 Hello!

9
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,080
 And welcome to another episode.

10
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,240
 A no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,280
 this week coming to you live from Melbourne!

12
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:31,520
 [cheering and applause]

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,920
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anacizanski,

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,760
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,840
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,080
 And in no particular order, here we go.

18
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,640
 Starting with you, James.

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,000
 OK, my fact this week is that the only known modern death

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,680
 due to meteorite was a cow who was hit in the neck

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,800
 in Venezuela in 1972.

22
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,960
 [audience laughing]

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,840
 We didn't know about it for a decade,

24
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,520
 because the farmer ate the cow, and used the meteorite

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,280
 as a doorstop.

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,320
 [audience laughing]

27
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,320
 It's amazing.

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,840
 Yeah, so this is a thing that happened in Venezuela,

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,960
 in a town that I don't know how to pronounce.

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,240
 It's T-R-U-J-I-L-L-O.

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,240
 Croyo.

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,680
 Was that a Zorro impression?

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,880
 Yeah, it was good.

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,080
 So there was a sonic boom one night,

35
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,720
 and then the next morning, they found the dead cow and the rock.

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,360
 They kind of thought nothing more about it,

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,520
 but then 10 years later, a doctor came along,

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,680
 and he checked out this rock and realized that it was a meteorite,

39
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,000
 and he said, this is definitely a meteorite that's killed the cow.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,760
 And that's the only one, there's a lot of kind of possible people

41
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,720
 who've been killed or things that have been killed by meteorites,

42
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,000
 but this is the only one with an actual certificate that says,

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,800
 that's what it is, really.

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,840
 And did he just look at his doorstop after all those years

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,640
 and go, well, that actually does look a bit like a meteorite?

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,040
 I mean, how does it transpire that someone suddenly decides

47
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,840
 to take their doorstop to a science museum?

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,200
 I think it was that the doctor was visiting them,

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,000
 rather than them taking just every single bit of rock in the house,

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,440
 rather than the museum.

51
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,600
 Is this what? No. Is this what? No.

52
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,480
 You got lucky in the end.

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,640
 But then some people are a little bit skeptical about it, actually,

54
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,320
 because what they realized is because this is now a famous meteorite

55
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,560
 because it killed a cow.

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,640
 It's now worth 10 times more than it was originally.

57
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,640
 So they're thinking maybe there's something going dodgy going on here.

58
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,960
 And then there's another twist.

59
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,280
 So around the same area, actually, in Chile and the Atacama,

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,720
 there was a large meteorite landed there.

61
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,040
 And the load of people collected it.

62
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,600
 And this was a really famous one.

63
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,480
 And it landed in a dry riverbed called Thakamwurta.

64
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,000
 How do you-- sorry, how do you pronounce that?

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Thakamwurta.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 [LAUGHTER]

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,560
 Sorry, yeah.

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,600
 [LAUGHTER]

69
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,080
 Whatever Andy just said means a dead cow in Spanish.

70
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,560
 And so the theory is that maybe these people

71
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,160
 heard about this famous one.

72
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,840
 And that, they went, that gives me an idea.

73
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,640
 I'm going to pretend my cow got hit by that.

74
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,120
 And then when anyone comes, I'll have the rock.

75
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,240
 But then I can say, oh, no, I ate the cow.

76
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,760
 Right.

77
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,280
 I'll check that.

78
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,440
 But don't they-- they do test these rocks, right?

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,280
 Oh, yeah, you can tell if a meteorite is a meteorite.

80
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,400
 So they test his rock.

81
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,600
 I mean, presumably, they did.

82
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,760
 Yeah, so the meteorite is definitely a meteorite.

83
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,280
 Yeah, OK.

84
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,480
 But the question is, did it kill the cow or not?

85
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,280
 Oh, that's what some people are skeptical about.

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,360
 Right, OK, I see.

87
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,160
 Have you guys heard of the Nakala meteorite

88
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,920
 which fell on Egypt in 1911?

89
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
 Nope.

90
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,920
 The story is that it vaporized a dog.

91
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,600
 Oh, yes.

92
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,640
 But that is very much the story of it, as in there's no evidence.

93
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,360
 Because obviously the dog was vaporized.

94
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,920
 Just what makes people think it's not quite true.

95
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,680
 Yeah.

96
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,840
 I read a really cool story that people

97
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,760
 used to think that Venus fly traps were aliens traveling

98
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,640
 on meteorites that landed on Earth.

99
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
 Because back in the day, Venus, what are you on about?

100
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,080
 No, this is--

101
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,640
 I read this on the BBC's website.

102
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,160
 Back in the day, Venus fly traps would be very unpredictable

103
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,280
 and where they came up.

104
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,000
 And they would go to places where they would think

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,160
 a meteorite had landed.

106
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,000
 And very often, they would see out of place Venus fly traps.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,160
 And it looks like an alien.

108
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,440
 And so they thought it's an alien.

109
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,200
 It only looks like an alien because we've

110
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,680
 designed alien things after it, like movies and stuff like that.

111
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
 Yeah.

112
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,160
 Actually, our aliens look like Venus fly traps.

113
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,640
 You're right.

114
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,720
 Is that way around, isn't it?

115
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,520
 Yeah.

116
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,040
 But they did.

117
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,520
 People used to attribute--

118
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,200
 sorry, Dan.

119
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,200
 But we're fine with vaporizing dog story over here.

120
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,640
 Yeah, that was a very sad story.

121
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,160
 Poor dog.

122
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,520
 They-- people would make money out of meteorites.

123
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,560
 And like so, like you were saying, people would pay

124
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,320
 to come and see various cows.

125
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,200
 And like, anything that's sort of been touched by a meteorite

126
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
 or experienced a meteorite can then be sold.

127
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,160
 So there was one that smashed through a car in New York

128
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,200
 in 1992, smashed through the boot of the car, the trunk of the car.

129
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,160
 And the owner of the car had just bought it for $400.

130
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,000
 And she was able to sell it for 25 times that amount straight

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,680
 afterwards.

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,480
 And she was also able to sell the original title to the car

133
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,480
 from when she bought it, and a bulb from the rear tail light

134
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,080
 that had been blasted out by the meteorite.

135
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
 Wow.

136
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,440
 It was worth it.

137
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,720
 I emailed the Secretary of the American Meteorological

138
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
 Society.

139
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,480
 This is a people who look after meteorites.

140
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,160
 And ask them what to do if I find the meteorite.

141
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,960
 And they said the protocol for collecting meteorites,

142
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,800
 ideally a fresh meteorite should be collected

143
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,000
 immediately without touching it and placed

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,360
 in a plastic sealed bag.

145
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,600
 How do you do that without touching it?

146
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,240
 It's the same procedure as for a dog poo.

147
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,760
 Yeah.

148
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,800
 Imagine.

149
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,400
 And then you--

150
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,200
 And if the dog hang it up on a tree and wait

151
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
 for the authorities to come in.

152
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
 And you don't have the dog anymore,

153
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
 because it's been vaporized.

154
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,200
 Do you guys know there are about 20 full-time meteorite

155
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,200
 hunters in the world, very rare career to have.

156
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,440
 And I think it was National Geographic.

157
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,560
 They interviewed one of them.

158
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,840
 He was a guy called Michael Farmer.

159
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,240
 He has been imprisoned for months in Oman,

160
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,400
 because he went there.

161
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,480
 He knew a meteorite had landed.

162
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,240
 He went to try and find it.

163
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,640
 And they locked him up saying, you're not

164
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,480
 allowed to take rocks out of Oman.

165
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,520
 But he's been nearly killed.

166
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,040
 But the one thing he said in this interview, which

167
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,320
 I really liked was he said, I've eaten a small piece

168
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,960
 of every moon rock and mars rock that I have purchased or found.

169
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,960
 Not many people can say they have eaten a piece of the moon.

170
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,880
 And then he said, and I know for a fact

171
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,040
 that numerous scientists have done the same.

172
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,560
 Do you think they're checking to see if it tastes of cheese?

173
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:56,440
 But I think you would do that when you give it a lick, at least.

174
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,800
 Yes, I would want to see what it tasted like.

175
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
 But I wouldn't eat a small bit of the moon.

176
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,640
 It feels somehow disrespectful.

177
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,720
 To whom?

178
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,880
 The goddess Salini.

179
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,640
 Oh, but yeah.

180
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,760
 Actually, that's what you do, isn't it, with fossils and stuff, isn't it?

181
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,920
 If you're not sure-- if you've got fossilized dinosaur poo, for instance,

182
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,160
 you can lick it, and it'll be slightly tacky to your tongue.

183
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,760
 Really?

184
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,800
 Come on.

185
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,520
 It's a long time since he's been in a dinosaur, OK?

186
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,360
 If you find a plastic bag hanging up on a tree,

187
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,320
 and you're not sure if it's a meteorite, do not do that.

188
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,400
 Well, that's like a farmer's eat their soil, don't they?

189
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,240
 Sometimes, some farmers test their-- taste their soil to see if it's fertile.

190
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,440
 And then the other way is by sitting down with your bare bottom on the soil.

191
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,280
 Yes.

192
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,080
 What's that for?

193
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,680
 If it's just for show.

194
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,640
 It's like to check if it's warm enough.

195
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,160
 Yeah.

196
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,400
 So the soil's warm enough if you drop your trousers, sit on it, and it's just not sort of sore.

197
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,680
 Does anyone do that?

198
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,200
 No.

199
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,600
 So it's not a common practice these days, but--

200
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,240
 Although I keep her a pair of underpants buried in my back garden.

201
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,960
 We all do that.

202
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
 Why did you do that?

203
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,320
 This was official advice from someone or other.

204
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,080
 Not to me.

205
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,600
 Life took farmers.

206
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,920
 And the idea is you put your underpants in your back garden,

207
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,120
 and then you go back a few months later, and you check if they've been eaten away

208
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,000
 by all the microbes and stuff.

209
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,360
 And you'll always know because the microbes can't eat the elastic band

210
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,080
 around the side of it, but they can eat the cotton.

211
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,840
 And the purpose to see how--

212
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,120
 I mean, no, like if the bacteria have eaten them, then what?

213
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,080
 Then you've got good soil, and you can plant stuff.

214
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,480
 And if they haven't, then you have to put some fertilizer in.

215
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
 Also, you've got a free thong at that point.

216
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:53,760
 So I was reading-- you know, in movies, how there's always a sci-fi movie

217
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,240
 that will start in Antarctica, and a meteorite has landed.

218
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,840
 And Antarctica always seems to be associated

219
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,240
 with finding big meteorites.

220
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,680
 And I thought I was like, is that because of the poles

221
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,440
 and it attracts as the meteorites coming in?

222
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,360
 And then I read this article.

223
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,320
 It turns out the reason they go there

224
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,560
 is because they're much easier to find because everything's white.

225
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,920
 So they just stick out.

226
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,720
 Is that amazing?

227
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,240
 I thought there was some deep, amazing alien life kind of thing.

228
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,720
 No, it's just like, oh, there it is.

229
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,760
 It's so much easier.

230
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,440
 So much more simple than trekking through a forest full of rocks.

231
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,200
 That's true.

232
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,480
 Also, not many humans there and other people to disturb it, right?

233
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,280
 Yeah.

234
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,320
 Because they're black, aren't they, meteorites?

235
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,840
 That's the sort of lessons on how to spot them.

236
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,600
 And so another place where it's really common for meteorites

237
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,960
 to be found is Morocco.

238
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,440
 So for a country of its size, it's

239
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,720
 got like by multiple factors of 10 more meteorite findings

240
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,840
 than any other country of its size in the world.

241
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,480
 And this is just because this guy in 2006

242
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,400
 decided to start teaching people how to spot a meteorite.

243
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,680
 And it's become a proper career for a lot

244
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,120
 of the nomadic people in Morocco.

245
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,960
 They go around finding meteorites.

246
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,840
 So a lot of them make money out of this.

247
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,680
 And it's actually where the most important meteorite

248
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,680
 probably ever found was found.

249
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,080
 It was one that came from Mars.

250
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,560
 It was in 2011.

251
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,240
 And it's like this whole jumble of rocks

252
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,080
 that were thrown together.

253
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,920
 And also, it's kind of full of old Mars water.

254
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,360
 So it's the first kind of evidence that we have of that.

255
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,440
 But the cool story about this is that it

256
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,680
 was found by this guy who'd had lessons

257
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
 that they have in Morocco on how to spot a meteorite.

258
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,720
 And he saw it.

259
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,520
 I think it was on sale in a market.

260
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,520
 It's called the Black Beauty Stone now.

261
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,920
 But it was on sale in a market.

262
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,520
 And he looked at it.

263
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,760
 He was tempted.

264
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,600
 And then he said, no, no, I'm not going to buy it.

265
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,560
 He drove away.

266
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,600
 He changed his mind.

267
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,720
 He drove back.

268
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,000
 And then he bought it.

269
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,120
 And he was driving.

270
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,720
 He was on his way back from the hospital

271
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,160
 from having a gall stone removed.

272
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,000
 So he had one stone removed.

273
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,320
 And then he immediately got another stone.

274
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,720
 Yeah.

275
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,120
 You're saying this in the way that Dan says things sometimes.

276
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,160
 I thought it sounded like that.

277
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,240
 Is that what I sound like?

278
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,520
 I am so sorry.

279
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,800
 Hey, we need to move on shortly.

280
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,440
 You guys got anything before we do?

281
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,200
 Can I give you a list of other things

282
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,240
 that have been used as door stops over the years?

283
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,080
 Yeah, sure.

284
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,720
 It is unbelievable how careless people are.

285
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,600
 So it's just like everything valuable you've ever heard of.

286
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,360
 In 2016, a Chinese vase being used as a door stop

287
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,560
 was suddenly sold for $860,000.

288
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,600
 In 2014, a Chinese pot sold for $150,000.

289
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,120
 A min vase in 2012 sold for a million.

290
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,200
 The world's largest sapphire in 1947 was found in Queensland.

291
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,240
 It been used as a door stop for nine years

292
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,320
 until the owner looked a bit closer.

293
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,280
 A Bronze Age dagger that was worth $50,000.

294
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,040
 In 1802, a lump of gold had been used as a door stop

295
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,920
 for three years until a jeweler who was visiting this house

296
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,720
 saw it.

297
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,240
 And it sparked America's very first gold rush

298
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,960
 so in North Carolina.

299
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,640
 And finally, a can of tinned veal that

300
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,640
 was left in the Arctic by William Perry, the explorer.

301
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,080
 In 1825, it was rediscovered by another explorer in 1829

302
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,760
 and used as a door stop for many, many years.

303
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,440
 And finally opened in 1958.

304
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,040
 Yeah, it got that reaction, I think,

305
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,280
 from the people who opened it as well.

306
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,480
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

307
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,880
 And that is my fact.

308
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,600
 My fact this week is that there is a unique species of ant

309
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,800
 that only lives in 10 blocks of New York City.

310
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,560
 They call it the Manhattan.

311
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,400
 This was sent in to me, actually, by a guy called Justin Hintz.

312
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,400
 And it was that this biologist discovered this species of ant,

313
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,440
 which lives between 63rd Street and 76th Street in New York,

314
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,680
 which is in Broadway in Broadway, Manhattan.

315
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,880
 And yeah, and they were looking at it.

316
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,680
 And they noticed that it was unlike any of the 13,000

317
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
 other species of ants that have ever been cataloged.

318
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,080
 They thought it might have come from Europe,

319
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,600
 but they can't trace it to any known ant.

320
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,440
 So that is, they've got this one city dwelling

321
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,080
 that has evolved to be its own species.

322
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
 And Manhattan.

323
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,880
 How do you look at an ant?

324
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,480
 And then immediately access your mental catalog

325
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,200
 of all the 13,000 other ants and just eliminate them all.

326
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,080
 Unless it has something extremely different.

327
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,760
 Like, it had an extra leg.

328
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,000
 It was driving one of the yellow cabs, that's what that wasn't so.

329
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,760
 Get out of here.

330
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,840
 So they eat so much junk food.

331
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,640
 And the scientists who were studying this

332
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,280
 said that the pavement ant eats so much,

333
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,320
 shifting their diets to more human foods

334
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,880
 that it's actually changing the chemical makeup

335
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,880
 of their bodies to look more like humans.

336
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,560
 Which, sadly, is not as exciting a sentence as I thought it was.

337
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,880
 I think they mean internally, as opposed to, like, got a face.

338
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,600
 I've also got faces, surely.

339
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,520
 Ah, but just imagine, like, my face on an ant.

340
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,680
 Yeah, so yeah, and they don't get diabetes, though.

341
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,680
 So that's a thing that separates the ants.

342
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,080
 So other ants get diabetes, do they?

343
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,880
 No.

344
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,880
 What?

345
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,480
 Sorry.

346
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,340
 I say--

347
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,360
 Compared to the humans who are reading all the fast food,

348
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,440
 I think it was your point, right?

349
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,040
 Yes, yeah.

350
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,280
 They're very good at digesting it.

351
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,320
 The fast food is actually sort of made for ants, it turns out.

352
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,000
 Exactly.

353
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,480
 Got it.

354
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,280
 Not for us.

355
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,520
 The coming human ants don't get diabetes

356
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,800
 so they can keep eating.

357
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,320
 The scientist who did that, he was called Clint Peneck.

358
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,480
 And he was talking about the study.

359
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,600
 He was interviewed about it.

360
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,600
 And he said, when he was doing the study, nobody ever talked to me.

361
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,000
 I basically was walking around and then

362
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,520
 crouching down on the ground and huffing something off the sidewalk

363
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,280
 through this ridiculous-looking device.

364
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,760
 And not a single New Yorker was like, hey, what are you doing?

365
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,320
 I guess I was not the weirdest person on the street.

366
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,200
 Now, that suggests to me that he was the weirdest person

367
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,760
 on the street.

368
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,640
 You don't tend to talk to the weirdest person on the street, mate.

369
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,200
 That's not what everyone does.

370
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,560
 So New York has a few other species, doesn't it?

371
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
 That's so unique to it.

372
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,200
 They have a unique centipede.

373
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,680
 They have a sweet bee.

374
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,640
 They have a white-footed mouse with small ears.

375
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,920
 They also found in New York in 2014 the first new amphibian

376
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,800
 that's been found in the state for 150 years.

377
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
 So a frog, a leopard frog.

378
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,720
 And so for more than a century, there's

379
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,040
 been two types of leopard frog living in New York

380
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,680
 and people have been arguing over it.

381
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,480
 Scientists have been arguing because there

382
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,800
 seemed to be so much variety in the different leopard frogs.

383
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,320
 There was this big debate that went on.

384
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,040
 And apparently, lots of discord and backlash

385
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,280
 from one scientist to another about theories

386
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,240
 as to how come there was so much variation

387
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,400
 with these two species.

388
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,040
 And a hermitologist in 1936 called Karl Kofield

389
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,120
 said, actually, I think there's two species,

390
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,560
 might be three species.

391
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,520
 And it caused such massive controversy.

392
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,760
 And there was this bickering and all this strife

393
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,320
 that people refused to accept in the scientific literature.

394
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,160
 His theory was absolutely rubbish.

395
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,520
 And that was 1936.

396
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,800
 And then in 2014, we went, oh, yeah, he was right.

397
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
 There was another one.

398
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,560
 So quite sweetly, it's called the Rana Calfeldi after him.

399
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,120
 But presumably, he's long dead.

400
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,000
 Long dead, yeah.

401
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,920
 But he's somewhere he's happy.

402
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,120
 [LAUGHTER]

403
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,640
 I think it's another New York discovered insect.

404
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,840
 So this was-- this is an insect that doesn't live in New York,

405
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,800
 but it was discovered by a New York scientist.

406
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,840
 And it is a new type of beetle.

407
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,160
 And they didn't know it existed.

408
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,800
 But they discovered it because it was attached to an ant.

409
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,600
 And what it does is this beetle, when it wants to get to places,

410
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,040
 it goes up to this ant.

411
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,880
 And it bites onto its anus.

412
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,160
 And it grips on and flips underneath.

413
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,080
 So the thorax-- it's in between the thorax and the admon--

414
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,520
 admon-- admon-- admon--

415
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
 admon-- admon--

416
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,040
 Sure.

417
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,600
 Oh, sorry.

418
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,320
 I'm going to add abdomen.

419
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
 [LAUGHTER]

420
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,840
 Thank you.

421
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,720
 [APPLAUSE]

422
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,080
 So they were studying this ant.

423
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,200
 And they were like, it's got two opposed.

424
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,360
 And they shook it, and the beetle fell off.

425
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,280
 And that's what it did.

426
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,960
 This is beetle has a unique way of transporting itself

427
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,040
 by biting the bum of the ant and getting--

428
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,040
 So does the ant just think it's got two buns?

429
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,080
 The ant doesn't seem to have an issue with it.

430
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,520
 Yeah, I don't know.

431
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,440
 So ants are pretty amazing.

432
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,560
 I really like this ant.

433
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,280
 I'd never heard of.

434
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,800
 It's called the Azteca Brevis ant.

435
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,000
 It's in Costa Rica.

436
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,640
 And it catches prey that's more than 50 times

437
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,280
 as heavy and as large as it is.

438
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,800
 And it does this by-- so they all work together,

439
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,360
 and they nest in a tree.

440
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,080
 But they build this network of tunnels

441
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,040
 within the tree with tiny little openings

442
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,080
 out through the tree bark that are just big enough

443
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,720
 to fit the little ant's heads.

444
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,440
 And so it looks a little bit like a holy cheese,

445
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,760
 like Swiss cheese or something.

446
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,800
 And their heads poke out.

447
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,920
 And then a big bit of prey will come along,

448
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,320
 like a termite or something.

449
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
 And we'll step on one of the holes.

450
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,240
 One of its legs will fall into the hole.

451
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,960
 And the ant will bite the leg with its teeth, so it's stuck.

452
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,800
 And then this thing kind of struggles to get away.

453
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
 And another leg falls into another hole.

454
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,760
 And another ant bites its other leg.

455
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,120
 And eventually, all its legs end up in the holes

456
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,280
 with ants' teeth biting into it.

457
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,800
 And then the other ants all emerge and tear it to pieces

458
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,000
 and have it for dinner.

459
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,200
 But it's sort of spread-eagled on this tree.

460
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,960
 Is there a happy ending at all to the story?

461
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,360
 If you're an ant--

462
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,040
 Oh, sure.

463
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,280
 It's a hell of a nice story.

464
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,960
 Yeah.

465
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,720
 That's really horrific.

466
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,840
 Just stuck there, sprawled out.

467
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,760
 It's not the scene in the zombie film where all the hands

468
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,040
 come through the wall.

469
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,800
 Yeah.

470
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,560
 I haven't seen that scene, but it sounds like it is like that.

471
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,560
 I found an ant called Cerecomerex amoeblis.

472
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,280
 And it's a pharma ant, so it farms a fungi.

473
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,360
 It literally makes little scrapings and grows fungi to eat.

474
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,920
 But there's another species, which is called megalomurmexematocus.

475
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,720
 And it comes into the first ant's colony.

476
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,280
 It doesn't do any work.

477
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,320
 It lives in the colony.

478
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,360
 It eats the fungus.

479
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,440
 The first ant has made.

480
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,240
 And it also eats the babies that the host is rearing.

481
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,560
 And the hosts do nothing about it.

482
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,320
 They don't take any defensive action.

483
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,360
 That is not much of a house guest, isn't it?

484
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,520
 And he stole their precious doorstop and fucked up.

485
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,920
 Yeah, there was nothing in the fridge.

486
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,680
 I hope you don't mind.

487
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:18,040
 So I ate the baby, but there's a reason that it's tolerated.

488
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,320
 And the reason is that second ant contains a venom

489
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,480
 in its body, which helps to repel an even worse invader ant.

490
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,240
 What is that guy doing now?

491
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,960
 What is worse than eating the babies?

492
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,080
 I think maybe those guys just completely destroy that.

493
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,560
 I don't know.

494
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,760
 They might destroy the nest or something.

495
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,160
 But yeah, so they have to put up with these really difficult guests

496
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,440
 because they know that it's protecting them against something worse.

497
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,160
 I was reading an article in Cosmos Magazine about ants.

498
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,480
 And I'll just read the start of that in a behavior

499
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,720
 that finds a broad comparison with human tradition,

500
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,880
 a genus known as turtle ants pass on possessions

501
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,120
 from older individuals directly to younger ones.

502
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,320
 In a mechanism that does not, however, find a human analog,

503
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,320
 they do so through their anuses.

504
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,280
 Wait, wait, wait.

505
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,960
 What about that scene in pulp fiction

506
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,760
 with the guy who puts the watch up his anus?

507
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,400
 I haven't seen that film, but--

508
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,880
 Well, someone must know what I'm talking about.

509
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,080
 There was definitely one guy up there who got it immediately.

510
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,840
 Exactly.

511
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,000
 Christopher walking, but the watch up his anus then gives it to his son.

512
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,840
 So actually, there isn't analog in humans.

513
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,960
 I don't know.

514
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,240
 So these turtle ants, basically, it's like a fecal transplant

515
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,840
 that the adults give to the babies.

516
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,320
 And basically, if you don't get that fecal transplant

517
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,360
 from your parents, then you would starve

518
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,440
 because you wouldn't have the right bacteria in your stomach.

519
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,120
 So they do need it.

520
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
 Oh, wow.

521
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,240
 Because there's a story with a happy ending.

522
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,240
 But a gross middle.

523
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,280
 There was going to be a really exciting game.

524
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,000
 There was a kick-started game that reached funding.

525
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,520
 And it was called Ant Simulator.

526
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,320
 And it sounded really cool.

527
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 So basically, you would manage an ant colony.

528
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,880
 Like, you would be the main ant.

529
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,080
 And you would be like, get over that.

530
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,120
 This is one of these new york ants, is that?

531
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,800
 Yeah.

532
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,960
 And so it looked really amazing.

533
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,520
 And it had, I think, three people who

534
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,120
 were like the main people behind it.

535
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,720
 And unfortunately, it's not happening.

536
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,040
 And the reason is because of--

537
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,760
 and they captured it, I think, perfectly in the headline--

538
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,720
 Ant Simulator canceled after team spends the money

539
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,080
 on booze and strippers.

540
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,640
 [LAUGHTER]

541
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,880
 Two of them went off, had a massive night.

542
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,560
 And this guy had to make a video going,

543
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,240
 I'm so sorry.

544
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,280
 Ant Simulator can't happen anymore.

545
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,240
 And we can't give you back your money, either.

546
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,240
 But as typical entomologist behavior, they're always

547
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,480
 doing that kind of thing.

548
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,760
 Can't be trusted.

549
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,640
 We're going to have to move on soon to our next fact.

550
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,600
 They fake injury ants to get sympathy.

551
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
 So they carry their injured home.

552
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,840
 And ants have figured this out.

553
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,520
 This is the Ronaldo ant, doesn't it?

554
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,280
 I've seen this.

555
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,560
 It's amazing.

556
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,400
 Oh, my god.

557
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,760
 It just grazes the leaf.

558
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,600
 And it goes, oh!

559
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,320
 I am so impressed that you knew the name of any figure.

560
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,800
 [LAUGHTER]

561
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,680
 So the Ronaldo ant, if they're injured,

562
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,080
 they carry each other home.

563
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,520
 And so some ants really overemphasize injuries.

564
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,720
 So it was found ants have been witnessed moving really,

565
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,040
 really slowly or limping or falling over.

566
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,000
 I don't know how an ant falls over, but they do.

567
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,200
 In the hope of being carried.

568
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,160
 But then if no one helps, they look around

569
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,240
 and then they get back up and they walk on like this happens.

570
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
 [LAUGHTER]

571
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,800
 OK, let's move on.

572
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,760
 It is time for fact number three.

573
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,920
 And that is Chazinski.

574
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,000
 In my fact this week is that the slinky business almost

575
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,840
 went bankrupt because the slinky's inventor kept giving

576
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,600
 the proceeds the way to religious cults.

577
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
 [LAUGHTER]

578
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,040
 It's amazing.

579
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,680
 Yeah, so this is it.

580
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,480
 The slinky was invented by a guy called Richard James,

581
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,360
 who was an engineer.

582
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,320
 He was invented in 1943.

583
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,640
 He worked on a Navy shipyard.

584
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,800
 And he was working on a bit of equipment

585
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,000
 and noticed some springs acting oddly walking.

586
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,680
 And so he said to his wife, I think I can make a toy out of this.

587
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,840
 And it was huge and it sold out and he got very rich.

588
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,880
 And then he turned to a religion Christianity

589
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,920
 to be specific.

590
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,480
 And he started giving away all this money.

591
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,600
 And his wife was like, oh my god, we were almost broke.

592
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,440
 We were almost completely out of money

593
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,880
 because he just gave it all away to various cults.

594
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,880
 And then he ran away to Bolivia to join one of them in 1960

595
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,800
 and did not speak to or see his family again, all the slinky.

596
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,440
 He did occasionally write letters to his wife, Betty,

597
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,720
 urging her to repent.

598
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
 So that is something--

599
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,560
 [LAUGHTER]

600
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,240
 Yeah.

601
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,720
 So the invention was an amazing invention.

602
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,320
 And it caught on quite quickly with an initial batch.

603
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,400
 He sold something like 490 minutes once.

604
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,520
 All they had to do was bring it to the front of the store

605
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,960
 and just show people that going down a couple of steps.

606
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,120
 And it just-- everyone was like, God, I have it.

607
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,880
 And then there was a few years where it just--

608
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,640
 he needed to get it manufactured.

609
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,760
 And people wouldn't buy into it.

610
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,600
 But he not only invented the slinky,

611
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,760
 he invented the machine that makes the slinky

612
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,560
 in a quick, sort of like mass product way.

613
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,240
 So a slinky-- and I don't know if it's still to this day

614
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,040
 the same length, but the original slink is that he made--

615
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,000
 if it was the coil was laid out just straight as a coil,

616
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,320
 it's 80 feet long, each slinky.

617
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,760
 He created a machine that coiled it up in 10 seconds,

618
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,040
 and then it was good to go.

619
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,880
 So he has a patent for an invention,

620
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,280
 as well as the toy invention.

621
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,080
 That's cool.

622
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,160
 The patent for the original slinky

623
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,920
 said that it could be used as both a child's amusement

624
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,880
 and for parlor games.

625
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,400
 OK, so I couldn't work out what parlor games there might be.

626
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,120
 But I went on to the internet, and apparently there

627
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,720
 was once a game that was sold called Slinkum.

628
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,360
 And it was like a little ramp.

629
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,560
 And it had boxes at the bottom, like squares.

630
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,160
 And you would put your slinky down the ramp,

631
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,680
 and whichever square it stopped in,

632
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,520
 that's a number of points you got.

633
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,960
 And obviously, they weren't that confident about how good a game

634
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,880
 it was, because the rules offers a bounty

635
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,600
 of $25, but anyone offering a suggestion

636
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,000
 of an improvement of the game.

637
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,080
 [LAUGHTER]

638
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,320
 That is amazing.

639
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,200
 So good.

640
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,520
 Do you know what the quality controllers in the slinky factory?

641
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,160
 It's--

642
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,680
 No.

643
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,560
 They test whether or not they can walk into their own box.

644
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,520
 Wow.

645
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,560
 If they can do that, then there are high quality slinky.

646
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,120
 Down some stairs, right?

647
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,920
 I think they put them down--

648
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,640
 I think they put the boxes at the bottom of stairs,

649
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,160
 and their final challenge.

650
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,160
 That is amazing.

651
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,680
 It won't walk in.

652
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
 If it's too tight or too loose, it won't walk in.

653
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,520
 What's another weird thing is that--

654
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,840
 so he invented this while he was working for the war effort.

655
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,280
 And it was the side project, as Anna was saying,

656
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,600
 found a toy when it fell off the thing.

657
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,160
 Yeah, so what he was doing, just not on that,

658
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,360
 is there was like a meter, which would tell you

659
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,760
 the horsepower of the ship that he was on.

660
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,800
 And he needed a dampening system to stop it

661
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,040
 from bouncing around everywhere.

662
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,800
 So he was using springs to do that.

663
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,800
 Then this spring happens to be great at doing different things.

664
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,560
 Yeah, so he saw that, and he made it as a toy.

665
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,000
 No intention for use of war.

666
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,040
 Then years later, the Vietnam War happened,

667
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,240
 and slinkies were actually used in the war,

668
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,600
 because what they were fantastic at doing was,

669
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,240
 if you were stuck in the middle of nowhere,

670
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,200
 you would throw a slinky up into a tree,

671
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,760
 and it could act as a sort of antenna for radio signals

672
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,400
 that you needed to be sending.

673
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
 No way.

674
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,320
 It ended up becoming an actual use for war.

675
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,760
 No way, that's so cool.

676
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
 Way.

677
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,040
 Wow.

678
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
 Here's a use for a slinky.

679
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,560
 You can use it to get rid of squirrels.

680
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:48,680
 You put a squirrel on one, and then send it down the stairs,

681
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,440
 and no, you don't do that.

682
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,240
 And then it goes into its box, and you slam the lid shut.

683
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,800
 Now, what you do is you put it on your bird feeder,

684
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,040
 and then when the squirrel comes along,

685
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,920
 he kind of grabs onto the slinky,

686
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,720
 and the weight pulls the slinky down,

687
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,440
 and he's kind of pulled down in a little elevator ride.

688
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,200
 There are videos online, aren't there?

689
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,520
 They are unbelievable.

690
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,000
 How's the fun?

691
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,520
 So when you drop a slinky, the bottom doesn't know

692
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,280
 that you let go of the top, at first.

693
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,480
 This is true.

694
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
 Yeah, this is true.

695
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,560
 I don't think it even knows it's a slinky, I mean.

696
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,440
 So this is my damn fact of the show.

697
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,320
 And I'm playing it now.

698
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,440
 Check it out, go home.

699
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,200
 Go to the slinky cupboard, and check it out.

700
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,280
 So it looks like it's floating.

701
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,360
 The bottom looks like it's floating, because it's a tension spring.

702
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,560
 And when you let go--

703
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,560
 You're holding the slinky not scrunched up, right?

704
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,600
 So you're holding the very tip of it.

705
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,360
 So it's really dangling down a long way.

706
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
 Is that what you think?

707
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,640
 Your squirrels just come off the bottom.

708
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,680
 Exactly.

709
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,920
 It's loose at the bottom.

710
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,480
 And when you let go of the, as you say, the top bands,

711
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,360
 it takes time for the motion to tell the bottom of the slinky

712
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,320
 that the top and the tension have been released.

713
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,600
 And I read that--

714
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,120
 You're not a physicist, are you Andy?

715
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,600
 Not-- well, not by trade.

716
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,400
 But I read-- I couldn't quite believe this.

717
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,800
 I read that this happens even to solid objects.

718
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,560
 So if you drop a steel rod, the top starts accelerating

719
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,200
 before the bottom does.

720
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,600
 OK, because the vibrations need to travel down, don't they?

721
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,480
 It's not that.

722
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,000
 It's basically the tension is pulling up

723
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,640
 at the same rate as the gravity is pushing down.

724
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,520
 Yeah, so the tension, once you've released it with your hand,

725
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,720
 it needs to travel down the slinky before the slinky

726
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,720
 knows of the bottom.

727
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,160
 Oh, that tension's been released now.

728
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,040
 And it is amazing.

729
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,640
 You should watch it on YouTube.

730
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,240
 The slinky, it just levitates.

731
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,520
 The bottom just levitates.

732
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,240
 There's a very good video on the Veritasium YouTube channel.

733
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,680
 Wow, is that-- do you make that channel?

734
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,760
 And yeah, it's incredible.

735
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,240
 It's magic.

736
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,760
 It's magic.

737
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,520
 You just ruined all the science of it.

738
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,840
 I think we should say about the slinky,

739
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,360
 but the hero behind it wasn't the guy who made it

740
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
 and then turned to a Bolivian cult.

741
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,400
 It was his wife, Bessie, who was the person who saved it.

742
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,160
 So she became determined to make it work.

743
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,360
 And she made this 450 mile weekly round trip to the factory

744
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,200
 and pumped all their remaining money into it.

745
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,600
 She gammled their entire mortgage on a toy show in 1963

746
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,160
 in New York, hoping that people would go for it.

747
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,760
 She launched the advertising campaign.

748
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,920
 She gave it a jingle.

749
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,080
 And she suddenly built from her ruined marriage

750
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,200
 this great little toy.

751
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,280
 And I think she might have been her idea to do the dog

752
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,960
 or the dog really gave it a boost in a train as well.

753
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,800
 So the dog is pictured toy story in your head

754
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,240
 and the slinky dog.

755
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,320
 That's literally it.

756
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,680
 And when the movie came out, they weren't prepared for the fact

757
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,040
 that it was going to be massively popular.

758
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,440
 So they didn't have the quantities that they need for merchandise

759
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,240
 to come out at a point, which seems impossible as a thought,

760
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
 doesn't it?

761
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,360
 Well, they did a range of things, which were all slinkies

762
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,120
 in the middle and then other things at the front of the back.

763
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,680
 So they did the dog, they did the train.

764
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,600
 There was also a caterpillar, a hippo, a fire engine,

765
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,680
 a worm, and several more.

766
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,840
 But they all had the same thing.

767
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,880
 You can buy at the moment.

768
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,640
 You can buy sound effects slinky for $12.99.

769
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,320
 And as it goes down, it makes a sound splat,

770
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,240
 boing, and thwap.

771
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,960
 But I kind of think the sound is quite nice.

772
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,800
 Anyway, isn't it what a slinky makes?

773
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:34,680
 You could also, for $153.99 by a 14-karat gold-plated slinky,

774
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,400
 just to keep your dog open.

775
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:43,640
 Oh, we're going to have to move on soon to our next fact.

776
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,080
 Oh, I was just looking at some other toys.

777
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,680
 I'll bring them. Mr. Potato Head, the original Mr. Potato Head,

778
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,760
 did not come with the potato head.

779
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,520
 It was just the bits on his face.

780
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,080
 So you ordered a Mr. Potato Head, or you went and bought one.

781
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,200
 And it was just bits of moustache.

782
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,520
 In fact, I think the original one came with hands, feet, ears,

783
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,040
 two mouths, two pesovies, four noses, three hats, eye glasses,

784
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,920
 and a pipe.

785
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,880
 But, and some felt for the moustache.

786
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,600
 But the idea was you should use one of your own potatoes.

787
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,640
 So you should put it in a real potato.

788
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,440
 I think I actually remember having one of those with an actual potato.

789
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,280
 I believe so.

790
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,480
 Unless you're going to tell me it was in the 1920s or something.

791
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,080
 I think you might be lying about how old you are, James,

792
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,040
 because now I haven't written on the date here.

793
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,200
 But I think it was in the early 70s when they decided that--

794
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,800
 I was alive in the late 70s, so maybe.

795
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,680
 Yeah.

796
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,480
 Do you remember?

797
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,600
 They decided that the pins needed to jab into a potato

798
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,000
 were too sharp and contravened health and safety.

799
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,240
 And so you could no longer stick it into a real potato,

800
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,360
 so they had to come with a plastic potato.

801
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,160
 Oh, really?

802
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,680
 Yeah.

803
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,000
 Do you know who invented paint by Numbers?

804
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,560
 No, I love that, though.

805
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,400
 Yeah, it was Michelangelo.

806
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,280
 Not the turtle, damn, not the turtle.

807
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:02,800
 He's a party, dude, you know?

808
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,120
 He used to assign sections of his ceilings for his students to paint.

809
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,680
 And the way that he would do it is he put Numbers there so they knew what to paint.

810
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:15,720
 But the modern ones started in 1952, and Macy started selling this.

811
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,320
 And a few months later, it became massive,

812
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,280
 because an amateur painter won third prize

813
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,880
 at a San Francisco art competition by doing just the paint by Numbers.

814
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,560
 Wow.

815
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,400
 And the press coverage just said that no one could tell the difference

816
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,720
 between real painting and this.

817
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,320
 And then it became absolutely huge.

818
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:31,920
 Wow.

819
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,280
 Oh, my God.

820
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,280
 That's so-- I can't believe Michelangelo did that.

821
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,720
 That's really funny.

822
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,600
 He ruined his own profession in a way,

823
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,000
 because once you're painting by Numbers, anyone can do it.

824
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,760
 And that's where there are no artists around today,

825
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,840
 is because we're all just doing paint by Numbers.

826
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,920
 [LAUGHTER]

827
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,280
 OK, should we move on to our final fact of the show?

828
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,920
 It's time for our final fact of the show.

829
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,360
 And that is Andy.

830
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,320
 My fact is that when zebras are running away from a lion,

831
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,760
 they fart loudly with every stride.

832
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
 [LAUGHTER]

833
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,800
 And who's to say, Andy, that you wouldn't do exactly the same thing

834
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,040
 as your situation?

835
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,320
 Sure I would.

836
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,960
 Fair play.

837
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,640
 But they're quite gassy animals.

838
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,920
 And the motion propels the gases out of their bodies

839
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,760
 when they start running.

840
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,960
 Does he push them forward quicker?

841
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,880
 I think he does, yes.

842
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,520
 And you can hear them from quite a long way away.

843
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,080
 So there's a new book out, and it's called Does It Fart?

844
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,920
 And it's by Nick Caruso and Danny Rabbiotti.

845
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,760
 And it's an absolutely fantastic book.

846
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,960
 So they're scientists, and they started collecting animals

847
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,160
 and writing little essays about whether or not

848
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,360
 those animals fart.

849
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,160
 And it was a spreadsheet that turned into a book,

850
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,760
 which is my favorite kind of book.

851
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,280
 [LAUGHTER]

852
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,760
 And they just got information about all kinds of things.

853
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,080
 So there are termites in there.

854
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,960
 There are dinosaurs.

855
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,920
 Dinosaurs, the ruling is not anymore.

856
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,560
 [LAUGHTER]

857
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,840
 There's a thing about termites.

858
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,600
 The amazing thing about termites-- termites each produce

859
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,440
 1/2 of 1 millionth gram of methane per day.

860
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,560
 So not very much.

861
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,200
 However, unfortunately, there are so many termites

862
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,440
 that they produce-- now, this is a wide range, so steady on.

863
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,480
 But they produce between 5% and 19% of methane emissions

864
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,440
 globally.

865
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,280
 Between what and what?

866
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,000
 5% and 19%.

867
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,040
 That's a lot, guys.

868
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
 [LAUGHTER]

869
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,720
 Kill them.

870
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,680
 This is why the answer finds a kill them.

871
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,320
 That's your answer to every problem, don't you?

872
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,120
 Well, I've got a very hawkish approach to termites.

873
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,080
 Yeah, it does sound like an incredible book.

874
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,880
 So a couple of other things is, sloths don't fart.

875
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,640
 The most animals do fart.

876
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,720
 Sloths don't fart because their digestion is so

877
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,600
 slow, like all the rest of them.

878
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,240
 They would take them so long to work through the farting

879
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,520
 process that the gases would build up inside them

880
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,840
 and become poisonous.

881
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,960
 And so instead, they are reabsorbed through their intestines

882
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,160
 into their bloodstreams.

883
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,400
 And then those gases are taken up to their lungs,

884
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,280
 and they breathe them out instead.

885
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,560
 I desperately want to know what a slow spread smells like.

886
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,200
 Ah, yeah.

887
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,400
 The early morning used to be called sparrow fart,

888
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,000
 which was just the time of day, you know, sparrow fart.

889
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,800
 It's so early that the sparrows are farting,

890
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,080
 I suppose.

891
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,280
 But think about that.

892
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,720
 Sparrows don't fart.

893
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,400
 Do they not?

894
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:27,920
 Nope.

895
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,080
 Is that true of all birds?

896
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,560
 All birds don't fart, or no birds fart.

897
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,680
 [LAUGHTER]

898
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,320
 Why do they not fart?

899
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,320
 They've got very short intestines,

900
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,800
 and they poo very frequently.

901
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,920
 And the main reason is that they-- so the reason you fart

902
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,600
 is that you have a buildup of gas, which

903
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,760
 is due to gas forming bacteria in your gut.

904
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,080
 I think we may have mentioned that before.

905
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,640
 So humans and mammals do have those bacteria and birds don't.

906
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,840
 So that's the reason they don't.

907
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,080
 OK.

908
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,040
 I was checking if humans might fart if they're

909
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,760
 being chased by stuff.

910
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,480
 And James has been to the zoo today.

911
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,960
 [LAUGHTER]

912
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,960
 And I went on to runnersworld.com.

913
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,400
 And apparently, this is a problem that lots of runners

914
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,200
 have that are farting a lot while they're running, right?

915
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,680
 And they say that the reason is all that--

916
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,840
 People have told me.

917
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,480
 People have told me that, too, sorry.

918
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,000
 I felt as I was agreeing with that that it was too enthusiastic.

919
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,120
 So anyway, apparently, what it is, is it's all the heavy breathing.

920
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,520
 So you're taking in a lot of gas, and it has to go somewhere.

921
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,720
 And that's what happens.

922
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,320
 Really, yeah, apparently.

923
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,680
 And you need to poo as well.

924
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,400
 Run as diarrhea is a serious problem on running forums.

925
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:42,900
 Hey.

926
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,400
 Hey.

927
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,040
 [LAUGHTER]

928
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,240
 Is anyone else feeling like they're at a help group?

929
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,760
 Sorry.

930
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,920
 Sorry, I forgot everyone was here.

931
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,880
 OK, I do have a question.

932
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,440
 And I'm not a physicist, but I do have this question.

933
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,120
 If you're running, and you break wind--

934
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,720
 Yeah.

935
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,080
-- let's say you're running at 12 miles an hour,

936
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,360
 and you break wind at 4 miles an hour out the other way.

937
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,320
 I presume that the wind that you break is still traveling

938
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,560
 at 8 miles an hour in your wake.

939
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,760
 OK, I've got a lot to tell you about relativity.

940
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,800
 That's correct.

941
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,880
 We'll do it after the show.

942
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
 OK.

943
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,040
 I think that works.

944
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,560
 Yeah.

945
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,840
 [LAUGHTER]

946
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,480
 One of the good farting animal is the pupfish.

947
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,600
 So I think this isn't the book as well, but it eats algae.

948
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,680
 But it has-- the algae has such high levels of gas in it

949
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,480
 that the pupfish's stomach inflates, fully inflates,

950
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,320
 and it floats to the top of the water.

951
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,840
 And that's a really, really bad place for it to be,

952
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,760
 because it exposes it to lots of predators.

953
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,720
 So the moment the pupfish has a meal of algae,

954
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,800
 it has to fart to save its own life.

955
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,080
 Wow.

956
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,800
 And so--

957
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,320
 Wow.

958
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,000
 The pup's straight up to the top and is desperately trying to expel

959
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,800
 wind constantly to sink back down again.

960
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,560
 It's extremely stressful.

961
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,080
 That's amazing.

962
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,760
 It's a raise to the bottom for them.

963
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,040
 [LAUGHTER]

964
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,720
 Now, maybe some stuff on zebras.

965
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
 Yeah.

966
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,080
 Here's an amazing thing about zebras.

967
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,480
 When they're being chased by a lion,

968
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,240
 not only do they do what you said,

969
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,560
 but they only run about half the top speed

970
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,160
 when they're being chased by a lion.

971
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,920
 What?

972
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,440
 So basically, what happens is, if you're going at your top speed

973
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,520
 and you're running, it's really easy for the lion

974
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,680
 or whatever to tell where you're going to be in two strides time.

975
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,120
 So what they do is they go at half of their speed,

976
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,720
 and then when the lion gets anywhere near them,

977
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,400
 they just go in a different direction.

978
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,720
 And then they go really fast.

979
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,040
 And then they'll slow down to half their speed again,

980
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,600
 and then wait till the lion gets to them

981
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,320
 and then speed off really quickly again.

982
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:39,840
 Oh, wow.

983
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,720
 That's smart, isn't it?

984
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,400
 That's very, very good.

985
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,920
 Very clever.

986
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,160
 Did you read about this ridiculous story in 2001

987
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,760
 where some farmers brought in the UK

988
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,000
 bought a Shetland Pony, a really small pony.

989
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 And then they were surprised when they woke up one morning

990
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,200
 and they went out into the field.

991
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,880
 And there was their Shetland Pony in there,

992
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,600
 but also a tiny, tiny zebra.

993
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,040
 And it was because they hadn't realized

994
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,440
 they'd bought a pregnant Shetland Pony,

995
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,920
 and they bought it from a wildlife sanctuary

996
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,800
 where it was sharing a field with a zebra.

997
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
 What?

998
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,600
 Wow.

999
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,360
 What?

1000
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,840
 The woman didn't say, we had thought that she was getting faster,

1001
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,320
 but it really was a bit of a shock when we got up one morning

1002
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,880
 and we saw that full zebra was there.

1003
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,000
 We realized then what had happened.

1004
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,120
 That's-- I have a related factor that, which is that--

1005
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,240
 I think it's in Georgia.

1006
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,360
 There are dogs who are supposed to be guarding sheep,

1007
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,760
 and they keep on having sex with the wolves.

1008
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,800
 They're meant to be defending the sheep from.

1009
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,280
 Well, I guess it would put the wolves off

1010
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,520
 what they were supposed to be doing.

1011
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,520
 That is true.

1012
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,680
 It was a action method, but they keep testing the dogs

1013
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,360
 as well, and finding out, oh, you're half wolf,

1014
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,080
 because your parents were a wolf and a dog.

1015
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,600
 This is amazing.

1016
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,000
 But in the line of duty, James Bond does it all the time.

1017
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 He does.

1018
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,480

1019
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:06,280
 OK, that is it.

1020
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,360
 That is all of our facts.
