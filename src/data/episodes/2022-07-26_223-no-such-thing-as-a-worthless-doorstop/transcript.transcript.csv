00:00:13,00:00:14,Hello!
00:00:14,00:00:17,And welcome to another episode.
00:00:17,00:00:20,"A no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:00:20,00:00:23,this week coming to you live from Melbourne!
00:00:23,00:00:31,[cheering and applause]
00:00:31,00:00:35,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anacizanski,"
00:00:35,00:00:38,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:38,00:00:41,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:41,00:00:44,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:44,00:00:48,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:48,00:00:50,"Starting with you, James."
00:00:50,00:00:54,"OK, my fact this week is that the only known modern death"
00:00:54,00:00:57,due to meteorite was a cow who was hit in the neck
00:00:57,00:00:59,in Venezuela in 1972.
00:00:59,00:01:02,[audience laughing]
00:01:02,00:01:04,"We didn't know about it for a decade,"
00:01:04,00:01:08,"because the farmer ate the cow, and used the meteorite"
00:01:08,00:01:09,as a doorstop.
00:01:09,00:01:12,[audience laughing]
00:01:12,00:01:14,It's amazing.
00:01:14,00:01:18,"Yeah, so this is a thing that happened in Venezuela,"
00:01:18,00:01:21,in a town that I don't know how to pronounce.
00:01:21,00:01:25,It's T-R-U-J-I-L-L-O.
00:01:25,00:01:27,Croyo.
00:01:27,00:01:28,Was that a Zorro impression?
00:01:28,00:01:30,"Yeah, it was good."
00:01:30,00:01:33,"So there was a sonic boom one night,"
00:01:33,00:01:36,"and then the next morning, they found the dead cow and the rock."
00:01:36,00:01:38,"They kind of thought nothing more about it,"
00:01:38,00:01:41,"but then 10 years later, a doctor came along,"
00:01:41,00:01:44,"and he checked out this rock and realized that it was a meteorite,"
00:01:44,00:01:48,"and he said, this is definitely a meteorite that's killed the cow."
00:01:48,00:01:50,"And that's the only one, there's a lot of kind of possible people"
00:01:50,00:01:52,"who've been killed or things that have been killed by meteorites,"
00:01:52,00:01:56,"but this is the only one with an actual certificate that says,"
00:01:56,00:01:57,"that's what it is, really."
00:01:57,00:02:00,And did he just look at his doorstop after all those years
00:02:00,00:02:03,"and go, well, that actually does look a bit like a meteorite?"
00:02:03,00:02:07,"I mean, how does it transpire that someone suddenly decides"
00:02:07,00:02:09,to take their doorstop to a science museum?
00:02:09,00:02:12,"I think it was that the doctor was visiting them,"
00:02:12,00:02:16,"rather than them taking just every single bit of rock in the house,"
00:02:16,00:02:18,rather than the museum.
00:02:18,00:02:21,Is this what? No. Is this what? No.
00:02:21,00:02:24,You got lucky in the end.
00:02:24,00:02:27,"But then some people are a little bit skeptical about it, actually,"
00:02:27,00:02:31,because what they realized is because this is now a famous meteorite
00:02:31,00:02:32,because it killed a cow.
00:02:32,00:02:36,It's now worth 10 times more than it was originally.
00:02:36,00:02:39,So they're thinking maybe there's something going dodgy going on here.
00:02:39,00:02:40,And then there's another twist.
00:02:40,00:02:44,"So around the same area, actually, in Chile and the Atacama,"
00:02:44,00:02:46,there was a large meteorite landed there.
00:02:46,00:02:48,And the load of people collected it.
00:02:48,00:02:49,And this was a really famous one.
00:02:49,00:02:53,And it landed in a dry riverbed called Thakamwurta.
00:02:53,00:02:56,"How do you-- sorry, how do you pronounce that?"
00:02:56,00:02:58,Thakamwurta.
00:02:58,00:02:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:59,00:03:00,"Sorry, yeah."
00:03:00,00:03:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:03,00:03:07,Whatever Andy just said means a dead cow in Spanish.
00:03:07,00:03:09,And so the theory is that maybe these people
00:03:09,00:03:11,heard about this famous one.
00:03:11,00:03:12,"And that, they went, that gives me an idea."
00:03:12,00:03:15,I'm going to pretend my cow got hit by that.
00:03:15,00:03:18,"And then when anyone comes, I'll have the rock."
00:03:18,00:03:20,"But then I can say, oh, no, I ate the cow."
00:03:20,00:03:20,Right.
00:03:20,00:03:21,I'll check that.
00:03:21,00:03:23,"But don't they-- they do test these rocks, right?"
00:03:23,00:03:25,"Oh, yeah, you can tell if a meteorite is a meteorite."
00:03:25,00:03:27,So they test his rock.
00:03:27,00:03:28,"I mean, presumably, they did."
00:03:28,00:03:30,"Yeah, so the meteorite is definitely a meteorite."
00:03:30,00:03:31,"Yeah, OK."
00:03:31,00:03:33,"But the question is, did it kill the cow or not?"
00:03:33,00:03:35,"Oh, that's what some people are skeptical about."
00:03:35,00:03:36,"Right, OK, I see."
00:03:36,00:03:38,Have you guys heard of the Nakala meteorite
00:03:38,00:03:39,which fell on Egypt in 1911?
00:03:39,00:03:40,Nope.
00:03:40,00:03:43,The story is that it vaporized a dog.
00:03:43,00:03:45,"Oh, yes."
00:03:45,00:03:48,"But that is very much the story of it, as in there's no evidence."
00:03:48,00:03:52,Because obviously the dog was vaporized.
00:03:52,00:03:53,Just what makes people think it's not quite true.
00:03:53,00:03:54,Yeah.
00:03:54,00:03:56,I read a really cool story that people
00:03:56,00:04:01,used to think that Venus fly traps were aliens traveling
00:04:01,00:04:04,on meteorites that landed on Earth.
00:04:04,00:04:06,"Because back in the day, Venus, what are you on about?"
00:04:06,00:04:08,"No, this is--"
00:04:08,00:04:09,I read this on the BBC's website.
00:04:09,00:04:14,"Back in the day, Venus fly traps would be very unpredictable"
00:04:14,00:04:15,and where they came up.
00:04:15,00:04:17,And they would go to places where they would think
00:04:17,00:04:18,a meteorite had landed.
00:04:18,00:04:21,"And very often, they would see out of place Venus fly traps."
00:04:21,00:04:22,And it looks like an alien.
00:04:22,00:04:25,And so they thought it's an alien.
00:04:25,00:04:27,It only looks like an alien because we've
00:04:27,00:04:31,"designed alien things after it, like movies and stuff like that."
00:04:31,00:04:32,Yeah.
00:04:32,00:04:34,"Actually, our aliens look like Venus fly traps."
00:04:34,00:04:34,You're right.
00:04:34,00:04:35,"Is that way around, isn't it?"
00:04:35,00:04:36,Yeah.
00:04:36,00:04:37,But they did.
00:04:37,00:04:39,People used to attribute--
00:04:39,00:04:41,"sorry, Dan."
00:04:41,00:04:44,But we're fine with vaporizing dog story over here.
00:04:44,00:04:50,"Yeah, that was a very sad story."
00:04:50,00:04:52,Poor dog.
00:04:52,00:04:54,They-- people would make money out of meteorites.
00:04:54,00:04:57,"And like so, like you were saying, people would pay"
00:04:57,00:04:59,to come and see various cows.
00:04:59,00:05:02,"And like, anything that's sort of been touched by a meteorite"
00:05:02,00:05:04,or experienced a meteorite can then be sold.
00:05:04,00:05:07,So there was one that smashed through a car in New York
00:05:07,00:05:11,"in 1992, smashed through the boot of the car, the trunk of the car."
00:05:11,00:05:14,And the owner of the car had just bought it for $400.
00:05:14,00:05:17,And she was able to sell it for 25 times that amount straight
00:05:17,00:05:17,afterwards.
00:05:17,00:05:20,And she was also able to sell the original title to the car
00:05:20,00:05:23,"from when she bought it, and a bulb from the rear tail light"
00:05:23,00:05:26,that had been blasted out by the meteorite.
00:05:26,00:05:27,Wow.
00:05:27,00:05:28,It was worth it.
00:05:28,00:05:32,I emailed the Secretary of the American Meteorological
00:05:32,00:05:34,Society.
00:05:34,00:05:36,This is a people who look after meteorites.
00:05:36,00:05:39,And ask them what to do if I find the meteorite.
00:05:39,00:05:41,"And they said the protocol for collecting meteorites,"
00:05:41,00:05:43,ideally a fresh meteorite should be collected
00:05:43,00:05:46,immediately without touching it and placed
00:05:46,00:05:48,in a plastic sealed bag.
00:05:48,00:05:50,How do you do that without touching it?
00:05:50,00:05:52,It's the same procedure as for a dog poo.
00:05:52,00:05:52,Yeah.
00:05:52,00:05:55,Imagine.
00:05:55,00:05:56,And then you--
00:05:56,00:05:58,And if the dog hang it up on a tree and wait
00:05:58,00:06:00,for the authorities to come in.
00:06:00,00:06:01,"And you don't have the dog anymore,"
00:06:01,00:06:02,because it's been vaporized.
00:06:05,00:06:08,Do you guys know there are about 20 full-time meteorite
00:06:08,00:06:12,"hunters in the world, very rare career to have."
00:06:12,00:06:14,And I think it was National Geographic.
00:06:14,00:06:15,They interviewed one of them.
00:06:15,00:06:17,He was a guy called Michael Farmer.
00:06:17,00:06:20,"He has been imprisoned for months in Oman,"
00:06:20,00:06:21,because he went there.
00:06:21,00:06:22,He knew a meteorite had landed.
00:06:22,00:06:23,He went to try and find it.
00:06:23,00:06:24,"And they locked him up saying, you're not"
00:06:24,00:06:26,allowed to take rocks out of Oman.
00:06:26,00:06:28,But he's been nearly killed.
00:06:28,00:06:30,"But the one thing he said in this interview, which"
00:06:30,00:06:33,"I really liked was he said, I've eaten a small piece"
00:06:33,00:06:36,of every moon rock and mars rock that I have purchased or found.
00:06:36,00:06:39,Not many people can say they have eaten a piece of the moon.
00:06:39,00:06:41,"And then he said, and I know for a fact"
00:06:41,00:06:45,that numerous scientists have done the same.
00:06:45,00:06:47,Do you think they're checking to see if it tastes of cheese?
00:06:47,00:06:56,"But I think you would do that when you give it a lick, at least."
00:06:56,00:06:58,"Yes, I would want to see what it tasted like."
00:06:58,00:07:00,But I wouldn't eat a small bit of the moon.
00:07:00,00:07:03,It feels somehow disrespectful.
00:07:03,00:07:04,To whom?
00:07:04,00:07:05,The goddess Salini.
00:07:05,00:07:07,"Oh, but yeah."
00:07:07,00:07:11,"Actually, that's what you do, isn't it, with fossils and stuff, isn't it?"
00:07:11,00:07:15,"If you're not sure-- if you've got fossilized dinosaur poo, for instance,"
00:07:15,00:07:20,"you can lick it, and it'll be slightly tacky to your tongue."
00:07:20,00:07:20,Really?
00:07:20,00:07:21,Come on.
00:07:21,00:07:24,"It's a long time since he's been in a dinosaur, OK?"
00:07:24,00:07:26,"If you find a plastic bag hanging up on a tree,"
00:07:26,00:07:29,"and you're not sure if it's a meteorite, do not do that."
00:07:29,00:07:34,"Well, that's like a farmer's eat their soil, don't they?"
00:07:34,00:07:39,"Sometimes, some farmers test their-- taste their soil to see if it's fertile."
00:07:39,00:07:43,And then the other way is by sitting down with your bare bottom on the soil.
00:07:43,00:07:44,Yes.
00:07:44,00:07:45,What's that for?
00:07:45,00:07:48,If it's just for show.
00:07:48,00:07:51,It's like to check if it's warm enough.
00:07:51,00:07:52,Yeah.
00:07:52,00:07:57,"So the soil's warm enough if you drop your trousers, sit on it, and it's just not sort of sore."
00:07:57,00:07:59,Does anyone do that?
00:07:59,00:08:00,No.
00:08:00,00:08:02,"So it's not a common practice these days, but--"
00:08:02,00:08:06,Although I keep her a pair of underpants buried in my back garden.
00:08:06,00:08:08,We all do that.
00:08:08,00:08:09,Why did you do that?
00:08:09,00:08:12,This was official advice from someone or other.
00:08:12,00:08:13,Not to me.
00:08:13,00:08:14,Life took farmers.
00:08:14,00:08:17,"And the idea is you put your underpants in your back garden,"
00:08:17,00:08:21,"and then you go back a few months later, and you check if they've been eaten away"
00:08:21,00:08:23,by all the microbes and stuff.
00:08:23,00:08:26,And you'll always know because the microbes can't eat the elastic band
00:08:26,00:08:30,"around the side of it, but they can eat the cotton."
00:08:30,00:08:32,And the purpose to see how--
00:08:32,00:08:36,"I mean, no, like if the bacteria have eaten them, then what?"
00:08:36,00:08:38,"Then you've got good soil, and you can plant stuff."
00:08:38,00:08:40,"And if they haven't, then you have to put some fertilizer in."
00:08:40,00:08:42,"Also, you've got a free thong at that point."
00:08:42,00:08:53,"So I was reading-- you know, in movies, how there's always a sci-fi movie"
00:08:53,00:08:57,"that will start in Antarctica, and a meteorite has landed."
00:08:57,00:09:00,And Antarctica always seems to be associated
00:09:00,00:09:03,with finding big meteorites.
00:09:03,00:09:06,"And I thought I was like, is that because of the poles"
00:09:06,00:09:09,and it attracts as the meteorites coming in?
00:09:09,00:09:10,And then I read this article.
00:09:10,00:09:12,It turns out the reason they go there
00:09:12,00:09:15,is because they're much easier to find because everything's white.
00:09:15,00:09:17,So they just stick out.
00:09:17,00:09:18,Is that amazing?
00:09:18,00:09:21,"I thought there was some deep, amazing alien life kind of thing."
00:09:21,00:09:22,"No, it's just like, oh, there it is."
00:09:22,00:09:24,It's so much easier.
00:09:24,00:09:28,So much more simple than trekking through a forest full of rocks.
00:09:28,00:09:29,That's true.
00:09:29,00:09:32,"Also, not many humans there and other people to disturb it, right?"
00:09:32,00:09:33,Yeah.
00:09:33,00:09:35,"Because they're black, aren't they, meteorites?"
00:09:35,00:09:37,That's the sort of lessons on how to spot them.
00:09:37,00:09:40,And so another place where it's really common for meteorites
00:09:40,00:09:41,to be found is Morocco.
00:09:41,00:09:44,"So for a country of its size, it's"
00:09:44,00:09:48,got like by multiple factors of 10 more meteorite findings
00:09:48,00:09:50,than any other country of its size in the world.
00:09:50,00:09:53,And this is just because this guy in 2006
00:09:53,00:09:56,decided to start teaching people how to spot a meteorite.
00:09:56,00:09:58,And it's become a proper career for a lot
00:09:58,00:10:00,of the nomadic people in Morocco.
00:10:00,00:10:01,They go around finding meteorites.
00:10:01,00:10:03,So a lot of them make money out of this.
00:10:03,00:10:06,And it's actually where the most important meteorite
00:10:06,00:10:08,probably ever found was found.
00:10:08,00:10:10,It was one that came from Mars.
00:10:10,00:10:11,It was in 2011.
00:10:11,00:10:13,And it's like this whole jumble of rocks
00:10:13,00:10:14,that were thrown together.
00:10:14,00:10:16,"And also, it's kind of full of old Mars water."
00:10:16,00:10:20,So it's the first kind of evidence that we have of that.
00:10:20,00:10:22,But the cool story about this is that it
00:10:22,00:10:24,was found by this guy who'd had lessons
00:10:24,00:10:26,that they have in Morocco on how to spot a meteorite.
00:10:26,00:10:27,And he saw it.
00:10:27,00:10:29,I think it was on sale in a market.
00:10:29,00:10:32,It's called the Black Beauty Stone now.
00:10:32,00:10:33,But it was on sale in a market.
00:10:33,00:10:34,And he looked at it.
00:10:34,00:10:35,He was tempted.
00:10:35,00:10:37,"And then he said, no, no, I'm not going to buy it."
00:10:37,00:10:38,He drove away.
00:10:38,00:10:39,He changed his mind.
00:10:39,00:10:40,He drove back.
00:10:40,00:10:42,And then he bought it.
00:10:42,00:10:43,And he was driving.
00:10:43,00:10:44,He was on his way back from the hospital
00:10:44,00:10:47,from having a gall stone removed.
00:10:47,00:10:50,So he had one stone removed.
00:10:50,00:10:52,And then he immediately got another stone.
00:10:52,00:10:53,Yeah.
00:10:53,00:10:56,You're saying this in the way that Dan says things sometimes.
00:10:56,00:11:00,I thought it sounded like that.
00:11:00,00:11:03,Is that what I sound like?
00:11:03,00:11:06,I am so sorry.
00:11:06,00:11:07,"Hey, we need to move on shortly."
00:11:07,00:11:09,You guys got anything before we do?
00:11:09,00:11:11,Can I give you a list of other things
00:11:11,00:11:13,that have been used as door stops over the years?
00:11:13,00:11:15,"Yeah, sure."
00:11:15,00:11:18,It is unbelievable how careless people are.
00:11:18,00:11:21,So it's just like everything valuable you've ever heard of.
00:11:21,00:11:24,"In 2016, a Chinese vase being used as a door stop"
00:11:24,00:11:27,"was suddenly sold for $860,000."
00:11:27,00:11:31,"In 2014, a Chinese pot sold for $150,000."
00:11:31,00:11:34,A min vase in 2012 sold for a million.
00:11:34,00:11:40,The world's largest sapphire in 1947 was found in Queensland.
00:11:40,00:11:42,It been used as a door stop for nine years
00:11:42,00:11:45,until the owner looked a bit closer.
00:11:45,00:11:48,"A Bronze Age dagger that was worth $50,000."
00:11:48,00:11:52,"In 1802, a lump of gold had been used as a door stop"
00:11:52,00:11:54,for three years until a jeweler who was visiting this house
00:11:54,00:11:55,saw it.
00:11:55,00:11:58,And it sparked America's very first gold rush
00:11:58,00:11:59,so in North Carolina.
00:11:59,00:12:03,"And finally, a can of tinned veal that"
00:12:03,00:12:06,"was left in the Arctic by William Perry, the explorer."
00:12:06,00:12:11,"In 1825, it was rediscovered by another explorer in 1829"
00:12:11,00:12:13,"and used as a door stop for many, many years."
00:12:13,00:12:17,And finally opened in 1958.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"Yeah, it got that reaction, I think,"
00:12:19,00:12:22,from the people who opened it as well.
00:12:22,00:12:24,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:12:24,00:12:25,And that is my fact.
00:12:25,00:12:29,My fact this week is that there is a unique species of ant
00:12:29,00:12:33,that only lives in 10 blocks of New York City.
00:12:33,00:12:35,They call it the Manhattan.
00:12:41,00:12:45,"This was sent in to me, actually, by a guy called Justin Hintz."
00:12:45,00:12:49,"And it was that this biologist discovered this species of ant,"
00:12:49,00:12:53,"which lives between 63rd Street and 76th Street in New York,"
00:12:53,00:12:56,"which is in Broadway in Broadway, Manhattan."
00:12:56,00:12:58,"And yeah, and they were looking at it."
00:12:58,00:13:01,"And they noticed that it was unlike any of the 13,000"
00:13:01,00:13:03,other species of ants that have ever been cataloged.
00:13:03,00:13:05,"They thought it might have come from Europe,"
00:13:05,00:13:07,but they can't trace it to any known ant.
00:13:07,00:13:11,"So that is, they've got this one city dwelling"
00:13:11,00:13:14,that has evolved to be its own species.
00:13:14,00:13:15,And Manhattan.
00:13:15,00:13:16,How do you look at an ant?
00:13:16,00:13:19,And then immediately access your mental catalog
00:13:19,00:13:24,"of all the 13,000 other ants and just eliminate them all."
00:13:24,00:13:27,Unless it has something extremely different.
00:13:27,00:13:28,"Like, it had an extra leg."
00:13:28,00:13:32,"It was driving one of the yellow cabs, that's what that wasn't so."
00:13:32,00:13:34,Get out of here.
00:13:34,00:13:36,So they eat so much junk food.
00:13:36,00:13:39,And the scientists who were studying this
00:13:39,00:13:42,"said that the pavement ant eats so much,"
00:13:42,00:13:44,shifting their diets to more human foods
00:13:44,00:13:46,that it's actually changing the chemical makeup
00:13:46,00:13:50,of their bodies to look more like humans.
00:13:50,00:13:55,"Which, sadly, is not as exciting a sentence as I thought it was."
00:13:55,00:13:58,"I think they mean internally, as opposed to, like, got a face."
00:13:58,00:14:04,"I've also got faces, surely."
00:14:04,00:14:09,"Ah, but just imagine, like, my face on an ant."
00:14:09,00:14:12,"Yeah, so yeah, and they don't get diabetes, though."
00:14:12,00:14:15,So that's a thing that separates the ants.
00:14:15,00:14:18,"So other ants get diabetes, do they?"
00:14:18,00:14:18,No.
00:14:18,00:14:20,What?
00:14:20,00:14:21,Sorry.
00:14:21,00:14:22,I say--
00:14:22,00:14:24,"Compared to the humans who are reading all the fast food,"
00:14:24,00:14:25,"I think it was your point, right?"
00:14:25,00:14:26,"Yes, yeah."
00:14:26,00:14:27,They're very good at digesting it.
00:14:27,00:14:29,"The fast food is actually sort of made for ants, it turns out."
00:14:29,00:14:30,Exactly.
00:14:30,00:14:30,Got it.
00:14:30,00:14:31,Not for us.
00:14:31,00:14:33,The coming human ants don't get diabetes
00:14:33,00:14:34,so they can keep eating.
00:14:34,00:14:37,"The scientist who did that, he was called Clint Peneck."
00:14:37,00:14:38,And he was talking about the study.
00:14:38,00:14:39,He was interviewed about it.
00:14:39,00:14:43,"And he said, when he was doing the study, nobody ever talked to me."
00:14:43,00:14:45,I basically was walking around and then
00:14:45,00:14:47,crouching down on the ground and huffing something off the sidewalk
00:14:47,00:14:49,through this ridiculous-looking device.
00:14:49,00:14:52,"And not a single New Yorker was like, hey, what are you doing?"
00:14:52,00:14:55,I guess I was not the weirdest person on the street.
00:14:55,00:14:58,"Now, that suggests to me that he was the weirdest person"
00:14:58,00:15:00,on the street.
00:15:00,00:15:03,"You don't tend to talk to the weirdest person on the street, mate."
00:15:03,00:15:05,That's not what everyone does.
00:15:05,00:15:07,"So New York has a few other species, doesn't it?"
00:15:07,00:15:08,That's so unique to it.
00:15:08,00:15:10,They have a unique centipede.
00:15:10,00:15:11,They have a sweet bee.
00:15:11,00:15:14,They have a white-footed mouse with small ears.
00:15:14,00:15:18,They also found in New York in 2014 the first new amphibian
00:15:18,00:15:21,that's been found in the state for 150 years.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"So a frog, a leopard frog."
00:15:23,00:15:26,"And so for more than a century, there's"
00:15:26,00:15:29,been two types of leopard frog living in New York
00:15:29,00:15:30,and people have been arguing over it.
00:15:30,00:15:32,Scientists have been arguing because there
00:15:32,00:15:35,seemed to be so much variety in the different leopard frogs.
00:15:35,00:15:37,There was this big debate that went on.
00:15:37,00:15:40,"And apparently, lots of discord and backlash"
00:15:40,00:15:42,from one scientist to another about theories
00:15:42,00:15:44,as to how come there was so much variation
00:15:44,00:15:45,with these two species.
00:15:45,00:15:49,And a hermitologist in 1936 called Karl Kofield
00:15:49,00:15:51,"said, actually, I think there's two species,"
00:15:51,00:15:52,might be three species.
00:15:52,00:15:54,And it caused such massive controversy.
00:15:54,00:15:56,And there was this bickering and all this strife
00:15:56,00:15:59,that people refused to accept in the scientific literature.
00:15:59,00:16:01,His theory was absolutely rubbish.
00:16:01,00:16:02,And that was 1936.
00:16:02,00:16:04,"And then in 2014, we went, oh, yeah, he was right."
00:16:04,00:16:05,There was another one.
00:16:05,00:16:10,"So quite sweetly, it's called the Rana Calfeldi after him."
00:16:10,00:16:12,"But presumably, he's long dead."
00:16:12,00:16:13,"Long dead, yeah."
00:16:13,00:16:15,But he's somewhere he's happy.
00:16:15,00:16:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:17,00:16:20,I think it's another New York discovered insect.
00:16:20,00:16:23,"So this was-- this is an insect that doesn't live in New York,"
00:16:23,00:16:25,but it was discovered by a New York scientist.
00:16:25,00:16:27,And it is a new type of beetle.
00:16:27,00:16:29,And they didn't know it existed.
00:16:29,00:16:31,But they discovered it because it was attached to an ant.
00:16:31,00:16:35,"And what it does is this beetle, when it wants to get to places,"
00:16:35,00:16:37,it goes up to this ant.
00:16:37,00:16:38,And it bites onto its anus.
00:16:38,00:16:41,And it grips on and flips underneath.
00:16:41,00:16:45,So the thorax-- it's in between the thorax and the admon--
00:16:45,00:16:46,admon-- admon-- admon--
00:16:46,00:16:47,admon-- admon--
00:16:47,00:16:48,Sure.
00:16:48,00:16:48,"Oh, sorry."
00:16:48,00:16:50,I'm going to add abdomen.
00:16:50,00:16:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:51,00:16:52,Thank you.
00:16:52,00:16:55,[APPLAUSE]
00:16:55,00:16:57,So they were studying this ant.
00:16:57,00:16:59,"And they were like, it's got two opposed."
00:16:59,00:17:03,"And they shook it, and the beetle fell off."
00:17:03,00:17:04,And that's what it did.
00:17:04,00:17:06,This is beetle has a unique way of transporting itself
00:17:06,00:17:10,by biting the bum of the ant and getting--
00:17:10,00:17:13,So does the ant just think it's got two buns?
00:17:13,00:17:15,The ant doesn't seem to have an issue with it.
00:17:15,00:17:17,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:17:17,00:17:19,So ants are pretty amazing.
00:17:19,00:17:20,I really like this ant.
00:17:20,00:17:21,I'd never heard of.
00:17:21,00:17:22,It's called the Azteca Brevis ant.
00:17:22,00:17:24,It's in Costa Rica.
00:17:24,00:17:26,And it catches prey that's more than 50 times
00:17:26,00:17:29,as heavy and as large as it is.
00:17:29,00:17:31,"And it does this by-- so they all work together,"
00:17:31,00:17:33,and they nest in a tree.
00:17:33,00:17:35,But they build this network of tunnels
00:17:35,00:17:38,within the tree with tiny little openings
00:17:38,00:17:40,out through the tree bark that are just big enough
00:17:40,00:17:41,to fit the little ant's heads.
00:17:41,00:17:44,"And so it looks a little bit like a holy cheese,"
00:17:44,00:17:45,like Swiss cheese or something.
00:17:45,00:17:46,And their heads poke out.
00:17:46,00:17:48,"And then a big bit of prey will come along,"
00:17:48,00:17:51,like a termite or something.
00:17:51,00:17:53,And we'll step on one of the holes.
00:17:53,00:17:55,One of its legs will fall into the hole.
00:17:55,00:17:58,"And the ant will bite the leg with its teeth, so it's stuck."
00:17:58,00:18:00,And then this thing kind of struggles to get away.
00:18:00,00:18:02,And another leg falls into another hole.
00:18:02,00:18:03,And another ant bites its other leg.
00:18:03,00:18:06,"And eventually, all its legs end up in the holes"
00:18:06,00:18:08,with ants' teeth biting into it.
00:18:08,00:18:10,And then the other ants all emerge and tear it to pieces
00:18:10,00:18:12,and have it for dinner.
00:18:12,00:18:14,But it's sort of spread-eagled on this tree.
00:18:14,00:18:17,Is there a happy ending at all to the story?
00:18:17,00:18:19,If you're an ant--
00:18:19,00:18:20,"Oh, sure."
00:18:20,00:18:21,It's a hell of a nice story.
00:18:21,00:18:21,Yeah.
00:18:21,00:18:23,That's really horrific.
00:18:23,00:18:25,"Just stuck there, sprawled out."
00:18:25,00:18:27,It's not the scene in the zombie film where all the hands
00:18:27,00:18:29,come through the wall.
00:18:29,00:18:29,Yeah.
00:18:29,00:18:32,"I haven't seen that scene, but it sounds like it is like that."
00:18:32,00:18:35,I found an ant called Cerecomerex amoeblis.
00:18:35,00:18:38,"And it's a pharma ant, so it farms a fungi."
00:18:38,00:18:41,It literally makes little scrapings and grows fungi to eat.
00:18:41,00:18:45,"But there's another species, which is called megalomurmexematocus."
00:18:45,00:18:48,And it comes into the first ant's colony.
00:18:48,00:18:50,It doesn't do any work.
00:18:50,00:18:51,It lives in the colony.
00:18:51,00:18:52,It eats the fungus.
00:18:52,00:18:53,The first ant has made.
00:18:53,00:18:57,And it also eats the babies that the host is rearing.
00:18:57,00:19:00,And the hosts do nothing about it.
00:19:00,00:19:02,They don't take any defensive action.
00:19:02,00:19:05,"That is not much of a house guest, isn't it?"
00:19:05,00:19:10,And he stole their precious doorstop and fucked up.
00:19:10,00:19:11,"Yeah, there was nothing in the fridge."
00:19:11,00:19:12,I hope you don't mind.
00:19:12,00:19:18,"So I ate the baby, but there's a reason that it's tolerated."
00:19:18,00:19:21,And the reason is that second ant contains a venom
00:19:21,00:19:26,"in its body, which helps to repel an even worse invader ant."
00:19:26,00:19:29,What is that guy doing now?
00:19:29,00:19:31,What is worse than eating the babies?
00:19:31,00:19:34,I think maybe those guys just completely destroy that.
00:19:34,00:19:34,I don't know.
00:19:34,00:19:35,They might destroy the nest or something.
00:19:35,00:19:39,"But yeah, so they have to put up with these really difficult guests"
00:19:39,00:19:42,because they know that it's protecting them against something worse.
00:19:42,00:19:46,I was reading an article in Cosmos Magazine about ants.
00:19:46,00:19:48,And I'll just read the start of that in a behavior
00:19:48,00:19:51,"that finds a broad comparison with human tradition,"
00:19:51,00:19:54,a genus known as turtle ants pass on possessions
00:19:54,00:19:58,from older individuals directly to younger ones.
00:19:58,00:20:01,"In a mechanism that does not, however, find a human analog,"
00:20:01,00:20:05,they do so through their anuses.
00:20:05,00:20:06,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:20:06,00:20:08,What about that scene in pulp fiction
00:20:08,00:20:11,with the guy who puts the watch up his anus?
00:20:11,00:20:13,"I haven't seen that film, but--"
00:20:13,00:20:15,"Well, someone must know what I'm talking about."
00:20:15,00:20:19,There was definitely one guy up there who got it immediately.
00:20:19,00:20:19,Exactly.
00:20:19,00:20:23,"Christopher walking, but the watch up his anus then gives it to his son."
00:20:23,00:20:24,"So actually, there isn't analog in humans."
00:20:24,00:20:28,I don't know.
00:20:28,00:20:32,"So these turtle ants, basically, it's like a fecal transplant"
00:20:32,00:20:34,that the adults give to the babies.
00:20:34,00:20:38,"And basically, if you don't get that fecal transplant"
00:20:38,00:20:40,"from your parents, then you would starve"
00:20:40,00:20:42,because you wouldn't have the right bacteria in your stomach.
00:20:42,00:20:44,So they do need it.
00:20:44,00:20:45,"Oh, wow."
00:20:45,00:20:48,Because there's a story with a happy ending.
00:20:48,00:20:51,But a gross middle.
00:20:51,00:20:53,There was going to be a really exciting game.
00:20:53,00:20:56,There was a kick-started game that reached funding.
00:20:56,00:20:58,And it was called Ant Simulator.
00:20:58,00:21:01,And it sounded really cool.
00:21:01,00:21:04,"So basically, you would manage an ant colony."
00:21:04,00:21:05,"Like, you would be the main ant."
00:21:05,00:21:08,"And you would be like, get over that."
00:21:08,00:21:10,"This is one of these new york ants, is that?"
00:21:10,00:21:13,Yeah.
00:21:13,00:21:15,And so it looked really amazing.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"And it had, I think, three people who"
00:21:17,00:21:19,were like the main people behind it.
00:21:19,00:21:20,"And unfortunately, it's not happening."
00:21:20,00:21:22,And the reason is because of--
00:21:22,00:21:24,"and they captured it, I think, perfectly in the headline--"
00:21:24,00:21:27,Ant Simulator canceled after team spends the money
00:21:27,00:21:29,on booze and strippers.
00:21:29,00:21:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:31,00:21:33,"Two of them went off, had a massive night."
00:21:33,00:21:35,"And this guy had to make a video going,"
00:21:35,00:21:36,I'm so sorry.
00:21:36,00:21:38,Ant Simulator can't happen anymore.
00:21:38,00:21:41,"And we can't give you back your money, either."
00:21:41,00:21:44,"But as typical entomologist behavior, they're always"
00:21:44,00:21:45,doing that kind of thing.
00:21:45,00:21:46,Can't be trusted.
00:21:46,00:21:49,We're going to have to move on soon to our next fact.
00:21:49,00:21:53,They fake injury ants to get sympathy.
00:21:53,00:21:55,So they carry their injured home.
00:21:55,00:21:56,And ants have figured this out.
00:21:56,00:21:58,"This is the Ronaldo ant, doesn't it?"
00:21:58,00:22:00,I've seen this.
00:22:00,00:22:01,It's amazing.
00:22:01,00:22:02,"Oh, my god."
00:22:02,00:22:03,It just grazes the leaf.
00:22:03,00:22:06,"And it goes, oh!"
00:22:06,00:22:09,I am so impressed that you knew the name of any figure.
00:22:09,00:22:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:11,00:22:15,"So the Ronaldo ant, if they're injured,"
00:22:15,00:22:17,they carry each other home.
00:22:17,00:22:19,And so some ants really overemphasize injuries.
00:22:19,00:22:21,"So it was found ants have been witnessed moving really,"
00:22:21,00:22:25,really slowly or limping or falling over.
00:22:25,00:22:27,"I don't know how an ant falls over, but they do."
00:22:27,00:22:28,In the hope of being carried.
00:22:28,00:22:30,"But then if no one helps, they look around"
00:22:30,00:22:32,and then they get back up and they walk on like this happens.
00:22:32,00:22:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:34,00:22:38,"OK, let's move on."
00:22:38,00:22:40,It is time for fact number three.
00:22:40,00:22:42,And that is Chazinski.
00:22:42,00:22:46,In my fact this week is that the slinky business almost
00:22:46,00:22:48,went bankrupt because the slinky's inventor kept giving
00:22:48,00:22:50,the proceeds the way to religious cults.
00:22:50,00:22:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:52,00:22:54,It's amazing.
00:22:54,00:22:55,"Yeah, so this is it."
00:22:55,00:22:58,"The slinky was invented by a guy called Richard James,"
00:22:58,00:22:59,who was an engineer.
00:22:59,00:23:02,He was invented in 1943.
00:23:02,00:23:03,He worked on a Navy shipyard.
00:23:03,00:23:04,And he was working on a bit of equipment
00:23:04,00:23:08,and noticed some springs acting oddly walking.
00:23:08,00:23:11,"And so he said to his wife, I think I can make a toy out of this."
00:23:11,00:23:15,And it was huge and it sold out and he got very rich.
00:23:15,00:23:18,And then he turned to a religion Christianity
00:23:18,00:23:19,to be specific.
00:23:19,00:23:22,And he started giving away all this money.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"And his wife was like, oh my god, we were almost broke."
00:23:25,00:23:27,We were almost completely out of money
00:23:27,00:23:29,because he just gave it all away to various cults.
00:23:29,00:23:33,And then he ran away to Bolivia to join one of them in 1960
00:23:33,00:23:37,"and did not speak to or see his family again, all the slinky."
00:23:37,00:23:42,"He did occasionally write letters to his wife, Betty,"
00:23:42,00:23:43,urging her to repent.
00:23:43,00:23:44,So that is something--
00:23:44,00:23:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:46,00:23:47,Yeah.
00:23:47,00:23:49,So the invention was an amazing invention.
00:23:49,00:23:52,And it caught on quite quickly with an initial batch.
00:23:52,00:23:55,He sold something like 490 minutes once.
00:23:55,00:23:57,All they had to do was bring it to the front of the store
00:23:57,00:23:59,and just show people that going down a couple of steps.
00:23:59,00:24:02,"And it just-- everyone was like, God, I have it."
00:24:02,00:24:03,And then there was a few years where it just--
00:24:03,00:24:05,he needed to get it manufactured.
00:24:05,00:24:07,And people wouldn't buy into it.
00:24:07,00:24:09,"But he not only invented the slinky,"
00:24:09,00:24:12,he invented the machine that makes the slinky
00:24:12,00:24:15,"in a quick, sort of like mass product way."
00:24:15,00:24:18,So a slinky-- and I don't know if it's still to this day
00:24:18,00:24:21,"the same length, but the original slink is that he made--"
00:24:21,00:24:24,"if it was the coil was laid out just straight as a coil,"
00:24:24,00:24:26,"it's 80 feet long, each slinky."
00:24:26,00:24:29,"He created a machine that coiled it up in 10 seconds,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,and then it was good to go.
00:24:31,00:24:32,"So he has a patent for an invention,"
00:24:32,00:24:34,as well as the toy invention.
00:24:34,00:24:35,That's cool.
00:24:35,00:24:37,The patent for the original slinky
00:24:37,00:24:39,said that it could be used as both a child's amusement
00:24:39,00:24:42,and for parlor games.
00:24:42,00:24:46,"OK, so I couldn't work out what parlor games there might be."
00:24:46,00:24:48,"But I went on to the internet, and apparently there"
00:24:48,00:24:51,was once a game that was sold called Slinkum.
00:24:51,00:24:53,And it was like a little ramp.
00:24:53,00:24:56,"And it had boxes at the bottom, like squares."
00:24:56,00:24:58,"And you would put your slinky down the ramp,"
00:24:58,00:24:59,"and whichever square it stopped in,"
00:24:59,00:25:01,that's a number of points you got.
00:25:01,00:25:03,"And obviously, they weren't that confident about how good a game"
00:25:03,00:25:06,"it was, because the rules offers a bounty"
00:25:06,00:25:09,"of $25, but anyone offering a suggestion"
00:25:09,00:25:11,of an improvement of the game.
00:25:11,00:25:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:14,00:25:15,That is amazing.
00:25:15,00:25:16,So good.
00:25:16,00:25:20,Do you know what the quality controllers in the slinky factory?
00:25:20,00:25:21,It's--
00:25:21,00:25:21,No.
00:25:21,00:25:26,They test whether or not they can walk into their own box.
00:25:26,00:25:27,Wow.
00:25:27,00:25:29,"If they can do that, then there are high quality slinky."
00:25:29,00:25:31,"Down some stairs, right?"
00:25:31,00:25:32,I think they put them down--
00:25:32,00:25:34,"I think they put the boxes at the bottom of stairs,"
00:25:34,00:25:37,and their final challenge.
00:25:37,00:25:38,That is amazing.
00:25:38,00:25:38,It won't walk in.
00:25:38,00:25:40,"If it's too tight or too loose, it won't walk in."
00:25:40,00:25:42,What's another weird thing is that--
00:25:42,00:25:45,so he invented this while he was working for the war effort.
00:25:45,00:25:49,"And it was the side project, as Anna was saying,"
00:25:49,00:25:50,found a toy when it fell off the thing.
00:25:50,00:25:52,"Yeah, so what he was doing, just not on that,"
00:25:52,00:25:55,"is there was like a meter, which would tell you"
00:25:55,00:25:57,the horsepower of the ship that he was on.
00:25:57,00:25:59,And he needed a dampening system to stop it
00:25:59,00:26:01,from bouncing around everywhere.
00:26:01,00:26:02,So he was using springs to do that.
00:26:02,00:26:05,Then this spring happens to be great at doing different things.
00:26:05,00:26:08,"Yeah, so he saw that, and he made it as a toy."
00:26:08,00:26:11,No intention for use of war.
00:26:11,00:26:13,"Then years later, the Vietnam War happened,"
00:26:13,00:26:15,"and slinkies were actually used in the war,"
00:26:15,00:26:17,"because what they were fantastic at doing was,"
00:26:17,00:26:19,"if you were stuck in the middle of nowhere,"
00:26:19,00:26:21,"you would throw a slinky up into a tree,"
00:26:21,00:26:24,and it could act as a sort of antenna for radio signals
00:26:24,00:26:26,that you needed to be sending.
00:26:26,00:26:27,No way.
00:26:27,00:26:31,It ended up becoming an actual use for war.
00:26:31,00:26:33,"No way, that's so cool."
00:26:33,00:26:35,Way.
00:26:35,00:26:37,Wow.
00:26:37,00:26:39,Here's a use for a slinky.
00:26:39,00:26:40,You can use it to get rid of squirrels.
00:26:40,00:26:48,"You put a squirrel on one, and then send it down the stairs,"
00:26:48,00:26:50,"and no, you don't do that."
00:26:50,00:26:54,"And then it goes into its box, and you slam the lid shut."
00:26:54,00:26:56,"Now, what you do is you put it on your bird feeder,"
00:26:56,00:26:59,"and then when the squirrel comes along,"
00:26:59,00:27:00,"he kind of grabs onto the slinky,"
00:27:00,00:27:02,"and the weight pulls the slinky down,"
00:27:02,00:27:06,and he's kind of pulled down in a little elevator ride.
00:27:06,00:27:08,"There are videos online, aren't there?"
00:27:08,00:27:10,They are unbelievable.
00:27:10,00:27:13,How's the fun?
00:27:13,00:27:17,"So when you drop a slinky, the bottom doesn't know"
00:27:17,00:27:20,"that you let go of the top, at first."
00:27:20,00:27:21,This is true.
00:27:21,00:27:22,"Yeah, this is true."
00:27:22,00:27:26,"I don't think it even knows it's a slinky, I mean."
00:27:26,00:27:30,So this is my damn fact of the show.
00:27:30,00:27:32,And I'm playing it now.
00:27:32,00:27:34,"Check it out, go home."
00:27:34,00:27:36,"Go to the slinky cupboard, and check it out."
00:27:36,00:27:38,So it looks like it's floating.
00:27:38,00:27:41,"The bottom looks like it's floating, because it's a tension spring."
00:27:41,00:27:42,And when you let go--
00:27:42,00:27:45,"You're holding the slinky not scrunched up, right?"
00:27:45,00:27:47,So you're holding the very tip of it.
00:27:47,00:27:49,So it's really dangling down a long way.
00:27:49,00:27:50,Is that what you think?
00:27:50,00:27:51,Your squirrels just come off the bottom.
00:27:51,00:27:52,Exactly.
00:27:52,00:27:53,It's loose at the bottom.
00:27:53,00:27:56,"And when you let go of the, as you say, the top bands,"
00:27:56,00:28:00,it takes time for the motion to tell the bottom of the slinky
00:28:00,00:28:02,that the top and the tension have been released.
00:28:02,00:28:03,And I read that--
00:28:03,00:28:05,"You're not a physicist, are you Andy?"
00:28:05,00:28:09,"Not-- well, not by trade."
00:28:09,00:28:11,But I read-- I couldn't quite believe this.
00:28:11,00:28:13,I read that this happens even to solid objects.
00:28:13,00:28:17,"So if you drop a steel rod, the top starts accelerating"
00:28:17,00:28:19,before the bottom does.
00:28:19,00:28:21,"OK, because the vibrations need to travel down, don't they?"
00:28:21,00:28:22,It's not that.
00:28:22,00:28:25,It's basically the tension is pulling up
00:28:25,00:28:27,at the same rate as the gravity is pushing down.
00:28:27,00:28:30,"Yeah, so the tension, once you've released it with your hand,"
00:28:30,00:28:33,it needs to travel down the slinky before the slinky
00:28:33,00:28:34,knows of the bottom.
00:28:34,00:28:36,"Oh, that tension's been released now."
00:28:36,00:28:37,And it is amazing.
00:28:37,00:28:38,You should watch it on YouTube.
00:28:38,00:28:40,"The slinky, it just levitates."
00:28:40,00:28:41,The bottom just levitates.
00:28:41,00:28:45,There's a very good video on the Veritasium YouTube channel.
00:28:45,00:28:49,"Wow, is that-- do you make that channel?"
00:28:49,00:28:51,"And yeah, it's incredible."
00:28:51,00:28:54,It's magic.
00:28:54,00:28:54,It's magic.
00:28:54,00:28:58,You just ruined all the science of it.
00:28:58,00:28:59,"I think we should say about the slinky,"
00:28:59,00:29:02,but the hero behind it wasn't the guy who made it
00:29:02,00:29:04,and then turned to a Bolivian cult.
00:29:04,00:29:07,"It was his wife, Bessie, who was the person who saved it."
00:29:07,00:29:10,So she became determined to make it work.
00:29:10,00:29:15,And she made this 450 mile weekly round trip to the factory
00:29:15,00:29:18,and pumped all their remaining money into it.
00:29:18,00:29:21,She gammled their entire mortgage on a toy show in 1963
00:29:21,00:29:24,"in New York, hoping that people would go for it."
00:29:24,00:29:25,She launched the advertising campaign.
00:29:25,00:29:26,She gave it a jingle.
00:29:26,00:29:31,And she suddenly built from her ruined marriage
00:29:31,00:29:33,this great little toy.
00:29:33,00:29:36,And I think she might have been her idea to do the dog
00:29:36,00:29:39,or the dog really gave it a boost in a train as well.
00:29:39,00:29:42,So the dog is pictured toy story in your head
00:29:42,00:29:44,and the slinky dog.
00:29:44,00:29:45,That's literally it.
00:29:45,00:29:48,"And when the movie came out, they weren't prepared for the fact"
00:29:48,00:29:50,that it was going to be massively popular.
00:29:50,00:29:54,So they didn't have the quantities that they need for merchandise
00:29:54,00:29:57,"to come out at a point, which seems impossible as a thought,"
00:29:57,00:29:58,doesn't it?
00:29:58,00:30:01,"Well, they did a range of things, which were all slinkies"
00:30:01,00:30:03,in the middle and then other things at the front of the back.
00:30:03,00:30:04,"So they did the dog, they did the train."
00:30:04,00:30:07,"There was also a caterpillar, a hippo, a fire engine,"
00:30:07,00:30:09,"a worm, and several more."
00:30:09,00:30:12,But they all had the same thing.
00:30:12,00:30:13,You can buy at the moment.
00:30:13,00:30:18,You can buy sound effects slinky for $12.99.
00:30:18,00:30:21,"And as it goes down, it makes a sound splat,"
00:30:21,00:30:24,"boing, and thwap."
00:30:24,00:30:25,But I kind of think the sound is quite nice.
00:30:25,00:30:27,"Anyway, isn't it what a slinky makes?"
00:30:27,00:30:34,"You could also, for $153.99 by a 14-karat gold-plated slinky,"
00:30:34,00:30:36,just to keep your dog open.
00:30:36,00:30:43,"Oh, we're going to have to move on soon to our next fact."
00:30:43,00:30:45,"Oh, I was just looking at some other toys."
00:30:45,00:30:48,"I'll bring them. Mr. Potato Head, the original Mr. Potato Head,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,did not come with the potato head.
00:30:50,00:30:53,It was just the bits on his face.
00:30:53,00:30:57,"So you ordered a Mr. Potato Head, or you went and bought one."
00:30:57,00:30:59,And it was just bits of moustache.
00:30:59,00:31:01,"In fact, I think the original one came with hands, feet, ears,"
00:31:01,00:31:05,"two mouths, two pesovies, four noses, three hats, eye glasses,"
00:31:05,00:31:05,and a pipe.
00:31:05,00:31:07,"But, and some felt for the moustache."
00:31:07,00:31:11,But the idea was you should use one of your own potatoes.
00:31:11,00:31:13,So you should put it in a real potato.
00:31:13,00:31:17,I think I actually remember having one of those with an actual potato.
00:31:17,00:31:18,I believe so.
00:31:18,00:31:21,Unless you're going to tell me it was in the 1920s or something.
00:31:21,00:31:24,"I think you might be lying about how old you are, James,"
00:31:24,00:31:26,because now I haven't written on the date here.
00:31:26,00:31:29,But I think it was in the early 70s when they decided that--
00:31:29,00:31:31,"I was alive in the late 70s, so maybe."
00:31:31,00:31:32,Yeah.
00:31:32,00:31:33,Do you remember?
00:31:33,00:31:37,They decided that the pins needed to jab into a potato
00:31:37,00:31:40,were too sharp and contravened health and safety.
00:31:40,00:31:42,"And so you could no longer stick it into a real potato,"
00:31:42,00:31:44,so they had to come with a plastic potato.
00:31:44,00:31:45,"Oh, really?"
00:31:45,00:31:45,Yeah.
00:31:45,00:31:48,Do you know who invented paint by Numbers?
00:31:48,00:31:49,"No, I love that, though."
00:31:49,00:31:53,"Yeah, it was Michelangelo."
00:31:53,00:31:55,"Not the turtle, damn, not the turtle."
00:31:55,00:32:02,"He's a party, dude, you know?"
00:32:02,00:32:07,He used to assign sections of his ceilings for his students to paint.
00:32:07,00:32:10,And the way that he would do it is he put Numbers there so they knew what to paint.
00:32:10,00:32:15,"But the modern ones started in 1952, and Macy started selling this."
00:32:15,00:32:17,"And a few months later, it became massive,"
00:32:17,00:32:19,because an amateur painter won third prize
00:32:19,00:32:23,at a San Francisco art competition by doing just the paint by Numbers.
00:32:23,00:32:25,Wow.
00:32:25,00:32:28,And the press coverage just said that no one could tell the difference
00:32:28,00:32:29,between real painting and this.
00:32:29,00:32:31,And then it became absolutely huge.
00:32:31,00:32:31,Wow.
00:32:31,00:32:33,"Oh, my God."
00:32:33,00:32:36,That's so-- I can't believe Michelangelo did that.
00:32:36,00:32:37,That's really funny.
00:32:37,00:32:39,"He ruined his own profession in a way,"
00:32:39,00:32:42,"because once you're painting by Numbers, anyone can do it."
00:32:42,00:32:43,"And that's where there are no artists around today,"
00:32:43,00:32:45,is because we're all just doing paint by Numbers.
00:32:45,00:32:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:48,00:32:51,"OK, should we move on to our final fact of the show?"
00:32:51,00:32:52,It's time for our final fact of the show.
00:32:52,00:32:55,And that is Andy.
00:32:55,00:32:58,"My fact is that when zebras are running away from a lion,"
00:32:58,00:33:00,they fart loudly with every stride.
00:33:00,00:33:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:02,00:33:08,"And who's to say, Andy, that you wouldn't do exactly the same thing"
00:33:08,00:33:11,as your situation?
00:33:11,00:33:12,Sure I would.
00:33:12,00:33:13,Fair play.
00:33:13,00:33:15,But they're quite gassy animals.
00:33:15,00:33:18,And the motion propels the gases out of their bodies
00:33:18,00:33:19,when they start running.
00:33:19,00:33:20,Does he push them forward quicker?
00:33:20,00:33:22,"I think he does, yes."
00:33:22,00:33:25,And you can hear them from quite a long way away.
00:33:25,00:33:30,"So there's a new book out, and it's called Does It Fart?"
00:33:30,00:33:33,And it's by Nick Caruso and Danny Rabbiotti.
00:33:33,00:33:35,And it's an absolutely fantastic book.
00:33:35,00:33:38,"So they're scientists, and they started collecting animals"
00:33:38,00:33:41,and writing little essays about whether or not
00:33:41,00:33:42,those animals fart.
00:33:42,00:33:45,"And it was a spreadsheet that turned into a book,"
00:33:45,00:33:46,which is my favorite kind of book.
00:33:46,00:33:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:49,00:33:51,And they just got information about all kinds of things.
00:33:51,00:33:54,So there are termites in there.
00:33:54,00:33:54,There are dinosaurs.
00:33:54,00:33:56,"Dinosaurs, the ruling is not anymore."
00:33:56,00:34:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:00,00:34:01,There's a thing about termites.
00:34:01,00:34:04,The amazing thing about termites-- termites each produce
00:34:04,00:34:09,1/2 of 1 millionth gram of methane per day.
00:34:09,00:34:10,So not very much.
00:34:10,00:34:13,"However, unfortunately, there are so many termites"
00:34:13,00:34:17,"that they produce-- now, this is a wide range, so steady on."
00:34:17,00:34:21,But they produce between 5% and 19% of methane emissions
00:34:21,00:34:23,globally.
00:34:23,00:34:24,Between what and what?
00:34:24,00:34:26,5% and 19%.
00:34:26,00:34:27,"That's a lot, guys."
00:34:27,00:34:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:29,00:34:29,Kill them.
00:34:29,00:34:32,This is why the answer finds a kill them.
00:34:32,00:34:36,"That's your answer to every problem, don't you?"
00:34:36,00:34:42,"Well, I've got a very hawkish approach to termites."
00:34:42,00:34:44,"Yeah, it does sound like an incredible book."
00:34:44,00:34:47,"So a couple of other things is, sloths don't fart."
00:34:47,00:34:49,The most animals do fart.
00:34:49,00:34:51,Sloths don't fart because their digestion is so
00:34:51,00:34:53,"slow, like all the rest of them."
00:34:53,00:34:56,They would take them so long to work through the farting
00:34:56,00:34:58,process that the gases would build up inside them
00:34:58,00:34:59,and become poisonous.
00:34:59,00:35:02,"And so instead, they are reabsorbed through their intestines"
00:35:02,00:35:04,into their bloodstreams.
00:35:04,00:35:06,"And then those gases are taken up to their lungs,"
00:35:06,00:35:10,and they breathe them out instead.
00:35:10,00:35:13,I desperately want to know what a slow spread smells like.
00:35:13,00:35:15,"Ah, yeah."
00:35:15,00:35:18,"The early morning used to be called sparrow fart,"
00:35:18,00:35:21,"which was just the time of day, you know, sparrow fart."
00:35:21,00:35:22,"It's so early that the sparrows are farting,"
00:35:22,00:35:24,I suppose.
00:35:24,00:35:25,But think about that.
00:35:25,00:35:26,Sparrows don't fart.
00:35:26,00:35:27,Do they not?
00:35:27,00:35:27,Nope.
00:35:27,00:35:29,Is that true of all birds?
00:35:29,00:35:32,"All birds don't fart, or no birds fart."
00:35:32,00:35:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:35,00:35:37,Why do they not fart?
00:35:37,00:35:40,"They've got very short intestines,"
00:35:40,00:35:41,and they poo very frequently.
00:35:41,00:35:44,And the main reason is that they-- so the reason you fart
00:35:44,00:35:46,"is that you have a buildup of gas, which"
00:35:46,00:35:48,is due to gas forming bacteria in your gut.
00:35:48,00:35:50,I think we may have mentioned that before.
00:35:50,00:35:52,So humans and mammals do have those bacteria and birds don't.
00:35:52,00:35:53,So that's the reason they don't.
00:35:53,00:35:55,OK.
00:35:55,00:35:58,I was checking if humans might fart if they're
00:35:58,00:36:00,being chased by stuff.
00:36:00,00:36:02,And James has been to the zoo today.
00:36:02,00:36:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:04,00:36:07,And I went on to runnersworld.com.
00:36:07,00:36:10,"And apparently, this is a problem that lots of runners"
00:36:10,00:36:14,"have that are farting a lot while they're running, right?"
00:36:14,00:36:17,And they say that the reason is all that--
00:36:17,00:36:18,People have told me.
00:36:18,00:36:21,"People have told me that, too, sorry."
00:36:21,00:36:26,I felt as I was agreeing with that that it was too enthusiastic.
00:36:26,00:36:29,"So anyway, apparently, what it is, is it's all the heavy breathing."
00:36:29,00:36:33,"So you're taking in a lot of gas, and it has to go somewhere."
00:36:33,00:36:34,And that's what happens.
00:36:34,00:36:36,"Really, yeah, apparently."
00:36:36,00:36:38,And you need to poo as well.
00:36:38,00:36:42,Run as diarrhea is a serious problem on running forums.
00:36:42,00:36:42,Hey.
00:36:42,00:36:43,Hey.
00:36:43,00:36:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:47,00:36:51,Is anyone else feeling like they're at a help group?
00:36:51,00:36:51,Sorry.
00:36:51,00:36:52,"Sorry, I forgot everyone was here."
00:36:55,00:36:56,"OK, I do have a question."
00:36:56,00:36:59,"And I'm not a physicist, but I do have this question."
00:36:59,00:37:02,"If you're running, and you break wind--"
00:37:02,00:37:02,Yeah.
00:37:02,00:37:05,"-- let's say you're running at 12 miles an hour,"
00:37:05,00:37:10,and you break wind at 4 miles an hour out the other way.
00:37:10,00:37:13,I presume that the wind that you break is still traveling
00:37:13,00:37:16,at 8 miles an hour in your wake.
00:37:16,00:37:19,"OK, I've got a lot to tell you about relativity."
00:37:19,00:37:20,That's correct.
00:37:20,00:37:21,We'll do it after the show.
00:37:21,00:37:22,OK.
00:37:22,00:37:24,I think that works.
00:37:24,00:37:24,Yeah.
00:37:24,00:37:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:26,00:37:30,One of the good farting animal is the pupfish.
00:37:30,00:37:32,"So I think this isn't the book as well, but it eats algae."
00:37:32,00:37:35,But it has-- the algae has such high levels of gas in it
00:37:35,00:37:39,"that the pupfish's stomach inflates, fully inflates,"
00:37:39,00:37:41,and it floats to the top of the water.
00:37:41,00:37:42,"And that's a really, really bad place for it to be,"
00:37:42,00:37:44,because it exposes it to lots of predators.
00:37:44,00:37:47,"So the moment the pupfish has a meal of algae,"
00:37:47,00:37:49,it has to fart to save its own life.
00:37:49,00:37:50,Wow.
00:37:50,00:37:50,And so--
00:37:50,00:37:51,Wow.
00:37:51,00:37:54,The pup's straight up to the top and is desperately trying to expel
00:37:54,00:37:56,wind constantly to sink back down again.
00:37:56,00:37:58,It's extremely stressful.
00:37:58,00:37:59,That's amazing.
00:37:59,00:38:00,It's a raise to the bottom for them.
00:38:00,00:38:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:04,00:38:05,"Now, maybe some stuff on zebras."
00:38:05,00:38:06,Yeah.
00:38:06,00:38:08,Here's an amazing thing about zebras.
00:38:08,00:38:09,"When they're being chased by a lion,"
00:38:09,00:38:11,"not only do they do what you said,"
00:38:11,00:38:14,but they only run about half the top speed
00:38:14,00:38:16,when they're being chased by a lion.
00:38:16,00:38:16,What?
00:38:16,00:38:20,"So basically, what happens is, if you're going at your top speed"
00:38:20,00:38:22,"and you're running, it's really easy for the lion"
00:38:22,00:38:25,or whatever to tell where you're going to be in two strides time.
00:38:25,00:38:28,"So what they do is they go at half of their speed,"
00:38:28,00:38:29,"and then when the lion gets anywhere near them,"
00:38:29,00:38:32,they just go in a different direction.
00:38:32,00:38:33,And then they go really fast.
00:38:33,00:38:36,"And then they'll slow down to half their speed again,"
00:38:36,00:38:37,and then wait till the lion gets to them
00:38:37,00:38:39,and then speed off really quickly again.
00:38:39,00:38:39,"Oh, wow."
00:38:39,00:38:40,"That's smart, isn't it?"
00:38:40,00:38:41,"That's very, very good."
00:38:41,00:38:42,Very clever.
00:38:42,00:38:47,Did you read about this ridiculous story in 2001
00:38:47,00:38:49,where some farmers brought in the UK
00:38:49,00:38:53,"bought a Shetland Pony, a really small pony."
00:38:53,00:38:56,And then they were surprised when they woke up one morning
00:38:56,00:38:57,and they went out into the field.
00:38:57,00:38:58,"And there was their Shetland Pony in there,"
00:38:58,00:39:01,"but also a tiny, tiny zebra."
00:39:01,00:39:04,And it was because they hadn't realized
00:39:04,00:39:05,"they'd bought a pregnant Shetland Pony,"
00:39:05,00:39:06,and they bought it from a wildlife sanctuary
00:39:06,00:39:08,where it was sharing a field with a zebra.
00:39:08,00:39:09,What?
00:39:09,00:39:10,Wow.
00:39:10,00:39:12,What?
00:39:12,00:39:15,"The woman didn't say, we had thought that she was getting faster,"
00:39:15,00:39:18,but it really was a bit of a shock when we got up one morning
00:39:18,00:39:20,and we saw that full zebra was there.
00:39:20,00:39:24,We realized then what had happened.
00:39:24,00:39:27,"That's-- I have a related factor that, which is that--"
00:39:27,00:39:28,I think it's in Georgia.
00:39:28,00:39:31,"There are dogs who are supposed to be guarding sheep,"
00:39:31,00:39:33,and they keep on having sex with the wolves.
00:39:33,00:39:37,They're meant to be defending the sheep from.
00:39:37,00:39:40,"Well, I guess it would put the wolves off"
00:39:40,00:39:41,what they were supposed to be doing.
00:39:41,00:39:42,That is true.
00:39:42,00:39:47,"It was a action method, but they keep testing the dogs"
00:39:47,00:39:49,"as well, and finding out, oh, you're half wolf,"
00:39:49,00:39:53,because your parents were a wolf and a dog.
00:39:53,00:39:54,This is amazing.
00:39:54,00:39:57,"But in the line of duty, James Bond does it all the time."
00:39:57,00:39:58,He does.
00:39:58,00:39:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:59,00:40:06,"OK, that is it."
00:40:06,00:40:07,That is all of our facts.
