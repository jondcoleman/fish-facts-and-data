1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,680
 How are you doing?

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,880
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,600
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,840
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,200
 I'm Anna Chazinski and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,520
 favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,760
 Starting with you, Anna Chazinski.

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,280
 My fact this week is that a frog's tongue is 10 times softer than a human's tongue.

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,280
 I've thought we had soft tongues already.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
 And yet?

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,120
 You've been very lucky in your love life.

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,520
 Does this mean that French kissing a frog will be unbelievably good?

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
 Or unbelievably bad?

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,440
 Yeah, because you don't want too much give, do you?

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,440
 I don't know.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,400
 It really depends on your personal taste but it doesn't use it for kissing.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,040
 When the princess kisses the frog in the story, does she French kiss it and if so does

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,160
 she notice that it's tongue is unbelievably soft?

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,920
 That was probably in the original draft after that she kissed.

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,920
 She went, "What the fuck is that?"

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,840
 Actually, I do remember that in one of the really early versions of that, like in the old

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,440
 French versions of that thing, I think she has sex with the frog to turn him into a

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
 prince, I think so.

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:29,640
 But unfortunately, who finds the frog's penis is 10 times softer than a human's finger.

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,160
 So 10 times softer, that's pretty chilly, right?

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
 It's soft.

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's soft.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,240
 It's because it's so that they can catch their prey effectively.

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,720
 So if we start our tongue out and bash it into a fly, then we'd bash the fly away from

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
 us.

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,560
 But a frog's tongue is soft enough that if it bashes its tongue into a fly, it sort of moulds

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,240
 into the various crevices of the cricket or whatever it is.

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,840
 And then it can retract and pull it back in.

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,440
 And it does this by having an extremely soft tongue.

35
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,120
 And it also does it by having this incredible saliva.

36
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,560
 So frog saliva is 50,000 times more viscous, so 50,000 times stickier than ours.

37
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,040
 So that means if you do French kiss a frog, it's going to be hard to get away.

38
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
 Wow.

39
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
 Yeah, that's true.

40
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,680
 So if a frog was looking stamps to put on, that would be really soddly stuck on, right?

41
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
 Yeah.

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,440
 And so in the early days of the post office, then every letter came with a frog attached.

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,280
 They employed them at first.

44
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
 It's incredible.

45
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,040
 But the thing is that it changes, doesn't it?

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
 Yes.

47
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,920
 So it starts off like, so it incredibly thick, honey, and then when it's on the tongue,

48
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,840
 and then when it hits the insect, for a moment, it liquefies, covers the insect completely,

49
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,000
 like it gets around every angle of it, every knock, every cranny, so the insect is completely

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,800
 covered in it, and then it hardens again, and then the frog pulls it back in.

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
 How is that?

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,560
 It evolves over time, I know, but I mean, it's incredible to think of that evolving.

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,200
 And I can't believe that we've never bothered to look into it before.

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
 It's such a common trope.

55
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,640
 The idea of a frog darting out, it's tongue and grabbing an insect, and we've only just bothered

56
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
 to work out how they do it.

57
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,440
 But there's so many things that do that, right?

58
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
 Like, chameleons.

59
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
 Yeah.

60
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
 So there's a lot of animals.

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
 Yeah.

62
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
 So I wonder if they do the same thing.

63
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
 They do it in a slightly different way.

64
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
 Yeah.

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
 They evolve separately.

66
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,480
 I think like Salamanders, they have like a kind of a skeletal bit attached to

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,520
 the tongue, which fires it out, and the frog just kind of drops its jaw really,

68
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,200
 really quickly, and that flicks it out like a flicky thing.

69
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,480
 Because when I was reading the paper, so that's quite a different description to what

70
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,560
 I read about how the tongue is used when it darts out in order to catch prey.

71
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,680
 And they said that effectively what it was doing was it's acting almost like a bungee cord.

72
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,360
 So it's gripping on to the prey and just sucking it back in a very kind of mild manner,

73
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,080
 as opposed to like a whip.

74
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,880
 Like as if you were coming back up on the bungee.

75
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,000
 One of weird bungee jumps, if you don't, where you stand on the ground, and you wait

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,800
 for a bungee rope to pull down and grab you on the way back.

77
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,120
 Even more exciting, you jump off the cliff without a bungee rope, and then it comes down

78
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
 and grabs you.

79
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
 I mean, it pulls you up.

80
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
 That'd be pretty exciting.

81
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
 That'd be amazing.

82
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,960
 Do you know how they found this out?

83
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,240
 The scientist who did this, as a PhD student, called Alexis Noel, and she said, "I actually

84
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,680
 got 15 frogs and scraped their tongues for a couple of hours one night.

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
 It was pretty disgusting."

86
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,800
 And she said, "It takes about half an hour to get a milliliter of frog saliva off their

87
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
 tongue."

88
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,960
 She says, "It's like the world's most precious material because it's so hard to get and you

89
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,840
 get so little of it once you've done that."

90
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,560
 But I don't think that necessarily makes it precious.

91
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,480
 Well, it depends on her time, doesn't it?

92
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,800
 If she charges like $2 million an hour, and it takes her that long, then it is really

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
 precious.

94
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,400
 But if she's, you know, on minimum wage, it's probably not that precious.

95
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,320
 She's probably somewhere in between, isn't she?

96
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,160
 Well she works under Dr David Ho.

97
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,480
 He was the guy who came up with the idea that all animals or all mammals urinate for the

98
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,880
 same amount of time, around 21 seconds.

99
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
 And David Ho.

100
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
 We met David Ho.

101
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,880
 How are we?

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
 Yeah.

103
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
 He's won the Nignal Bell Prize.

104
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
 Yeah.

105
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,360
 We met him at the ignoble show in London.

106
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
 Oh, yes, we did.

107
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
 Yes, we did.

108
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
 Well, we spoke to Martin.

109
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
 He gave us his card.

110
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
 You're right.

111
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
 Is he a doctor?

112
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
 Is he a doctor?

113
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
 He's a doctor, yeah.

114
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
 Nice.

115
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
 Yeah.

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
 That's very cool.

117
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
 Yeah.

118
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,800
 He said of the frog's tongue that it's like a trampoline and a baseball mitt in that

119
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,200
 stretch that catches you and then pulls back.

120
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
 And the bungee cord.

121
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,040
 Yeah, there's a lot of metaphors going on here.

122
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,280
 Well, the other metaphor is on the softness of the tongue.

123
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,120
 They said it's like freshly chewed chewing gum about that same stickiness and kind of softness.

124
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
 Okay.

125
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,400
 And also marshmallow fluff.

126
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,320
 You know, if you get like a t-cake and you get marshmallow on your hands, you just can't

127
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,320
 get it off like that.

128
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,600
 Oh my god, a wonderful marshmallow fluff works like this.

129
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,480
 And actually, if you bashed it really hard, it would suddenly turn to liquid and you

130
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
 could get it off your finger.

131
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,840
 You'd finally be able to catch all those flies you've been looking for.

132
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,280
 Do you know, when the frog gets its tongue back in its mouth as well, it's then it has a problem,

133
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,600
 which is that my saliva is like honey and it's incredibly sticky and I've got the fly

134
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,120
 on my tongue and I can't get it off.

135
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,480
 So do you know what they have to do?

136
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,160
 They have to push their eyeballs down into their head onto their tongue to scrape the

137
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
 fly off their tongue.

138
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,240
 Well, it's not to scrape it because what I think we might have mentioned the eyeballs

139
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,400
 thing before, but I think they just realise why that works because that's the same thing.

140
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,480
 I think the eyeballs bash into it and it's the impacts that turns it into this very, very

141
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
 liquid thing.

142
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
 So what is it?

143
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,360
 It's a non-utonian fluid which I've talked about before.

144
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,720
 So it's like quick sand whereby whenever you agitate it, it changes its disgust.

145
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,680
 But it's like the opposite of custard.

146
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,560
 So it's a non-utonian fluid but it has the opposite effect.

147
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,040
 Catch up is the same as frog saliva.

148
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
 What?

149
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
 What do you mean?

150
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
 The same.

151
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,920
 It's a non-utonian fluid as well, but this way round.

152
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,880
 So that's why if you bash a glass, catch up bottle, then it will suddenly come flowing

153
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,960
 out because if you hit it hard enough, then the viscosity of the liquid suddenly changes.

154
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,480
 I was looking into tongues generally and we don't know how bats drink.

155
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,800
 We're still looking into how bats drink and one of the things that they notice is that

156
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,840
 they use their tongue as a sort of conveyor belt to bring the liquid up.

157
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,160
 What does that mean?

158
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,040
 It means that the tongue sort of...

159
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,960
 Is it on rollers?

160
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,280
 Yeah, and then I see it, yeah.

161
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
 How does that work?

162
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
 I don't know, Dan.

163
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
 I think you don't know how bat tongues work.

164
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,040
 I think you've slightly misunderstood the story.

165
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:13,560
 No, it says scientists use their tongues as a kind of conveyor belt to slurp up nectar.

166
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,160
 I think the key bit there is kind of...

167
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
 Okay.

168
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,240
 Because the amazing thing about it being conveyor belt would be if it woundled the way around

169
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,840
 on its rotor and came back out, which is hard to believe they do.

170
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,120
 Have you heard the myth about dog mouths?

171
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,720
 Is it that they're cleaner than human mouths?

172
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
 Yes.

173
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,720
 Because I had not heard this myth until I was researching this fact.

174
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,480
 But there is a myth that dog mouths are cleaner than human mouths and that it's fine as a result

175
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
 to friend kiss them.

176
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
 It's okay.

177
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,000
 I think what happens is, now, you've read into this, you might know, but I think there

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,160
 might be fewer bacteria, but the point is that they're all bacteria that you don't already

179
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
 have in your mouth.

180
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
 Yes.

181
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,400
 And probably you don't really want in your mouth.

182
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
 Yeah.

183
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,920
 So there was an article on ABC News where they spoke to a vet and said it may be safer

184
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,760
 because lots of the bacteria are species specific.

185
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,960
 So you can't catch the same strep from a dog that you could from a person.

186
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,240
 However, I did read also articles like I almost died after a dog saliva infection.

187
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,840
 So I think it's not recommended.

188
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,440
 Well, especially a rabid dog that can...

189
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
 Oh, yeah.

190
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
 Yeah.

191
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,720
 If you get rabid dog saliva and you've got any kind of cuts in your mouth, then you'll catch

192
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,320
 rabies from that.

193
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,520
 And they used to try to weaponize this.

194
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,000
 So I think Lian, as he called, he's a Roman writer.

195
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,840
 He wrote that if a rabid dog saliva could get into contact with someone, then they would

196
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
 get rabies.

197
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,920
 Leonardo da Vinci thought that this might be a good idea to use in war.

198
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,920
 And there was a Polish general called Kazemir Semenovic who thought that he would get the

199
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:46,320
 slubber from rabid dogs, put them in clay balls and fire them into, like, towns that besieged.

200
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,320
 Is there hope that people will find the clay bottles on the ground and think, what is this?

201
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
 I must put it in my mouth.

202
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,040
 Or is it that they can fire into people's mouths?

203
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,840
 Like, it just seems like such an inefficient distribution message.

204
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,640
 They were firing into towns of toddlers who just picked them all up and tried to eat them.

205
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
 You're right.

206
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,400
 They should put it in, like, an Easter egg or something.

207
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
 Yeah, exactly.

208
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
 Something really crafted like that.

209
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,600
 And then leave a load of Easter eggs outside, saying, sorry about the seeds going on a bit,

210
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
 isn't it?

211
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
 Have some Easter eggs.

212
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,120
 But our official advice is, don't snog your dog, right?

213
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,040
 I think, yeah, that's mine, even if it might be safe, even if you've got a very clean

214
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,040
 dog.

215
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
 Even if it's safe.

216
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
 It's weird.

217
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
 Yeah.

218
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,520
 I have one more thing, which is that grey whales, this is so cool, they use their tongues

219
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,280
 really cleverly to control their heat loss.

220
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,080
 So they've always got mouths full of extremely cold ocean water, right?

221
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,920
 So they might lose a massive amount of heat that way.

222
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,800
 And that would, they might die as a result of, if they had a really warm tongue.

223
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,800
 So what happens is, the arteries that take blood to their tongue, right, are really close

224
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,880
 to the veins carrying blood away from the tongue.

225
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:56,520
 And as the arteries get closer to the tongue, they transfer all the heat over from the artery

226
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,440
 going to the tongue to the vein, heading back from the tongue, right?

227
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
 Right.

228
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,320
 So the blood on its way to the tongue cools down, and the blood on its way back to the heart

229
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
 warms up.

230
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,720
 And it sounds kind of like a, like a conveyor belt.

231
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,400
 It is a lot like a conveyor belt, actually.

232
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,840
 So when it gets to the end of the tongue, or when it gets to the tongue, it's incredibly

233
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
 cold already.

234
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
 This blood.

235
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,960
 So the whale doesn't lose massive amounts of heat because its tongue is constantly in contact

236
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
 with very cold water.

237
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
 And that crafty.

238
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
 Yeah.

239
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,720
 I don't know if it's this whale, but there is some kind of whale that can thermoregulate

240
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
 in that way, but by, it has erectile tissue in its tongue.

241
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,880
 And so it can kind of engorge it with blood in the way that an erection would.

242
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,160
 And so they would kind of, if they need to cool down, they get a massive kind of erection

243
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,040
 in the mouth in the tongue.

244
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
 And that will cool them down.

245
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
 What you laugh about, Andy.

246
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,800
 I'm just remembering a joke, so what's happening?

247
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,320
 Do you want to just know how you can tell if you're an extrovert or an introvert by your

248
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
 saliva?

249
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
 Yeah, sure.

250
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,520
 And if you are constantly leaving it in other people's mouths, you're an extrovert.

251
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,520
 So there's a study that was done, I think, in the '60s, but I think it's been replicated

252
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,880
 that showed that introverts salivate more.

253
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,200
 So when you put drops of lemon on the tongue of people who are introverted by character,

254
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
 they produce more saliva.

255
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,680
 And it kind of makes sense because people who are introverts tend to react more strongly

256
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,680
 to certain kind of stimulation.

257
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,880
 But can make sense if you're constantly slubbering, you don't want to spend a lot of time with

258
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
 me.

259
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,680
 Every time you open your mouth, you spit in someone's face, you start to stop speaking.

260
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,240
 Well, so apparently this works.

261
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,760
 If you're not sure if you're an introvert or an extrovert, there's not the easiest way

262
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,200
 to tell, but you get a cotton bud.

263
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,240
 You tie a little bit of thread to the exact middle so that when you hold it by the thread,

264
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,040
 it hangs horizontally.

265
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,880
 And then you put one end of the tip in your mouth for 20 seconds and take it out.

266
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,160
 And then you put lemon juice on your tongue, and then you put the other end of the tip on

267
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,960
 your mouth for another 20 seconds.

268
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,920
 So you're seeing how much you're salivating in response to the lemon juice.

269
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
 And then you hold it by the thread.

270
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,480
 And if it's hanging horizontally still, it means you haven't salivated much, which means

271
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
 you're an extrovert.

272
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,480
 And if it tilts, it means you've salivated quite a lot.

273
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,920
 So the end one end is heavier now.

274
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,760
 But it's a lot to do to tell you something that presumably you kind of already know.

275
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,920
 If you've got the time to do this, you're an introvert.

276
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:24,040
 OK, there's time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

277
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,800
 My fact is that during the Second World War, Britain invented chocolate bars infused with

278
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,560
 garlic to give to pilots who were shot down and needed to make their breath authentically

279
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
 French.

280
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,080
 So it's the idea that you land in France and you meet someone.

281
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
 Yeah.

282
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,440
 And they say, are you French?

283
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,960
 And you just breathe on them and they go, oh, you must be French then, you're not actually

284
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
 to speak French.

285
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,600
 But I don't ask you why you're wearing an R.A.F uniform or none of this.

286
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,400
 So this gets written about quite a lot.

287
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,600
 I've tried to find concrete evidence of pilots actually being given these bars and using

288
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
 them.

289
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
 And I haven't found much.

290
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,120
 I do know that it was invented as a thing, because it's written about a load of times

291
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,320
 there was a guy called Charles Fraser Smith, who was kind of one of the original inspirations

292
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,440
 of Q in the James Bond films.

293
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,160
 So that's this guy.

294
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,480
 And he did invent these things, as well as loads of other incredible stuff.

295
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
 Yeah.

296
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,600
 But I can't find out whether it was put into operation in the field.

297
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,720
 Why didn't he just give them garlic?

298
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,480
 It's not as though-- well, hey, it's not as though garlic goes especially well with chocolate

299
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
 anyway.

300
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,680
 And R.A.F pilots in World War II would be undergoing a lot of physical trauma and challenges

301
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
 every day.

302
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,440
 I didn't think they're going to have a problem with just easier a couple of cloves of garlic.

303
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,960
 That's not going to be the final straw.

304
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,520
 No, but this guy was James Bond's Q, right?

305
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
 Yeah.

306
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,400
 So Q never just-- there was always a double thing to the invention.

307
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,600
 It's a pen that doubles as a-- so you would be like, it's just garlic.

308
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
 You'd be like, "And?"

309
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,440
 And it doubles as a chocolate bar.

310
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
 That's Q.

311
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,960
 It's not garlic, but doubles as a chocolate bar.

312
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,800
 Well, it's a chocolate bar.

313
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
 Yeah.

314
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
 Garlic flavoured.

315
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
 Yeah.

316
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
 Well, I'm just saying.

317
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,920
 A lot of people that go on missions isn't chocolate a thing, a sustenance.

318
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,800
 So maybe he was trying to double up the sustenance with the-- so again, Q's mind is working

319
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
 there.

320
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
 He's doubling up.

321
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
 Yeah, I'm very good.

322
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
 Back to say about my criticism.

323
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
 It was a great idea.

324
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
 Yeah.

325
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,680
 This was in the news because there was a very recent story, MI6 announced that their current

326
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,480
 Q is a woman, which surprised a lot of people because they thought it was still--

327
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,960
 That's my new talent from the James Bond fans, but no, it is, but he doubles up as a woman.

328
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,560
 Did they tell us who these people are?

329
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
 What's going on?

330
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,120
 I think it's bizarre that you know who the head of MI5 and MI6 is.

331
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,680
 Yeah, I do as well.

332
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
 Really hard.

333
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
 Probably aren't the real ones.

334
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,680
 They can't be, right?

335
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,680
 Like Stella Remington couldn't have been the headhead.

336
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,680
 I think she was.

337
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,120
 I mentioned she was, but on what James is saying, I think that you can't-- there must be someone

338
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
 who is actually a secret head.

339
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,400
 There's going to be someone who, if you ask them, they'll just not be able to say anything.

340
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
 I don't know.

341
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,200
 What if Stella Remington listens to this podcast, and she's sitting at home feeling bad now?

342
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,520
 She's fine.

343
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,760
 She's the fake head of MI6.

344
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,680
 Okay, so I don't think we can say fake on a fake, that's all.

345
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,400
 All I'm saying is, if I was in charge, I would make Stella Remington the fake one and then

346
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
 have a real one.

347
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
 Yes.

348
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,080
 But she'd know at some point that she was the fake one after--

349
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
 She's in on it.

350
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
 Oh, she's in on it.

351
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
 Oh, she's in on it.

352
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,120
 But she doesn't think she's running the show with secretly this.

353
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,480
 Oh, she's in on it.

354
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,480
 She's an actor called Maureen.

355
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
 Maureen Lippman.

356
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
 Yeah.

357
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,040
 I'm not going to recognise her though, they'll say I saw that Stella Remington in a--

358
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
 Oh, the BT ad.

359
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
 Yes.

360
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,880
 She should be looking after the country's safety, not clocking on and doing BT adverts, and then

361
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
 there'd be a scandal.

362
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,880
 I love the BT adverts.

363
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,120
 That's a reference from the early '80s.

364
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,720
 That's the last thing I can remember that piece.

365
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
 Well, she's going to be feeling sad at home because you haven't been keeping up with

366
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,560
 her career.

367
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,440
 So I don't think that you need to be secret unless you're in the field.

368
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,720
 Next thing, another thing, I would assume.

369
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,720
 Well, Stella Remington was the first person that they openly acknowledged as the head.

370
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,160
 So that was a transparency thing that came in with one of the governments who decided

371
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
 transparency was, I think.

372
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
 So they did keep them secret.

373
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,160
 Oh, OK.

374
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,160
 Yeah.

375
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
 That's not always been, though.

376
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,920
 That was the thing that I think we've mentioned on a previous podcast.

377
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,000
 And I don't know.

378
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,880
 I think we almost mentioned it as an urban myth, the idea of the spy who was pregnant and

379
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,200
 they discovered that she was a spy when she was delivering the baby because the pain

380
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,320
 was so great, she started swearing in her own language.

381
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
 Is that a myth?

382
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
 I don't know.

383
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 I don't know.

384
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,920
 I thought you meant that the baby came out and started speaking Russian.

385
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,760
 Ah, that's fity of my life.

386
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
 It's a great myth.

387
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,120
 Or, I mean, if it's true, if it's in bad terms, it might be true.

388
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,800
 Only that I've heard it and I've never personally questioned it, but it might, yeah, it

389
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,440
 does have the width of the myth, doesn't it?

390
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,640
 Do you guys know about Operation Lena?

391
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
 No.

392
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,640
 This was a German operation.

393
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,280
 This was in 1940 and it was when 12 Germans spies were sent to Britain as to, like, do a bit

394
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,640
 of a wrecky to plan Hitler's follow-up operation, which is going to be Operation Sealine, which

395
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,600
 is going to be the invasion of Britain.

396
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,720
 And so they were trained up as to how to appear British, apparently trained up to blend

397
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
 right in.

398
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,520
 And they were caught straight away because of their own stupidity, was what the British

399
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,600
 officials said.

400
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,360
 One of them went into a pub and ordered a pint of cider at 10 in the morning and, which is

401
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,360
 a weird thing to do in any situation.

402
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,160
 I can't think of anything more British.

403
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
 No, you go to Gawick and Heathrow Airport.

404
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,440
 Well, you'll see a lot of German spies there.

405
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440

00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

681
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

682
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

683
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

684
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

685
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

686
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

687
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

688
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

689
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

690
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

691
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

692
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

693
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

694
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

695
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

696
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

697
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

698
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

699
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

700
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

701
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

702
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

703
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

704
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

705
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

706
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

707
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

708
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

709
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

710
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

711
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

712
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

713
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
 I didn't know until I read this.

714
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,920
 So the producer of King Kong had read the story of W. Douglas Bowden.

715
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,920
 And W. Douglas Bowden had gone over and he was the first person to probably film Komodo Dragons,

716
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,920
 bring back a few live Komodo dragons as well as samples of dead ones

717
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
 that they'd shot while they were out there.

718
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,920
 And he went out with his wife and he had basically the scenes that you see in King Kong

719
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,920
 where they go to Skull Island to begin with is the kind of same setup of what they had.

720
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,920
 Wait, did he tie his wife to a tree to draw Komodo Dragon?

721
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,920
 No, but she almost got killed by Komodo Dragon while she was out there.

722
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,920
 Yeah, she went out without her gun one day and she was walking past a carcass

723
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,920
 that was laid out for Komodo Dragon that they were hoping to attract.

724
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
 And one was coming.

725
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,920
 So suddenly she was between the carcass and the Komodo Dragon.

726
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,920
 And she laid down in the tall grass and really hoped that it hadn't seen her.

727
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,920
 But she also suspected that it had and smelt her.

728
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,920
 And so she accepted her death and just laid that because she knew it was that close.

729
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:03,920
 And five feet away, the Komodo Dragon as it was coming towards her was shot by one of the assistance of burden.

730
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
 So she survived.

731
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,920
 She didn't deserve to survive.

732
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
 Who just lies down and takes it.

733
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
 At least try and make a run for it.

734
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
 Well, she just knew there was no way.

735
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,920
 Well, there is a way.

736
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,920
 There are only slightly faster than climb a tree.

737
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
 Well, they've just discovered them.

738
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
 They don't know what their abilities are.

739
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
 This is like a dinosaur.

740
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
 And what kind of survival instinct is that?

741
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
 So she just said, I'm dead.

742
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
 She'd rather go to have me.

743
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,920
 I've got a complete idiot.

744
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,920
 That would work against some animals, though, wouldn't it?

745
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
 They're playing dead.

746
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
 Yeah. It's a big risk.

747
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
 It's a big risk.

748
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,920
 Brown bears and black bears, there's a different one of them.

749
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
 I think brown bears, nothing works.

750
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
 Because they're faster.

751
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
 They can climb trees and they can just.

752
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:44,920
 And then with black bears, I think you're supposed to kind of take your clothes off and slowly walk away from them

753
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,920
 so that they get confused about what your clothes are.

754
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,920
 You're just trying to make me have an embarrassing bear.

755
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,920
 [LAUGHTER]

756
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
 Noted pervert, hunter hunter Murray,

757
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
 was found naked and mortal.

758
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,920
 [LAUGHTER]

759
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
 Back on the way, they taste things.

760
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,920
 So they have this fork tongue and they stick it out and it gets like all the chemicals and the information from the air.

761
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,920
 And then they retract it into their mouth and they rub it into pads on the bottom of their mouth.

762
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,920
 And then they have to close their mouth and the pads on the bottom of their mouth touch the top of their mouth.

763
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
 And that contains an organ that gives it to their brain.

764
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,920
 So every time they want to taste something, you get it on your tongue, put it on the bottom of your mouth,

765
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
 close your mouth, put it on the top of your mouth.

766
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
 It just seems like a real dilemma.

767
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
 That does.

768
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,920
 That does.

769
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,920
 But that does seem like a connoisseur as well.

770
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
 It does, doesn't it?

771
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
 Like what a professional.

772
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,920
 It feels like someone's really tasting their food.

773
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,920
 So in your mythical commuter dragon restaurant, there'll be a lot of consideration going on.

774
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,920
 And getting notes of carcass, but also excrement.

775
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
 [LAUGHTER]

776
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,920
 Maybe that's why she laid still as well.

777
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,920
 She thought, I mean, how often do you change your mind about the restaurant you're going to as soon as you get up to it

778
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
 and see a better one next door?

779
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
 Yes.

780
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
 She knew she was bad tasting.

781
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
 Yeah, exactly.

782
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
 Two and a half miles away.

783
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
 This commuter dragon made a booking.

784
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
 Yeah.

785
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
 He was on his way.

786
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,920
 Are we sure she wasn't lying still covering herself in feces?

787
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
 She probably was.

788
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,920
 [LAUGHTER]

789
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
 So there is a thing.

790
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,920
 Their metabolism is a really slow reptiles, as we know, because they're, as we say, cold-blooded.

791
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,920
 But their muscles can stay working for hours after death.

792
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,920
 So there was an Atlantic article all about the process of dissecting a commuter dragon,

793
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
 which is very hard.

794
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,920
 Very low to the nose of knives, because their skin is so tough.

795
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
 Really?

796
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,920
 Yeah. And one of the students who was doing it, called Viv Allen,

797
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,920
 said that she'd been studying an alligator, which would be shot, had a massive hole in his head.

798
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,920
 And she stuck a knife into the alligator, and it walked off the table.

799
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
 [LAUGHTER]

800
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,920
 And they freaked out, obviously, because it was dead.

801
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,920
 But their metabolism is so slow that their muscles can stay working for hours.

802
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,920
 And if you hit the right nerve center, you can trigger lots of muscular contractions.

803
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,920
 And she said, we freaked out. It just wouldn't stop moving.

804
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,920
 We cut its head off just to make sure.

805
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,920
 And then one of the undergrads was sick in it.

806
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,920
 Oh, cut.

807
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
 Wow.

808
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
 I know.

809
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:59,920
 Just quickly on reptiles surviving after they've been killed, a snake remains completely alive after you decapitate it.

810
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,920
 Not just muscle, not just muscles, like spasming or anything.

811
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,920
 A snake's head is totally alive for about an hour.

812
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,920
 And after a full hour, it can see you and decide it's pissed off with you,

813
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,920
 because you've cut its head from its body, and head it, so I don't know how it heads over to you.

814
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,920
 But crawl its way over to you on its head and bite you.

815
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
 That's amazing.

816
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,920
 It's because they've got these ridiculously slow metabolism.

817
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
 That's hilarious.

818
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
 That's amazing.

819
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
 So creepy.

820
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,920
 It must be weird if they actually say, like, chase a mouse and they catch it and they eat it,

821
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
 but it just walks through.

822
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
 [LAUGHTER]

823
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,920
 OK, it is time to move on to our final fact of the show, and that is James.

824
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,920
 OK, my fact this week is that you can improve your darts game by training yourself to dream about darts.

825
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,920
 But it's not worth it, because you have to dream about darts all the time.

826
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
 Well, you know, there are worse dreams.

827
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,920
 It's not a nightmare at least.

828
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
 What depends on the game?

829
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
 The dartboard is chasing you. It's a nightmare.

830
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
 [LAUGHTER]

831
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,920
 And it's trying to throw darts into your body and say, see how you like it.

832
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,920
 I don't think that would improve your game if that's the way you dream about it.

833
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
 [LAUGHTER]

834
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,920
 Now, the way that this works, it was a study which they did on lucid dreamers.

835
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,920
 And these are people who can kind of decide what they're going to dream about.

836
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,920
 And it's the thing you can train yourself to do.

837
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,920
 You go to sleep, and then you realize you're asleep, and you can say, OK, now I'm going to chase dragons,

838
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,920
 because I know I'm asleep, whereas most people just dream passively.

839
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,920
 Anyway, they got these people who could lucid dream to practice darts,

840
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,920
 and they tested them afterwards, and the ones who did it were better at darts,

841
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,920
 and the ones who didn't do it were worse at darts.

842
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,920
 That's how you go.

843
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,920
 Although they did specify that if people, the third group that practice darts in their waking life

844
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,920
 were even better than the ones who practiced it in their sleep.

845
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
 Sure.

846
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,920
 But I imagine if you practice in your waking life and practice while you're asleep,

847
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
 you're going to be even better.

848
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,920
 So it sounds like this is quite early research, like the controversial as well.

849
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,920
 A lot of people aren't sure whether or not it does actually improve.

850
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,920
 It's just a small pool of stuff.

851
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
 Oh, it's a small study, yeah.

852
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,920
 Yeah.

853
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
 But the thing is, it definitely does work.

854
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,920
 I don't want to say definitely just in case, but it does appear to work,

855
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,920
 is kind of in sport, just imagining that you're going to do something,

856
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,920
 and that really helps your body to prepare for muscle memory and things like that.

857
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
 I can absolutely believe it.

858
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
 Haven't there been studies on people with their arms and casts

859
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,920
 who've been asked to visualise themselves doing exercises with that arm?

860
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
 Yes.

861
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,920
 And it's been, their arm has become stronger than if they were,

862
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,920
 than if they were not doing those visualisations.

863
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
 Oh, wow.

864
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
 Yeah, it absolutely.

865
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,920
 So that is, I mean, dreaming doesn't sound very far from that at all.

866
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
 I believe it.

867
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,920
 There was one thing about this study as well with the lucid dreamers about darts,

868
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
 dreams being what they are.

869
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,920
 Sometimes they weren't exactly the same as a darts game.

870
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,920
 So one of the people was throwing a dartboard that was actually looked exactly like a tree stump,

871
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
 but that still helped them to get better.

872
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
 Oh, sure.

873
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
 So is it wood in the real world, I guess?

874
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
 Yeah.

875
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,920
 It's like, you find out the dartboard is your mum, that's different.

876
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,920
 No, but I think the idea is, even if a dartboard turns into your mum

877
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,920
 and you turn out to be naked and you're flying over Australia,

878
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,920
 then you're still going to be better because you practice the darts bit.

879
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,920
 Imagine if you got to the competition, you needed those exact conditions.

880
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,920
 I'm Phil Taylor, the darts player.

881
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
 Yeah.

882
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
 He dreams about darts.

883
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,920
 So sometimes I'm playing darts in my sleep and I wake myself up.

884
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
 I hate it.

885
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,920
 Drives me crackers because if I have a catnet, I'm dreaming about bloody darts.

886
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,920
 Yeah.

887
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,920
 So he is the best darts player of all time.

888
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
 Right.

889
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,920
 And he probably plays darts all the time in his normal life

890
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920
 because otherwise how would he get so good?

891
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
 Yeah.

892
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,920
 And he's probably just dreaming because you often dream about what you're doing.

893
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,920
 Yeah.

894
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
 You love them.

895
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
 Actually, he's deliberately doing its practice.

896
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,920
 Like if you play a computer game and when you close your eyes at night,

897
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
 you can see images from the computer game.

898
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
 Yeah, the Tetris effect.

899
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,920
 Yeah, I used to get that all the time, but I used to play a lot of computer games.

900
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,920
 Supposedly when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip went on a tour of Australia

901
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,920
 and they did something like 56 towns in 57 days.

902
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,920
 So it was a megator. Philip at that point was dreaming of just waving in his dreams.

903
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,920
 Yeah, I don't know if that's a proper fact.

904
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,920
 It's in the crown, but I assume they pulled that from a book somewhere.

905
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
 Wow.

906
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,920
 You love the crown so much.

907
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
 I can't believe it's taken you so long to crowbar it into this.

908
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
 I know.

909
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
 What is the crown?

910
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
 Is it a film?

911
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
 It's a Netflix.

912
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,920
 It's written by Peter Morgan who wrote the Queen.

913
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
 Right.

914
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,920
 So he's very factual in his writing.

915
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,920
 And yeah, neither of those stories mentions that they're all lizards.

916
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
 Weirdly.

917
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:27,920
 Have you ever seen the Queen try and catch a fly with her marshmallow-like tongue?

918
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
 Like Ozzie LB8.

919
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
 I know.

920
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,920
 And I've sent all those emails about the honours committee to my management.

921
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
 Incredible.

922
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
 I'm filled the power.

923
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,920
 So the nickname the power.

924
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,920
 I went on to Wikipedia and saw a big list of all because they've all got sort of WWF nicknames

925
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
 that they bring to the sport.

926
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,920
 But what's really exciting is there's a lot of puns.

927
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,920
 So Antonio Alcinas.

928
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
 He's Spanish.

929
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,920
 So what do you reckon his is?

930
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
 Antonio Alcinas.

931
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
 I don't know.

932
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
 El d'Artador.

933
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
 So that's it.

934
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
 El d'Artador.

935
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
 Jamie Harvey.

936
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
 He's from Scotland.

937
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
 What's his pun?

938
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
 Tossing the dart.

939
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,920
 No, Scotland.

940
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
 Like Scotland the brave.

941
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
 Some pun on this.

942
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,920
 Brave dart.

943
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,920
 Oh.

944
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,920
 Mark Frost.

945
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
 Where's he from?

946
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,920
 Is he from Dartford?

947
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,920
 Because otherwise I reckon we're going to struggle with someone from Dartford.

948
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,920
 Could anybody be beaten by someone from Dartmore?

949
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:30,920
 So the earliest form of darts, do you know why it was banned?

950
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
 Why?

951
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,920
 Do you know that it was banned?

952
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,920
 It was because people kept on dying.

953
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,920
 It's the earliest form of darts wall.

954
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
 Yes.

955
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,920
 No, it was called Puff and Dart and it involved a blowpipe.

956
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,920
 And you go, you know, you would blow the dart towards the board.

957
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,920
 And eventually, I mean, people kept on swallowing them by mistake.

958
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,920
 And they could be--

959
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
 Shucking instead of blowing.

960
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
 Yeah.

961
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
 They could be quite small.

962
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,920
 And so eventually they thought, why don't we just get rid of the blowpipe element of the darts game?

963
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,920
 Did you see read about that man last year or the year before last, who inhaled a dart?

964
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,920
 But he inhaled a rubber dart 44 years ago.

965
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,920
 And his parents took him to Annie and said, we think our sons inhaled a dart.

966
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,920
 And they said, there's not really a dart in there, go away.

967
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
 And then he didn't know about this.

968
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,920
 And he's always had sinus problems.

969
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,920
 And he sneezed.

970
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
 This is in 2015.

971
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
 He sneezed.

972
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,920
 Please tell me you was standing right next to the dart bottle.

973
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,920
 [LAUGHTER]

974
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,920
 And he took him 5,000 pounds for prize money and the rubber dart.

975
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,920
 So he sneezed and the rubber dart came out.

976
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,920
 And it had been sitting in his nose for the last 44 years.

977
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
 That is unbelievable.

978
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,920
 James, you know darts terminology because you're a fan of the sport.

979
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
 Sure.

980
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,920
 Have you heard of the phrase, wankers 50?

981
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,920
 [LAUGHTER]

982
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
 I haven't.

983
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
 No, what is a wankers 50?

984
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,920
 It's-- I don't know if this is common or rare.

985
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
 It doesn't seem common.

986
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,920
 It's where you're aiming for a bullseye, which is 50.

987
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
 Oh, yeah.

988
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,920
 But you hit single 20, single 18, and single 12 instead.

989
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
 OK.

990
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,920
 So you do score 50, but you use three darts.

991
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,920
 OK, have you heard of bagadix, which is B-A-G-A-D-I-X?

992
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,920
 Oh, it's not an acronym.

993
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
 No.

994
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
 Oh.

995
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,920
 What would begin with X in that acronym?

996
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
 [LAUGHTER]

997
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,920
 It's rhyming slang.

998
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
 It's not an acronym.

999
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
 OK.

1000
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
 It's rhyming slang for 26.

1001
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,920
 Oh, because if you're aiming for the treble 20,

1002
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,920
 you miss it on one side and get one, and on the other side you get five.

1003
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
 Exactly.

1004
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,920
 And I call that B and B, but I don't know why we call it that.

1005
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,920
 B and B is 2 and 6, and 2 and 6 is how much a bed and breakfast used to cost in the UK,

1006
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,920
 in two shillings and six months, in pre-decentralisation characters.

1007
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,920
 So what's bagadix?

1008
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,920
 26.

1009
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,920
 You know that as in, I don't know.

1010
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,920
 Should in that, like most rhyming slang has a meaning to a thing it's wrong to.

1011
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,920
 You know a bag.

1012
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,920
 Yeah.

1013
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,920
 So if you put some dicks in a bag.

1014
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,920
 OK.

1015
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
 See?

1016
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,920
 I don't know that it is that.

1017
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
 It sounds more like a bingo call, doesn't it?

1018
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,920
 Yeah.

1019
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,920
 Bagadix.

1020
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
 26.

1021
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,920
 [LAUGHTER]

1022
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,920
 This children do listen to this show.
