00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.680
 How are you doing?

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.880
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.600
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.840
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.200
 I'm Anna Chazinski and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.520
 favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.760
 Starting with you, Anna Chazinski.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.280
 My fact this week is that a frog's tongue is 10 times softer than a human's tongue.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 I've thought we had soft tongues already.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.280
 And yet?

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.120
 You've been very lucky in your love life.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.520
 Does this mean that French kissing a frog will be unbelievably good?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.520
 Or unbelievably bad?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.440
 Yeah, because you don't want too much give, do you?

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.440
 I don't know.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.400
 It really depends on your personal taste but it doesn't use it for kissing.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.040
 When the princess kisses the frog in the story, does she French kiss it and if so does

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.160
 she notice that it's tongue is unbelievably soft?

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.920
 That was probably in the original draft after that she kissed.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.920
 She went, "What the fuck is that?"

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.840
 Actually, I do remember that in one of the really early versions of that, like in the old

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.440
 French versions of that thing, I think she has sex with the frog to turn him into a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.440
 prince, I think so.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.640
 But unfortunately, who finds the frog's penis is 10 times softer than a human's finger.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.160
 So 10 times softer, that's pretty chilly, right?

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.160
 It's soft.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's soft.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.240
 It's because it's so that they can catch their prey effectively.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.720
 So if we start our tongue out and bash it into a fly, then we'd bash the fly away from

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.720
 us.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.560
 But a frog's tongue is soft enough that if it bashes its tongue into a fly, it sort of moulds

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.240
 into the various crevices of the cricket or whatever it is.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.840
 And then it can retract and pull it back in.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.440
 And it does this by having an extremely soft tongue.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.120
 And it also does it by having this incredible saliva.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.560
 So frog saliva is 50,000 times more viscous, so 50,000 times stickier than ours.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.040
 So that means if you do French kiss a frog, it's going to be hard to get away.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.040
 Wow.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040
 Yeah, that's true.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.680
 So if a frog was looking stamps to put on, that would be really soddly stuck on, right?

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.680
 Yeah.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.440
 And so in the early days of the post office, then every letter came with a frog attached.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.280
 They employed them at first.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.280
 It's incredible.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.040
 But the thing is that it changes, doesn't it?

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.040
 Yes.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.920
 So it starts off like, so it incredibly thick, honey, and then when it's on the tongue,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.840
 and then when it hits the insect, for a moment, it liquefies, covers the insect completely,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.000
 like it gets around every angle of it, every knock, every cranny, so the insect is completely

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.800
 covered in it, and then it hardens again, and then the frog pulls it back in.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800
 How is that?

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.560
 It evolves over time, I know, but I mean, it's incredible to think of that evolving.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.200
 And I can't believe that we've never bothered to look into it before.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200
 It's such a common trope.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.640
 The idea of a frog darting out, it's tongue and grabbing an insect, and we've only just bothered

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.640
 to work out how they do it.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.440
 But there's so many things that do that, right?

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.440
 Like, chameleons.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.440
 Yeah.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.440
 So there's a lot of animals.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.440
 Yeah.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.440
 So I wonder if they do the same thing.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.440
 They do it in a slightly different way.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.440
 Yeah.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.440
 They evolve separately.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.480
 I think like Salamanders, they have like a kind of a skeletal bit attached to

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.520
 the tongue, which fires it out, and the frog just kind of drops its jaw really,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.200
 really quickly, and that flicks it out like a flicky thing.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.480
 Because when I was reading the paper, so that's quite a different description to what

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.560
 I read about how the tongue is used when it darts out in order to catch prey.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.680
 And they said that effectively what it was doing was it's acting almost like a bungee cord.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.360
 So it's gripping on to the prey and just sucking it back in a very kind of mild manner,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.080
 as opposed to like a whip.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.880
 Like as if you were coming back up on the bungee.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.000
 One of weird bungee jumps, if you don't, where you stand on the ground, and you wait

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.800
 for a bungee rope to pull down and grab you on the way back.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.120
 Even more exciting, you jump off the cliff without a bungee rope, and then it comes down

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.120
 and grabs you.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.120
 I mean, it pulls you up.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.120
 That'd be pretty exciting.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.120
 That'd be amazing.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.960
 Do you know how they found this out?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.240
 The scientist who did this, as a PhD student, called Alexis Noel, and she said, "I actually

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.680
 got 15 frogs and scraped their tongues for a couple of hours one night.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.680
 It was pretty disgusting."

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.800
 And she said, "It takes about half an hour to get a milliliter of frog saliva off their

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.800
 tongue."

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.960
 She says, "It's like the world's most precious material because it's so hard to get and you

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.840
 get so little of it once you've done that."

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.560
 But I don't think that necessarily makes it precious.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.480
 Well, it depends on her time, doesn't it?

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.800
 If she charges like $2 million an hour, and it takes her that long, then it is really

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.800
 precious.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.400
 But if she's, you know, on minimum wage, it's probably not that precious.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.320
 She's probably somewhere in between, isn't she?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.160
 Well she works under Dr David Ho.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.480
 He was the guy who came up with the idea that all animals or all mammals urinate for the

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.880
 same amount of time, around 21 seconds.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.880
 And David Ho.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.880
 We met David Ho.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.880
 How are we?

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.880
 Yeah.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.880
 He's won the Nignal Bell Prize.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.880
 Yeah.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.360
 We met him at the ignoble show in London.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.360
 Oh, yes, we did.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.360
 Yes, we did.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.360
 Well, we spoke to Martin.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.360
 He gave us his card.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.360
 You're right.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.360
 Is he a doctor?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.360
 Is he a doctor?

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.360
 He's a doctor, yeah.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.360
 Nice.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.360
 Yeah.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.360
 That's very cool.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.360
 Yeah.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.800
 He said of the frog's tongue that it's like a trampoline and a baseball mitt in that

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.200
 stretch that catches you and then pulls back.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.200
 And the bungee cord.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.040
 Yeah, there's a lot of metaphors going on here.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.280
 Well, the other metaphor is on the softness of the tongue.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.120
 They said it's like freshly chewed chewing gum about that same stickiness and kind of softness.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.120
 Okay.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.400
 And also marshmallow fluff.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.320
 You know, if you get like a t-cake and you get marshmallow on your hands, you just can't

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.320
 get it off like that.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.600
 Oh my god, a wonderful marshmallow fluff works like this.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.480
 And actually, if you bashed it really hard, it would suddenly turn to liquid and you

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480
 could get it off your finger.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.840
 You'd finally be able to catch all those flies you've been looking for.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.280
 Do you know, when the frog gets its tongue back in its mouth as well, it's then it has a problem,

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.600
 which is that my saliva is like honey and it's incredibly sticky and I've got the fly

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.120
 on my tongue and I can't get it off.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.480
 So do you know what they have to do?

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.160
 They have to push their eyeballs down into their head onto their tongue to scrape the

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.160
 fly off their tongue.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.240
 Well, it's not to scrape it because what I think we might have mentioned the eyeballs

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.400
 thing before, but I think they just realise why that works because that's the same thing.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.480
 I think the eyeballs bash into it and it's the impacts that turns it into this very, very

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.480
 liquid thing.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.480
 So what is it?

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.360
 It's a non-utonian fluid which I've talked about before.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.720
 So it's like quick sand whereby whenever you agitate it, it changes its disgust.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.680
 But it's like the opposite of custard.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.560
 So it's a non-utonian fluid but it has the opposite effect.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.040
 Catch up is the same as frog saliva.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040
 What?

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.040
 What do you mean?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.040
 The same.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.920
 It's a non-utonian fluid as well, but this way round.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.880
 So that's why if you bash a glass, catch up bottle, then it will suddenly come flowing

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.960
 out because if you hit it hard enough, then the viscosity of the liquid suddenly changes.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.480
 I was looking into tongues generally and we don't know how bats drink.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.800
 We're still looking into how bats drink and one of the things that they notice is that

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.840
 they use their tongue as a sort of conveyor belt to bring the liquid up.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.160
 What does that mean?

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.040
 It means that the tongue sort of...

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.960
 Is it on rollers?

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.280
 Yeah, and then I see it, yeah.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.280
 How does that work?

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.280
 I don't know, Dan.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.280
 I think you don't know how bat tongues work.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.040
 I think you've slightly misunderstood the story.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:13.560
 No, it says scientists use their tongues as a kind of conveyor belt to slurp up nectar.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.160
 I think the key bit there is kind of...

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160
 Okay.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.240
 Because the amazing thing about it being conveyor belt would be if it woundled the way around

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.840
 on its rotor and came back out, which is hard to believe they do.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.120
 Have you heard the myth about dog mouths?

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.720
 Is it that they're cleaner than human mouths?

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.720
 Yes.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.720
 Because I had not heard this myth until I was researching this fact.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.480
 But there is a myth that dog mouths are cleaner than human mouths and that it's fine as a result

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480
 to friend kiss them.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.480
 It's okay.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.000
 I think what happens is, now, you've read into this, you might know, but I think there

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.160
 might be fewer bacteria, but the point is that they're all bacteria that you don't already

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.160
 have in your mouth.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.160
 Yes.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.400
 And probably you don't really want in your mouth.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.400
 Yeah.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.920
 So there was an article on ABC News where they spoke to a vet and said it may be safer

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.760
 because lots of the bacteria are species specific.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.960
 So you can't catch the same strep from a dog that you could from a person.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.240
 However, I did read also articles like I almost died after a dog saliva infection.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.840
 So I think it's not recommended.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.440
 Well, especially a rabid dog that can...

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440
 Yeah.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.720
 If you get rabid dog saliva and you've got any kind of cuts in your mouth, then you'll catch

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.320
 rabies from that.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.520
 And they used to try to weaponize this.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:25.000
 So I think Lian, as he called, he's a Roman writer.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.840
 He wrote that if a rabid dog saliva could get into contact with someone, then they would

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.840
 get rabies.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.920
 Leonardo da Vinci thought that this might be a good idea to use in war.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.920
 And there was a Polish general called Kazemir Semenovic who thought that he would get the

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.320
 slubber from rabid dogs, put them in clay balls and fire them into, like, towns that besieged.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.320
 Is there hope that people will find the clay bottles on the ground and think, what is this?

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.320
 I must put it in my mouth.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.040
 Or is it that they can fire into people's mouths?

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.840
 Like, it just seems like such an inefficient distribution message.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.640
 They were firing into towns of toddlers who just picked them all up and tried to eat them.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.640
 You're right.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.400
 They should put it in, like, an Easter egg or something.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.400
 Something really crafted like that.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.600
 And then leave a load of Easter eggs outside, saying, sorry about the seeds going on a bit,

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.600
 isn't it?

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.600
 Have some Easter eggs.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.120
 But our official advice is, don't snog your dog, right?

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.040
 I think, yeah, that's mine, even if it might be safe, even if you've got a very clean

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.040
 dog.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.040
 Even if it's safe.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.040
 It's weird.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.040
 Yeah.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.520
 I have one more thing, which is that grey whales, this is so cool, they use their tongues

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.280
 really cleverly to control their heat loss.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.080
 So they've always got mouths full of extremely cold ocean water, right?

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.920
 So they might lose a massive amount of heat that way.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.800
 And that would, they might die as a result of, if they had a really warm tongue.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.800
 So what happens is, the arteries that take blood to their tongue, right, are really close

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.880
 to the veins carrying blood away from the tongue.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:56.520
 And as the arteries get closer to the tongue, they transfer all the heat over from the artery

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.440
 going to the tongue to the vein, heading back from the tongue, right?

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.440
 Right.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.320
 So the blood on its way to the tongue cools down, and the blood on its way back to the heart

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.320
 warms up.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.720
 And it sounds kind of like a, like a conveyor belt.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.400
 It is a lot like a conveyor belt, actually.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.840
 So when it gets to the end of the tongue, or when it gets to the tongue, it's incredibly

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.840
 cold already.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.840
 This blood.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.960
 So the whale doesn't lose massive amounts of heat because its tongue is constantly in contact

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.960
 with very cold water.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.960
 And that crafty.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.960
 Yeah.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.720
 I don't know if it's this whale, but there is some kind of whale that can thermoregulate

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.720
 in that way, but by, it has erectile tissue in its tongue.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.880
 And so it can kind of engorge it with blood in the way that an erection would.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.160
 And so they would kind of, if they need to cool down, they get a massive kind of erection

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.040
 in the mouth in the tongue.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.040
 And that will cool them down.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.040
 What you laugh about, Andy.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.800
 I'm just remembering a joke, so what's happening?

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.320
 Do you want to just know how you can tell if you're an extrovert or an introvert by your

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.320
 saliva?

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.320
 Yeah, sure.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:58.520
 And if you are constantly leaving it in other people's mouths, you're an extrovert.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.520
 So there's a study that was done, I think, in the '60s, but I think it's been replicated

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.880
 that showed that introverts salivate more.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:09.200
 So when you put drops of lemon on the tongue of people who are introverted by character,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.200
 they produce more saliva.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.680
 And it kind of makes sense because people who are introverts tend to react more strongly

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.680
 to certain kind of stimulation.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.880
 But can make sense if you're constantly slubbering, you don't want to spend a lot of time with

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.880
 me.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.680
 Every time you open your mouth, you spit in someone's face, you start to stop speaking.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.240
 Well, so apparently this works.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.760
 If you're not sure if you're an introvert or an extrovert, there's not the easiest way

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.200
 to tell, but you get a cotton bud.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.240
 You tie a little bit of thread to the exact middle so that when you hold it by the thread,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.040
 it hangs horizontally.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.880
 And then you put one end of the tip in your mouth for 20 seconds and take it out.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.160
 And then you put lemon juice on your tongue, and then you put the other end of the tip on

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.960
 your mouth for another 20 seconds.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.920
 So you're seeing how much you're salivating in response to the lemon juice.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.920
 And then you hold it by the thread.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.480
 And if it's hanging horizontally still, it means you haven't salivated much, which means

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.480
 you're an extrovert.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.480
 And if it tilts, it means you've salivated quite a lot.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.920
 So the end one end is heavier now.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.760
 But it's a lot to do to tell you something that presumably you kind of already know.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.920
 If you've got the time to do this, you're an introvert.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:24.040
 OK, there's time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.800
 My fact is that during the Second World War, Britain invented chocolate bars infused with

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.560
 garlic to give to pilots who were shot down and needed to make their breath authentically

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.560
 French.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.080
 So it's the idea that you land in France and you meet someone.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.080
 Yeah.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.440
 And they say, are you French?

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.960
 And you just breathe on them and they go, oh, you must be French then, you're not actually

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960
 to speak French.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.600
 But I don't ask you why you're wearing an R.A.F uniform or none of this.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.400
 So this gets written about quite a lot.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.600
 I've tried to find concrete evidence of pilots actually being given these bars and using

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.600
 them.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.600
 And I haven't found much.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.120
 I do know that it was invented as a thing, because it's written about a load of times

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:09.320
 there was a guy called Charles Fraser Smith, who was kind of one of the original inspirations

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.440
 of Q in the James Bond films.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.160
 So that's this guy.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.480
 And he did invent these things, as well as loads of other incredible stuff.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.480
 Yeah.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.600
 But I can't find out whether it was put into operation in the field.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.720
 Why didn't he just give them garlic?

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.480
 It's not as though-- well, hey, it's not as though garlic goes especially well with chocolate

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.480
 anyway.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:32.680
 And R.A.F pilots in World War II would be undergoing a lot of physical trauma and challenges

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.680
 every day.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.440
 I didn't think they're going to have a problem with just easier a couple of cloves of garlic.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.960
 That's not going to be the final straw.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.520
 No, but this guy was James Bond's Q, right?

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.520
 Yeah.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.400
 So Q never just-- there was always a double thing to the invention.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.600
 It's a pen that doubles as a-- so you would be like, it's just garlic.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.600
 You'd be like, "And?"

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.440
 And it doubles as a chocolate bar.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.440
 That's Q.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.960
 It's not garlic, but doubles as a chocolate bar.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.800
 Well, it's a chocolate bar.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.800
 Yeah.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800
 Garlic flavoured.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.800
 Yeah.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.800
 Well, I'm just saying.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.920
 A lot of people that go on missions isn't chocolate a thing, a sustenance.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.800
 So maybe he was trying to double up the sustenance with the-- so again, Q's mind is working

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800
 there.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.800
 He's doubling up.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800
 Yeah, I'm very good.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.800
 Back to say about my criticism.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.800
 It was a great idea.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.800
 Yeah.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.680
 This was in the news because there was a very recent story, MI6 announced that their current

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.480
 Q is a woman, which surprised a lot of people because they thought it was still--

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.960
 That's my new talent from the James Bond fans, but no, it is, but he doubles up as a woman.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.560
 Did they tell us who these people are?

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.560
 What's going on?

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.120
 I think it's bizarre that you know who the head of MI5 and MI6 is.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.680
 Yeah, I do as well.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.680
 Really hard.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.680
 Probably aren't the real ones.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.680
 They can't be, right?

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.680
 Like Stella Remington couldn't have been the headhead.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.680
 I think she was.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.120
 I mentioned she was, but on what James is saying, I think that you can't-- there must be someone

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.120
 who is actually a secret head.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:55.400
 There's going to be someone who, if you ask them, they'll just not be able to say anything.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.400
 I don't know.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.200
 What if Stella Remington listens to this podcast, and she's sitting at home feeling bad now?

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.520
 She's fine.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.760
 She's the fake head of MI6.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.680
 Okay, so I don't think we can say fake on a fake, that's all.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.400
 All I'm saying is, if I was in charge, I would make Stella Remington the fake one and then

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.400
 have a real one.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.400
 Yes.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.080
 But she'd know at some point that she was the fake one after--

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.080
 She's in on it.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.080
 Oh, she's in on it.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.080
 Oh, she's in on it.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.120
 But she doesn't think she's running the show with secretly this.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.480
 Oh, she's in on it.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.480
 She's an actor called Maureen.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.480
 Maureen Lippman.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.480
 Yeah.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.040
 I'm not going to recognise her though, they'll say I saw that Stella Remington in a--

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.040
 Oh, the BT ad.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.040
 Yes.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.880
 She should be looking after the country's safety, not clocking on and doing BT adverts, and then

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.880
 there'd be a scandal.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.880
 I love the BT adverts.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.120
 That's a reference from the early '80s.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.720
 That's the last thing I can remember that piece.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.560
 Well, she's going to be feeling sad at home because you haven't been keeping up with

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.560
 her career.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:58.440
 So I don't think that you need to be secret unless you're in the field.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.720
 Next thing, another thing, I would assume.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.720
 Well, Stella Remington was the first person that they openly acknowledged as the head.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.160
 So that was a transparency thing that came in with one of the governments who decided

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.160
 transparency was, I think.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.160
 So they did keep them secret.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.160
 Oh, OK.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.160
 Yeah.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.160
 That's not always been, though.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.920
 That was the thing that I think we've mentioned on a previous podcast.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.000
 And I don't know.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.880
 I think we almost mentioned it as an urban myth, the idea of the spy who was pregnant and

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.200
 they discovered that she was a spy when she was delivering the baby because the pain

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.320
 was so great, she started swearing in her own language.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.320
 Is that a myth?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.320
 I don't know.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.320
 I don't know.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.920
 I thought you meant that the baby came out and started speaking Russian.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.760
 Ah, that's fity of my life.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.760
 It's a great myth.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.120
 Or, I mean, if it's true, if it's in bad terms, it might be true.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.800
 Only that I've heard it and I've never personally questioned it, but it might, yeah, it

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.440
 does have the width of the myth, doesn't it?

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.640
 Do you guys know about Operation Lena?

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.640
 No.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.640
 This was a German operation.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:06.280
 This was in 1940 and it was when 12 Germans spies were sent to Britain as to, like, do a bit

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.640
 of a wrecky to plan Hitler's follow-up operation, which is going to be Operation Sealine, which

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.600
 is going to be the invasion of Britain.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.720
 And so they were trained up as to how to appear British, apparently trained up to blend

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.720
 right in.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.520
 And they were caught straight away because of their own stupidity, was what the British

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.600
 officials said.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.360
 One of them went into a pub and ordered a pint of cider at 10 in the morning and, which is

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.360
 a weird thing to do in any situation.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.160

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.160

 Do you know why they climb up trees?

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.920
 Do you know why they climb up trees?

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.920
 I didn't know until I read this.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.920
 So the producer of King Kong had read the story of W. Douglas Bowden.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.920
 And W. Douglas Bowden had gone over and he was the first person to probably film Komodo Dragons,

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.920
 bring back a few live Komodo dragons as well as samples of dead ones

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.920
 that they'd shot while they were out there.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.920
 And he went out with his wife and he had basically the scenes that you see in King Kong

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.920
 where they go to Skull Island to begin with is the kind of same setup of what they had.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.920
 Wait, did he tie his wife to a tree to draw Komodo Dragon?

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.920
 No, but she almost got killed by Komodo Dragon while she was out there.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:38.920
 Yeah, she went out without her gun one day and she was walking past a carcass

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.920
 that was laid out for Komodo Dragon that they were hoping to attract.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.920
 And one was coming.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.920
 So suddenly she was between the carcass and the Komodo Dragon.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.920
 And she laid down in the tall grass and really hoped that it hadn't seen her.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.920
 But she also suspected that it had and smelt her.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.920
 And so she accepted her death and just laid that because she knew it was that close.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:03.920
 And five feet away, the Komodo Dragon as it was coming towards her was shot by one of the assistance of burden.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.920
 So she survived.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.920
 She didn't deserve to survive.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.920
 Who just lies down and takes it.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.920
 At least try and make a run for it.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.920
 Well, she just knew there was no way.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.920
 Well, there is a way.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.920
 There are only slightly faster than climb a tree.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.920
 Well, they've just discovered them.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.920
 They don't know what their abilities are.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.920
 This is like a dinosaur.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.920
 And what kind of survival instinct is that?

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.920
 So she just said, I'm dead.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.920
 She'd rather go to have me.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.920
 I've got a complete idiot.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.920
 That would work against some animals, though, wouldn't it?

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.920
 They're playing dead.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.920
 Yeah. It's a big risk.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.920
 It's a big risk.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.920
 Brown bears and black bears, there's a different one of them.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.920
 I think brown bears, nothing works.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.920
 Because they're faster.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.920
 They can climb trees and they can just.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:44.920
 And then with black bears, I think you're supposed to kind of take your clothes off and slowly walk away from them

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.920
 so that they get confused about what your clothes are.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.920
 You're just trying to make me have an embarrassing bear.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.920
 Noted pervert, hunter hunter Murray,

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.920
 was found naked and mortal.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.920
 Back on the way, they taste things.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.920
 So they have this fork tongue and they stick it out and it gets like all the chemicals and the information from the air.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:11.920
 And then they retract it into their mouth and they rub it into pads on the bottom of their mouth.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.920
 And then they have to close their mouth and the pads on the bottom of their mouth touch the top of their mouth.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.920
 And that contains an organ that gives it to their brain.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.920
 So every time they want to taste something, you get it on your tongue, put it on the bottom of your mouth,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.920
 close your mouth, put it on the top of your mouth.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.920
 It just seems like a real dilemma.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.920
 That does.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.920
 That does.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.920
 But that does seem like a connoisseur as well.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.920
 It does, doesn't it?

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.920
 Like what a professional.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.920
 It feels like someone's really tasting their food.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.920
 So in your mythical commuter dragon restaurant, there'll be a lot of consideration going on.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.920
 And getting notes of carcass, but also excrement.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.920
 Maybe that's why she laid still as well.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.920
 She thought, I mean, how often do you change your mind about the restaurant you're going to as soon as you get up to it

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.920
 and see a better one next door?

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.920
 Yes.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.920
 She knew she was bad tasting.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.920
 Yeah, exactly.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.920
 Two and a half miles away.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.920
 This commuter dragon made a booking.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.920
 Yeah.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.920
 He was on his way.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.920
 Are we sure she wasn't lying still covering herself in feces?

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.920
 She probably was.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.920
 So there is a thing.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.920
 Their metabolism is a really slow reptiles, as we know, because they're, as we say, cold-blooded.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.920
 But their muscles can stay working for hours after death.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.920
 So there was an Atlantic article all about the process of dissecting a commuter dragon,

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.920
 which is very hard.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.920
 Very low to the nose of knives, because their skin is so tough.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.920
 Really?

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.920
 Yeah. And one of the students who was doing it, called Viv Allen,

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.920
 said that she'd been studying an alligator, which would be shot, had a massive hole in his head.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.920
 And she stuck a knife into the alligator, and it walked off the table.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.920
 And they freaked out, obviously, because it was dead.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.920
 But their metabolism is so slow that their muscles can stay working for hours.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.920
 And if you hit the right nerve center, you can trigger lots of muscular contractions.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.920
 And she said, we freaked out. It just wouldn't stop moving.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.920
 We cut its head off just to make sure.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.920
 And then one of the undergrads was sick in it.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.920
 Oh, cut.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.920
 Wow.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.920
 I know.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:59.920
 Just quickly on reptiles surviving after they've been killed, a snake remains completely alive after you decapitate it.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.920
 Not just muscle, not just muscles, like spasming or anything.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.920
 A snake's head is totally alive for about an hour.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.920
 And after a full hour, it can see you and decide it's pissed off with you,

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:13.920
 because you've cut its head from its body, and head it, so I don't know how it heads over to you.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.920
 But crawl its way over to you on its head and bite you.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.920
 That's amazing.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.920
 It's because they've got these ridiculously slow metabolism.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.920
 That's hilarious.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.920
 That's amazing.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.920
 So creepy.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.920
 It must be weird if they actually say, like, chase a mouse and they catch it and they eat it,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.920
 but it just walks through.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.920
 OK, it is time to move on to our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:45.920
 OK, my fact this week is that you can improve your darts game by training yourself to dream about darts.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.920
 But it's not worth it, because you have to dream about darts all the time.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.920
 Well, you know, there are worse dreams.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.920
 It's not a nightmare at least.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.920
 What depends on the game?

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.920
 The dartboard is chasing you. It's a nightmare.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.920
 And it's trying to throw darts into your body and say, see how you like it.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.920
 I don't think that would improve your game if that's the way you dream about it.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:05.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.920
 Now, the way that this works, it was a study which they did on lucid dreamers.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.920
 And these are people who can kind of decide what they're going to dream about.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.920
 And it's the thing you can train yourself to do.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.920
 You go to sleep, and then you realize you're asleep, and you can say, OK, now I'm going to chase dragons,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.920
 because I know I'm asleep, whereas most people just dream passively.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.920
 Anyway, they got these people who could lucid dream to practice darts,

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.920
 and they tested them afterwards, and the ones who did it were better at darts,

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.920
 and the ones who didn't do it were worse at darts.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.920
 That's how you go.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.920
 Although they did specify that if people, the third group that practice darts in their waking life

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.920
 were even better than the ones who practiced it in their sleep.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.920
 Sure.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.920
 But I imagine if you practice in your waking life and practice while you're asleep,

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.920
 you're going to be even better.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.920
 So it sounds like this is quite early research, like the controversial as well.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.920
 A lot of people aren't sure whether or not it does actually improve.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.920
 It's just a small pool of stuff.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.920
 Oh, it's a small study, yeah.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.920
 Yeah.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.920
 But the thing is, it definitely does work.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.920
 I don't want to say definitely just in case, but it does appear to work,

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.920
 is kind of in sport, just imagining that you're going to do something,

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:10.920
 and that really helps your body to prepare for muscle memory and things like that.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.920
 I can absolutely believe it.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.920
 Haven't there been studies on people with their arms and casts

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.920
 who've been asked to visualise themselves doing exercises with that arm?

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.920
 Yes.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.920
 And it's been, their arm has become stronger than if they were,

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.920
 than if they were not doing those visualisations.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.920
 Oh, wow.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.920
 Yeah, it absolutely.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.920
 So that is, I mean, dreaming doesn't sound very far from that at all.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.920
 I believe it.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.920
 There was one thing about this study as well with the lucid dreamers about darts,

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.920
 dreams being what they are.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.920
 Sometimes they weren't exactly the same as a darts game.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.920
 So one of the people was throwing a dartboard that was actually looked exactly like a tree stump,

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.920
 but that still helped them to get better.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.920
 Oh, sure.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.920
 So is it wood in the real world, I guess?

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.920
 Yeah.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.920
 It's like, you find out the dartboard is your mum, that's different.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.920
 No, but I think the idea is, even if a dartboard turns into your mum

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.920
 and you turn out to be naked and you're flying over Australia,

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.920
 then you're still going to be better because you practice the darts bit.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.920
 Imagine if you got to the competition, you needed those exact conditions.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.920
 I'm Phil Taylor, the darts player.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.920
 Yeah.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.920
 He dreams about darts.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.920
 So sometimes I'm playing darts in my sleep and I wake myself up.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.920
 I hate it.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.920
 Drives me crackers because if I have a catnet, I'm dreaming about bloody darts.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.920
 Yeah.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.920
 So he is the best darts player of all time.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.920
 Right.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.920
 And he probably plays darts all the time in his normal life

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.920
 because otherwise how would he get so good?

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.920
 Yeah.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.920
 And he's probably just dreaming because you often dream about what you're doing.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.920
 Yeah.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.920
 You love them.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.920
 Actually, he's deliberately doing its practice.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.920
 Like if you play a computer game and when you close your eyes at night,

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.920
 you can see images from the computer game.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.920
 Yeah, the Tetris effect.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.920
 Yeah, I used to get that all the time, but I used to play a lot of computer games.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.920
 Supposedly when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip went on a tour of Australia

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.920
 and they did something like 56 towns in 57 days.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.920
 So it was a megator. Philip at that point was dreaming of just waving in his dreams.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.920
 Yeah, I don't know if that's a proper fact.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.920
 It's in the crown, but I assume they pulled that from a book somewhere.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.920
 Wow.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.920
 You love the crown so much.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.920
 I can't believe it's taken you so long to crowbar it into this.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.920
 I know.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:07.920
 What is the crown?

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.920
 Is it a film?

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.920
 It's a Netflix.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.920
 It's written by Peter Morgan who wrote the Queen.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.920
 Right.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.920
 So he's very factual in his writing.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.920
 And yeah, neither of those stories mentions that they're all lizards.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.920
 Weirdly.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:27.920
 Have you ever seen the Queen try and catch a fly with her marshmallow-like tongue?

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.920
 Like Ozzie LB8.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.920
 I know.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.920
 And I've sent all those emails about the honours committee to my management.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.920
 Incredible.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.920
 I'm filled the power.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.920
 So the nickname the power.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.920
 I went on to Wikipedia and saw a big list of all because they've all got sort of WWF nicknames

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.920
 that they bring to the sport.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.920
 But what's really exciting is there's a lot of puns.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.920
 So Antonio Alcinas.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.920
 He's Spanish.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.920
 So what do you reckon his is?

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:55.920
 Antonio Alcinas.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.920
 I don't know.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.920
 El d'Artador.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.920
 So that's it.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:32:59.920
 El d'Artador.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.920
 Jamie Harvey.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.920
 He's from Scotland.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.920
 What's his pun?

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.920
 Tossing the dart.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.920
 No, Scotland.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.920
 Like Scotland the brave.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.920
 Some pun on this.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.920
 Brave dart.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.920
 Oh.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.920
 Mark Frost.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.920
 Where's he from?

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.920
 Is he from Dartford?

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.920
 Because otherwise I reckon we're going to struggle with someone from Dartford.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.920
 Could anybody be beaten by someone from Dartmore?

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:30.920
 So the earliest form of darts, do you know why it was banned?

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.920
 Why?

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.920
 Do you know that it was banned?

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.920
 It was because people kept on dying.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.920
 It's the earliest form of darts wall.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.920
 Yes.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.920
 No, it was called Puff and Dart and it involved a blowpipe.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.920
 And you go, you know, you would blow the dart towards the board.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.920
 And eventually, I mean, people kept on swallowing them by mistake.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.920
 And they could be--

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.920
 Shucking instead of blowing.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.920
 Yeah.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.920
 They could be quite small.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.920
 And so eventually they thought, why don't we just get rid of the blowpipe element of the darts game?

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:05.920
 Did you see read about that man last year or the year before last, who inhaled a dart?

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.920
 But he inhaled a rubber dart 44 years ago.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.920
 And his parents took him to Annie and said, we think our sons inhaled a dart.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.920
 And they said, there's not really a dart in there, go away.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.920
 And then he didn't know about this.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.920
 And he's always had sinus problems.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.920
 And he sneezed.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.920
 This is in 2015.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.920
 He sneezed.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.920
 Please tell me you was standing right next to the dart bottle.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.920
 And he took him 5,000 pounds for prize money and the rubber dart.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.920
 So he sneezed and the rubber dart came out.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.920
 And it had been sitting in his nose for the last 44 years.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.920
 That is unbelievable.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.920
 James, you know darts terminology because you're a fan of the sport.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.920
 Sure.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.920
 Have you heard of the phrase, wankers 50?

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.920
 I haven't.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.920
 No, what is a wankers 50?

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.920
 It's-- I don't know if this is common or rare.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.920
 It doesn't seem common.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.920
 It's where you're aiming for a bullseye, which is 50.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.920
 But you hit single 20, single 18, and single 12 instead.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.920
 OK.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.920
 So you do score 50, but you use three darts.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.920
 OK, have you heard of bagadix, which is B-A-G-A-D-I-X?

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:06.920
 Oh, it's not an acronym.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.920
 No.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.920
 Oh.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.920
 What would begin with X in that acronym?

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:14.920
 It's rhyming slang.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.920
 It's not an acronym.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.920
 OK.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.920
 It's rhyming slang for 26.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.920
 Oh, because if you're aiming for the treble 20,

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.920
 you miss it on one side and get one, and on the other side you get five.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.920
 Exactly.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.920
 And I call that B and B, but I don't know why we call it that.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:31.920
 B and B is 2 and 6, and 2 and 6 is how much a bed and breakfast used to cost in the UK,

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.920
 in two shillings and six months, in pre-decentralisation characters.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.920
 So what's bagadix?

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.920
 26.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.920
 You know that as in, I don't know.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:43.920
 Should in that, like most rhyming slang has a meaning to a thing it's wrong to.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.920
 You know a bag.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.920
 Yeah.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.920
 So if you put some dicks in a bag.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:48.920
 OK.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:49.920
 See?

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.920
 I don't know that it is that.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.920
 It sounds more like a bingo call, doesn't it?

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:54.920
 Yeah.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.920
 Bagadix.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.920
 26.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.920
 This children do listen to this show.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:01.920
 Oh, it's not that bad.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.920
 A lot of people know what bingo is.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:16.920
 OK, that's it.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.920
 That's all of our facts.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.920
