00:00:00,00:00:15,How are you doing?
00:00:15,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:22,to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:26,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:26,00:00:31,I'm Anna Chazinski and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four
00:00:31,00:00:36,"favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:38,"Starting with you, Anna Chazinski."
00:00:38,00:00:44,My fact this week is that a frog's tongue is 10 times softer than a human's tongue.
00:00:44,00:00:46,I've thought we had soft tongues already.
00:00:46,00:00:47,And yet?
00:00:47,00:00:50,You've been very lucky in your love life.
00:00:50,00:00:53,Does this mean that French kissing a frog will be unbelievably good?
00:00:53,00:00:54,Or unbelievably bad?
00:00:54,00:00:57,"Yeah, because you don't want too much give, do you?"
00:00:57,00:00:58,I don't know.
00:00:58,00:01:01,It really depends on your personal taste but it doesn't use it for kissing.
00:01:01,00:01:06,"When the princess kisses the frog in the story, does she French kiss it and if so does"
00:01:06,00:01:08,she notice that it's tongue is unbelievably soft?
00:01:08,00:01:10,That was probably in the original draft after that she kissed.
00:01:10,00:01:12,"She went, ""What the fuck is that?"""
00:01:12,00:01:17,"Actually, I do remember that in one of the really early versions of that, like in the old"
00:01:17,00:01:21,"French versions of that thing, I think she has sex with the frog to turn him into a"
00:01:21,00:01:22,"prince, I think so."
00:01:22,00:01:29,"But unfortunately, who finds the frog's penis is 10 times softer than a human's finger."
00:01:29,00:01:33,"So 10 times softer, that's pretty chilly, right?"
00:01:33,00:01:34,It's soft.
00:01:34,00:01:35,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's soft."
00:01:35,00:01:39,It's because it's so that they can catch their prey effectively.
00:01:39,00:01:45,"So if we start our tongue out and bash it into a fly, then we'd bash the fly away from"
00:01:45,00:01:46,us.
00:01:46,00:01:50,"But a frog's tongue is soft enough that if it bashes its tongue into a fly, it sort of moulds"
00:01:50,00:01:54,into the various crevices of the cricket or whatever it is.
00:01:54,00:01:56,And then it can retract and pull it back in.
00:01:56,00:01:59,And it does this by having an extremely soft tongue.
00:01:59,00:02:02,And it also does it by having this incredible saliva.
00:02:02,00:02:08,"So frog saliva is 50,000 times more viscous, so 50,000 times stickier than ours."
00:02:08,00:02:12,"So that means if you do French kiss a frog, it's going to be hard to get away."
00:02:12,00:02:13,Wow.
00:02:13,00:02:14,"Yeah, that's true."
00:02:14,00:02:18,"So if a frog was looking stamps to put on, that would be really soddly stuck on, right?"
00:02:18,00:02:19,Yeah.
00:02:19,00:02:22,"And so in the early days of the post office, then every letter came with a frog attached."
00:02:22,00:02:24,They employed them at first.
00:02:24,00:02:25,It's incredible.
00:02:25,00:02:27,"But the thing is that it changes, doesn't it?"
00:02:27,00:02:28,Yes.
00:02:28,00:02:32,"So it starts off like, so it incredibly thick, honey, and then when it's on the tongue,"
00:02:32,00:02:37,"and then when it hits the insect, for a moment, it liquefies, covers the insect completely,"
00:02:37,00:02:42,"like it gets around every angle of it, every knock, every cranny, so the insect is completely"
00:02:42,00:02:45,"covered in it, and then it hardens again, and then the frog pulls it back in."
00:02:45,00:02:46,How is that?
00:02:46,00:02:50,"It evolves over time, I know, but I mean, it's incredible to think of that evolving."
00:02:50,00:02:53,And I can't believe that we've never bothered to look into it before.
00:02:53,00:02:54,It's such a common trope.
00:02:54,00:02:57,"The idea of a frog darting out, it's tongue and grabbing an insect, and we've only just bothered"
00:02:57,00:02:58,to work out how they do it.
00:02:58,00:03:00,"But there's so many things that do that, right?"
00:03:00,00:03:01,"Like, chameleons."
00:03:01,00:03:02,Yeah.
00:03:02,00:03:03,So there's a lot of animals.
00:03:03,00:03:04,Yeah.
00:03:04,00:03:05,So I wonder if they do the same thing.
00:03:05,00:03:06,They do it in a slightly different way.
00:03:06,00:03:07,Yeah.
00:03:07,00:03:08,They evolve separately.
00:03:08,00:03:12,"I think like Salamanders, they have like a kind of a skeletal bit attached to"
00:03:12,00:03:16,"the tongue, which fires it out, and the frog just kind of drops its jaw really,"
00:03:16,00:03:20,"really quickly, and that flicks it out like a flicky thing."
00:03:20,00:03:23,"Because when I was reading the paper, so that's quite a different description to what"
00:03:23,00:03:27,I read about how the tongue is used when it darts out in order to catch prey.
00:03:27,00:03:31,And they said that effectively what it was doing was it's acting almost like a bungee cord.
00:03:31,00:03:37,"So it's gripping on to the prey and just sucking it back in a very kind of mild manner,"
00:03:37,00:03:39,as opposed to like a whip.
00:03:39,00:03:40,Like as if you were coming back up on the bungee.
00:03:40,00:03:44,"One of weird bungee jumps, if you don't, where you stand on the ground, and you wait"
00:03:44,00:03:47,for a bungee rope to pull down and grab you on the way back.
00:03:47,00:03:52,"Even more exciting, you jump off the cliff without a bungee rope, and then it comes down"
00:03:52,00:03:53,and grabs you.
00:03:53,00:03:54,"I mean, it pulls you up."
00:03:54,00:03:55,That'd be pretty exciting.
00:03:55,00:03:56,That'd be amazing.
00:03:56,00:03:57,Do you know how they found this out?
00:03:57,00:04:02,"The scientist who did this, as a PhD student, called Alexis Noel, and she said, ""I actually"
00:04:02,00:04:05,got 15 frogs and scraped their tongues for a couple of hours one night.
00:04:05,00:04:06,"It was pretty disgusting."""
00:04:06,00:04:11,"And she said, ""It takes about half an hour to get a milliliter of frog saliva off their"
00:04:11,00:04:12,"tongue."""
00:04:12,00:04:16,"She says, ""It's like the world's most precious material because it's so hard to get and you"
00:04:16,00:04:18,"get so little of it once you've done that."""
00:04:18,00:04:21,But I don't think that necessarily makes it precious.
00:04:21,00:04:23,"Well, it depends on her time, doesn't it?"
00:04:23,00:04:28,"If she charges like $2 million an hour, and it takes her that long, then it is really"
00:04:28,00:04:29,precious.
00:04:29,00:04:32,"But if she's, you know, on minimum wage, it's probably not that precious."
00:04:32,00:04:36,"She's probably somewhere in between, isn't she?"
00:04:36,00:04:39,Well she works under Dr David Ho.
00:04:39,00:04:43,He was the guy who came up with the idea that all animals or all mammals urinate for the
00:04:43,00:04:45,"same amount of time, around 21 seconds."
00:04:45,00:04:46,And David Ho.
00:04:46,00:04:47,We met David Ho.
00:04:47,00:04:48,How are we?
00:04:48,00:04:49,Yeah.
00:04:49,00:04:50,He's won the Nignal Bell Prize.
00:04:50,00:04:51,Yeah.
00:04:51,00:04:53,We met him at the ignoble show in London.
00:04:53,00:04:54,"Oh, yes, we did."
00:04:54,00:04:55,"Yes, we did."
00:04:55,00:04:56,"Well, we spoke to Martin."
00:04:56,00:04:57,He gave us his card.
00:04:57,00:04:58,You're right.
00:04:58,00:04:59,Is he a doctor?
00:04:59,00:05:00,Is he a doctor?
00:05:00,00:05:01,"He's a doctor, yeah."
00:05:01,00:05:02,Nice.
00:05:02,00:05:03,Yeah.
00:05:03,00:05:04,That's very cool.
00:05:04,00:05:05,Yeah.
00:05:05,00:05:07,He said of the frog's tongue that it's like a trampoline and a baseball mitt in that
00:05:07,00:05:10,stretch that catches you and then pulls back.
00:05:10,00:05:11,And the bungee cord.
00:05:11,00:05:14,"Yeah, there's a lot of metaphors going on here."
00:05:14,00:05:17,"Well, the other metaphor is on the softness of the tongue."
00:05:17,00:05:22,They said it's like freshly chewed chewing gum about that same stickiness and kind of softness.
00:05:22,00:05:23,Okay.
00:05:23,00:05:24,And also marshmallow fluff.
00:05:24,00:05:27,"You know, if you get like a t-cake and you get marshmallow on your hands, you just can't"
00:05:27,00:05:28,get it off like that.
00:05:28,00:05:30,"Oh my god, a wonderful marshmallow fluff works like this."
00:05:30,00:05:34,"And actually, if you bashed it really hard, it would suddenly turn to liquid and you"
00:05:34,00:05:35,could get it off your finger.
00:05:35,00:05:38,You'd finally be able to catch all those flies you've been looking for.
00:05:38,00:05:43,"Do you know, when the frog gets its tongue back in its mouth as well, it's then it has a problem,"
00:05:43,00:05:46,which is that my saliva is like honey and it's incredibly sticky and I've got the fly
00:05:46,00:05:48,on my tongue and I can't get it off.
00:05:48,00:05:49,So do you know what they have to do?
00:05:49,00:05:54,They have to push their eyeballs down into their head onto their tongue to scrape the
00:05:54,00:05:55,fly off their tongue.
00:05:55,00:05:57,"Well, it's not to scrape it because what I think we might have mentioned the eyeballs"
00:05:57,00:06:01,"thing before, but I think they just realise why that works because that's the same thing."
00:06:01,00:06:06,"I think the eyeballs bash into it and it's the impacts that turns it into this very, very"
00:06:06,00:06:07,liquid thing.
00:06:07,00:06:08,So what is it?
00:06:08,00:06:11,It's a non-utonian fluid which I've talked about before.
00:06:11,00:06:16,"So it's like quick sand whereby whenever you agitate it, it changes its disgust."
00:06:16,00:06:18,But it's like the opposite of custard.
00:06:18,00:06:21,So it's a non-utonian fluid but it has the opposite effect.
00:06:21,00:06:24,Catch up is the same as frog saliva.
00:06:24,00:06:25,What?
00:06:25,00:06:26,What do you mean?
00:06:26,00:06:27,The same.
00:06:27,00:06:28,"It's a non-utonian fluid as well, but this way round."
00:06:28,00:06:32,"So that's why if you bash a glass, catch up bottle, then it will suddenly come flowing"
00:06:32,00:06:36,"out because if you hit it hard enough, then the viscosity of the liquid suddenly changes."
00:06:36,00:06:42,I was looking into tongues generally and we don't know how bats drink.
00:06:42,00:06:46,We're still looking into how bats drink and one of the things that they notice is that
00:06:46,00:06:50,they use their tongue as a sort of conveyor belt to bring the liquid up.
00:06:50,00:06:52,What does that mean?
00:06:52,00:06:54,It means that the tongue sort of...
00:06:54,00:06:56,Is it on rollers?
00:06:56,00:06:59,"Yeah, and then I see it, yeah."
00:06:59,00:07:00,How does that work?
00:07:00,00:07:01,"I don't know, Dan."
00:07:01,00:07:03,I think you don't know how bat tongues work.
00:07:03,00:07:06,I think you've slightly misunderstood the story.
00:07:06,00:07:13,"No, it says scientists use their tongues as a kind of conveyor belt to slurp up nectar."
00:07:13,00:07:15,I think the key bit there is kind of...
00:07:15,00:07:16,Okay.
00:07:16,00:07:19,Because the amazing thing about it being conveyor belt would be if it woundled the way around
00:07:19,00:07:22,"on its rotor and came back out, which is hard to believe they do."
00:07:22,00:07:26,Have you heard the myth about dog mouths?
00:07:26,00:07:27,Is it that they're cleaner than human mouths?
00:07:27,00:07:28,Yes.
00:07:28,00:07:32,Because I had not heard this myth until I was researching this fact.
00:07:32,00:07:36,But there is a myth that dog mouths are cleaner than human mouths and that it's fine as a result
00:07:36,00:07:37,to friend kiss them.
00:07:37,00:07:38,It's okay.
00:07:38,00:07:42,"I think what happens is, now, you've read into this, you might know, but I think there"
00:07:42,00:07:46,"might be fewer bacteria, but the point is that they're all bacteria that you don't already"
00:07:46,00:07:47,have in your mouth.
00:07:47,00:07:48,Yes.
00:07:48,00:07:49,And probably you don't really want in your mouth.
00:07:49,00:07:50,Yeah.
00:07:50,00:07:53,So there was an article on ABC News where they spoke to a vet and said it may be safer
00:07:53,00:07:56,because lots of the bacteria are species specific.
00:07:56,00:08:00,So you can't catch the same strep from a dog that you could from a person.
00:08:00,00:08:06,"However, I did read also articles like I almost died after a dog saliva infection."
00:08:06,00:08:07,So I think it's not recommended.
00:08:07,00:08:10,"Well, especially a rabid dog that can..."
00:08:10,00:08:11,"Oh, yeah."
00:08:11,00:08:12,Yeah.
00:08:12,00:08:15,"If you get rabid dog saliva and you've got any kind of cuts in your mouth, then you'll catch"
00:08:15,00:08:17,rabies from that.
00:08:17,00:08:20,And they used to try to weaponize this.
00:08:20,00:08:25,"So I think Lian, as he called, he's a Roman writer."
00:08:25,00:08:29,"He wrote that if a rabid dog saliva could get into contact with someone, then they would"
00:08:29,00:08:30,get rabies.
00:08:30,00:08:34,Leonardo da Vinci thought that this might be a good idea to use in war.
00:08:34,00:08:40,And there was a Polish general called Kazemir Semenovic who thought that he would get the
00:08:40,00:08:46,"slubber from rabid dogs, put them in clay balls and fire them into, like, towns that besieged."
00:08:46,00:08:50,"Is there hope that people will find the clay bottles on the ground and think, what is this?"
00:08:50,00:08:51,I must put it in my mouth.
00:08:51,00:08:54,Or is it that they can fire into people's mouths?
00:08:54,00:08:56,"Like, it just seems like such an inefficient distribution message."
00:08:56,00:09:01,They were firing into towns of toddlers who just picked them all up and tried to eat them.
00:09:01,00:09:02,You're right.
00:09:02,00:09:05,"They should put it in, like, an Easter egg or something."
00:09:05,00:09:06,"Yeah, exactly."
00:09:06,00:09:07,Something really crafted like that.
00:09:07,00:09:10,"And then leave a load of Easter eggs outside, saying, sorry about the seeds going on a bit,"
00:09:10,00:09:11,isn't it?
00:09:11,00:09:13,Have some Easter eggs.
00:09:13,00:09:16,"But our official advice is, don't snog your dog, right?"
00:09:16,00:09:20,"I think, yeah, that's mine, even if it might be safe, even if you've got a very clean"
00:09:20,00:09:21,dog.
00:09:21,00:09:22,Even if it's safe.
00:09:22,00:09:23,It's weird.
00:09:23,00:09:24,Yeah.
00:09:24,00:09:28,"I have one more thing, which is that grey whales, this is so cool, they use their tongues"
00:09:28,00:09:31,really cleverly to control their heat loss.
00:09:31,00:09:35,"So they've always got mouths full of extremely cold ocean water, right?"
00:09:35,00:09:37,So they might lose a massive amount of heat that way.
00:09:37,00:09:42,"And that would, they might die as a result of, if they had a really warm tongue."
00:09:42,00:09:47,"So what happens is, the arteries that take blood to their tongue, right, are really close"
00:09:47,00:09:49,to the veins carrying blood away from the tongue.
00:09:49,00:09:56,"And as the arteries get closer to the tongue, they transfer all the heat over from the artery"
00:09:56,00:09:59,"going to the tongue to the vein, heading back from the tongue, right?"
00:09:59,00:10:00,Right.
00:10:00,00:10:04,"So the blood on its way to the tongue cools down, and the blood on its way back to the heart"
00:10:04,00:10:05,warms up.
00:10:05,00:10:08,"And it sounds kind of like a, like a conveyor belt."
00:10:08,00:10:11,"It is a lot like a conveyor belt, actually."
00:10:11,00:10:15,"So when it gets to the end of the tongue, or when it gets to the tongue, it's incredibly"
00:10:15,00:10:16,cold already.
00:10:16,00:10:17,This blood.
00:10:17,00:10:20,So the whale doesn't lose massive amounts of heat because its tongue is constantly in contact
00:10:20,00:10:21,with very cold water.
00:10:21,00:10:22,And that crafty.
00:10:22,00:10:23,Yeah.
00:10:23,00:10:26,"I don't know if it's this whale, but there is some kind of whale that can thermoregulate"
00:10:26,00:10:30,"in that way, but by, it has erectile tissue in its tongue."
00:10:30,00:10:34,And so it can kind of engorge it with blood in the way that an erection would.
00:10:34,00:10:39,"And so they would kind of, if they need to cool down, they get a massive kind of erection"
00:10:39,00:10:41,in the mouth in the tongue.
00:10:41,00:10:42,And that will cool them down.
00:10:42,00:10:43,"What you laugh about, Andy."
00:10:43,00:10:46,"I'm just remembering a joke, so what's happening?"
00:10:46,00:10:50,Do you want to just know how you can tell if you're an extrovert or an introvert by your
00:10:50,00:10:51,saliva?
00:10:51,00:10:52,"Yeah, sure."
00:10:52,00:10:58,"And if you are constantly leaving it in other people's mouths, you're an extrovert."
00:10:58,00:11:01,"So there's a study that was done, I think, in the '60s, but I think it's been replicated"
00:11:01,00:11:03,that showed that introverts salivate more.
00:11:03,00:11:09,"So when you put drops of lemon on the tongue of people who are introverted by character,"
00:11:09,00:11:10,they produce more saliva.
00:11:10,00:11:13,And it kind of makes sense because people who are introverts tend to react more strongly
00:11:13,00:11:14,to certain kind of stimulation.
00:11:14,00:11:19,"But can make sense if you're constantly slubbering, you don't want to spend a lot of time with"
00:11:19,00:11:20,me.
00:11:20,00:11:26,"Every time you open your mouth, you spit in someone's face, you start to stop speaking."
00:11:26,00:11:29,"Well, so apparently this works."
00:11:29,00:11:32,"If you're not sure if you're an introvert or an extrovert, there's not the easiest way"
00:11:32,00:11:35,"to tell, but you get a cotton bud."
00:11:35,00:11:39,"You tie a little bit of thread to the exact middle so that when you hold it by the thread,"
00:11:39,00:11:41,it hangs horizontally.
00:11:41,00:11:44,And then you put one end of the tip in your mouth for 20 seconds and take it out.
00:11:44,00:11:49,"And then you put lemon juice on your tongue, and then you put the other end of the tip on"
00:11:49,00:11:50,your mouth for another 20 seconds.
00:11:50,00:11:54,So you're seeing how much you're salivating in response to the lemon juice.
00:11:54,00:11:56,And then you hold it by the thread.
00:11:56,00:12:00,"And if it's hanging horizontally still, it means you haven't salivated much, which means"
00:12:00,00:12:01,you're an extrovert.
00:12:01,00:12:04,"And if it tilts, it means you've salivated quite a lot."
00:12:04,00:12:06,So the end one end is heavier now.
00:12:06,00:12:10,But it's a lot to do to tell you something that presumably you kind of already know.
00:12:10,00:12:13,"If you've got the time to do this, you're an introvert."
00:12:13,00:12:24,"OK, there's time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:12:24,00:12:28,"My fact is that during the Second World War, Britain invented chocolate bars infused with"
00:12:28,00:12:33,garlic to give to pilots who were shot down and needed to make their breath authentically
00:12:33,00:12:34,French.
00:12:34,00:12:39,So it's the idea that you land in France and you meet someone.
00:12:39,00:12:40,Yeah.
00:12:40,00:12:42,"And they say, are you French?"
00:12:42,00:12:45,"And you just breathe on them and they go, oh, you must be French then, you're not actually"
00:12:45,00:12:46,to speak French.
00:12:46,00:12:51,But I don't ask you why you're wearing an R.A.F uniform or none of this.
00:12:51,00:12:53,So this gets written about quite a lot.
00:12:53,00:12:57,I've tried to find concrete evidence of pilots actually being given these bars and using
00:12:57,00:12:58,them.
00:12:58,00:12:59,And I haven't found much.
00:12:59,00:13:04,"I do know that it was invented as a thing, because it's written about a load of times"
00:13:04,00:13:09,"there was a guy called Charles Fraser Smith, who was kind of one of the original inspirations"
00:13:09,00:13:11,of Q in the James Bond films.
00:13:11,00:13:13,So that's this guy.
00:13:13,00:13:16,"And he did invent these things, as well as loads of other incredible stuff."
00:13:16,00:13:17,Yeah.
00:13:17,00:13:19,But I can't find out whether it was put into operation in the field.
00:13:19,00:13:21,Why didn't he just give them garlic?
00:13:21,00:13:25,"It's not as though-- well, hey, it's not as though garlic goes especially well with chocolate"
00:13:25,00:13:26,anyway.
00:13:26,00:13:32,And R.A.F pilots in World War II would be undergoing a lot of physical trauma and challenges
00:13:32,00:13:33,every day.
00:13:33,00:13:36,I didn't think they're going to have a problem with just easier a couple of cloves of garlic.
00:13:36,00:13:37,That's not going to be the final straw.
00:13:37,00:13:41,"No, but this guy was James Bond's Q, right?"
00:13:41,00:13:42,Yeah.
00:13:42,00:13:46,So Q never just-- there was always a double thing to the invention.
00:13:46,00:13:49,"It's a pen that doubles as a-- so you would be like, it's just garlic."
00:13:49,00:13:50,"You'd be like, ""And?"""
00:13:50,00:13:53,And it doubles as a chocolate bar.
00:13:53,00:13:54,That's Q.
00:13:54,00:13:56,"It's not garlic, but doubles as a chocolate bar."
00:13:56,00:13:58,"Well, it's a chocolate bar."
00:13:58,00:13:59,Yeah.
00:13:59,00:14:00,Garlic flavoured.
00:14:00,00:14:01,Yeah.
00:14:01,00:14:02,"Well, I'm just saying."
00:14:02,00:14:06,"A lot of people that go on missions isn't chocolate a thing, a sustenance."
00:14:06,00:14:11,"So maybe he was trying to double up the sustenance with the-- so again, Q's mind is working"
00:14:11,00:14:12,there.
00:14:12,00:14:13,He's doubling up.
00:14:13,00:14:14,"Yeah, I'm very good."
00:14:14,00:14:15,Back to say about my criticism.
00:14:15,00:14:16,It was a great idea.
00:14:16,00:14:17,Yeah.
00:14:17,00:14:20,"This was in the news because there was a very recent story, MI6 announced that their current"
00:14:20,00:14:24,"Q is a woman, which surprised a lot of people because they thought it was still--"
00:14:24,00:14:29,"That's my new talent from the James Bond fans, but no, it is, but he doubles up as a woman."
00:14:29,00:14:31,Did they tell us who these people are?
00:14:31,00:14:32,What's going on?
00:14:32,00:14:35,I think it's bizarre that you know who the head of MI5 and MI6 is.
00:14:35,00:14:36,"Yeah, I do as well."
00:14:36,00:14:37,Really hard.
00:14:37,00:14:38,Probably aren't the real ones.
00:14:38,00:14:39,"They can't be, right?"
00:14:39,00:14:42,Like Stella Remington couldn't have been the headhead.
00:14:42,00:14:43,I think she was.
00:14:43,00:14:49,"I mentioned she was, but on what James is saying, I think that you can't-- there must be someone"
00:14:49,00:14:50,who is actually a secret head.
00:14:50,00:14:55,"There's going to be someone who, if you ask them, they'll just not be able to say anything."
00:14:55,00:14:56,I don't know.
00:14:56,00:15:00,"What if Stella Remington listens to this podcast, and she's sitting at home feeling bad now?"
00:15:00,00:15:02,She's fine.
00:15:02,00:15:03,She's the fake head of MI6.
00:15:03,00:15:07,"Okay, so I don't think we can say fake on a fake, that's all."
00:15:07,00:15:11,"All I'm saying is, if I was in charge, I would make Stella Remington the fake one and then"
00:15:11,00:15:12,have a real one.
00:15:12,00:15:13,Yes.
00:15:13,00:15:16,But she'd know at some point that she was the fake one after--
00:15:16,00:15:17,She's in on it.
00:15:17,00:15:18,"Oh, she's in on it."
00:15:18,00:15:19,"Oh, she's in on it."
00:15:19,00:15:21,But she doesn't think she's running the show with secretly this.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"Oh, she's in on it."
00:15:23,00:15:26,She's an actor called Maureen.
00:15:26,00:15:27,Maureen Lippman.
00:15:27,00:15:28,Yeah.
00:15:28,00:15:32,"I'm not going to recognise her though, they'll say I saw that Stella Remington in a--"
00:15:32,00:15:33,"Oh, the BT ad."
00:15:33,00:15:34,Yes.
00:15:34,00:15:38,"She should be looking after the country's safety, not clocking on and doing BT adverts, and then"
00:15:38,00:15:39,there'd be a scandal.
00:15:39,00:15:41,I love the BT adverts.
00:15:41,00:15:45,That's a reference from the early '80s.
00:15:45,00:15:48,That's the last thing I can remember that piece.
00:15:48,00:15:52,"Well, she's going to be feeling sad at home because you haven't been keeping up with"
00:15:52,00:15:53,her career.
00:15:53,00:15:58,So I don't think that you need to be secret unless you're in the field.
00:15:58,00:16:00,"Next thing, another thing, I would assume."
00:16:00,00:16:05,"Well, Stella Remington was the first person that they openly acknowledged as the head."
00:16:05,00:16:10,So that was a transparency thing that came in with one of the governments who decided
00:16:10,00:16:11,"transparency was, I think."
00:16:11,00:16:12,So they did keep them secret.
00:16:12,00:16:13,"Oh, OK."
00:16:13,00:16:14,Yeah.
00:16:14,00:16:15,"That's not always been, though."
00:16:15,00:16:17,That was the thing that I think we've mentioned on a previous podcast.
00:16:17,00:16:19,And I don't know.
00:16:19,00:16:23,"I think we almost mentioned it as an urban myth, the idea of the spy who was pregnant and"
00:16:23,00:16:28,they discovered that she was a spy when she was delivering the baby because the pain
00:16:28,00:16:31,"was so great, she started swearing in her own language."
00:16:31,00:16:32,Is that a myth?
00:16:32,00:16:33,I don't know.
00:16:33,00:16:34,I don't know.
00:16:34,00:16:38,I thought you meant that the baby came out and started speaking Russian.
00:16:38,00:16:43,"Ah, that's fity of my life."
00:16:43,00:16:44,It's a great myth.
00:16:44,00:16:48,"Or, I mean, if it's true, if it's in bad terms, it might be true."
00:16:48,00:16:51,"Only that I've heard it and I've never personally questioned it, but it might, yeah, it"
00:16:51,00:16:54,"does have the width of the myth, doesn't it?"
00:16:54,00:16:56,Do you guys know about Operation Lena?
00:16:56,00:16:57,No.
00:16:57,00:17:00,This was a German operation.
00:17:00,00:17:06,"This was in 1940 and it was when 12 Germans spies were sent to Britain as to, like, do a bit"
00:17:06,00:17:11,"of a wrecky to plan Hitler's follow-up operation, which is going to be Operation Sealine, which"
00:17:11,00:17:13,is going to be the invasion of Britain.
00:17:13,00:17:17,"And so they were trained up as to how to appear British, apparently trained up to blend"
00:17:17,00:17:18,right in.
00:17:18,00:17:22,"And they were caught straight away because of their own stupidity, was what the British"
00:17:22,00:17:23,officials said.
00:17:23,00:17:28,"One of them went into a pub and ordered a pint of cider at 10 in the morning and, which is"
00:17:28,00:17:30,a weird thing to do in any situation.
00:17:30,00:17:32,I can't think of anything more British.
00:17:32,00:17:34,"No, you go to Gawick and Heathrow Airport."
00:17:34,00:17:36,"Well, you'll see a lot of German spies there."

00:23:59,00:24:00,Do you know why they climb up trees?
00:24:00,00:24:01,Do you know why they climb up trees?
00:24:01,00:24:03,I didn't know until I read this.
00:24:03,00:24:08,So the producer of King Kong had read the story of W. Douglas Bowden.
00:24:08,00:24:12,"And W. Douglas Bowden had gone over and he was the first person to probably film Komodo Dragons,"
00:24:12,00:24:16,bring back a few live Komodo dragons as well as samples of dead ones
00:24:16,00:24:18,that they'd shot while they were out there.
00:24:18,00:24:22,And he went out with his wife and he had basically the scenes that you see in King Kong
00:24:22,00:24:27,where they go to Skull Island to begin with is the kind of same setup of what they had.
00:24:27,00:24:30,"Wait, did he tie his wife to a tree to draw Komodo Dragon?"
00:24:30,00:24:33,"No, but she almost got killed by Komodo Dragon while she was out there."
00:24:33,00:24:38,"Yeah, she went out without her gun one day and she was walking past a carcass"
00:24:38,00:24:41,that was laid out for Komodo Dragon that they were hoping to attract.
00:24:41,00:24:42,And one was coming.
00:24:42,00:24:45,So suddenly she was between the carcass and the Komodo Dragon.
00:24:45,00:24:50,And she laid down in the tall grass and really hoped that it hadn't seen her.
00:24:50,00:24:53,But she also suspected that it had and smelt her.
00:24:53,00:24:56,And so she accepted her death and just laid that because she knew it was that close.
00:24:56,00:25:03,"And five feet away, the Komodo Dragon as it was coming towards her was shot by one of the assistance of burden."
00:25:03,00:25:04,So she survived.
00:25:04,00:25:06,She didn't deserve to survive.
00:25:06,00:25:08,Who just lies down and takes it.
00:25:08,00:25:10,At least try and make a run for it.
00:25:10,00:25:11,"Well, she just knew there was no way."
00:25:11,00:25:12,"Well, there is a way."
00:25:12,00:25:15,There are only slightly faster than climb a tree.
00:25:15,00:25:16,"Well, they've just discovered them."
00:25:16,00:25:17,They don't know what their abilities are.
00:25:17,00:25:19,This is like a dinosaur.
00:25:19,00:25:21,And what kind of survival instinct is that?
00:25:21,00:25:22,"So she just said, I'm dead."
00:25:22,00:25:23,She'd rather go to have me.
00:25:23,00:25:25,I've got a complete idiot.
00:25:25,00:25:27,"That would work against some animals, though, wouldn't it?"
00:25:27,00:25:28,They're playing dead.
00:25:28,00:25:29,Yeah. It's a big risk.
00:25:29,00:25:30,It's a big risk.
00:25:30,00:25:33,"Brown bears and black bears, there's a different one of them."
00:25:33,00:25:35,"I think brown bears, nothing works."
00:25:35,00:25:36,Because they're faster.
00:25:36,00:25:38,They can climb trees and they can just.
00:25:38,00:25:44,"And then with black bears, I think you're supposed to kind of take your clothes off and slowly walk away from them"
00:25:44,00:25:47,so that they get confused about what your clothes are.
00:25:47,00:25:49,You're just trying to make me have an embarrassing bear.

00:25:54,00:25:56,was found naked and mortal.
00:25:56,00:25:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:59,00:26:01,"Back on the way, they taste things."
00:26:01,00:26:05,So they have this fork tongue and they stick it out and it gets like all the chemicals and the information from the air.
00:26:05,00:26:11,And then they retract it into their mouth and they rub it into pads on the bottom of their mouth.
00:26:11,00:26:16,And then they have to close their mouth and the pads on the bottom of their mouth touch the top of their mouth.
00:26:16,00:26:18,And that contains an organ that gives it to their brain.
00:26:18,00:26:21,"So every time they want to taste something, you get it on your tongue, put it on the bottom of your mouth,"
00:26:21,00:26:23,"close your mouth, put it on the top of your mouth."
00:26:23,00:26:24,It just seems like a real dilemma.
00:26:24,00:26:25,That does.
00:26:25,00:26:26,That does.
00:26:26,00:26:28,But that does seem like a connoisseur as well.
00:26:28,00:26:29,"It does, doesn't it?"
00:26:29,00:26:30,Like what a professional.
00:26:30,00:26:32,It feels like someone's really tasting their food.
00:26:32,00:26:36,"So in your mythical commuter dragon restaurant, there'll be a lot of consideration going on."
00:26:36,00:26:40,"And getting notes of carcass, but also excrement."
00:26:40,00:26:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:41,00:26:43,Maybe that's why she laid still as well.
00:26:43,00:26:47,"She thought, I mean, how often do you change your mind about the restaurant you're going to as soon as you get up to it"
00:26:47,00:26:48,and see a better one next door?
00:26:48,00:26:49,Yes.
00:26:49,00:26:50,She knew she was bad tasting.
00:26:50,00:26:51,"Yeah, exactly."
00:26:51,00:26:52,Two and a half miles away.
00:26:52,00:26:53,This commuter dragon made a booking.
00:26:53,00:26:54,Yeah.
00:26:54,00:26:55,He was on his way.
00:26:55,00:26:57,Are we sure she wasn't lying still covering herself in feces?
00:26:57,00:26:58,She probably was.
00:26:58,00:27:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:01,00:27:02,So there is a thing.
00:27:02,00:27:07,"Their metabolism is a really slow reptiles, as we know, because they're, as we say, cold-blooded."
00:27:07,00:27:10,But their muscles can stay working for hours after death.
00:27:10,00:27:14,"So there was an Atlantic article all about the process of dissecting a commuter dragon,"
00:27:14,00:27:15,which is very hard.
00:27:15,00:27:17,"Very low to the nose of knives, because their skin is so tough."
00:27:17,00:27:18,Really?
00:27:18,00:27:21,"Yeah. And one of the students who was doing it, called Viv Allen,"
00:27:21,00:27:25,"said that she'd been studying an alligator, which would be shot, had a massive hole in his head."
00:27:25,00:27:29,"And she stuck a knife into the alligator, and it walked off the table."
00:27:29,00:27:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:30,00:27:34,"And they freaked out, obviously, because it was dead."
00:27:34,00:27:37,But their metabolism is so slow that their muscles can stay working for hours.
00:27:37,00:27:42,"And if you hit the right nerve center, you can trigger lots of muscular contractions."
00:27:42,00:27:45,"And she said, we freaked out. It just wouldn't stop moving."
00:27:45,00:27:47,We cut its head off just to make sure.
00:27:47,00:27:49,And then one of the undergrads was sick in it.
00:27:49,00:27:51,"Oh, cut."
00:27:51,00:27:52,Wow.
00:27:52,00:27:53,I know.
00:27:53,00:27:59,"Just quickly on reptiles surviving after they've been killed, a snake remains completely alive after you decapitate it."
00:27:59,00:28:02,"Not just muscle, not just muscles, like spasming or anything."
00:28:02,00:28:05,A snake's head is totally alive for about an hour.
00:28:05,00:28:08,"And after a full hour, it can see you and decide it's pissed off with you,"
00:28:08,00:28:13,"because you've cut its head from its body, and head it, so I don't know how it heads over to you."
00:28:13,00:28:16,But crawl its way over to you on its head and bite you.
00:28:16,00:28:17,That's amazing.
00:28:17,00:28:20,It's because they've got these ridiculously slow metabolism.
00:28:20,00:28:21,That's hilarious.
00:28:21,00:28:22,That's amazing.
00:28:22,00:28:23,So creepy.
00:28:23,00:28:26,"It must be weird if they actually say, like, chase a mouse and they catch it and they eat it,"
00:28:26,00:28:28,but it just walks through.
00:28:28,00:28:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:35,00:28:39,"OK, it is time to move on to our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:28:39,00:28:45,"OK, my fact this week is that you can improve your darts game by training yourself to dream about darts."
00:28:45,00:28:49,"But it's not worth it, because you have to dream about darts all the time."
00:28:49,00:28:51,"Well, you know, there are worse dreams."
00:28:51,00:28:53,It's not a nightmare at least.
00:28:53,00:28:54,What depends on the game?
00:28:54,00:28:56,The dartboard is chasing you. It's a nightmare.
00:28:56,00:28:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:58,00:29:01,"And it's trying to throw darts into your body and say, see how you like it."
00:29:01,00:29:04,I don't think that would improve your game if that's the way you dream about it.
00:29:04,00:29:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:05,00:29:09,"Now, the way that this works, it was a study which they did on lucid dreamers."
00:29:09,00:29:12,And these are people who can kind of decide what they're going to dream about.
00:29:12,00:29:14,And it's the thing you can train yourself to do.
00:29:14,00:29:19,"You go to sleep, and then you realize you're asleep, and you can say, OK, now I'm going to chase dragons,"
00:29:19,00:29:22,"because I know I'm asleep, whereas most people just dream passively."
00:29:22,00:29:26,"Anyway, they got these people who could lucid dream to practice darts,"
00:29:26,00:29:30,"and they tested them afterwards, and the ones who did it were better at darts,"
00:29:30,00:29:32,and the ones who didn't do it were worse at darts.
00:29:32,00:29:34,That's how you go.
00:29:34,00:29:38,"Although they did specify that if people, the third group that practice darts in their waking life"
00:29:38,00:29:40,were even better than the ones who practiced it in their sleep.
00:29:40,00:29:41,Sure.
00:29:41,00:29:45,"But I imagine if you practice in your waking life and practice while you're asleep,"
00:29:45,00:29:47,you're going to be even better.
00:29:47,00:29:51,"So it sounds like this is quite early research, like the controversial as well."
00:29:51,00:29:54,A lot of people aren't sure whether or not it does actually improve.
00:29:54,00:29:56,It's just a small pool of stuff.
00:29:56,00:29:57,"Oh, it's a small study, yeah."
00:29:57,00:29:58,Yeah.
00:29:58,00:29:59,"But the thing is, it definitely does work."
00:29:59,00:30:02,"I don't want to say definitely just in case, but it does appear to work,"
00:30:02,00:30:05,"is kind of in sport, just imagining that you're going to do something,"
00:30:05,00:30:10,and that really helps your body to prepare for muscle memory and things like that.
00:30:10,00:30:11,I can absolutely believe it.
00:30:11,00:30:13,Haven't there been studies on people with their arms and casts
00:30:13,00:30:17,who've been asked to visualise themselves doing exercises with that arm?
00:30:17,00:30:18,Yes.
00:30:18,00:30:21,"And it's been, their arm has become stronger than if they were,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,than if they were not doing those visualisations.
00:30:23,00:30:24,"Oh, wow."
00:30:24,00:30:25,"Yeah, it absolutely."
00:30:25,00:30:27,"So that is, I mean, dreaming doesn't sound very far from that at all."
00:30:27,00:30:28,I believe it.
00:30:28,00:30:32,"There was one thing about this study as well with the lucid dreamers about darts,"
00:30:32,00:30:34,dreams being what they are.
00:30:34,00:30:37,Sometimes they weren't exactly the same as a darts game.
00:30:37,00:30:42,"So one of the people was throwing a dartboard that was actually looked exactly like a tree stump,"
00:30:42,00:30:44,but that still helped them to get better.
00:30:44,00:30:45,"Oh, sure."
00:30:45,00:30:46,"So is it wood in the real world, I guess?"
00:30:46,00:30:47,Yeah.
00:30:47,00:30:50,"It's like, you find out the dartboard is your mum, that's different."
00:30:50,00:30:53,"No, but I think the idea is, even if a dartboard turns into your mum"
00:30:53,00:30:56,"and you turn out to be naked and you're flying over Australia,"
00:30:56,00:30:59,then you're still going to be better because you practice the darts bit.
00:30:59,00:31:03,"Imagine if you got to the competition, you needed those exact conditions."
00:31:03,00:31:07,"I'm Phil Taylor, the darts player."
00:31:07,00:31:08,Yeah.
00:31:08,00:31:09,He dreams about darts.
00:31:09,00:31:11,So sometimes I'm playing darts in my sleep and I wake myself up.
00:31:11,00:31:12,I hate it.
00:31:12,00:31:15,"Drives me crackers because if I have a catnet, I'm dreaming about bloody darts."
00:31:15,00:31:16,Yeah.
00:31:16,00:31:19,So he is the best darts player of all time.
00:31:19,00:31:20,Right.
00:31:20,00:31:23,And he probably plays darts all the time in his normal life
00:31:23,00:31:25,because otherwise how would he get so good?
00:31:25,00:31:26,Yeah.
00:31:26,00:31:29,And he's probably just dreaming because you often dream about what you're doing.
00:31:29,00:31:30,Yeah.
00:31:30,00:31:31,You love them.
00:31:31,00:31:32,"Actually, he's deliberately doing its practice."
00:31:32,00:31:35,"Like if you play a computer game and when you close your eyes at night,"
00:31:35,00:31:37,you can see images from the computer game.
00:31:37,00:31:38,"Yeah, the Tetris effect."
00:31:38,00:31:41,"Yeah, I used to get that all the time, but I used to play a lot of computer games."
00:31:41,00:31:46,Supposedly when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip went on a tour of Australia
00:31:46,00:31:50,and they did something like 56 towns in 57 days.
00:31:50,00:31:55,So it was a megator. Philip at that point was dreaming of just waving in his dreams.
00:31:55,00:31:57,"Yeah, I don't know if that's a proper fact."
00:31:57,00:32:01,"It's in the crown, but I assume they pulled that from a book somewhere."
00:32:01,00:32:02,Wow.
00:32:02,00:32:03,You love the crown so much.
00:32:03,00:32:05,I can't believe it's taken you so long to crowbar it into this.
00:32:05,00:32:06,I know.
00:32:06,00:32:07,What is the crown?
00:32:07,00:32:08,Is it a film?
00:32:08,00:32:09,It's a Netflix.
00:32:09,00:32:11,It's written by Peter Morgan who wrote the Queen.
00:32:11,00:32:12,Right.
00:32:12,00:32:15,So he's very factual in his writing.
00:32:15,00:32:19,"And yeah, neither of those stories mentions that they're all lizards."
00:32:19,00:32:20,Weirdly.
00:32:20,00:32:27,Have you ever seen the Queen try and catch a fly with her marshmallow-like tongue?
00:32:27,00:32:29,Like Ozzie LB8.
00:32:29,00:32:30,I know.
00:32:30,00:32:33,And I've sent all those emails about the honours committee to my management.
00:32:33,00:32:34,Incredible.
00:32:34,00:32:35,I'm filled the power.
00:32:35,00:32:37,So the nickname the power.
00:32:37,00:32:42,I went on to Wikipedia and saw a big list of all because they've all got sort of WWF nicknames
00:32:42,00:32:44,that they bring to the sport.
00:32:44,00:32:48,But what's really exciting is there's a lot of puns.
00:32:48,00:32:51,So Antonio Alcinas.
00:32:51,00:32:52,He's Spanish.
00:32:52,00:32:54,So what do you reckon his is?
00:32:54,00:32:55,Antonio Alcinas.
00:32:55,00:32:56,I don't know.
00:32:56,00:32:57,El d'Artador.
00:32:57,00:32:58,So that's it.
00:32:58,00:32:59,El d'Artador.
00:32:59,00:33:00,Jamie Harvey.
00:33:00,00:33:01,He's from Scotland.
00:33:01,00:33:02,What's his pun?
00:33:02,00:33:04,Tossing the dart.
00:33:04,00:33:06,"No, Scotland."
00:33:06,00:33:08,Like Scotland the brave.
00:33:08,00:33:09,Some pun on this.
00:33:09,00:33:10,Brave dart.
00:33:10,00:33:11,Oh.
00:33:11,00:33:13,Mark Frost.
00:33:13,00:33:14,Where's he from?
00:33:14,00:33:15,Is he from Dartford?
00:33:15,00:33:20,Because otherwise I reckon we're going to struggle with someone from Dartford.
00:33:20,00:33:22,Could anybody be beaten by someone from Dartmore?
00:33:22,00:33:30,"So the earliest form of darts, do you know why it was banned?"
00:33:30,00:33:31,Why?
00:33:31,00:33:33,Do you know that it was banned?
00:33:33,00:33:35,It was because people kept on dying.
00:33:35,00:33:38,It's the earliest form of darts wall.
00:33:38,00:33:39,Yes.
00:33:39,00:33:44,"No, it was called Puff and Dart and it involved a blowpipe."
00:33:44,00:33:48,"And you go, you know, you would blow the dart towards the board."
00:33:48,00:33:52,"And eventually, I mean, people kept on swallowing them by mistake."
00:33:52,00:33:53,And they could be--
00:33:53,00:33:54,Shucking instead of blowing.
00:33:54,00:33:55,Yeah.
00:33:55,00:33:56,They could be quite small.
00:33:56,00:34:00,"And so eventually they thought, why don't we just get rid of the blowpipe element of the darts game?"
00:34:00,00:34:05,"Did you see read about that man last year or the year before last, who inhaled a dart?"
00:34:05,00:34:09,But he inhaled a rubber dart 44 years ago.
00:34:09,00:34:13,"And his parents took him to Annie and said, we think our sons inhaled a dart."
00:34:13,00:34:15,"And they said, there's not really a dart in there, go away."
00:34:15,00:34:17,And then he didn't know about this.
00:34:17,00:34:19,And he's always had sinus problems.
00:34:19,00:34:20,And he sneezed.
00:34:20,00:34:21,This is in 2015.
00:34:21,00:34:22,He sneezed.
00:34:22,00:34:25,Please tell me you was standing right next to the dart bottle.
00:34:25,00:34:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:27,00:34:31,"And he took him 5,000 pounds for prize money and the rubber dart."
00:34:31,00:34:34,So he sneezed and the rubber dart came out.
00:34:34,00:34:37,And it had been sitting in his nose for the last 44 years.
00:34:37,00:34:38,That is unbelievable.
00:34:38,00:34:40,"James, you know darts terminology because you're a fan of the sport."
00:34:40,00:34:41,Sure.
00:34:41,00:34:44,"Have you heard of the phrase, wankers 50?"
00:34:44,00:34:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:47,00:34:48,I haven't.
00:34:48,00:34:49,"No, what is a wankers 50?"
00:34:49,00:34:51,It's-- I don't know if this is common or rare.
00:34:51,00:34:52,It doesn't seem common.
00:34:52,00:34:54,"It's where you're aiming for a bullseye, which is 50."
00:34:54,00:34:55,"Oh, yeah."
00:34:55,00:34:58,"But you hit single 20, single 18, and single 12 instead."
00:34:58,00:34:59,OK.
00:34:59,00:35:01,"So you do score 50, but you use three darts."
00:35:01,00:35:05,"OK, have you heard of bagadix, which is B-A-G-A-D-I-X?"
00:35:05,00:35:06,"Oh, it's not an acronym."
00:35:06,00:35:07,No.
00:35:07,00:35:08,Oh.
00:35:08,00:35:11,What would begin with X in that acronym?
00:35:11,00:35:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:13,00:35:14,It's rhyming slang.
00:35:14,00:35:15,It's not an acronym.
00:35:15,00:35:16,OK.
00:35:16,00:35:17,It's rhyming slang for 26.
00:35:17,00:35:20,"Oh, because if you're aiming for the treble 20,"
00:35:20,00:35:23,"you miss it on one side and get one, and on the other side you get five."
00:35:23,00:35:24,Exactly.
00:35:24,00:35:26,"And I call that B and B, but I don't know why we call it that."
00:35:26,00:35:31,"B and B is 2 and 6, and 2 and 6 is how much a bed and breakfast used to cost in the UK,"
00:35:31,00:35:34,"in two shillings and six months, in pre-decentralisation characters."
00:35:34,00:35:35,So what's bagadix?
00:35:35,00:35:36,26.
00:35:36,00:35:38,"You know that as in, I don't know."
00:35:38,00:35:43,"Should in that, like most rhyming slang has a meaning to a thing it's wrong to."
00:35:43,00:35:44,You know a bag.
00:35:44,00:35:45,Yeah.
