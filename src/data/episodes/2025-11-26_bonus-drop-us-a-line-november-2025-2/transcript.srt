 [telephone ringing]

00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,400
 You don't want it or who don't want it to be?

00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,380
 [upbeat music]

00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,560
 [upbeat music]

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,960
 - Hi!

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,800
 - Hello, Andy.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,200
 - Hey, guys.

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,440
 Welcome to Drop Is Alive.

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,060
 Welcome to all of you listening, or watching,

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,520
 at home, or at your place of work.

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,360
 - And nothing?

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,920
 - No, no, Andy has said work or home.

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,840
 - Oh, is that the only two places you're allowed to be?

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,680
 - Apparently.

15
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,440
 - The other places, a third space, stop,

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,740
 and resume when you've got time to properly focus

17
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,660
 on what's going on.

18
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,600
 It's been a great, great couple of weeks in the inbox.

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,920
 - It's been wriggling the inbox.

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
 - Really?

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,800
 - Absolutely writhing.

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,720
 - Yeah. - Not bulging?

23
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
 - No, no, no.

24
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,520
 It's, it's, it's developed, it's got worse than that.

25
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,240
 - Oh, it's, it's crawling.

26
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,080
 - What's happened?

27
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,440
 Why is it changed?

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,560
 - Well, we've gone fortnightly.

29
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,200
 So, you know, people have picked up the pace.

30
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,440
 We've got people writing, now people,

31
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,800
 a lot more people are sending in facts,

32
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,880
 'cause we've lost the fact show, little fish.

33
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,720
 - Oh yeah.

34
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,120
 - So a lot more people are sending in their facts for that show,

35
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,360
 which is great, podcast@QI.com.

36
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,240
 If you've got a fact, or a bone to pick,

37
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,720
 then send it our way.

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,560
 - Great.

39
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,960
 - Yeah, let's get to those bones now.

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,320
 - Should we start with a treat?

41
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,160
 - Yes, we are.

42
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,400
 - Okay, 'cause we always start with the, you know,

43
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,080
 maybe a quibble, maybe you've got it wrong,

44
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,440
 and there's plenty of that coming out.

45
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,260
 - Oh, no.

46
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,100
 - Flenty.

47
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,220
 - Should we not save the treat for dessert?

48
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,980
 - I don't think you'll feel hungry anymore,

49
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,860
 once I've read out some of the complaints I've got for you.

50
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,700
 - Right.

51
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,060
 - No, this is a really exciting thing.

52
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,900
 I don't know if you remember.

53
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,260
 We've got a bit of correspondence from Jodie,

54
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,100
 little while ago.

55
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,900
 - Oh, Jodie, yeah, I remember Jodie.

56
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,380
 - Yeah, saying we're getting married,

57
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,020
 and we're having a heritage rail themed wedding.

58
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,860
 - Oh, yeah.

59
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,700
 - That's right, Jodie.

60
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,060
 - You're our kind of person, Jodie and James.

61
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,220
 And they were doing small coal as wedding favors.

62
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,060
 (Jodie laughs)

63
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,340
 Just did it on my heart, 'cause we said ages ago,

64
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,860
 what do they use for coal, on model rowers?

65
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,540
 They use small coal.

66
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,980
 - Small coal, yeah.

67
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,100
 - Anyway, Jodie writes, as promised,

68
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,180
 here is the candy coal we handed out as favors at our wedding.

69
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,660
 It was a fantastic day.

70
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,740
 The wedding went off without a hitch.

71
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,500
 - Oh, 'cause your hitch carriages on Twitch are that.

72
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,340
 (Jodie laughs)

73
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,180
 - Okay.

74
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,540
 - And all the guests were absolutely steaming.

75
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,820
 That's my little drug.

76
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,460
 - How is the train of her dress?

77
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,740
 - Oh, yeah, beautiful.

78
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,740
 - Oh, very nice.

79
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,420
 - Really good, as was her carriage and he railing.

80
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,220
 (Jodie laughs)

81
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,980
 - Oh my god.

82
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,620
 - It doesn't say in her letter.

83
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,460
 - Okay.

84
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,300
 - Brilliant.

85
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,220
 But anyway, look, each of you has a little bag of candy coal.

86
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,060
 - Dan, that's for you.

87
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,900
 - Wow.

88
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,100
 - Oh, no, look at this.

89
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,940
 - Thank you.

90
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,780
 - A little sack of coal.

91
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,540
 Normally, it means you've been a bad boy,

92
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,540
 getting a piece of coal.

93
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,300
 - Yeah, but this is a mark of favor from Jodie and James.

94
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,580
 So thank you so much.

95
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,860
 - Okay, so what is this?

96
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,940
 - This, I don't know.

97
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,580
 - Looks, it doesn't look.

98
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,420
 - It's edible.

99
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,260
 - It looks like it could be heroin.

100
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,740
 She does, actually, she encloses a spoon and a lighter.

101
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,420
 And I think, right, here we go.

102
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,260
 Oh my god.

103
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,100
 - Oh, I love it.

104
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,820
 - Just tastes like slightly stale chocolate cake.

105
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,340
 (Jodie laughs)

106
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,860
 It's been in the box for ages.

107
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,940
 - It's got Oreo cookies, Oreo vibe.

108
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,340
 It's very Oreo-coated.

109
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,500
 Anyway, thank you so much, Jodie and James.

110
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,580
 Welcome to Married Life.

111
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,420
 - Yeah.

112
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,100
 - If you're listening to this and you're married,

113
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,500
 you two must send us tribute.

114
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,580
 (Jodie laughs)

115
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,420
 - No, that's brilliant.

116
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,260
 Congratulations, guys.

117
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,260
 - Right. - We're wonderful.

118
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,020
 - Right, we're off the blocks, but we are on the hook.

119
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,180
 - Okay. - Okay, dammit.

120
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,660
 A lot of comments have come in about things

121
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,740
 we said about the Second World War.

122
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,580
 - Oh.

123
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,420
 - It's an episode.

124
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,420
 - And Alton. - Right.

125
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,140
 - And great news.

126
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,300
 It's all complaints about stuff.

127
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,260
 Ben said nothing about what we said.

128
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,540
 We're fine.

129
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,380
 - Ben's in trouble.

130
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,220
 - Okay.

131
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,180
 Ben's in trouble with the people of Canada,

132
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,180
 and Australia, and New Zealand, and also India,

133
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,820
 for saying the Britain stood alone for a year

134
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,660
 in the Second World War.

135
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,420
 When, in fact, all of those countries.

136
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,340
 - And the wider Commonwealth were very much on team GB

137
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,580
 for that spell.

138
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,220
 And contributing lots of, you know, stuff, food, supplies,

139
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,060
 soldiers, all of that.

140
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,060
 - Yeah, yeah.

141
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,180
 - So Erin Thomas just wants to point out Canada

142
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,260
 was there every step of the way

143
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,940
 from the Declaration of War until peace was declared.

144
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,340
 Mayor Brown writes, for a man who says he's read

145
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,380
 an awful lot of books on World War II,

146
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,100
 Ben Elton's egregious declaration that Britain stood alone

147
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,540
 for a full year against Germany was patently false.

148
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,220
 And Geoffrey Partiger has a little bit of extra spicy stuff

149
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,860
 about a lances.

150
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,700
 - Oh.

151
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,540
 (laughing)

152
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,020
 - So that was the fact, was your fact, wasn't it?

153
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,580
 - Yeah, we had, the army was still using lances.

154
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,060
 - Tell the first World War.

155
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,460
 - Yeah, 'til 1927.

156
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,780
 Your terrific guest, Ben Elton, expressed his doubts

157
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,140
 regarding the use of lances.

158
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,940
 But there's also an example of the miracle on the vestula

159
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,060
 in the summer of 1920, so socket Elton writes Geoffrey.

160
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,900
 - Okay.

161
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,300
 (laughing)

162
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,140
 - Yep.

163
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,820
 There was a place, there's a thing called the miracle

164
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,500
 on the vestula, which was the red army against Polish cavalry.

165
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,100
 And it was, it was thanks to Polish cavalry with lances.

166
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,300
 And in the same campaign, there were 20,000 men

167
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,780
 on horseback charging each other with lances couch

168
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,620
 at the Battle of Comorov.

169
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,620
 So there you go.

170
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,300
 So anyway, lances remain useful.

171
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,620
 - And Canada also.

172
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,140
 - And Canada also, mainly Canada,

173
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,340
 but I mean, full credit, full credit to almost everyone involved.

174
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,180
 - Yeah.

175
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,100
 - Well, I'll cut this up and send it to Ben.

176
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,140
 I'm sure he'll be very here.

177
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,980
 - The dish is it out.

178
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,220
 - Yeah, absolutely.

179
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,700
 - Yeah, that's a fact check.

180
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,020
 Right, now I've got a new section for us.

181
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,020
 - Oh, exciting.

182
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,100
 - The, you said it wrong underground chamber of nightmares.

183
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,940
 - Okay.

184
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,780
 - Now entering.

185
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,660
 - Is that a pronunciation thing?

186
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,500
 - Sonny is.

187
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
 - Is it done?

188
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,220
 - It's, no, it's me.

189
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,140
 - Oh, okay.

190
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,980
 - Interesting.

191
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,500
 - Oh, there's a bit for Dan later.

192
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,940
 - On a previous drop as a line, I said

193
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,860
 that Daniel from Wagger Wagger had written.

194
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,980
 And I've had several Australians right in saying

195
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,980
 it's pronounced Wagger Wagger.

196
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,700
 - Oh, that's just your accent, Andy.

197
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,180
 - That's just my accent.

198
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,940
 - If you say it correctly, like Andy does.

199
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,780
 - Why?

200
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,060
 (laughing)

201
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,420
 - Jeff Salfall writes, Australian and Melbourne here.

202
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,660
 A friend of mine was briefly a DJ and Wagger Wagger

203
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,220
 and was given strict instructions on how to say it.

204
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,820
 So firstly, everyone in Australia knows it isn't said

205
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,300
 for them as in hat, but as if it's spelled Wagger Wagger.

206
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,700
 So I'm very sorry.

207
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,940
 Dan, you didn't help me out there.

208
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,140
 - Yeah, I mean, I've heard of Wagger Wagger.

209
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,140
 They might have been a Wagger Wagger as well.

210
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,180
 Like Australia's massive, it's got lots of names.

211
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,380
 I don't know where we're always talking about.

212
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,540
 - Fair enough.

213
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,540
 - I'd be astonished if there isn't a Wagger Wagger,

214
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,020
 a Wagger Wagger, a Wagger Wagger and a Wigger Wigger.

215
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,020
 - There you go.

216
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,580
 - I think we need to name check pronunciation

217
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,100
 anything Australian now because our hit rate is pretty intense.

218
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,940
 - Bad.

219
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,940
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

220
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,700
 And we have a huge listenership there.

221
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,340
 - Yeah, that's our third most listened to country.

222
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,380
 - The nullable road train has kept rolling into the inbox.

223
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,020
 But are we gonna stop doing it?

224
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,460
 - If we discovered beforehand, it's not pronounced like that.

225
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,300
 Yeah, we will.

226
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,420
 - Okay, but apparently we even said Melbourne wrong last time.

227
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,260
 - So...

228
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,260
 - What did we say?

229
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,260
 - I can't remember, Sydney.

230
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,100
 - That's right.

231
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,100
 - Well, just to go elsewhere,

232
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,340
 we're still in the Chamber of Nightmares,

233
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,900
 but Alex Tewski has written,

234
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,180
 I listened to this week's episode of "Fish During a Long Drive"

235
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,700
 during which I was amused by Dan's mispronunciation

236
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,700
 of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana,

237
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,300
 which is pronounced Notre Dame.

238
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,140
 - Right.

239
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,980
 - He said Notre Dame.

240
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,060
 - Yeah, that feels like an affectation.

241
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,220
 - I think so.

242
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,380
 - Like Mordlin College and...

243
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,220
 - Exactly.

244
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,060
 - Yeah.

245
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,820
 - And Laffborough, and I just think it's clearly Notre Dame,

246
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,660
 isn't it?

247
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,500
 (laughing)

248
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,740
 - Clearly Notre Dame.

249
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,580
 - How it looks.

250
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,540
 - Where's the hunchback from?

251
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,780
 (laughing)

252
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,020
 - The hunchback of Notre Dame is a funny idea for something.

253
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,580
 - Yeah.

254
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,420
 - It's his college years, I suppose.

255
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,900
 - Oh, yes.

256
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,060
 - That's good, and he's called a hunchback.

257
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,300
 - This is...

258
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,780
 - Sometimes things just write themselves instantly,

259
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,620
 and here we are.

260
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,860
 - It's weird how nothing good ever writes itself.

261
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,700
 - No.

262
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,540
 (laughing)

263
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,780
 - It's always really weak puns that write themselves.

264
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,620
 - Yeah.

265
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,940
 - I actually dreamt an idea for a movie the other night,

266
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,980
 which I wasn't gonna bring up.

267
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,820
 - Oh God.

268
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
 - Oh God, go on then.

269
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,820
 - Okay.

270
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,180
 And it's because it's a fish related thing, it's okay.

271
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,460
 It's like a Guinness World Records jamboree day, right?

272
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,020
 At a big conference center,

273
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,060
 but the plot of die hard happens.

274
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,020
 So like terrorists break in,

275
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,700
 and they're trying to steal something big,

276
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,940
 that's happens to be held in this big conference center.

277
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,900
 - The world's biggest something, presumably.

278
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,740
 - That's it.

279
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,740
 - They're trying to steal the world's biggest.

280
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,940
 - Oh, don't tell me.

281
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,740
 - You're giving me a half bags idea,

282
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,580
 and I'm gonna fill it out, aren't I?

283
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,780
 - I'm giving you 10% J.

284
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,620
 - It's a great idea.

285
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,460
 - But how many people are gonna get it?

286
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,620
 - I can see it's a great idea.

287
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,700
 - So, okay, the main character

288
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,140
 is the Craig Glenday editor figure, right?

289
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,020
 Who doesn't have any special skills himself.

290
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,820
 Apart from, he can stop a stopwatch exactly

291
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,740
 at the time he needs to,

292
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,820
 'cause he's been doing that all day.

293
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,220
 - He's like Hawkeye from the Avengers.

294
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,940
 - He doesn't really have any skills,

295
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,980
 but he's quite good at one thing.

296
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,220
 - But the stopwatch is his one skill.

297
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,300
 So the terrorist break in,

298
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,780
 obviously a Ragtag band of insane record breakers

299
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,460
 has to drop water balance on their stomachs

300
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,340
 and to feed them all.

301
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,620
 - Oh, yeah, like you can see someone being stabbed

302
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,900
 with a sword, but it happens to be a sword swallower

303
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,460
 and it goes in their mouth, it does nothing.

304
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,300
 - Exactly.

305
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,980
 - To them, just like this is a,

306
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,340
 I think a legitimately reasonable idea.

307
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,180
 - Yeah, I think it's something that could clear a committee

308
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,100
 of Hollywood brains.

309
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,420
 Something's really high up, how are we gonna get to it?

310
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,620
 Oh my god, the Guinness World Records

311
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,220
 for the most cherished stacked.

312
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,140
 - All the longest arm.

313
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,340
 - All the longest arm.

314
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,220
 - Guys, I think it's a sketch.

315
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,740
 I'm not sure we can squeeze two and a half hours out.

316
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,500
 - I think it's a Friday minute long, so yeah, I agree.

317
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,300
 This is the next Avengers.

318
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,140
 The mediocre's.

319
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,580
 - And it comes down to it, like the final bit is,

320
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,820
 the bomb's gonna go off,

321
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,380
 unless we can cut these wires at exactly the right time.

322
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,180
 Up steps, the hero, Mr. Stopwatch.

323
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,260
 - But that doesn't cut wires, right?

324
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,460
 - Yeah, but he's timing when exactly to do it.

325
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
 - Okay, right.

326
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

327
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,140
 - Like that's his skill.

328
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,700
 - And then there's someone with the Guinness World Record

329
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,180
 for most successfully defused bombs.

330
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,660
 - He just has to cut the wire at the right time,

331
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,740
 but he's quite poignant because he thinks he's not,

332
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,020
 he thinks he doesn't have a skill, right?

333
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,940
 And he's gone his whole life

334
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,300
 surrounded by these amazing people

335
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,900
 who have these bizarre talents.

336
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,700
 And he's always felt a bit bad about himself, you know?

337
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,220
 So actually, it's quite moving.

338
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,860
 - Okay, it's really good.

339
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,060
 I mean, what's it called?

340
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,260
 - Ooh.

341
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,180
 - Don't know.

342
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,580
 - Don't know.

343
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,580
 Coming to one sketch of a new sketch show, here you.

344
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,900
 - In fairness, that was a tough one

345
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,540
 to put him on the spotlight, man.

346
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,860
 - But you've got a lot in the dream, Dan.

347
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,300
 A lot of work done in the dream.

348
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,140
 That's great.

349
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,140
 - It started in the dream

350
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,620
 because I was flying a plane in the dream,

351
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,660
 but it was about to fly into a shopping center

352
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,300
 and I was thinking, oh no, we're gonna crash.

353
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,620
 But then I remembered in the shopping center today

354
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,740
 that I have a demonstration of the world's largest balloon.

355
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,820
 Okay, so I'll just fly the plane into that.

356
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,900
 And that'll save everyone.

357
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,100
 It's a really good idea.

358
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,940
 - Thank you.

359
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,020
 - I mean, oh god, I started crying with laughter again.

360
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,820
 I can't be crying with laughter this early in the show, you know.

361
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,660
 - Do you know what I mean?

362
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,500
 - Absolutely.

363
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

364
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
 - Okay.

365
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,540
 - Okay, so it's noted, Dave.

366
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,940
 - Yeah, it's the point I'm trying to make.

367
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,220
 Which is another great movie.

368
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,300
 That's another great movie.

369
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,500
 The Hunchback Collegios.

370
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,820
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

371
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,660
 Okay.

372
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,100
 Right, fan theory corner.

373
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,940
 - Cool.

374
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,020
 - Logan Emory writes, this is about dreams, actually.

375
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,260
 I was listening to an old episode

376
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,180
 in which one of you mentioned

377
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,660
 that a lot of people listened to fish to fall asleep.

378
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,260
 I don't know who said it or what episode it was

379
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,740
 because I was listening as I fell asleep,

380
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,500
 but it started me thinking about why that is.

381
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,420
 I vaguely remember someone, Andy,

382
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,340
 mentioning cognitive shuffling,

383
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,540
 but that may have also been a figment of my imagination.

384
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,700
 Stay with it.

385
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,260
 Essentially, you think of a word, fish,

386
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,580
 and then think of words that start

387
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,740
 with each letter of that word.

388
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,060
 - That's the way to get a sleep.

389
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,900
 - Exactly.

390
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,100
 So, friend, icicle, shortbread, honeybee,

391
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,340
 would be fish.

392
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,620
 The idea is that this replicates the sort of half dreams

393
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,140
 you have as you're falling asleep.

394
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,060
 You know, when images start to sort of flip around

395
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,220
 in your mind a bit.

396
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,500
 My theory is that the tangential associations

397
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,580
 and scattered nature of fish,

398
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,580
 I'll show, mimic micro dreams,

399
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,700
 the same way that that technique does.

400
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,940
 So, you can zone in and out

401
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,100
 and get this collection of images and words

402
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,460
 without thinking of them yourself.

403
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,180
 Could be that, it could be just that we're really tedious.

404
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,460
 Yes.

405
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,460
 - Oh, good.

406
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,620
 - It could.

407
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,740
 - It's so horrific.

408
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,580
 - Yeah.

409
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,100
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

410
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,980
 - Now, I see what I see what he's saying,

411
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,020
 'cause it means you won't get fixated on one thing

412
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,780
 'cause we move around from that subject to another.

413
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,620
 - Exactly.

414
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,140
 So, I think that's a very plausible theory.

415
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,980
 I like it.

416
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,820
 - Yes, really good.

417
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,660
 - Yeah, yeah.

418
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,660
 And as we've seen, it comes up with that

419
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,660
 major franchise ideas as well.

420
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,420
 - 'Cause I sometimes fall asleep to the podcast

421
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,260
 of Richard Herring playing Snookle with himself.

422
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,100
 - Okay.

423
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,260
 - Not a euphemism.

424
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,100
 And then that really, it's the same thing

425
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,780
 that happens every single game.

426
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,340
 He misses lots and lots and lots of shots.

427
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,740
 And then eventually all the balls get down.

428
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,940
 Again, not a euphemism, but he does find that

429
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,580
 100% of the time it will get me to sleep for a...

430
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,460
 - For a 10 minute nap.

431
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,500
 - For a 10 minute nap.

432
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,340
 - Yeah.

433
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,340
 - Are you needing help to get down for a nap?

434
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,700
 - Well, yeah, that's harder to get down for a nap

435
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,820
 than for a sleep, isn't it?

436
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,660
 'Cause you're not necessarily tired.

437
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,980
 - So this is our afternoon nap, we're talking.

438
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,900
 - Yeah, I can nap very readily.

439
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,540
 - Yeah, I can, but that might change.

440
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,620
 You might need Herring on your side soon.

441
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
 - Herring aids.

442
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,260
 - Yeah, I like it.

443
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,380
 - Anyway, we're going to a fun new place now

444
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,780
 called Place Name City.

445
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,580
 - This is a whole new show, Andy.

446
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,420
 - I know.

447
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,020
 - Okay, where's spicy meat?

448
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,980
 - There's a little bit of meat later on.

449
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,460
 - Does that's what people are chewing them for?

450
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,300
 - That's true.

451
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,820
 - Do you guys remember Zoe Hamburger?

452
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,420
 - Yes.

453
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,940
 - She was the first ever fact on Little Fish.

454
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,500
 - Right, and you, James, said something about.

455
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,700
 - So she was, oh, I see where we're gonna go.

456
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,900
 She worked for McDonald's.

457
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,740
 - Yeah.

458
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,740
 - And I said that her name probably comes

459
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,180
 because her ancestors came from Hamburg.

460
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,220
 And then one of the other two of you said,

461
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,820
 oh, we don't have that in the UK.

462
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,180
 People whose names are from the place

463
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,180
 where they're from, well.

464
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,420
 And we came up with a couple of examples.

465
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,860
 And I can only imagine that the audience back home

466
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,460
 were yelling Tommy Fleetwood at the phone and saw.

467
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,300
 - Who's that?

468
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,300
 - He's a golfer.

469
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,140
 - Of course.

470
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,380
 (laughing)

471
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,020
 - And is there a place called Fleetwood?

472
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,380
 - Yeah, in Lancashire.

473
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,140
 - I've never heard of Fleetwood.

474
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,220
 - What?

475
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,100
 - It's a relatively large town.

476
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,100
 - Is it?

477
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,700
 - Anyway, yeah, we missed a few people with names

478
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
 that are also places.

479
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,540
 - Okay.

480
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,540
 - So Ian Dunn sends in Danza Washington.

481
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,700
 - Oh yeah.

482
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,860
 - I suppose also George Washington.

483
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,860
 - At least slightly the other way around.

484
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,700
 - Yeah.

485
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,700
 (laughing)

486
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,060
 - Irving Berlin.

487
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,900
 - Yeah.

488
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
 - Dion Dublin.

489
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,740
 - Yeah.

490
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,980
 - So there's all great points.

491
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,060
 Emerson Lehmann writes,

492
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,420
 you all forgot about Michael York.

493
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,260
 - Okay.

494
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,100
 - Who?

495
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,780
 - He was in Austin Powers.

496
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,500
 He was, he was.

497
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,340
 - He does alex position.

498
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,180
 - Yes.

499
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,100
 - He's a great actor.

500
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,140
 - Tom Yark.

501
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,380
 - I know heaven from Radiohead.

502
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,220
 - Oh yes.

503
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,060
 - He's Tom Yorky.

504
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:25,900
 - He's Tom Yorky.

505
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,420
 - Yeah, he's no doubt that the chocolate bar isn't here.

506
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,260
 - He's not for girls.

507
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
 (laughing)

508
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,820
 - That's an old-eyed campaign for Yorky.

509
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,980
 For international listeners, it doesn't matter.

510
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,820
 (laughing)

511
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,820
 - Sometimes it's just good to say,

512
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,580
 if you're international listeners, don't worry.

513
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,420
 - I think they do plus over

514
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,100
 a lot of this podcast international listeners.

515
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,940
 - Yeah.

516
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,620
 - Well, I think they do it with love.

517
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,620
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

518
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,780
 - Yeah.

519
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,060
 - Jack writes,

520
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,820
 I have a colleague with the surname Pontifract.

521
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,660
 - Oh, really?

522
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,500
 - Okay.

523
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,940
 - The last surname was Wally, Wally with an H.

524
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,420
 - Like Wally Bridge.

525
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,900
 - Wally in Blackburn?

526
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,140
 Is that the same Wally?

527
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,980
 - Maybe.

528
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,820
 - So name I weigh somewhere.

529
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,740
 - Which links Wally Blackburn,

530
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,660
 whose Abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII.

531
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,140
 With Wally being a popular term of derision in the '80s,

532
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,300
 my family changed our name.

533
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,140
 - Oh, really?

534
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,980
 - Yeah.

535
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,180
 - Tony Blackburn.

536
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,820
 - Tony Blackburn.

537
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,660
 - Yeah.

538
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,500
 - I mean, they're everywhere.

539
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
 - Yeah, Peter English gets in touch.

540
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,340
 - Oh yeah.

541
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,500
 - It's interesting.

542
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,780
 - His surname is ink, the word English.

543
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,620
 - Yeah.

544
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,980
 - But he writes oddly and confusingly,

545
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,860
 the name was not given to a person because they were English.

546
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,340
 It's actually Irish.

547
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,180
 - Is it?

548
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,020
 - What?

549
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,780
 - 'Cause I said, I mentioned Harris English,

550
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,780
 who's another golfer as an example.

551
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,060
 But yeah, maybe Harris English is family and not.

552
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,900
 - This is crazy.

553
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,220
 - So the story is that, Peter writes,

554
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,140
 at the time when surnames were required,

555
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,380
 some rich English people had estates in Ireland

556
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,180
 and locals who were employed to work on those estates

557
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,020
 were given the surname English.

558
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,300
 - Is that crazy?

559
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,900
 - Yeah, yeah.

560
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,460
 - The absolute crown on this one goes to Dan Connelly,

561
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,860
 who writes, he got inspired by our discussion

562
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,780
 of Zoe Hamburger and says,

563
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,460
 "I got thinking about the longest chain you could make

564
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,860
 "of people named for places named for people."

565
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,700
 And so forth.

566
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,540
 - Okay.

567
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,420
 - Give us an example.

568
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,500
 - So for example, Bolivia is named after Simon Bolivar,

569
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,860
 and he was named after the village of Bolivar

570
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,140
 in the bar's country.

571
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,980
 - Lovely.

572
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,140
 - It gives a couple more examples.

573
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,340
 And then the coup de gras, he needs a bit of help

574
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,180
 with the end of it.

575
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,580
 But Houston, Texas.

576
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,500
 - Houston.

577
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,060
 - Houston, Texas.

578
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,580
 - I'm just saving emails.

579
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,620
 - Sounds like Houston, you have a problem, mate.

580
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,460
 - Is it?

581
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,300
 - Yes.

582
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,140
 - Okay.

583
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,300
 - Where is Houston?

584
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,260
 - Hugh, really, Whitney.

585
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,100
 - Brilliant.

586
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,100
 - Houston, Texas.

587
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,940
 - Yeah.

588
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,940
 - Extraordinary.

589
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,460
 (laughing)

590
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,780
 Is named for Sam Houston, whose name comes from Houston

591
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,420
 in Renfrucia, it's called.

592
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,260
 - Yeah.

593
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,620
 - Which was named for Hugh, de Paduinan,

594
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,660
 where Paduinan also refers to a place.

595
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,820
 The bit I haven't managed to track down

596
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,060
 as someone whose name is Houston,

597
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,820
 after Houston, Texas.

598
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,260
 Maybe Whitney, Houston.

599
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,420
 But that will be a person named for a city,

600
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,740
 named for a person, named for a town.

601
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,780
 Name for a person, I've got confused.

602
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,780
 - But it's great, it's very impressive.

603
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,060
 - That's a really good research.

604
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,900
 - Brilliant.

605
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,740
 - Yeah, really good.

606
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,540
 - The infinite loop, helical staircases.

607
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,540
 - Oh yeah.

608
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,860
 - Here we go.

609
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,500
 We, just, it's not a problem, we didn't say anything wrong.

610
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
 - No, I can get us for anything we said.

611
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,420
 (laughing)

612
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,980
 - But Nick Ladner writes, since you mentioned them,

613
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,140
 you might like to know there is a double helic staircase

614
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,060
 at the University of Reading in the chemistry department.

615
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,140
 - Oh, that's very cool.

616
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,980
 - Isn't that good?

617
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,820
 - Yeah, that's awesome.

618
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,740
 And if you flip that over, you'll see a lovely image

619
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,300
 from Galicia, Alvaro Lomba writes,

620
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,540
 at the Galician People's Museum, we have a triple one,

621
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,980
 triple helic staircase.

622
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,820
 - Wow.

623
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,940
 - From 1700.

624
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,780
 - Oh, it's beautiful.

625
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,620
 - How good is that?

626
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,460
 - Yeah.

627
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,300
 - Yeah.

628
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,140
 - Stunning.

629
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,980
 So thank you.

630
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,300
 Dan Cloak, wicked name, that's great name.

631
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,980
 - Points out that we have a triple helic staircase

632
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,220
 in the UK, and in fact it's Hune, or Hune,

633
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,980
 into the rock at Dover.

634
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,820
 - Is that?

635
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,660
 - Yeah.

636
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,340
 - It's called the Grand Shaft.

637
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,140
 This is for troop movements.

638
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,100
 It's from the Second World War,

639
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,940
 or it might even be from an older war,

640
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,900
 like Napoleonic or something,

641
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,740
 but it's to get troops down to the beach in case Napoleon,

642
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,540
 or Hitler is turning up, you need to get three layers

643
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,500
 of soldiers down at the same time

644
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,420
 from the top to the bottom of the cliffs.

645
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,260
 - Cool.

646
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,100
 - How cool is that?

647
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,940
 - That's very cool.

648
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,420
 - And it's called the Grand Shaft, which sounds rude.

649
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,420
 - Is that more or less complicated

650
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,740
 than digging three sets of staircases down?

651
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,380
 - Good question.

652
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,140
 - So no, it's all less complicated than a big pole.

653
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,820
 - Oh, that would not be fun.

654
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,660
 - It would be good.

655
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,500
 - It would be very good.

656
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,180
 - Massive, massive, massive firemen's pole.

657
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,980
 - Yeah, but if you go too fast above the guy below you,

658
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,900
 don't want your lance to go through his head.

659
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,860
 - Are they going down with lances?

660
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,940
 - It feels like you should drop your lance off the top

661
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,500
 before, which carries his own risks, doesn't it?

662
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,340
 - Yeah.

663
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:17,620
 - We've had a serious comment from Stephen Chalena.

664
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,060
 It seems as if Anna has been absent from the no such thing

665
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,820
 as a fish podcast for several weeks now, is she okay?

666
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,820
 Hope she's okay.

667
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,580
 - Yeah, she's doing good.

668
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,420
 - She's fine.

669
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,700
 - I saw her last weekend.

670
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,220
 - Oh yeah, how was she?

671
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,020
 - She was good, she was a bit tired.

672
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,260
 - Yeah.

673
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,420
 - Because she's been listening to the podcast every week,

674
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,900
 and you know, I get to sleep because it's so exciting.

675
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,860
 No, she had her little baby relatively recently

676
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,460
 and she'll be back next year.

677
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,140
 - Excellent, excellent.

678
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,180
 I just like to point out, Stephen adds,

679
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,260
 I miss her.

680
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,780
 Assemblance of sanity amongst a room full of oddness.

681
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,380
 - Ah, now what you've done there is mistaken Anna

682
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,140
 for someone else.

683
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,340
 - Yeah, she's not saying.

684
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,140
 - She's the least sane person I've ever met.

685
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,580
 - She's loopy-loop.

686
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,420
 - I don't know.

687
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,020
 - Oh, that was a compliment.

688
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,020
 What were we called?

689
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,220
 - A room full of oddness.

690
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,340
 - Yeah, love it.

691
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,180
 - We are.

692
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,860
 - That's the title of the film.

693
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,220
 - For the Guinness World Records.

694
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,060
 - Yep.

695
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,340
 - Well, that's, challenge is involved in the royalties.

696
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,220
 - He's on 10%.

697
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,060
 - Okay.

698
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,900
 - You're on 10%.

699
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,740
 - You don't think of--

700
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,220
 - Please, I have the whole saw down them.

701
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,220
 - Yeah, don't know.

702
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,060
 - You're on 10%.

703
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,180
 (laughing)

704
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,580
 - I feel that's for the triple X parody version.

705
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,260
 (laughing)

706
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,620
 - It's such a vote of confidence, James,

707
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,860
 that you think we're going to get a scene remake spade.

708
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,660
 That's thank you.

709
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,580
 That's really nice.

710
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,940
 And we should put that in the pitch too Hollywood.

711
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,460
 It's like, we think we can, you know, broaden this out.

712
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,380
 As it were.

713
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,700
 Right, let's carry on.

714
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,860
 Audience quiz of the week.

715
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,700
 - Great.

716
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,460
 - This is, I can't put it any more simply than that.

717
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,300
 Sorry.

718
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,540
 - Well, look, are we giving the quiz time again?

719
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,380
 Sorry, I was the audience giving the quiz to us.

720
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,660
 - Someone's written a quiz in.

721
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,620
 - Someone's written a quiz for us to do.

722
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,460
 - A quiz for us, yeah.

723
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,300
 - Or is it a quiz that you've got for us about the audience?

724
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
 - Okay, I could have been clearer.

725
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,140
 I could have been clearer naming this section.

726
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,380
 - So an audience originated quiz question of the week.

727
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,220
 - Okay.

728
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,060
 - From Ben Rushworth.

729
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,860
 Thank you, Ben.

730
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,540
 This is my first email since becoming a friend

731
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,380
 of the podcast, who writes, which is a very proud moment for me.

732
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,380
 I have always wanted to be considered alongside such luminaries

733
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,660
 as Robin Thickey and Mark Twain.

734
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,660
 - Or were those enemies of the podcast?

735
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,820
 - Thickey, Thickey is us.

736
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,900
 - He's an acquaintance of the podcast.

737
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,180
 - Yeah.

738
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,260
 He's closer than that.

739
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,140
 He's family at this point.

740
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,300
 - He's one of those uncles that you see at Christmas

741
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:48,200
 that you're like, which of course makes his father,

742
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,380
 Alan Thickey, our great uncle.

743
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,540
 - Yeah.

744
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,540
 - And Twain is definitely that enemy of the podcast.

745
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,020
 - Twain is a part of the podcast, yeah, yeah.

746
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,860
 Right, Philip Muir is our Mike Giggler of the month.

747
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,700
 - Oh yeah.

748
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,000
 - Who he writes, comedy gold was missed

749
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,060
 in the last club fish.

750
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,900
 It's fair enough.

751
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,020
 And you guys are gonna kick us off up the ass

752
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,780
 when you give us a set up and don't tell us what we missed.

753
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,980
 - All right, let's see if we can get it.

754
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,820
 - Okay.

755
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,660
 - In the discussion on Forks, it was said,

756
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,700
 Forkall, I think this was you James,

757
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,980
 instead of being a TV show,

758
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,540
 you could sell it to the New York Times as a daily quiz.

759
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,700
 Oh, I think I then said New Fork Times.

760
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,700
 - New Fork Times.

761
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,580
 - New Fork Times has in the end of a Fork.

762
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,420
 - He's done it.

763
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,260
 - And so is that it?

764
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,100
 - Yep.

765
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
 (laughing)

766
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,700
 - He's done it.

767
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,420
 Yep, he says we got nine out of 10,

768
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,940
 but if we'd said New Fork Times,

769
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,620
 that would have been 10 out of 10.

770
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,460
 - Yeah.

771
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,740
 - So thank you, Philip.

772
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,580
 It's good.

773
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,420
 I like what you're saying.

774
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,340
 - It's good, but I said it.

775
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,860
 I can go back and edit it back into the show now.

776
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,860
 - You'll have to.

777
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,700
 - Yeah.

778
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,520
 - Yeah.

779
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:56,140
 - And I'm actually, yes, how cars work.

780
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,860
 - Oh, dumbeters.

781
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,980
 We said on the show that we're not quite sure

782
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,260
 how speed omiters work in cars.

783
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,100
 - Yeah.

784
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,980
 - And then we thought, we said right in,

785
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,420
 someone cavalier said right in.

786
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,620
 - You said right in if you're a world expert on it.

787
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,460
 - Yes.

788
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,820
 - Not if you half know the answer.

789
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,020
 - Well, James, thank you for saying that.

790
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,780
 And I was used at that because we've had one email

791
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,220
 explaining, "Cristily Clearly"

792
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,260
 from David Speedometer.

793
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,540
 (laughing)

794
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,380
 "Eventer of Such."

795
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,060
 David Sander for rights.

796
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,100
 I have been a technician of one variety or another

797
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,540
 for over 50 years.

798
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,140
 Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

799
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,020
 For many years, the speed indicator in your dash

800
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,500
 was driven by a cable running off a small gear

801
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,980
 in the transmission, which is part of the car.

802
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,900
 (laughing)

803
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,700
 He doesn't say, "I'm just adding that in."

804
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,420
 (laughing)

805
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,700
 - All right, head repart.

806
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,460
 (laughing)

807
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,020
 There were several different gears for many vehicles

808
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,700
 because tire size affects the speedometer,

809
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,420
 of course, because if your tire is bigger,

810
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,460
 once round actually means you've gone a bit further.

811
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,900
 Today, the cable has been replaced by a non-contact sensor

812
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,700
 that reads the speed of a gear turning in the transmission.

813
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,300
 That signal is sent to the onboard computer,

814
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,940
 which then sends a variable signal

815
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,620
 to the speed indicator in the dash.

816
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,660
 So there you go.

817
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,900
 So you're seeing the speed of a gear in the transmission,

818
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,660
 not the actual direct monitoring of the actual speed.

819
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,660
 - Makes sense.

820
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,820
 - And GPS can use that as well.

821
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,580
 And that's a bit more accurate.

822
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,140
 The average speedometer has a bit of a tolerance,

823
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,500
 so there's a bit of error in there.

824
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,340
 - So there you go.

825
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,180
 - Great.

826
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,020
 - Well, really good.

827
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,860
 - Yeah.

828
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,020
 - Aren't you a bit boring?

829
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,260
 (laughing)

830
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,580
 - Oh, I mean, it would have been nice

831
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,180
 if there was a really exciting way that they worked that out.

832
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,020
 - Oh, yeah.

833
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,220
 I said, "Your couple is not with David's email explaining it,

834
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,820
 "it's with how they work."

835
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,980
 - Yeah, it's an awesome way.

836
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,820
 - Oh, yeah.

837
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,660
 - If David had written in saying,

838
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,700
 "Well, what they do is you turn your radio on

839
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,300
 "and the radio waves bounce off a wall

840
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,300
 "and it could tell how far you've gone in that time."

841
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,660
 - It tells you how far you are from BBC Radio Norfolk.

842
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,700
 And then in a second it tells you how far you are then.

843
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,540
 - Yeah, yeah.

844
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,380
 - That would have been exciting.

845
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,380
 But as it is, the actual answer is, you know, mundane.

846
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,220
 - Quite mundane.

847
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,020
 - But probably very useful.

848
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,540
 - But so if you're writing in and it's with something boring,

849
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,940
 just make something up.

850
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,660
 Just make something really interesting up.

851
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,500
 - Don't.

852
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,340
 - And we'll read it.

853
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,180
 - Yeah.

854
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,940
 - Change your surname 'cause I'm in silly.

855
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,940
 (laughing)

856
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,900
 - Thank you, David, for your email.

857
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,860
 We've got, I'm actually on none, urine.

858
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,700
 - Ah, yes.

859
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,980
 Okay, Ben Hilton show again.

860
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,820
 - Absolutely.

861
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,660
 - This is the fact that for fertility purposes,

862
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,860
 nuns were donating their urine

863
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,060
 in order to help people conceive.

864
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,660
 - Well, Helen writes, listen to the recent Ben Hilton cast,

865
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,380
 maybe think about the nuns who having never had,

866
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,940
 I'm afraid, cover your ears, children.

867
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,020
 You can't have relations.

868
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,860
 - Yes.

869
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,260
 - She says penetrative penis in vagina sex.

870
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,340
 (laughing)

871
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,860
 - We all have our ufusus.

872
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,260
 - So we call it in our house.

873
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,780
 (laughing)

874
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,980
 - It's a bit of a mouthful.

875
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,020
 (laughing)

876
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,660
 - Oh dear, oh dear.

877
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,420
 Well, those nuns who have never had that,

878
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,540
 very rarely get cervical cancer.

879
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,260
 And it was this fact that led to the discovery

880
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,940
 of the HPV factor in cervical cancer,

881
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,340
 leading to the vaccine for HPV.

882
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,180
 - Very good.

883
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,140
 - And she pointed to us by saying HPV is almost always

884
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,900
 spread around by PIV.

885
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,740
 - Yes.

886
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,580
 - It seemed like a vagina.

887
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,420
 - Yeah.

888
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,620
 - So PIV, that's called new acronym.

889
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,620
 - PLV, points of view.

890
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,220
 - Yeah, but this is a slightly different point of view.

891
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,900
 (laughing)

892
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,300
 - God, you don't want to be dyslexic looking

893
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,300
 for the PIV room and said good to the VIP.

894
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,900
 (laughing)

895
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,180
 - Oh dear.

896
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,140
 I think if you went to the VIP room

897
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,580
 and there was a mirror right next to the sign

898
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,060
 that says VIP room.

899
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,900
 - Yeah.

900
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,220
 - So it says PIV.

901
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,060
 - Animal.

902
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,580
 (laughing)

903
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,100
 - Oh, we've had some terrific non-determ.

904
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,940
 - Great.

905
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,780
 - I mean, really good.

906
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,140
 Mollipair writes, medium time less than a first time emailer.

907
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,980
 (laughing)

908
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,100
 - My GP is called A Doctor.

909
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,100
 Doctor A Doctor.

910
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,940
 - I love it.

911
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,100
 - If I didn't respect her privacy, I'd send proof.

912
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,820
 - You've sort of broken that anyway, haven't you?

913
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,580
 Doctor A Doctor, how many of those can there be?

914
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,740
 - I don't think the doctor patient confidentiality

915
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,620
 stretches to you not telling people

916
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,660
 what your doctor's called.

917
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,620
 - No, because you have to tell people

918
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,620
 what your doctor's called, don't they?

919
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,620
 On every form you fill in there.

920
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,460
 - Yeah.

921
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,300
 - So what's your doctor called?

922
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,300
 - People must think she's filled it in wrong.

923
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,140
 - Refused it.

924
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,260
 (laughing)

925
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,740
 - It says doctor question mark

926
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,540
 and she just writes doctor next to it.

927
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,380
 - Yep.

928
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,260
 - She must think she's about to start a joke.

929
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,060
 - Monty Cox sends this in.

930
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,060
 Lindsay Newton, who then became a doctor, doctor Newton.

931
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,700
 She then had a chance to marry a man whose name was sleeper

932
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,620
 and she wasn't going to, but then she decided

933
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,740
 she would take his surname.

934
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,980
 She's now doctor sleeper.

935
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,260
 - What kind of doctor is she?

936
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,340
 - Euthanasia.

937
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,180
 - Euthanasia.

938
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,820
 (laughing)

939
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,500
 - You go for a very long sleeper.

940
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,380
 (laughing)

941
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,380
 - Hi, I'm gonna be your euthanasia today.

942
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,860
 - I went for an eye test the other day, right?

943
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,940
 And the woman, the ophthalmologist said,

944
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,460
 you know, if you had any problems with your eyes

945
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,620
 and I wanted to sell it that I'd had some migraines,

946
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,860
 optical migraines. - Yeah.

947
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,300
 - But I forgot the word for migraine

948
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,980
 and that's accidentally said,

949
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,940
 oh yeah, I've had a few comas.

950
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,620
 (laughing)

951
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,620
 And she's like, oh no, what happened?

952
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,900
 And then I realized what I said and I was like,

953
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,580
 oh no, no, no, cause a few comas.

954
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,260
 It does sound like it's happening again.

955
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,020
 (laughing)

956
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,220
 - That was very funny.

957
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:56,060
 - Tom Reed sent in a fairly uninteresting article.

958
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,140
 His words, but it does feature a belfast tailor

959
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,580
 called Chris Sutter.

960
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,420
 - Lovely.

961
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,260
 - Really good.

962
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,500
 David Bella Squires sends in a piece about scarecrow's

963
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,020
 by Mark Haye and a Portland dance founder

964
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,540
 whose name is Sarah Slipper.

965
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,380
 - Very good.

966
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,500
 - And Michael Boulter writes about something you said, James,

967
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,500
 about New Zealand's state librarians.

968
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,740
 - Oh, apparently there was a flood or a storm surge

969
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,980
 and they had to get all of the books out of the library

970
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,340
 and so they took them onto the roof

971
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,900
 and according to the people,

972
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,660
 according to the talk guide of the library,

973
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,020
 they did so in their underwear and no one knows why.

974
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for unclear reasons.

975
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,500
 So, well, Michael Boulter just wants to write in and say,

976
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,900
 "I can speak from experience through undertaking tasks

977
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,500
 "in your underpants in the rain."

978
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,780
 Early on a Sunday morning, my young kids and I were watching

979
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,540
 a hail storm from our back deck.

980
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,340
 The kids wanted me to collect some hail

981
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,380
 and I could see a lot had accumulated on our trampoline.

982
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,020
 I was in a bathrobe and jocks

983
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,420
 and didn't know that I had time to go inside

984
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,980
 and properly gear up for the wet weather

985
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,620
 and rather than get my bathrobe soaked,

986
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,860
 I derubbed and ran out in my jocks.

987
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,740
 My wife took a video of the whole rigmarole

988
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,660
 which I have omitted for your benefit.

989
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,100
 (laughing)

990
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,540
 - Yeah, because actually under you said

991
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,260
 that it's quite good for people to get naked whenever it's raining.

992
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,100
 - I think that's--

993
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
 - To start their clothes from getting wet.

994
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,700
 - I think that's a spider.

995
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,540
 It's good to be chasing it around in your pants rather than in your,

996
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,380
 you know, rather than it crawling into your trousers.

997
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,700
 - Good climatic scene for your movie.

998
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,180
 The Guinness World Record, they all are on the roof.

999
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,020
 - Oh yeah.

1000
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,620
 - In their underwear, but we don't explain why.

1001
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,740
 - That's good. - Yeah.

1002
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,580
 - That's good.

1003
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,420
 Do you know what?

1004
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,340
 I think, 'cause we don't know what's going on there,

1005
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,780
 that makes sense to the film title, don't know.

1006
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,100
 (laughing)

1007
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,100
 - What I'm thinking from all this is maybe we start off

1008
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,540
 with the pornographic parody.

1009
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,140
 (laughing)

1010
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,140
 - And then we fill the dates and the Hollywood movies.

1011
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,740
 - That's a really good idea.

1012
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,380
 So yeah, Michael, thank you for that.

1013
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,220
 - Yeah, thank you.

1014
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,900
 - You know, very, very descriptive, you know, it's vivid.

1015
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,900
 - Send the video.

1016
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,820
 - Well, I mean, to listeners, you know,

1017
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,420
 what's the weirdest thing you've ever done in your pants?

1018
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,380
 - Is this the kind of email you're fishing for now, Andy?

1019
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,220
 - No.

1020
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,940
 - Is this what you're gonna start doing in each episode going?

1021
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,860
 And listeners, what's the sexiest picture

1022
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,060
 you've got on your phone?

1023
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,900
 (laughing)

1024
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,140
 - Oh God.

1025
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,980
 No.

1026
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,820
 (laughing)

1027
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,820
 - No, keep the inbox PG, please keep it PG.

1028
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,300
 Please.

1029
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,580
 Thank you.

1030
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,100
 'Cause it's great, and I just wanna keep it the way it is.

1031
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,700
 But we've, there we go, that's it.

1032
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,540
 That's your emails for today.

1033
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,420
 You too.

1034
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,260
 - Thank you.

1035
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,100
 - Thank you.

1036
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,680
 (upbeat music)

1037
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,660
 - Thanks everyone for listening.

1038
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,020
 We are podcast@cure.com.

1039
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,220
 If you've enjoyed this show,

1040
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,300
 and we're gonna make another one

1041
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,260
 whether you want us to or not.

1042
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,500
 So just there'll be another one in two weeks.

1043
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,340
 - That's right.

1044
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,340
 - But if you want to contribute to it,

1045
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,580
 then email podcast@cure.com, I suppose that's the point.

1046
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,740
 And if you don't, then don't.

1047
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,540
 - I think you've covered all basis, yeah.

1048
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,780
 - He's bloody good at this.

1049
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,940
 I mean, he really is, isn't he?

1050
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,140
 Like, he makes it so easy.

1051
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,420
 - He's got a much more difficult job.

1052
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,660
 - Yeah, it's a tough wrap up.

1053
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,500
 'Cause look, why?

1054
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,900
 - It's hard to say bye sometimes.

1055
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,460
 (laughing)

1056
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,260
 - When that old phrase of, "It's hard to say goodbye,"

1057
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,620
 I didn't realize they were referring

1058
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,100
 to your wrap-ups of podcasts.

1059
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,860
 (laughing)

1060
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,100
 - Thank you, everybody for listening.

1061
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,940
 Bye.

1062
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,540
 (upbeat music)

1063
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,120
 (upbeat music)

1064
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,700
 (upbeat music)
