 [telephone ringing]

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.400
 You don't want it or who don't want it to be?

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.380
 [upbeat music]

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.560
 [upbeat music]

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.960
 - Hi!

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.800
 - Hello, Andy.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.200
 - Hey, guys.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.440
 Welcome to Drop Is Alive.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.060
 Welcome to all of you listening, or watching,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.520
 at home, or at your place of work.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.360
 - And nothing?

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.920
 - No, no, Andy has said work or home.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.840
 - Oh, is that the only two places you're allowed to be?

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.680
 - Apparently.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.440
 - The other places, a third space, stop,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.740
 and resume when you've got time to properly focus

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.660
 on what's going on.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.600
 It's been a great, great couple of weeks in the inbox.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.920
 - It's been wriggling the inbox.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.920
 - Really?

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.800
 - Absolutely writhing.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.720
 - Yeah. - Not bulging?

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.720
 - No, no, no.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.520
 It's, it's, it's developed, it's got worse than that.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.240
 - Oh, it's, it's crawling.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.080
 - What's happened?

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.440
 Why is it changed?

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.560
 - Well, we've gone fortnightly.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.200
 So, you know, people have picked up the pace.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.440
 We've got people writing, now people,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.800
 a lot more people are sending in facts,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.880
 'cause we've lost the fact show, little fish.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.720
 - Oh yeah.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.120
 - So a lot more people are sending in their facts for that show,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.360
 which is great, podcast@QI.com.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.240
 If you've got a fact, or a bone to pick,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.720
 then send it our way.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.560
 - Great.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.960
 - Yeah, let's get to those bones now.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.320
 - Should we start with a treat?

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.160
 - Yes, we are.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.400
 - Okay, 'cause we always start with the, you know,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.080
 maybe a quibble, maybe you've got it wrong,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.440
 and there's plenty of that coming out.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.260
 - Oh, no.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.100
 - Flenty.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.220
 - Should we not save the treat for dessert?

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.980
 - I don't think you'll feel hungry anymore,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.860
 once I've read out some of the complaints I've got for you.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.700
 - Right.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.060
 - No, this is a really exciting thing.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.900
 I don't know if you remember.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.260
 We've got a bit of correspondence from Jodie,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.100
 little while ago.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.900
 - Oh, Jodie, yeah, I remember Jodie.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.380
 - Yeah, saying we're getting married,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.020
 and we're having a heritage rail themed wedding.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.860
 - Oh, yeah.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.700
 - That's right, Jodie.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.060
 - You're our kind of person, Jodie and James.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.220
 And they were doing small coal as wedding favors.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.060
 (Jodie laughs)

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.340
 Just did it on my heart, 'cause we said ages ago,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.860
 what do they use for coal, on model rowers?

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.540
 They use small coal.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.980
 - Small coal, yeah.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.100
 - Anyway, Jodie writes, as promised,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.180
 here is the candy coal we handed out as favors at our wedding.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.660
 It was a fantastic day.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.740
 The wedding went off without a hitch.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.500
 - Oh, 'cause your hitch carriages on Twitch are that.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.340
 (Jodie laughs)

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.180
 - Okay.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.540
 - And all the guests were absolutely steaming.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.820
 That's my little drug.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.460
 - How is the train of her dress?

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.740
 - Oh, yeah, beautiful.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.740
 - Oh, very nice.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.420
 - Really good, as was her carriage and he railing.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.220
 (Jodie laughs)

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.980
 - Oh my god.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.620
 - It doesn't say in her letter.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.460
 - Okay.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.300
 - Brilliant.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.220
 But anyway, look, each of you has a little bag of candy coal.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.060
 - Dan, that's for you.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.900
 - Wow.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.100
 - Oh, no, look at this.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.940
 - Thank you.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.780
 - A little sack of coal.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.540
 Normally, it means you've been a bad boy,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.540
 getting a piece of coal.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.300
 - Yeah, but this is a mark of favor from Jodie and James.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.580
 So thank you so much.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.860
 - Okay, so what is this?

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.940
 - This, I don't know.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.580
 - Looks, it doesn't look.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.420
 - It's edible.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.260
 - It looks like it could be heroin.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.740
 She does, actually, she encloses a spoon and a lighter.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.420
 And I think, right, here we go.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.260
 Oh my god.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.100
 - Oh, I love it.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.820
 - Just tastes like slightly stale chocolate cake.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.340
 (Jodie laughs)

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.860
 It's been in the box for ages.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.940
 - It's got Oreo cookies, Oreo vibe.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.340
 It's very Oreo-coated.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.500
 Anyway, thank you so much, Jodie and James.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.580
 Welcome to Married Life.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.420
 - Yeah.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.100
 - If you're listening to this and you're married,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.500
 you two must send us tribute.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.580
 (Jodie laughs)

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.420
 - No, that's brilliant.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.260
 Congratulations, guys.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.260
 - Right. - We're wonderful.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.020
 - Right, we're off the blocks, but we are on the hook.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.180
 - Okay. - Okay, dammit.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.660
 A lot of comments have come in about things

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.740
 we said about the Second World War.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.580
 - Oh.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.420
 - It's an episode.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.420
 - And Alton. - Right.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.140
 - And great news.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.300
 It's all complaints about stuff.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.260
 Ben said nothing about what we said.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.540
 We're fine.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.380
 - Ben's in trouble.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.220
 - Okay.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.180
 Ben's in trouble with the people of Canada,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.180
 and Australia, and New Zealand, and also India,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.820
 for saying the Britain stood alone for a year

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.660
 in the Second World War.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.420
 When, in fact, all of those countries.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.340
 - And the wider Commonwealth were very much on team GB

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.580
 for that spell.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.220
 And contributing lots of, you know, stuff, food, supplies,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.060
 soldiers, all of that.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.060
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.180
 - So Erin Thomas just wants to point out Canada

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.260
 was there every step of the way

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.940
 from the Declaration of War until peace was declared.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.340
 Mayor Brown writes, for a man who says he's read

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.380
 an awful lot of books on World War II,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.100
 Ben Elton's egregious declaration that Britain stood alone

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.540
 for a full year against Germany was patently false.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.220
 And Geoffrey Partiger has a little bit of extra spicy stuff

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.860
 about a lances.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.700
 - Oh.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.540
 (laughing)

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.020
 - So that was the fact, was your fact, wasn't it?

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.580
 - Yeah, we had, the army was still using lances.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.060
 - Tell the first World War.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.460
 - Yeah, 'til 1927.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.780
 Your terrific guest, Ben Elton, expressed his doubts

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.140
 regarding the use of lances.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.940
 But there's also an example of the miracle on the vestula

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.060
 in the summer of 1920, so socket Elton writes Geoffrey.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.900
 - Okay.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.300
 (laughing)

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.140
 - Yep.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.820
 There was a place, there's a thing called the miracle

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.500
 on the vestula, which was the red army against Polish cavalry.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.100
 And it was, it was thanks to Polish cavalry with lances.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.300
 And in the same campaign, there were 20,000 men

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.780
 on horseback charging each other with lances couch

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.620
 at the Battle of Comorov.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.620
 So there you go.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.300
 So anyway, lances remain useful.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.620
 - And Canada also.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.140
 - And Canada also, mainly Canada,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.340
 but I mean, full credit, full credit to almost everyone involved.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.180
 - Yeah.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.100
 - Well, I'll cut this up and send it to Ben.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.140
 I'm sure he'll be very here.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.980
 - The dish is it out.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.220
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.700
 - Yeah, that's a fact check.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.020
 Right, now I've got a new section for us.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.020
 - Oh, exciting.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.100
 - The, you said it wrong underground chamber of nightmares.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.940
 - Okay.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.780
 - Now entering.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.660
 - Is that a pronunciation thing?

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.500
 - Sonny is.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.500
 - Is it done?

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.220
 - It's, no, it's me.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.140
 - Oh, okay.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.980
 - Interesting.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.500
 - Oh, there's a bit for Dan later.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.940
 - On a previous drop as a line, I said

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.860
 that Daniel from Wagger Wagger had written.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.980
 And I've had several Australians right in saying

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.980
 it's pronounced Wagger Wagger.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.700
 - Oh, that's just your accent, Andy.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.180
 - That's just my accent.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.940
 - If you say it correctly, like Andy does.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.780
 - Why?

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.060
 (laughing)

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.420
 - Jeff Salfall writes, Australian and Melbourne here.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.660
 A friend of mine was briefly a DJ and Wagger Wagger

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.220
 and was given strict instructions on how to say it.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.820
 So firstly, everyone in Australia knows it isn't said

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.300
 for them as in hat, but as if it's spelled Wagger Wagger.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.700
 So I'm very sorry.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.940
 Dan, you didn't help me out there.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.140
 - Yeah, I mean, I've heard of Wagger Wagger.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.140
 They might have been a Wagger Wagger as well.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.180
 Like Australia's massive, it's got lots of names.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.380
 I don't know where we're always talking about.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.540
 - Fair enough.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.540
 - I'd be astonished if there isn't a Wagger Wagger,

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.020
 a Wagger Wagger, a Wagger Wagger and a Wigger Wigger.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.020
 - There you go.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.580
 - I think we need to name check pronunciation

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.100
 anything Australian now because our hit rate is pretty intense.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.940
 - Bad.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.940
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.700
 And we have a huge listenership there.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.340
 - Yeah, that's our third most listened to country.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.380
 - The nullable road train has kept rolling into the inbox.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.020
 But are we gonna stop doing it?

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.460
 - If we discovered beforehand, it's not pronounced like that.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.300
 Yeah, we will.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.420
 - Okay, but apparently we even said Melbourne wrong last time.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.260
 - So...

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.260
 - What did we say?

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
 - I can't remember, Sydney.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.100
 - That's right.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.100
 - Well, just to go elsewhere,

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.340
 we're still in the Chamber of Nightmares,

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.900
 but Alex Tewski has written,

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.180
 I listened to this week's episode of "Fish During a Long Drive"

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.700
 during which I was amused by Dan's mispronunciation

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.700
 of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana,

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.300
 which is pronounced Notre Dame.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.140
 - Right.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.980
 - He said Notre Dame.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.060
 - Yeah, that feels like an affectation.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.220
 - I think so.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.380
 - Like Mordlin College and...

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.220
 - Exactly.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.060
 - Yeah.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.820
 - And Laffborough, and I just think it's clearly Notre Dame,

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.660
 isn't it?

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.500
 (laughing)

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.740
 - Clearly Notre Dame.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.580
 - How it looks.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.540
 - Where's the hunchback from?

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.780
 (laughing)

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.020
 - The hunchback of Notre Dame is a funny idea for something.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.580
 - Yeah.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.420
 - It's his college years, I suppose.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.900
 - Oh, yes.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.060
 - That's good, and he's called a hunchback.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.300
 - This is...

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.780
 - Sometimes things just write themselves instantly,

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.620
 and here we are.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.860
 - It's weird how nothing good ever writes itself.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.700
 - No.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.540
 (laughing)

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.780
 - It's always really weak puns that write themselves.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:47.620
 - Yeah.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.940
 - I actually dreamt an idea for a movie the other night,

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.980
 which I wasn't gonna bring up.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:51.820
 - Oh God.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.820
 - Oh God, go on then.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.820
 - Okay.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.180
 And it's because it's a fish related thing, it's okay.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.460
 It's like a Guinness World Records jamboree day, right?

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.020
 At a big conference center,

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.060
 but the plot of die hard happens.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.020
 So like terrorists break in,

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.700
 and they're trying to steal something big,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.940
 that's happens to be held in this big conference center.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.900
 - The world's biggest something, presumably.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.740
 - That's it.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.740
 - They're trying to steal the world's biggest.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.940
 - Oh, don't tell me.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.740
 - You're giving me a half bags idea,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.580
 and I'm gonna fill it out, aren't I?

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.780
 - I'm giving you 10% J.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:23.620
 - It's a great idea.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.460
 - But how many people are gonna get it?

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.620
 - I can see it's a great idea.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.700
 - So, okay, the main character

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.140
 is the Craig Glenday editor figure, right?

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.020
 Who doesn't have any special skills himself.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.820
 Apart from, he can stop a stopwatch exactly

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.740
 at the time he needs to,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.820
 'cause he's been doing that all day.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.220
 - He's like Hawkeye from the Avengers.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.940
 - He doesn't really have any skills,

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.980
 but he's quite good at one thing.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.220
 - But the stopwatch is his one skill.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.300
 So the terrorist break in,

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.780
 obviously a Ragtag band of insane record breakers

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.460
 has to drop water balance on their stomachs

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.340
 and to feed them all.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.620
 - Oh, yeah, like you can see someone being stabbed

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.900
 with a sword, but it happens to be a sword swallower

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.460
 and it goes in their mouth, it does nothing.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.300
 - Exactly.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.980
 - To them, just like this is a,

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.340
 I think a legitimately reasonable idea.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.180
 - Yeah, I think it's something that could clear a committee

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.100
 of Hollywood brains.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.420
 Something's really high up, how are we gonna get to it?

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.620
 Oh my god, the Guinness World Records

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.220
 for the most cherished stacked.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.140
 - All the longest arm.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.340
 - All the longest arm.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.220
 - Guys, I think it's a sketch.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.740
 I'm not sure we can squeeze two and a half hours out.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.500
 - I think it's a Friday minute long, so yeah, I agree.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.300
 This is the next Avengers.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.140
 The mediocre's.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.580
 - And it comes down to it, like the final bit is,

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.820
 the bomb's gonna go off,

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.380
 unless we can cut these wires at exactly the right time.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.180
 Up steps, the hero, Mr. Stopwatch.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.260
 - But that doesn't cut wires, right?

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.460
 - Yeah, but he's timing when exactly to do it.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.460
 - Okay, right.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.140
 - Like that's his skill.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.700
 - And then there's someone with the Guinness World Record

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.180
 for most successfully defused bombs.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.660
 - He just has to cut the wire at the right time,

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.740
 but he's quite poignant because he thinks he's not,

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.020
 he thinks he doesn't have a skill, right?

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:58.940
 And he's gone his whole life

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.300
 surrounded by these amazing people

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.900
 who have these bizarre talents.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.700
 And he's always felt a bit bad about himself, you know?

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.220
 So actually, it's quite moving.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.860
 - Okay, it's really good.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.060
 I mean, what's it called?

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.260
 - Ooh.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:15.180
 - Don't know.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:20.580
 - Don't know.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.580
 Coming to one sketch of a new sketch show, here you.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.900
 - In fairness, that was a tough one

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.540
 to put him on the spotlight, man.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.860
 - But you've got a lot in the dream, Dan.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.300
 A lot of work done in the dream.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.140
 That's great.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.140
 - It started in the dream

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.620
 because I was flying a plane in the dream,

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.660
 but it was about to fly into a shopping center

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.300
 and I was thinking, oh no, we're gonna crash.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.620
 But then I remembered in the shopping center today

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.740
 that I have a demonstration of the world's largest balloon.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.820
 Okay, so I'll just fly the plane into that.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.900
 And that'll save everyone.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.100
 It's a really good idea.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:56.940
 - Thank you.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.020
 - I mean, oh god, I started crying with laughter again.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.820
 I can't be crying with laughter this early in the show, you know.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:03.660
 - Do you know what I mean?

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.500
 - Absolutely.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.500
 - Okay.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.540
 - Okay, so it's noted, Dave.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.940
 - Yeah, it's the point I'm trying to make.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.220
 Which is another great movie.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.300
 That's another great movie.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.500
 The Hunchback Collegios.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.820
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.660
 Okay.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:22.100
 Right, fan theory corner.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:22.940
 - Cool.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.020
 - Logan Emory writes, this is about dreams, actually.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.260
 I was listening to an old episode

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.180
 in which one of you mentioned

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.660
 that a lot of people listened to fish to fall asleep.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.260
 I don't know who said it or what episode it was

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.740
 because I was listening as I fell asleep,

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.500
 but it started me thinking about why that is.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.420
 I vaguely remember someone, Andy,

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.340
 mentioning cognitive shuffling,

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.540
 but that may have also been a figment of my imagination.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.700
 Stay with it.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.260
 Essentially, you think of a word, fish,

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.580
 and then think of words that start

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.740
 with each letter of that word.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.060
 - That's the way to get a sleep.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:54.900
 - Exactly.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.100
 So, friend, icicle, shortbread, honeybee,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.340
 would be fish.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.620
 The idea is that this replicates the sort of half dreams

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.140
 you have as you're falling asleep.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.060
 You know, when images start to sort of flip around

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.220
 in your mind a bit.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.500
 My theory is that the tangential associations

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.580
 and scattered nature of fish,

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.580
 I'll show, mimic micro dreams,

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.700
 the same way that that technique does.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:15.940
 So, you can zone in and out

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.100
 and get this collection of images and words

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.460
 without thinking of them yourself.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.180
 Could be that, it could be just that we're really tedious.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.460
 Yes.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.460
 - Oh, good.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.620
 - It could.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.740
 - It's so horrific.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.580
 - Yeah.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.100
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.980
 - Now, I see what I see what he's saying,

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.020
 'cause it means you won't get fixated on one thing

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.780
 'cause we move around from that subject to another.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:36.620
 - Exactly.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.140
 So, I think that's a very plausible theory.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:38.980
 I like it.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.820
 - Yes, really good.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.660
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.660
 And as we've seen, it comes up with that

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.660
 major franchise ideas as well.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.420
 - 'Cause I sometimes fall asleep to the podcast

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.260
 of Richard Herring playing Snookle with himself.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.100
 - Okay.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.260
 - Not a euphemism.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.100
 And then that really, it's the same thing

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.780
 that happens every single game.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.340
 He misses lots and lots and lots of shots.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.740
 And then eventually all the balls get down.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.940
 Again, not a euphemism, but he does find that

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.580
 100% of the time it will get me to sleep for a...

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.460
 - For a 10 minute nap.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.500
 - For a 10 minute nap.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.340
 - Yeah.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.340
 - Are you needing help to get down for a nap?

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.700
 - Well, yeah, that's harder to get down for a nap

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.820
 than for a sleep, isn't it?

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.660
 'Cause you're not necessarily tired.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.980
 - So this is our afternoon nap, we're talking.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.900
 - Yeah, I can nap very readily.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.540
 - Yeah, I can, but that might change.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.620
 You might need Herring on your side soon.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.620
 - Herring aids.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.260
 - Yeah, I like it.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.380
 - Anyway, we're going to a fun new place now

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.780
 called Place Name City.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.580
 - This is a whole new show, Andy.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.420
 - I know.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.020
 - Okay, where's spicy meat?

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.980
 - There's a little bit of meat later on.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.460
 - Does that's what people are chewing them for?

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.300
 - That's true.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.820
 - Do you guys remember Zoe Hamburger?

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.420
 - Yes.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.940
 - She was the first ever fact on Little Fish.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.500
 - Right, and you, James, said something about.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.700
 - So she was, oh, I see where we're gonna go.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.900
 She worked for McDonald's.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:11.740
 - Yeah.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.740
 - And I said that her name probably comes

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.180
 because her ancestors came from Hamburg.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.220
 And then one of the other two of you said,

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.820
 oh, we don't have that in the UK.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.180
 People whose names are from the place

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.180
 where they're from, well.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.420
 And we came up with a couple of examples.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.860
 And I can only imagine that the audience back home

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:34.460
 were yelling Tommy Fleetwood at the phone and saw.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.300
 - Who's that?

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.300
 - He's a golfer.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.140
 - Of course.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.380
 (laughing)

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.020
 - And is there a place called Fleetwood?

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.380
 - Yeah, in Lancashire.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.140
 - I've never heard of Fleetwood.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.220
 - What?

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.100
 - It's a relatively large town.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.100
 - Is it?

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.700
 - Anyway, yeah, we missed a few people with names

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.700
 that are also places.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.540
 - Okay.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.540
 - So Ian Dunn sends in Danza Washington.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.700
 - Oh yeah.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.860
 - I suppose also George Washington.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.860
 - At least slightly the other way around.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.700
 - Yeah.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.700
 (laughing)

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.060
 - Irving Berlin.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:05.900
 - Yeah.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.900
 - Dion Dublin.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.740
 - Yeah.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:08.980
 - So there's all great points.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.060
 Emerson Lehmann writes,

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.420
 you all forgot about Michael York.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.260
 - Okay.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:14.100
 - Who?

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.780
 - He was in Austin Powers.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.500
 He was, he was.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.340
 - He does alex position.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.180
 - Yes.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.100
 - He's a great actor.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.140
 - Tom Yark.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.380
 - I know heaven from Radiohead.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.220
 - Oh yes.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.060
 - He's Tom Yorky.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:25.900
 - He's Tom Yorky.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.420
 - Yeah, he's no doubt that the chocolate bar isn't here.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.260
 - He's not for girls.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.260
 (laughing)

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.820
 - That's an old-eyed campaign for Yorky.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.980
 For international listeners, it doesn't matter.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:33.820
 (laughing)

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.820
 - Sometimes it's just good to say,

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.580
 if you're international listeners, don't worry.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.420
 - I think they do plus over

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.100
 a lot of this podcast international listeners.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:41.940
 - Yeah.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.620
 - Well, I think they do it with love.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.620
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.780
 - Yeah.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.060
 - Jack writes,

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.820
 I have a colleague with the surname Pontifract.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.660
 - Oh, really?

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.500
 - Okay.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.940
 - The last surname was Wally, Wally with an H.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.420
 - Like Wally Bridge.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.900
 - Wally in Blackburn?

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.140
 Is that the same Wally?

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.980
 - Maybe.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.820
 - So name I weigh somewhere.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.740
 - Which links Wally Blackburn,

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.660
 whose Abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.140
 With Wally being a popular term of derision in the '80s,

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.300
 my family changed our name.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.140
 - Oh, really?

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:12.980
 - Yeah.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.180
 - Tony Blackburn.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.820
 - Tony Blackburn.

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:16.660
 - Yeah.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.500
 - I mean, they're everywhere.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.500
 - Yeah, Peter English gets in touch.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.340
 - Oh yeah.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.500
 - It's interesting.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.780
 - His surname is ink, the word English.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.620
 - Yeah.

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.980
 - But he writes oddly and confusingly,

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.860
 the name was not given to a person because they were English.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.340
 It's actually Irish.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.180
 - Is it?

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.020
 - What?

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.780
 - 'Cause I said, I mentioned Harris English,

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.780
 who's another golfer as an example.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.060
 But yeah, maybe Harris English is family and not.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:39.900
 - This is crazy.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.220
 - So the story is that, Peter writes,

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.140
 at the time when surnames were required,

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.380
 some rich English people had estates in Ireland

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.180
 and locals who were employed to work on those estates

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.020
 were given the surname English.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.300
 - Is that crazy?

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.900
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.460
 - The absolute crown on this one goes to Dan Connelly,

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:01.860
 who writes, he got inspired by our discussion

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.780
 of Zoe Hamburger and says,

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.460
 "I got thinking about the longest chain you could make

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.860
 "of people named for places named for people."

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.700
 And so forth.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:10.540
 - Okay.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.420
 - Give us an example.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.500
 - So for example, Bolivia is named after Simon Bolivar,

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.860
 and he was named after the village of Bolivar

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.140
 in the bar's country.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:21.980
 - Lovely.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.140
 - It gives a couple more examples.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.340
 And then the coup de gras, he needs a bit of help

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.180
 with the end of it.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.580
 But Houston, Texas.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.500
 - Houston.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.060
 - Houston, Texas.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.580
 - I'm just saving emails.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.620
 - Sounds like Houston, you have a problem, mate.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.460
 - Is it?

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.300
 - Yes.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.140
 - Okay.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.300
 - Where is Houston?

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.260
 - Hugh, really, Whitney.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.100
 - Brilliant.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.100
 - Houston, Texas.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:45.940
 - Yeah.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:46.940
 - Extraordinary.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.460
 (laughing)

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.780
 Is named for Sam Houston, whose name comes from Houston

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.420
 in Renfrucia, it's called.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.260
 - Yeah.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.620
 - Which was named for Hugh, de Paduinan,

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.660
 where Paduinan also refers to a place.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.820
 The bit I haven't managed to track down

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.060
 as someone whose name is Houston,

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.820
 after Houston, Texas.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.260
 Maybe Whitney, Houston.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.420
 But that will be a person named for a city,

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.740
 named for a person, named for a town.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.780
 Name for a person, I've got confused.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.780
 - But it's great, it's very impressive.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.060
 - That's a really good research.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:19.900
 - Brilliant.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.740
 - Yeah, really good.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.540
 - The infinite loop, helical staircases.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.540
 - Oh yeah.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.860
 - Here we go.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:31.500
 We, just, it's not a problem, we didn't say anything wrong.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.500
 - No, I can get us for anything we said.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.420
 (laughing)

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.980
 - But Nick Ladner writes, since you mentioned them,

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.140
 you might like to know there is a double helic staircase

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.060
 at the University of Reading in the chemistry department.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.140
 - Oh, that's very cool.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:44.980
 - Isn't that good?

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.820
 - Yeah, that's awesome.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.740
 And if you flip that over, you'll see a lovely image

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.300
 from Galicia, Alvaro Lomba writes,

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.540
 at the Galician People's Museum, we have a triple one,

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.980
 triple helic staircase.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:56.820
 - Wow.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.940
 - From 1700.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:58.780
 - Oh, it's beautiful.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.620
 - How good is that?

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.460
 - Yeah.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.300
 - Yeah.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.140
 - Stunning.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:02.980
 So thank you.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.300
 Dan Cloak, wicked name, that's great name.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.980
 - Points out that we have a triple helic staircase

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.220
 in the UK, and in fact it's Hune, or Hune,

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.980
 into the rock at Dover.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:14.820
 - Is that?

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.660
 - Yeah.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.340
 - It's called the Grand Shaft.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.140
 This is for troop movements.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.100
 It's from the Second World War,

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.940
 or it might even be from an older war,

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.900
 like Napoleonic or something,

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.740
 but it's to get troops down to the beach in case Napoleon,

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.540
 or Hitler is turning up, you need to get three layers

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.500
 of soldiers down at the same time

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.420
 from the top to the bottom of the cliffs.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.260
 - Cool.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.100
 - How cool is that?

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.940
 - That's very cool.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.420
 - And it's called the Grand Shaft, which sounds rude.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.420
 - Is that more or less complicated

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.740
 than digging three sets of staircases down?

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.380
 - Good question.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.140
 - So no, it's all less complicated than a big pole.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.820
 - Oh, that would not be fun.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:53.660
 - It would be good.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.500
 - It would be very good.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.180
 - Massive, massive, massive firemen's pole.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.980
 - Yeah, but if you go too fast above the guy below you,

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.900
 don't want your lance to go through his head.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.860
 - Are they going down with lances?

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.940
 - It feels like you should drop your lance off the top

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.500
 before, which carries his own risks, doesn't it?

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.340
 - Yeah.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:17.620
 - We've had a serious comment from Stephen Chalena.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.060
 It seems as if Anna has been absent from the no such thing

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.820
 as a fish podcast for several weeks now, is she okay?

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.820
 Hope she's okay.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.580
 - Yeah, she's doing good.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.420
 - She's fine.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.700
 - I saw her last weekend.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.220
 - Oh yeah, how was she?

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.020
 - She was good, she was a bit tired.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.260
 - Yeah.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.420
 - Because she's been listening to the podcast every week,

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.900
 and you know, I get to sleep because it's so exciting.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.860
 No, she had her little baby relatively recently

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.460
 and she'll be back next year.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.140
 - Excellent, excellent.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.180
 I just like to point out, Stephen adds,

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.260
 I miss her.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:54.780
 Assemblance of sanity amongst a room full of oddness.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.380
 - Ah, now what you've done there is mistaken Anna

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.140
 for someone else.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.340
 - Yeah, she's not saying.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.140
 - She's the least sane person I've ever met.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.580
 - She's loopy-loop.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.420
 - I don't know.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.020
 - Oh, that was a compliment.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.020
 What were we called?

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.220
 - A room full of oddness.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.340
 - Yeah, love it.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.180
 - We are.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.860
 - That's the title of the film.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.220
 - For the Guinness World Records.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.060
 - Yep.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.340
 - Well, that's, challenge is involved in the royalties.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.220
 - He's on 10%.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.060
 - Okay.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.900
 - You're on 10%.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.740
 - You don't think of--

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.220
 - Please, I have the whole saw down them.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.220
 - Yeah, don't know.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.060
 - You're on 10%.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.180
 (laughing)

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.580
 - I feel that's for the triple X parody version.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.260
 (laughing)

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.620
 - It's such a vote of confidence, James,

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.860
 that you think we're going to get a scene remake spade.

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.660
 That's thank you.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.580
 That's really nice.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.940
 And we should put that in the pitch too Hollywood.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.460
 It's like, we think we can, you know, broaden this out.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.380
 As it were.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.700
 Right, let's carry on.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.860
 Audience quiz of the week.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.700
 - Great.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.460
 - This is, I can't put it any more simply than that.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:57.300
 Sorry.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.540
 - Well, look, are we giving the quiz time again?

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.380
 Sorry, I was the audience giving the quiz to us.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.660
 - Someone's written a quiz in.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.620
 - Someone's written a quiz for us to do.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.460
 - A quiz for us, yeah.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.300
 - Or is it a quiz that you've got for us about the audience?

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.300
 - Okay, I could have been clearer.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.140
 I could have been clearer naming this section.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.380
 - So an audience originated quiz question of the week.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.220
 - Okay.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.060
 - From Ben Rushworth.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:19.860
 Thank you, Ben.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.540
 This is my first email since becoming a friend

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.380
 of the podcast, who writes, which is a very proud moment for me.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.380
 I have always wanted to be considered alongside such luminaries

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.660
 as Robin Thickey and Mark Twain.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.660
 - Or were those enemies of the podcast?

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.820
 - Thickey, Thickey is us.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.900
 - He's an acquaintance of the podcast.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.180
 - Yeah.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.260
 He's closer than that.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.140
 He's family at this point.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.300
 - He's one of those uncles that you see at Christmas

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:48.200
 that you're like, which of course makes his father,

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.380
 Alan Thickey, our great uncle.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.540
 - Yeah.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.540
 - And Twain is definitely that enemy of the podcast.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.020
 - Twain is a part of the podcast, yeah, yeah.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.860
 Right, Philip Muir is our Mike Giggler of the month.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:59.700
 - Oh yeah.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.000
 - Who he writes, comedy gold was missed

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.060
 in the last club fish.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.900
 It's fair enough.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.020
 And you guys are gonna kick us off up the ass

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.780
 when you give us a set up and don't tell us what we missed.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:12.980
 - All right, let's see if we can get it.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:13.820
 - Okay.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.660
 - In the discussion on Forks, it was said,

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.700
 Forkall, I think this was you James,

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.980
 instead of being a TV show,

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.540
 you could sell it to the New York Times as a daily quiz.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.700
 Oh, I think I then said New Fork Times.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.700
 - New Fork Times.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.580
 - New Fork Times has in the end of a Fork.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:31.420
 - He's done it.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.260
 - And so is that it?

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.100
 - Yep.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.100
 (laughing)

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.700
 - He's done it.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.420
 Yep, he says we got nine out of 10,

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.940
 but if we'd said New Fork Times,

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.620
 that would have been 10 out of 10.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.460
 - Yeah.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.740
 - So thank you, Philip.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.580
 It's good.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.420
 I like what you're saying.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.340
 - It's good, but I said it.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.860
 I can go back and edit it back into the show now.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.860
 - You'll have to.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.700
 - Yeah.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.520
 - Yeah.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:56.140
 - And I'm actually, yes, how cars work.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.860
 - Oh, dumbeters.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.980
 We said on the show that we're not quite sure

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.260
 how speed omiters work in cars.

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.100
 - Yeah.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.980
 - And then we thought, we said right in,

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.420
 someone cavalier said right in.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.620
 - You said right in if you're a world expert on it.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.460
 - Yes.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.820
 - Not if you half know the answer.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.020
 - Well, James, thank you for saying that.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.780
 And I was used at that because we've had one email

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.220
 explaining, "Cristily Clearly"

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.260
 from David Speedometer.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.540
 (laughing)

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.380
 "Eventer of Such."

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.060
 David Sander for rights.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.100
 I have been a technician of one variety or another

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.540
 for over 50 years.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.140
 Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.020
 For many years, the speed indicator in your dash

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.500
 was driven by a cable running off a small gear

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.980
 in the transmission, which is part of the car.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.900
 (laughing)

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.700
 He doesn't say, "I'm just adding that in."

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.420
 (laughing)

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.700
 - All right, head repart.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.460
 (laughing)

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.020
 There were several different gears for many vehicles

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.700
 because tire size affects the speedometer,

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.420
 of course, because if your tire is bigger,

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.460
 once round actually means you've gone a bit further.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:06.900
 Today, the cable has been replaced by a non-contact sensor

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.700
 that reads the speed of a gear turning in the transmission.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.300
 That signal is sent to the onboard computer,

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.940
 which then sends a variable signal

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.620
 to the speed indicator in the dash.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:15.660
 So there you go.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.900
 So you're seeing the speed of a gear in the transmission,

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.660
 not the actual direct monitoring of the actual speed.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:21.660
 - Makes sense.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.820
 - And GPS can use that as well.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.580
 And that's a bit more accurate.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.140
 The average speedometer has a bit of a tolerance,

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.500
 so there's a bit of error in there.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.340
 - So there you go.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.180
 - Great.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.020
 - Well, really good.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:33.860
 - Yeah.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.020
 - Aren't you a bit boring?

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.260
 (laughing)

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.580
 - Oh, I mean, it would have been nice

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.180
 if there was a really exciting way that they worked that out.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.020
 - Oh, yeah.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.220
 I said, "Your couple is not with David's email explaining it,

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.820
 "it's with how they work."

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.980
 - Yeah, it's an awesome way.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.820
 - Oh, yeah.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.660
 - If David had written in saying,

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.700
 "Well, what they do is you turn your radio on

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.300
 "and the radio waves bounce off a wall

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.300
 "and it could tell how far you've gone in that time."

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.660
 - It tells you how far you are from BBC Radio Norfolk.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.700
 And then in a second it tells you how far you are then.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.540
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.380
 - That would have been exciting.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.380
 But as it is, the actual answer is, you know, mundane.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.220
 - Quite mundane.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.020
 - But probably very useful.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.540
 - But so if you're writing in and it's with something boring,

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.940
 just make something up.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.660
 Just make something really interesting up.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.500
 - Don't.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.340
 - And we'll read it.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.180
 - Yeah.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.940
 - Change your surname 'cause I'm in silly.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.940
 (laughing)

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.900
 - Thank you, David, for your email.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.860
 We've got, I'm actually on none, urine.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:31.700
 - Ah, yes.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.980
 Okay, Ben Hilton show again.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:33.820
 - Absolutely.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.660
 - This is the fact that for fertility purposes,

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.860
 nuns were donating their urine

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.060
 in order to help people conceive.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.660
 - Well, Helen writes, listen to the recent Ben Hilton cast,

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.380
 maybe think about the nuns who having never had,

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.940
 I'm afraid, cover your ears, children.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.020
 You can't have relations.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:53.860
 - Yes.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.260
 - She says penetrative penis in vagina sex.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.340
 (laughing)

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.860
 - We all have our ufusus.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.260
 - So we call it in our house.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.780
 (laughing)

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.980
 - It's a bit of a mouthful.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.020
 (laughing)

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.660
 - Oh dear, oh dear.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.420
 Well, those nuns who have never had that,

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.540
 very rarely get cervical cancer.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.260
 And it was this fact that led to the discovery

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.940
 of the HPV factor in cervical cancer,

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.340
 leading to the vaccine for HPV.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.180
 - Very good.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.140
 - And she pointed to us by saying HPV is almost always

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.900
 spread around by PIV.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.740
 - Yes.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:29.580
 - It seemed like a vagina.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.420
 - Yeah.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.620
 - So PIV, that's called new acronym.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.620
 - PLV, points of view.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:39.220
 - Yeah, but this is a slightly different point of view.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.900
 (laughing)

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.300
 - God, you don't want to be dyslexic looking

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.300
 for the PIV room and said good to the VIP.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.900
 (laughing)

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.180
 - Oh dear.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.140
 I think if you went to the VIP room

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.580
 and there was a mirror right next to the sign

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.060
 that says VIP room.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:56.900
 - Yeah.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.220
 - So it says PIV.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.060
 - Animal.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.580
 (laughing)

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:05.100
 - Oh, we've had some terrific non-determ.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:05.940
 - Great.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:06.780
 - I mean, really good.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.140
 Mollipair writes, medium time less than a first time emailer.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.980
 (laughing)

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.100
 - My GP is called A Doctor.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.100
 Doctor A Doctor.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:16.940
 - I love it.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.100
 - If I didn't respect her privacy, I'd send proof.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.820
 - You've sort of broken that anyway, haven't you?

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.580
 Doctor A Doctor, how many of those can there be?

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.740
 - I don't think the doctor patient confidentiality

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.620
 stretches to you not telling people

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.660
 what your doctor's called.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.620
 - No, because you have to tell people

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.620
 what your doctor's called, don't they?

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.620
 On every form you fill in there.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.460
 - Yeah.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.300
 - So what's your doctor called?

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.300
 - People must think she's filled it in wrong.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.140
 - Refused it.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.260
 (laughing)

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.740
 - It says doctor question mark

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.540
 and she just writes doctor next to it.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:43.380
 - Yep.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.260
 - She must think she's about to start a joke.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.060
 - Monty Cox sends this in.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:53.060
 Lindsay Newton, who then became a doctor, doctor Newton.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.700
 She then had a chance to marry a man whose name was sleeper

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.620
 and she wasn't going to, but then she decided

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.740
 she would take his surname.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.980
 She's now doctor sleeper.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.260
 - What kind of doctor is she?

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.340
 - Euthanasia.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.180
 - Euthanasia.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.820
 (laughing)

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.500
 - You go for a very long sleeper.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.380
 (laughing)

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:16.380
 - Hi, I'm gonna be your euthanasia today.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.860
 - I went for an eye test the other day, right?

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.940
 And the woman, the ophthalmologist said,

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.460
 you know, if you had any problems with your eyes

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.620
 and I wanted to sell it that I'd had some migraines,

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.860
 optical migraines. - Yeah.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.300
 - But I forgot the word for migraine

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.980
 and that's accidentally said,

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.940
 oh yeah, I've had a few comas.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.620
 (laughing)

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.620
 And she's like, oh no, what happened?

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.900
 And then I realized what I said and I was like,

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.580
 oh no, no, no, cause a few comas.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.260
 It does sound like it's happening again.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.020
 (laughing)

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.220
 - That was very funny.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:56.060
 - Tom Reed sent in a fairly uninteresting article.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:59.140
 His words, but it does feature a belfast tailor

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.580
 called Chris Sutter.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:01.420
 - Lovely.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.260
 - Really good.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.500
 David Bella Squires sends in a piece about scarecrow's

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.020
 by Mark Haye and a Portland dance founder

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.540
 whose name is Sarah Slipper.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:12.380
 - Very good.

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:15.500
 - And Michael Boulter writes about something you said, James,

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:20.500
 about New Zealand's state librarians.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.740
 - Oh, apparently there was a flood or a storm surge

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.980
 and they had to get all of the books out of the library

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.340
 and so they took them onto the roof

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.900
 and according to the people,

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.660
 according to the talk guide of the library,

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.020
 they did so in their underwear and no one knows why.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for unclear reasons.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.500
 So, well, Michael Boulter just wants to write in and say,

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.900
 "I can speak from experience through undertaking tasks

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.500
 "in your underpants in the rain."

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.780
 Early on a Sunday morning, my young kids and I were watching

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.540
 a hail storm from our back deck.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.340
 The kids wanted me to collect some hail

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.380
 and I could see a lot had accumulated on our trampoline.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.020
 I was in a bathrobe and jocks

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.420
 and didn't know that I had time to go inside

00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.980
 and properly gear up for the wet weather

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.620
 and rather than get my bathrobe soaked,

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.860
 I derubbed and ran out in my jocks.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.740
 My wife took a video of the whole rigmarole

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.660
 which I have omitted for your benefit.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.100
 (laughing)

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.540
 - Yeah, because actually under you said

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.260
 that it's quite good for people to get naked whenever it's raining.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.100
 - I think that's--

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.100
 - To start their clothes from getting wet.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.700
 - I think that's a spider.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.540
 It's good to be chasing it around in your pants rather than in your,

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.380
 you know, rather than it crawling into your trousers.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.700
 - Good climatic scene for your movie.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.180
 The Guinness World Record, they all are on the roof.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.020
 - Oh yeah.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.620
 - In their underwear, but we don't explain why.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.740
 - That's good. - Yeah.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.580
 - That's good.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.420
 Do you know what?

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.340
 I think, 'cause we don't know what's going on there,

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.780
 that makes sense to the film title, don't know.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.100
 (laughing)

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.100
 - What I'm thinking from all this is maybe we start off

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.540
 with the pornographic parody.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.140
 (laughing)

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.140
 - And then we fill the dates and the Hollywood movies.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.740
 - That's a really good idea.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.380
 So yeah, Michael, thank you for that.

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:56.220
 - Yeah, thank you.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.900
 - You know, very, very descriptive, you know, it's vivid.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:32:59.900
 - Send the video.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.820
 - Well, I mean, to listeners, you know,

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.420
 what's the weirdest thing you've ever done in your pants?

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:08.380
 - Is this the kind of email you're fishing for now, Andy?

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.220
 - No.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.940
 - Is this what you're gonna start doing in each episode going?

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:15.860
 And listeners, what's the sexiest picture

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.060
 you've got on your phone?

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:17.900
 (laughing)

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.140
 - Oh God.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:19.980
 No.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.820
 (laughing)

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.820
 - No, keep the inbox PG, please keep it PG.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.300
 Please.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.580
 Thank you.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.100
 'Cause it's great, and I just wanna keep it the way it is.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.700
 But we've, there we go, that's it.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.540
 That's your emails for today.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.420
 You too.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:37.260
 - Thank you.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.100
 - Thank you.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.680
 (upbeat music)

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.660
 - Thanks everyone for listening.

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.020
 We are podcast@cure.com.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.220
 If you've enjoyed this show,

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.300
 and we're gonna make another one

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.260
 whether you want us to or not.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.500
 So just there'll be another one in two weeks.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.340
 - That's right.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:56.340
 - But if you want to contribute to it,

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.580
 then email podcast@cure.com, I suppose that's the point.

00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.740
 And if you don't, then don't.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.540
 - I think you've covered all basis, yeah.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.780
 - He's bloody good at this.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:06.940
 I mean, he really is, isn't he?

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.140
 Like, he makes it so easy.

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:10.420
 - He's got a much more difficult job.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.660
 - Yeah, it's a tough wrap up.

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:13.500
 'Cause look, why?

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.900
 - It's hard to say bye sometimes.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.460
 (laughing)

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.260
 - When that old phrase of, "It's hard to say goodbye,"

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.620
 I didn't realize they were referring

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.100
 to your wrap-ups of podcasts.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.860
 (laughing)

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.100
 - Thank you, everybody for listening.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:27.940
 Bye.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.540
 (upbeat music)

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.120
 (upbeat music)

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.700
 (upbeat music)
