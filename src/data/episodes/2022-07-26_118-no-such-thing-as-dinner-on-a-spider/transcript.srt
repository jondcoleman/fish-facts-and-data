1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,880
 All right, let's move on to the next question.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,820
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,720
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,800
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,160
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray, and once again,

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,840
 we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,240
 days, and in no particular order, here we go.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,080
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,160
 OK, my fact this week is that the fear of lifts can be cured by starving the subject and

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,400
 forcing them to eat all of their meals in lifts.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,640
 How long do you have to eat all your meals in a lift for?

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,840
 I think they only did it for a day or two, but then they checked back on this person a few

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,440
 years later, and it worked.

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,000
 And this is in an old paper from 1973 that I stumbled across this week, and the paper's

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,640
 called "A Brief Treatment of Elevator Fobia" and it's by S. Brintwick and Leslie Soliom.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
 So what's the idea?

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,840
 You would sit inside an elevator and you'd be distracted, so they wouldn't know this.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,320
 So what happens is, what you do is you've got someone who's scared of elevators or lifts,

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,840
 and you say to them, "You're not allowed to eat for 24 hours," and they go, "OK, I'm

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
 not going to eat."

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,360
 And you say, "You're not allowed to drink water either," and they say, "OK."

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,000
 And then you say to them, "OK, well, you can have something to eat now, you can have some

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,640
 conflites or whatever, but you can only have it if you're inside that lift."

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,000
 And so they have to go in the lift because they're so hungry, and then I reckon just because

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 they've gone in there and they're kind of getting used to it, then they feel like-

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 This is insane.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 There's like pamphlet.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,480
 Well, and then they're okay with being in the lift because they're enjoying the eating

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
 process, so-

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,600
 No, because what it is with fobias, one good way of getting over it is by forcing yourself

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,520
 to kind of go to these places or see these things or touch these things that you're scared

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,680
 of, and slowly you kind of build up resistance and you realise that not maybe as bad as you

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,720
 think, and you kind of get over it.

34
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,600
 Really, the food is genuinely just to lure them into the lift.

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
 It really is.

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,320
 Well, I mean, just pick the guy up and push him in, I think that might be a bit more humane.

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,560
 Wouldn't that make the fobias a bit worse?

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,560
 Well, the thing is, they think a lot of it is something bad has happened that you associate

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,240
 with this thing, and usually it happens when you're between four and seven as child,

40
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,080
 and then later on you kind of, even if it's subconsciously, you put these two things together

41
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
 and so you're scared.

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,480
 I'm scared of mushrooms, so when I'm as four years old I must have been attacked by a mushroom

43
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
 or something.

44
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
 I don't know.

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
 Thank a lot of Mario.

46
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,240
 So, if I'm scared of spiders, do I have to eat all my food off a spider?

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,720
 Is that how it's going to work?

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,320
 Well, they think that one good way of stopping being scared of spiders is by to touch spiders,

49
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,120
 so you go to like a zoo and they put a tarantula on your hand and maybe it makes you feel

50
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
 better.

51
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,400
 They call it in vivo exposure, but the problem is that people don't really like to go to the

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,960
 spider house and have the spiders put on them, and I was reading an article in improbable.com

53
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,000
 and they said that a way of doing this is by augmented reality, so say you're sat in front

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,760
 of a computer and you put your hand down and there's a camera looking at your hand.

55
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,640
 The computer makes it look as if there's like cockroaches running across your hand.

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,200
 You'll think that they're running across your hand when they're not actually, and that

57
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,360
 can maybe kind of cure you have been scared of cockroaches.

58
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,800
 Wait, why is that better than just having the cockroaches run over your hand?

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,920
 Because people don't like to go, if they see cockroaches, they'll just freak out, but

60
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,400
 if they put the hand down and they're just looking at a computer, then it's easy to get someone

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,040
 in front of a computer then in front of a cockroach house.

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,040
 Okay.

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,840
 There are more computers than cockroach houses for one, there's way more.

64
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,480
 There's quite an interesting theory about where Phobias come from, that scientists have

65
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,160
 just come up with, so you were saying that it's probably a memory that you have, maybe

66
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,480
 a memory that you have from childhood, but in 2013 there was some new research done that

67
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,240
 showed you could sort of inherit memories from your ancestors.

68
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
 No.

69
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,800
 Yeah, so what happens is if one of your ancestors had a horrible experience, like they've

70
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,320
 been bitten by a spider a long long time ago, then their response to that makes a chemical

71
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,640
 imprint on your DNA, and that chemical imprint can then be passed down, so then you'll have

72
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
 this Phobias.

73
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
 You knew research that was done in 2013.

74
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,240
 Is this why I'm scared of Nazis?

75
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,040
 That explains your totally rational phobia of the Nazi plastic.

76
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,240
 Just because my grandparents had to, you know, and sort of, there's a lot of deprivation and

77
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,640
 I think that's definitely true in mice, isn't it?

78
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,320
 They showed that that was true in mice.

79
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
 Yes.

80
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
 I'm not sure it's true in humans.

81
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,360
 Yeah, it's weird that that can be imprinted into DNA.

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,960
 Yeah, so it is quite a new thing.

83
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,880
 To my sperm, the fact that I was attacked by a dog, my sperm will have that knowledge as it

84
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
 goes across.

85
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
 Yeah.

86
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,960
 I mean, not the fact you're not going to have a grandchild who's like, "Hey, I remember this

87
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,240
 weird time in the QI offices when a dog bit my textbook."

88
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
 No, I know a bit.

89
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,800
 But is the response to that makes a chemical imprint on your DNA?

90
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
 Yeah, that's mad.

91
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
 Yeah, that's cool.

92
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
 That's mad.

93
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
 A fear of clowns.

94
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 That's a big thing.

95
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
 Coolophobia.

96
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
 Yes, exactly.

97
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,200
 Sorry, I thought you were saying it was a cool phobia.

98
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
 Coolophobia.

99
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,160
 I thought you were saying it was a fear of coolers.

100
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,960
 Well, everyone's confused.

101
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,960
 So what they do now, circuses are starting to do this.

102
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,360
 They have sessions before the circus starts where if you're afraid of clowns, you can go

103
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,920
 and watch the clown do their makeup, start from a normal person and do their makeup so

104
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,880
 by the time the circus starts, you feel comfortable with them and they call it clounciling

105
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
 and use...

106
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
 Oh, God's sake.

107
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
 It's true.

108
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
 This is true.

109
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,200
 You do clounciling and you can watch clowns get their makeup done and it's meant to

110
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,200
 help you massively to see the transformation happen.

111
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,320
 But it's quite obvious that the name preceded the actual idea.

112
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
 So...

113
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:49,280
 A good method is to starve someone for a day and then they can only custom-pise.

114
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,200
 There was, I read a report that for people who were afraid of elevators.

115
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,920
 In some cases, they will opt for a job that pays less if it's in a lower floor of a building.

116
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
 Wow.

117
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,320
 So, this is the thing.

118
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,160
 Otis, the elevator company, they estimate that every

119
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,680
 five days the equivalent of the entire population of the planet uses a lift.

120
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,480
 So seven billion journeys are made and left every five days.

121
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,520
 I think it was even in their lifts.

122
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
 Exactly.

123
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
 Yes.

124
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,400
 So just the brand otis, not even a shindler.

125
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,560
 I read about an amazing lift that maybe the three of you have heard of, but I hint of.

126
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
 And I discovered it.

127
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,160
 I discovered a great website called Elevatorpedia, which is just the Wikipedia of elevators.

128
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,560
 It's got 492 articles, 9 million registered users, over 9 million.

129
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,640
 Yeah, active users was about 22.

130
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
 Right.

131
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,840
 But 9 million registered users.

132
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
 Yeah.

133
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
 They're just spumb up, is that they?

134
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
 Probably.

135
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
 Yeah.

136
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
 But they're proud.

137
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,400
 So yeah, so I started reading about, I pressed random page and just brought up different

138
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
 random pages.

139
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
 And the first one that came up was the double-decker elevator.

140
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
 Have you heard of that?

141
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
 No.

142
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
 No.

143
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
 I like the idea of pressing random article in it.

144
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
 You don't have to wait 30 seconds for it.

145
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
 That's what it is.

146
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
 Yeah.

147
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,960
 So, a double-decker elevator, it stops at two floors at a time, so you're able to cut the

148
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,000
 journey in half effectively.

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,960
 But it's impossible to go from the very bottom floor to the very top floor because you're

150
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
 yes.

151
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
 And vice versa.

152
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,320
 And you'll be a little thing on the roof where it just pops out.

153
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

154
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,160
 I'm pretty sure that you're either in a lift that goes into a sort of attic that has

155
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,240
 no door to let you out when the lift below you is trying to go.

156
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,440
 And there's a basement for the below lift to not so, yeah, you can still go to the top floor

157
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,200
 and it's very unsatisfying to get to a floor where you're not allowed to get out.

158
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
 Oh, yeah.

159
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
 This sounds like almost as terrible as well.

160
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,720
 I imagined you were describing then when I imagined that they would just stop at the

161
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,320
 same floor on both levels and either the lift would open and you'd have a six foot drop

162
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,760
 as you stepped out or it would open and you'd just be faced with the wall because you're

163
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
 on the lower level.

164
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
 Yeah.

165
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,000
 I think what we're saying is that this isn't a particularly good idea though.

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,080
 It's, they're using it in so many different countries.

167
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
 Oh, no.

168
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
 Yeah, yeah.

169
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,560
 The Burj Khalifa has it and so do a lot of Taiwan and Hong Kong and Japan skyscrapers have

170
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
 it as well.

171
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
 Wow.

172
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,600
 The thing about that is about Burj Khalifa and that, is it not the case that lifts can only

173
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,960
 go a certain number of flaws because after that the cable gets too heavy or something?

174
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,880
 Well, exciting times in lift news because they've got a new technology which means that

175
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,440
 lifts might be able to go twice as far.

176
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
 Oh, really?

177
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
 They've got a new kind of rope.

178
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,600
 It's called ultra-rope and it's made of carbon fiber.

179
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,800
 And the maximum used to be about 500 metres but now it's much bigger and they reckon that

180
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,480
 this is the only thing preventing us from building 2,000 metre high skyscrapers.

181
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
 Wow.

182
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,160
 I've been reading loads of reviews of this book called Lifted, A Cultural History of the

183
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,720
 Elevator by Andreas Bernat.

184
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,880
 I haven't read the book yet but I found one review which started off just from a member

185
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
 of the public.

186
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,480
 It said this book had its ups and downs and then it went on.

187
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,680
 Now that the joke is out of the way, this is a very interesting book.

188
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,880
 Kind of like.

189
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,560
 So they did have kind of Elevator type things, didn't they?

190
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,320
 But then the first modern Elevators they came in the 19th century.

191
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,240
 And I read that the first Elevator shaft preceded the first Elevator by four years.

192
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
 Wow.

193
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
 Wow.

194
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,560
 This is in the Wikipedia actually but I think it does stack up and this is just normal

195
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
 Wikipedia.

196
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
 Just normal Wikipedia.

197
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
 It was the Lifted, I know Elevator.

198
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
 Elevator, yeah.

199
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
 Elevator, yeah.

200
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
 It wasn't in that one.

201
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,080
 So this was in the Cooper Union Foundation building in New York in 1853 and they built it

202
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,440
 with lift shaft because the guy who built it was sure that lifts would be invented quite

203
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
 soon.

204
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
 Wow.

205
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
 It was so confident.

206
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
 Oh my God.

207
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,600
 And sure enough, four years later they did invent them but his shaft was circular and all

208
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,400
 lifts aren't circular and so they couldn't fit the lifts in, they couldn't fit a square

209
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
 lift in a round hole.

210
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
 That's interesting.

211
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,720
 Maybe not just make a circle, a bit later, Otis designed a special lift just for that building.

212
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
 Right.

213
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
 That's so cool.

214
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,680
 Do you know the secret override for a lift?

215
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,440
 If you press the floor down left right, some lifts which use particular, there's a system

216
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,720
 called Logic Controller which is the sort of the brain of the lift basically.

217
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,280
 If the lift uses Logic Controller, if you press your floor and the closed door button

218
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,040
 at the same time, you can go to whatever floor you like in a lift immediately and bypass

219
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
 all the others.

220
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
 Right.

221
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,880
 So this is according to someone on the internet who I read who said he works in a building

222
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
 with loads of lifts.

223
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:36,640
 So he works on a lift system he was sort of part of the lift team for the building.

224
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,120
 He said that if the lift uses this system that does work but obviously you can't tell.

225
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,840
 That sounds very much like an urban lift.

226
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
 Give it a go.

227
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
 Give it a go listening to this.

228
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,200
 But if everyone knows of that with you with a guy who walks and tries to do it, you've

229
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,160
 now stuck in a lift with someone who's going, you dickhead.

230
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,360
 It doesn't work but you tried to ruin my lift ride by going past my floor.

231
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,480
 If you're already in the lift, you can just press a button.

232
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,640
 It's for people on the outside who requested the lift.

233
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,880
 That's an extremely selfish thing to do though.

234
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
 Yeah.

235
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
 Or you might be in a hurry.

236
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
 You might need a piece.

237
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
 We're not advocating it.

238
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
 I know.

239
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
 It's a possibility.

240
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
 And he's a very selfish man.

241
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,560
 The rest of us would advise against it.

242
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,720
 I want to know if this is a if this is a myth and I imagine it is, people say that pressing

243
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,880
 the close button doesn't actually do it.

244
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,400
 There's no consensus on this.

245
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
 Okay.

246
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,280
 I swear to God that no one's properly refuted it.

247
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,880
 No people on the internet who work in and these lift companies, we film a QI in a building

248
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,200
 with a lot of lifts.

249
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,640
 And so I realize we had an expert.

250
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,880
 I press the closed star and I reckon they do work.

251
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
 But maybe not.

252
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,880
 We're doing in thrillers and horror movies.

253
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,320
 They're always in there, pressing it like crazy and the lift is just chilled.

254
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,920
 It's definitely true that there are some road crossings where the button doesn't really

255
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
 work.

256
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,400
 Yeah, because they're just on time, especially busy crossings.

257
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,360
 I think the closed door button is likely to work on all the lifts before health and safety

258
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
 was invented.

259
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
 There isn't.

260
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,800
 One has to just cut people up in lifts.

261
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,360
 You know, lifts in Singapore have urine detector devices in them.

262
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,480
 And I can't work out whether this is because Singaporean authorities are really paranoid

263
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,160
 about this or because there was a spate of urinating because they did say in the 90s, there was

264
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,800
 in a year there was something like 40 incidents of lifts opening and there being a puddle of

265
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,000
 urine left in them.

266
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Right.

267
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,160
 And so now if you urinate in a lift in Singapore that has one of these devices in it, then

268
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,320
 an alarm gets set off.

269
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
 The lift stops.

270
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,320
 So you're stuck in the elevator.

271
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,280
 The police are called and they come round and then start the lift so that you can get

272
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,560
 out and be arrested by the police for weighing in an elevator.

273
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
 Wow.

274
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,560
 So don't do that.

275
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
 How can I tell that it's urine?

276
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,320
 It's urine detectors, what if I spilled my bottle of water, for example.

277
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,720
 And it had like a lot of kind of urea in it.

278
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
 Yeah.

279
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
 Like all my water, don't you?

280
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,400
 I just think by water from different outlets, you can just tell people that you've got

281
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,560
 your introduction devices and I think that will deal with the majority of cases.

282
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
 That's true.

283
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,320
 It's like that stuff they don't put in swimming pools, isn't it?

284
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,400
 It's like an ink that turns colour when you pee in the pool.

285
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
 Is that not actually in there?

286
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
 No, it doesn't exist.

287
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,520
 Oh my God, I always got so worried when I actually do have a piss and waiting for

288
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
 a colour to emerge.

289
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,280
 And then I wonder if there's something wrong with my piss.

290
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
 Go to the doctor.

291
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,520
 I'm really worried my piss isn't blue.

292
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:19,920
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is my fact.

293
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,120
 My fact this week is that the Russian space agency light their rockets using giant wooden

294
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,240
 matchsticks.

295
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,400
 So this is to me, unbelievable, to me too.

296
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
 But it's real.

297
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,800
 This is from popular mechanics.

298
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,280
 So it's been verified and the idea is that the Soyuz rockets, when they're going up, so

299
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,880
 this is not for every single rocket that they launch.

300
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,160
 However, it's been used hundreds of times.

301
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,960
 The idea is that you need a consistency, there's so many booster rockets, you need a consistency

302
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,920
 of all of them to go to be lit at the same time and something needs to light them.

303
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,360
 So what they've created are these giant bits of birch wood all put together, created into

304
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,520
 effectively a giant looking match.

305
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,360
 They're sat underneath the boosters.

306
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,520
 They all have little wiring that goes right to the top and the problem is obviously as the

307
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,440
 fire picks up, the wiring gets cut off.

308
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,120
 So the idea of using the wood is to keep it lit like a match, to have the wood just flaming

309
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,760
 up and so they can light all these rockets at the same time and then that's how it goes

310
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,880
 into space.

311
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
 Giant matchsticks.

312
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
 It's nuts.

313
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
 It's very cool.

314
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
 It's so old-fashioned.

315
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
 They've been doing that for 60 years.

316
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
 Wow.

317
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
 Yeah.

318
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,400
 I read that it's the only part of a modern rocket launch system that's made of wood.

319
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
 Oh really?

320
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
 Yeah.

321
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
 Unsurprisingly, I suppose.

322
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

323
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
 Yeah, reassuringly.

324
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,640
 Did you guys know that the first lighters were guns.

325
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,360
 So they were flintlock guns and they were converted to the purpose of becoming lighters in

326
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,720
 the 16th century.

327
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,360
 So flintlock guns are any firearm that uses flint to strike up and create a flame which

328
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,400
 would propel the bullets out of it.

329
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,680
 And people realise that you could turn this ignition mechanism into a lighter and that

330
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
 was the world's first lighters.

331
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
 Wow.

332
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
 How cool is that?

333
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
 It's cool looking guns.

334
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,680
 It is cool because then you get the actual lighters today that look like guns but aren't

335
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
 really guns.

336
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
 Yes, exactly.

337
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,280
 This was the original one of those for the real cowboys.

338
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,360
 There were novelty lighters before there were lighters, but you know what we're saying.

339
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,560
 It's exactly what I'm saying.

340
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,600
 I found one of the earliest references to matchsticks from ancient China and they were

341
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,160
 originally in their translation described as light-bringing slaves.

342
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,000
 That was their name.

343
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,600
 And they were from a book called The Records of the Unworldly and the Strange, which is

344
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000
 a great title for a book and I've never heard of that before.

345
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,440
 It's an old ancient Chinese book and that's where it comes from.

346
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,760
 Yeah, the old Chinese ones, they had sulfur on the end of them.

347
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,280
 But you had to light them from another light, basically.

348
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,600
 You needed another fire source in order to light them.

349
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,360
 So I don't know if that counts as much.

350
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
 Oh, okay.

351
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
 I'm cheesy.

352
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
 Definitely cheesy.

353
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,840
 I used in the, for 19th century matches as well and that was where matches really took

354
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,760
 off and we got match factories and match girls and things like this.

355
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,880
 The problem with matches in the first place was that they were very easy to light and so

356
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,520
 they would set fires and things like this.

357
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,040
 But in 1844, the safety match was invented.

358
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,160
 It was by a Swedish professor called Pash and what he did was he just split up the chemicals

359
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,840
 that he needed to set the match aflame.

360
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,440
 So the phosphorus that he did need, he just put on, that's what's on the surface of

361
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
 the box.

362
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,560
 So you have to combine the two elements, which had originally been both in the match head

363
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
 together.

364
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
 Oh, wow.

365
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,560
 And that was why I see.

366
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,960
 It ignited so easily, it's because it's all there ready for you, whereas this is guaranteed

367
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
 time.

368
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,640
 So what could because before that, I think if, because it was all together, if you just sort

369
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,640
 of accidentally rubbed your match up against any surface, what is that nice?

370
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,520
 So you get people sort of striking it on, you know, jeans or stubble or the gravet or

371
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
 a wall or whatever.

372
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
 Yeah.

373
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,360
 So these dodgy ones were the ones invented by the guy from Stockton called John Walker and

374
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,600
 they were banned in France and Germany because they were so dangerous.

375
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,120
 And they were giant matches as well.

376
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,920
 So the first problem matches were giant matches, they were a yard long.

377
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
 What?

378
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
 Yes.

379
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,400
 And to like them, you had to pull, you got a fold of sandpaper, put the match in between

380
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
 there, pulled it out.

381
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,240
 And it, they were so dangerous though, because often a flaming ball of material would fall

382
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,960
 off the end of the match and so far as to the ground or the carpet or wherever you were

383
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,440
 or someone's dress.

384
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,720
 He was, he was a good guy though, John Walker, because he refused to pay it in his matches.

385
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,000
 He had a decent amount of money.

386
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,760
 So he, he really did invent the lighting match, even though it was a little bit dodgy to start

387
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
 with.

388
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,200
 It was based on what he did that everyone else built their match technology.

389
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,680
 And he, yeah, had enough money and said he didn't want to pay it in the imagine at all.

390
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,240
 Michael Faraday and other people like that said that he should get money out of it.

391
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,960
 He never made a penny and he never got the credit for it until after he died.

392
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,520
 So what was actually a Frenchman called Chancel who came up with one 20 years before him?

393
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
 Oh, what's that?

394
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
 Yeah.

395
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,240
 And that one had an end tipped with potassium chlorate and sulphur.

396
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,280
 And you had to put acid on it to set that one safe, even more dangerous.

397
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,480
 And the one, there was another Frenchman Charles Soria, who invented one very shortly after

398
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,920
 John Walker and it relied on phosphorus.

399
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,920
 And they kept using the phosphorus in this country, so it sounds like they banned it in

400
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
 other countries.

401
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,040
 But in this country they kept using phosphorus in matches until 1906.

402
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,280
 And it was incredibly poisonous.

403
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,360
 So everyone who worked in those factories got this thing called fossy jaw, which was where

404
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,560
 your teeth would rot and your whole face would swell up and your jaw bones would rot because

405
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,200
 the phosphorus was so toxic your hair would fall out.

406
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,640
 So anyone who like used regularly or worked with making these matches would just, they'd

407
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
 fall apart.

408
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,920
 And I read that it would make you vomit, even a tiny amount breathing it in would make

409
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
 you vomit.

410
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,640
 And you could see the way people walked home from the phosphorus factory because there

411
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,240
 would be like pools of fluorescent vomit on the wall.

412
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,840
 Do you know the world match stick model record?

413
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
 What are we going for?

414
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
 Size.

415
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
 So a number of matches.

416
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
 That's a number of matches.

417
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
 A million.

418
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
 280,000.

419
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
 I do know.

420
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,840
 So I'm only cheating for me to say.

421
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,360
 It's the answer is, it's a model of an oil rig.

422
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,320
 It's made by a man called David Reynolds, who used to work on oil rigs.

423
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,320
 It contains 4,075,000 matches.

424
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
 Wow.

425
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
 It's huge.

426
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
 That's amazing.

427
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
 It's really good.

428
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,320
 It took him over 15 years to make.

429
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
 Wow.

430
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
 Yeah.

431
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
 What a great use of a life.

432
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
 I know.

433
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,320
 There's other people who are telling these things and he just does this, you know.

434
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
 Yeah.

435
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
 It's quite cool.

436
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,160
 But we are not suggesting you build the world's biggest match stick thing instead of watching

437
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
 our show on Fridays.

438
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
 No, great.

439
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
 Good point.

440
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,560
 Yeah, I feel really sorry for his son because he said that it was just that one Christmas his

441
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,480
 son bought him a match stick kit of a train to build a train of match sticks.

442
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
 And that feels really like the sun.

443
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
 Doesn't know what to get his dad.

444
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
 I'll just get him to this.

445
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
 Who cares?

446
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
 He can put it in a corner.

447
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
 Forget about it.

448
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,560
 And I bet he really regrets that 20 years later when all his dad's done or talked about

449
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,960
 is the fact that he's built 100,000 match stick items.

450
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,400
 All he's forever been trying to make up for this shit present that he got by going,

451
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
 "No, I really love it.

452
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
 Look, I'm making my next thing.

453
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
 Look, I'm going to make my way."

454
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
 He hates it.

455
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,280
 And again, it has two other match stick related world records.

456
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,680
 Okay, let's hear them.

457
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,960
 Most match sticks stacked into a tower in one minute.

458
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
 Yeah, great.

459
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,680
 Let's say one a second, 60.

460
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
 Very close.

461
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
 59.

462
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,680
 Not bad.

463
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
 4 million.

464
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
 It's 74.

465
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
 Wow.

466
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
 Yeah.

467
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,520
 And the other one, this is the one which I think is most beatable, possibly, is the largest collection

468
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,120
 of musical instruments made from match sticks.

469
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
 Okay.

470
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,120
 Which is about 10.

471
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,120
 I know what I'm getting you for your next match.

472
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,120
 11 kits.

473
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
 Yeah.

474
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,240
 I've just got a couple of things on, I've been looking into odd ways things are lit.

475
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,000
 I suddenly thought, "How do you light the Olympic torch?"

476
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,120
 What's the process there?

477
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,840
 And so probably we all know it's lit in Olympia.

478
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,120
 It's got a classic kind.

479
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,680
 It actually is a flame that goes though.

480
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,080
 But I had no idea how much backup flame that they have.

481
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
 Should it go out?

482
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
 Have you heard about this?

483
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,080
 I thought it pretty much went out all the time.

484
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
 Yes, it does.

485
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,080
 They have backup flame that they've brought with them from Olympia from the very same fire

486
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,600
 and they relight it using that exact flame.

487
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,000
 So the flame has broken up into all different little compartments so that it can be relit with

488
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 the original flame.

489
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,200
 Wait, so what are they storing the flame on?

490
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,480
 And there are just lots of other people holding back up Olympic torchers.

491
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,000
 They're in buses and stuff that travel with them, yeah.

492
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 What's this just containing giant fires?

493
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,200
 Yeah, you can see a photo.

494
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,280
 So when they leave Olympia, they take lifelame on the planes over to where they're going.

495
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,560
 So you can see there's a photo of British Airways where two seats have lifelames, four capsules

496
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
 of lifelames.

497
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,920
 They're obviously got a lid on them.

498
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,320
 And they carry that by, I think that's the only lifelame that you're allowed to take on

499
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
 a plane.

500
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,280
 I just think that backup Olympic flame thing is the stupidest thing I've ever, it's so,

501
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
 it doesn't matter.

502
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
 It's a flame.

503
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
 Yeah.

504
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
 It's symbolic.

505
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
 I guess that's what they're going for.

506
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,000
 They're invented by the Nazis as well.

507
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 What's it?

508
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 I think so.

509
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Fire.

510
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,760
 No, I think they invented the idea of like a Olympic flame relay.

511
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

512
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
 If you're right.

513
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,760
 I've got such a cool thing about fire, making fire.

514
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,040
 Just do you guys know about the new fire ceremony that the Aztecs had?

515
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
 No.

516
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,560
 This was this so that the Aztec calendar cycle was every 52 years.

517
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:23,640
 And at the end of every 52 years, the Aztecs ordered the all fires in the whole Aztec

518
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,520
 Empire were extinguished and they had to start again.

519
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,400
 So every single person after 52 years had to put out their fire.

520
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,120
 And then they go on top of this, on top of this mountain and a priest would light the

521
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,880
 first fire for the new calendar cycle and what was called the new fire ceremony.

522
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,120
 And what he did was he'd light it inside the chest cavity of a sacrificed person.

523
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,520
 So they'd sacrifice someone, they'd take it up to the top of this mountain, they open

524
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
 up their chest.

525
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,680
 And then the Aztec priest lights a fire inside his chest.

526
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,320
 And then he'd, a bunch of people would be allowed to come forward and dip their sticks

527
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,640
 in the fire and take it up.

528
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
 Oh my God.

529
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,200
 It is tasting barbecue I ever had.

530
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
 Wow.

531
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,960
 And then the fire would be distributed throughout the Empire again and that marked the start

532
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
 of the new calendar.

533
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
 Wow.

534
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:12,560
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

535
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,440
 My fact is that the film The Who Framed Roger Rabbit is based on a true story.

536
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
 Okay.

537
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,080
 It's a heartwarming story of a rabbit, no, so it's loosely based, but it is based on an

538
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,600
 actual story of something that happened in America in the early 20th century.

539
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,600
 So can you explain to me what happens in The Who Framed Roger Rabbit because I haven't

540
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
 seen it.

541
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,240
 It's very complicated, but basically there's a transport conspiracy.

542
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,700
 You don't want to give away all the spoilers of the film and it's about, you know, the

543
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
 car and about.

544
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,240
 And there's a giant rabbit, isn't there?

545
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
 He's not a giant rabbit.

546
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
 Oh, is he not?

547
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
 I think it is.

548
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,760
 He is bigger than a normal rabbit, but he's not taller than Bob Hoskins.

549
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,320
 Well, I still think that that's what the size of a rabbit and Bob Hoskins, if you can imagine

550
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,640
 such a thing and he's got a bow tie on, how tall would you say he is, taller than four

551
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,640
 feet?

552
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
 Yeah.

553
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,000
 I think that that has a very big rabbit with his upright.

554
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,680
 He's probably taller than Bob Hoskins, isn't it?

555
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
 No, I don't think he is.

556
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,680
 No, no, he's not.

557
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,480
 He never is taller than Bob Hoskins, even he was poised.

558
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
 Really?

559
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,800
 And Bob Hoskins was a very short man.

560
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,360
 Actually, perhaps it isn't a more rabbit-sized.

561
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
 Yeah.

562
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,040
 Anyway, I think this isn't the true element of the story.

563
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,320
 It sounds like a great film, actually.

564
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,120
 It is a really good film, but the story that it's based on is the thing that actually happened.

565
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,920
 It's a group of car and oil companies, they were called national city lines, right?

566
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,920
 And there was control by general motors.

567
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,320
 And the thing that they did in the early years of the 20th century, they bought up loads

568
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,680
 of streetcar lines, so these streetcars with rails, trolley buses, things like this.

569
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,040
 All across America, they bought these up, and they dismantled them and shut them off.

570
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,640
 And they also ran a lot of buses, so as an automobile bus is running on roads, as opposed

571
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,200
 to running on rails.

572
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:02,360
 And they were eventually fined a huge amount for kind of monopolising, attempting to monopolise

573
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,760
 the market for transport equipment.

574
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,320
 So some people think that this was a huge conspiracy designed to create the age of the

575
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,560
 car and to shut down public transport in favour of it.

576
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,480
 Because there was oil and car companies that were doing this.

577
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,160
 It's a bit more complicated than that, because the streetcar industry was already in decline,

578
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,000
 and it's also a lot easier to run a bus, which doesn't need a rail, than it is to run

579
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 a streetcar.

580
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,040
 I'm glad you debunked that popular business.

581
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,440
 This was absolutely huge, and the low to people still believe it.

582
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,760
 I think in America it's a really big idea that the age of the car was stitched up by

583
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
 a load of these companies.

584
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:47,480
 I've got to say, Roger Abbott didn't really do justice to the seriousness of the, it's

585
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
 based on it.

586
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,280
 I am starting to understand why they felt they needed to add car to encourage us to live

587
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,280
 not the story.

588
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,880
 Just to give a quick proper background on Roger Abbott as a movie.

589
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,080
 It was Robert Zemeckis, who directed it, which was the back to the future director.

590
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,720
 It came out in 1988, and the technology of the animation mixed with real life footage

591
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,800
 was so advanced, so new that the very same year that was made, or let's say the Oscars

592
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:19,080
 that happened post the movie's release, recognized its animator, Richard Williams, as an innovator

593
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,880
 and gave him a special Oscar.

594
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,080
 Like it's just a completely separate special Oscar to say this movie has changed everything

595
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,560
 for filmmaking with animation, so it's a really important movie in the history of cinema.

596
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:36,280
 Also, it's the only film where Loonie Tune's characters and Disney cartoon characters appear

597
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
 in the same film.

598
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,600
 It's very rare to see, for example, Mickey Mouse and Boogie Pick.

599
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,000
 And they insisted, both companies insisted, that their characters have exactly equal amount

600
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,160
 of screen time as the other company's characters didn't they?

601
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,680
 And that was why, and like I say, I haven't seen it, but apparently Bugs Bunny, so wherever

602
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,760
 you see Warner Bros. character, that's accompanied by a Disney character.

603
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,400
 So I think that there are two pairings of characters in the film, and the pairings are always

604
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,880
 a Warner Bros. character and a Disney character, because both companies said if your guy's getting

605
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
 screen time, my guy's going to get screen time.

606
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,520
 Yeah, because Roger Rabbit with Loonie Tunes and Bob Hoskins is, of course, a Disney cartoon

607
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
 character.

608
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
 Yeah.

609
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,680
 So one thing that's interesting about this is that it mustn't necessarily be the movie

610
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,200
 that was based on real life stuff, because Roger Rabbit was based off a novel called

611
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,960
 Who Sensored Roger Rabbit, which was written by Gary K Wolfe.

612
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,760
 Very dark and very different to the, had no Loonie Tune characters, for example.

613
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,040
 So that, I'm wondering if that's where the original political message about what you were so

614
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:41,120
 interestingly talking about.

615
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,000
 That's beyond the pile.

616
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,640
 Did you see that Bill Murray was the first choice to play the Bob Hoskins character?

617
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
 It was too tall.

618
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,920
 He was just that bit bigger than a rabbit.

619
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,840
 You make the rabbit look like a rabbit.

620
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,160
 He, no, they couldn't get hold of him, because you know Bill Murray has that famous thing

621
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,120
 where he refuses to have an agent.

622
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,200
 So he was Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spiel got Bob Hoskins first choice.

623
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
 They couldn't get hold of him.

624
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,360
 And Bill Murray said afterwards it was a real regret and he wished he could have done it.

625
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,760
 And it does make you think we'll get a starting agent then, mate.

626
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,680
 But yeah, he said that my Bob Hoskins is instead.

627
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
 Right.

628
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,360
 I did read reviews for Who Sensored Roger Rabbit, the first one, that it's got my favorite

629
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,720
 opening line of a review, of a review here as person said.

630
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,800
 This would have been a decent airplane book, but I wasn't flying anywhere.

631
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
 And there's a lot of differences.

632
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,400
 Like in the book, Roger Rabbit actually is killed.

633
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,360
 And they have a really interesting literary device where cartoon characters are able to

634
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,880
 create a doppelganger of themselves immediately to do stunt double work in movies.

635
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,480
 So in the novel Roger Rabbit is killed, but he creates a doppelganger who can last a few

636
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,720
 days, the longest doppelganger of any of them, who helps the story.

637
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,120
 The rules of cartoons are very different to the rules of real life, aren't they?

638
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
 What?

639
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
 Yeah.

640
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,920
 And they're getting my plans for jumping off that building later.

641
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,280
 This I haven't seen Who Sensored Roger Rabbit, but I think they kind of explore this in the

642
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,040
 film, don't they?

643
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:08,440
 There's a thing called the O'Donnell's Laws of Cartoon Motion, which was in a squire, and

644
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,280
 there are few like rules that happen in cartoons which don't happen in real life.

645
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,320
 So anybody suspended in space will remain in space until made aware of its situation.

646
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
 Wow, yeah, yeah.

647
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
 Kind of thing.

648
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320
 Yeah.

649
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,440
 Everything falls faster than an anvil is another one.

650
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
 Okay.

651
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,000
 I'm just saying that if you're falling down and so is an anvil, you'll hit the floor and

652
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,760
 then the anvil will hit your head on this thing.

653
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,580
 And there was a guy called Art Babits who is an animator from Walt Disney Studios and he

654
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:39,280
 said animation follows a lot of physics unless it's funnier otherwise.

655
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
 And I think they mentioned that movie as well, don't they?

656
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
 Something similar to that.

657
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,520
 And they've got things like tunnels that you throw onto walls and then you can run into

658
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
 the tunnel.

659
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,200
 But you can't follow them, you sort of, if you follow the human, you hit the wall.

660
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
 Yeah.

661
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
 It's the kind of thing.

662
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,040
 So Bob Hoskinson didn't speak to him for a while after he made two-frame Roger Abbott.

663
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,320
 Do you know why?

664
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,040
 It was because so his son Jack was three at the time and Hoskinson said an interview a few

665
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,040
 years ago that when his son Jack found out what he'd been working on, he wouldn't speak

666
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,920
 to him for a long time and Hoskins was really upset.

667
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,080
 And after about two weeks his son admitted that the reason he wasn't speaking to him was

668
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,320
 because he'd been working with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck the whole time and hadn't even

669
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
 introduced him to him.

670
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
 Oh, amazing.

671
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,320
 That's great.

672
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:28,920
 Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show and that is Chisinski.

673
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,720
 My fact is that the first ever wristwatch doubled up as a thermometer.

674
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,120
 Yeah, I just really like this.

675
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,920
 It's like a modern day gadget, but...

676
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:44,760
 What sort of thermometer is in Oral or, as James says, rectal?

677
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,160
 It was a whistle, a Ristal thermometer.

678
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,440
 Oh, it was a little thermometer on the...

679
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,440
 You had to shove your wrist up, your butt.

680
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,720
 It was designed for very flexible people.

681
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,320
 So this was a watch that was designed by Abraham Louis Breguet who was known as the Father

682
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
 of Modern Horology.

683
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,320
 He was sort of the leading person in watchmaking, in clockmaking and watchmaking at the turn of

684
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,040
 the 19th century.

685
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:15,480
 And one of the things he did work out how to do was to stop changes in the temperature

686
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,920
 altering a clock mechanism.

687
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,640
 So watches at the time, pocket watches, 'cause wristwatches didn't exist yet.

688
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,680
 Watches at the time, if the temperature change, would be a bit disrupted by that.

689
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,040
 So you could only guarantee that your watch would be correct within about two hours at the

690
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,920
 end of the 18th century.

691
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,040
 And he created a little thing, like a thermostat inside watches, which would work out when the

692
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,480
 temperature had got to a certain point and adjust the watch accordingly.

693
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,800
 And so he thought, well, I'll just add a little thermometer in, things I'm sensing

694
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,040
 the temperature anyway.

695
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,480
 And so he made this watch and it was for Napoleon's sister, actually, the Queen of Naples.

696
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,440
 She was called Caroline Murat.

697
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,400
 And he made it in 1810, started making it in 1810, and he delivered to her in 1812.

698
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,600
 And yeah, it was the first ever wristwatch.

699
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,640
 And the bracelet was made of a thread of hair and a little bit of gold thread.

700
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
 A thread of hair.

701
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,320
 A few threads of hair.

702
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,320
 Yeah.

703
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
 It was made of some hair.

704
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
 Like lots of threads of hair.

705
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
 More than one thread.

706
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,320
 She had to think her.

707
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
 Oh my God.

708
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:17,640
 I find it amazing how wristwatches were seen as really sort of effeminate and not suitable

709
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,560
 for proper men was basic implication for loads of their history.

710
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,960
 It was only in the first world war that they really took off, because it was very important

711
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,480
 for officers to be able to consult the same time and also pocket watches were pretty impractical

712
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
 in the trenches.

713
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,200
 We read an article in the Atlantic about the history of the wristwatch, and they said

714
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,200
 that someone at the time, when they first became popular after the war, someone said

715
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,760
 that Vodville artists and moving picture actors have utilized it as a fun maker as a Ciliass

716
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
 Fad.

717
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
 Yeah.

718
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
 Ciliass Fad.

719
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
 The wristwatch.

720
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
 Fools.

721
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,520
 Did you guys know about repeaters on watches?

722
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,440
 Because I didn't really understand what they were until I was really up on this.

723
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,440
 No.

724
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,640
 So this was a technology that was found on watches at the turn of the 19th century.

725
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,320
 It was on this watch that Brege gave to the Queen of Naples.

726
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,840
 And what it was was, it was a way of telling the time in the dark.

727
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,360
 If you wanted to tell the time, but it was dark, so you couldn't see a watch, you would press

728
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,920
 a little button on it, and it would, an alarm would go off, that would tell you the hour,

729
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,440
 and then how many quarters passed the hour you passed.

730
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
 Oh, nice.

731
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,800
 So you could tell the time to within a quarter of an hour.

732
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:30,000
 So if it was, let's say, 5.30, it would give five chimes in a certain deep tone, and then

733
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,200
 it would give two chimes in a lighter tone, which would show you it was five o'clock, and

734
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,800
 then two quarter hours had passed.

735
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,800
 That's pretty simple.

736
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
 And all watches at this time had this.

737
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
 This quarter repeated thing.

738
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,840
 It's half a pizza, which would give it to, obviously, within half an hour.

739
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
 It's amazing.

740
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
 Yeah, really cool.

741
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,840
 Yeah.

742
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,760
 I was at the design museum last year, and they had a watch, a wristwatch for blind people,

743
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,560
 which was, if I remember rightly, it just kind of looked like a normal face, but it had

744
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,920
 these little marbles on it, and they were magnetic, and they moved around, depending on

745
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,560
 the time, so you could kind of feel like a Braille, a Braille watch.

746
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
 That's amazing.

747
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
 It is really cool.

748
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
 That's awesome.

749
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
 That's really incredible.

750
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,840
 But what we used to do before we had watches and clocks, because obviously, I know about

751
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,600
 the sun dial, but I was just thinking, what if you just didn't, if you went further back,

752
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,320
 and what people used to do, and in spots of Africa used to do this, you would just, you

753
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,120
 would know the arc of the sun throughout the day.

754
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,080
 You'd know where it would pass, and so what you would do is you would point to a bit of

755
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,200
 the sky and say, let's meet when the sun's there in the sky, when it's reached that

756
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
 bit of the sky.

757
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,480
 And because they know the mapping of how the sun goes across so well, they would just know

758
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,480
 to look up and go, oh yeah, it's effectively four o'clock.

759
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,560
 I'd better go and meet Mike now.

760
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
 Oh, really?

761
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
 That's how it works.

762
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,560
 Yeah.

763
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,160
 It was not confusing though, because if you point and you say, let's meet there, and you

764
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,120
 point it somewhere, what people go, do you mean then at that time, or there in that place?

765
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,800
 Oh, you point it to the sky.

766
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,120
 So no one, unless it was a really mountainous region, yeah, I guess you were.

767
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,640
 So you just turn to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro.

768
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
 Yeah.

769
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,640
 Where is Mike?

770
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,680
 Oh, no, he must have meant four o'clock.

771
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,240
 I'm so embarrassed.

772
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,000
 So this reminds me of something that we've covered on QI, which is about how it was hard

773
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,320
 actually to know the exact time in the 19th century, even most people didn't have watches.

774
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,360
 And there was one family in London who for 100 years made a living, out of letting people

775
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,080
 look at their watches.

776
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
 Which is so cool.

777
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,080
 That's amazing.

778
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:33,160
 He's called Ruth Belville and her parents and her father started the company in 1836.

779
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,440
 They worked in Greenwich.

780
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,240
 And so he'd set his watch to Greenwich time at the start of the day.

781
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,240
 And then he'd get what's described as a buggy, which I'm not sure what that was in 1836.

782
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,360
 And he'd drive around London and he'd have people on contracts who would pay him in exchange

783
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,720
 for him telling them the time.

784
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
 And she kept doing that.

785
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,720
 She did it up until 1940.

786
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
 Yeah.

787
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,960
 I think you could kind of get season tickets from them as well, couldn't you?

788
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,520
 Like it'd be a bit cheaper and they'd come every week or something.

789
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,520
 Oh, could you.

790
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
 Yeah.

791
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,920
 And there was a guy called Mr. St. John Win who in 1908 wrote to the Times saying that her

792
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,960
 methods were completely out of date and it was ridiculous.

793
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,040
 And he suggested that she was using her femininity to gain business.

794
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,800
 Maybe she kept the watch in a cleavage or something like that, something that's all see.

795
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:25,200
 Did the letter of the Times say, dear, the Times, you of all newspapers should know that.

796
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,440
 This guy, sorry, this guy said John Win.

797
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,680
 He was the director of Standard Time Company who happened to be one of her like biggest kind

798
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
 of competitors.

799
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,040
 Oh, did they make watches?

800
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,680
 They were the people who supposedly start in charge of Standard Time in London.

801
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,680
 Okay.

802
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,680
 Makes sense.

803
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,400
 But it gave a massive publicity as well as set off the back of it.

804
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,000
 So actually business boomed for her.

805
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,080
 So in your face, Mr. St. John, what's your call?

806
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,080
 Win, yeah.

807
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,640
 It was St. John last moment, God.

808
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,920
 So in 1936, there was a big moment for her business in a bad way, which was the telephone

809
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,920
 speaking clock that really stopped a lot of business.

810
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,120
 But weirdly, then it was voiced by a lady and her name was Ethel Cain.

811
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:13,680
 And Ethel Cain lived in the exact same town as Ruth.

812
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,160
 They were virtually next door neighbors.

813
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,240
 Oh, but they never spoke to each other.

814
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
 What a sitcom.

815
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,960
 There is to be written there.

816
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,200
 Outskirts of Croydon is where they both lived.

817
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
 Wow.

818
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
 Yeah.

819
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
 God, attention.

820
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
 Attention in that neighborhood must have been palpable.

821
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
 Yeah.

822
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,680
 I do think it's amazing the sort of just to go back to wristwatches very, very briefly.

823
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:38,040
 The sort of, it was basically homophobia was what it was going on was people were saying

824
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,600
 that people who wear wristwatches are effeminate and not sort of, not the right sort of people.

825
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,520
 So if you had a wristwatch, you would be called a wristwatch boy and people would say this

826
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,000
 about you and it's sort of really in an insulting way.

827
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 Yeah.

828
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,480
 And there was, so here's something from the Albuquerque journal in May 1914.

829
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,480
 The fellow who wears a wristwatch is frequently suspected of having lace on his laundry and

830
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,240
 of braiding his hair at night.

831
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,560
 I mean, it's pretty plain.

832
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,320
 And in New Orleans, there was a theater where there was a play on it.

833
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,080
 They said the main character is not portrayed by a wristwatch screen actor, dude, but by

834
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
 a man's man.

835
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,160
 I'm not surprised of dude being used in that sense of that.

836
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,560
 That dude is very, yeah, dude is nice in century, I think.

837
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

838
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,560
 But basically, it took the first world war to shift that perception.

839
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,560
 Should we wrap up, Sunish?

840
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,560
 Yeah.

841
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,560
 There's a really cool story related to wristwatches and the original guy in this fact, and this

842
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,080
 is about the Marriant Onet Watch, which was another watch that Abraham Louis Brege made.

843
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:42,640
 So this was commissioned by a guy who fancied Marriant Onet in 1782, and it was completed

844
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,520
 by Brege's son in 1827, 44 years after it had been ordered, 34 years after Marriant Onet

845
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,840
 had died, and four years after he'd actually died, but it was unbelievably complicated.

846
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,500
 So it's still the fifth, consider the fifth most complicated watch ever made.

847
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,080
 It was really, really beautiful, and it was handed down various generations, and it ended

848
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:09,560
 up in the Maya Museum of Islamic Art in Jerusalem in 1983, where it got stolen in that year.

849
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,760
 And so there was a big police hunt, no one could find where it was.

850
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,200
 There's this original watch made for Marriant Onet.

851
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,360
 And then this guy called Nicholas Hayek, who was the CEO of the Swatch Group, which had taken

852
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:23,360
 over the Brege company, said in 1999 that he was the term that they'd make a replica.

853
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,120
 And so he went about making this replica, and that even took a few years.

854
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,280
 So that was commissioned in 2004.

855
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,120
 And just before the replica was about to be completed and displayed, then lawyer in America

856
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:40,120
 got a letter from a woman who said that she had to return a bunch of objects that her

857
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,240
 husband had left in his will, saying that he'd stolen them decades earlier.

858
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,220
 And one of those objects was the Marriant Onet watch.

859
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,160
 And so just as this replica was about to reappear, the watch itself surfaced.

860
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
 Wow.

861
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
 How great is that?

862
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,160
 Yeah.

863
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,560
 Okay, that's it.

864
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
