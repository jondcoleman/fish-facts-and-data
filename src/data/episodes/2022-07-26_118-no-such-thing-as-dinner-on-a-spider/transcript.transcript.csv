00:00:00,00:00:10,"All right, let's move on to the next question."
00:00:10,00:00:17,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:17,00:00:20,to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:20,00:00:21,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:21,00:00:27,"I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray, and once again,"
00:00:27,00:00:30,we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven
00:00:30,00:00:34,"days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:34,00:00:36,"Starting with you, James Harkin."
00:00:36,00:00:42,"OK, my fact this week is that the fear of lifts can be cured by starving the subject and"
00:00:42,00:00:47,forcing them to eat all of their meals in lifts.
00:00:47,00:00:50,How long do you have to eat all your meals in a lift for?
00:00:50,00:00:54,"I think they only did it for a day or two, but then they checked back on this person a few"
00:00:54,00:00:56,"years later, and it worked."
00:00:56,00:01:01,"And this is in an old paper from 1973 that I stumbled across this week, and the paper's"
00:01:01,00:01:07,"called ""A Brief Treatment of Elevator Fobia"" and it's by S. Brintwick and Leslie Soliom."
00:01:07,00:01:08,So what's the idea?
00:01:08,00:01:12,"You would sit inside an elevator and you'd be distracted, so they wouldn't know this."
00:01:12,00:01:17,"So what happens is, what you do is you've got someone who's scared of elevators or lifts,"
00:01:17,00:01:20,"and you say to them, ""You're not allowed to eat for 24 hours,"" and they go, ""OK, I'm"
00:01:20,00:01:21,"not going to eat."""
00:01:21,00:01:24,"And you say, ""You're not allowed to drink water either,"" and they say, ""OK."""
00:01:24,00:01:29,"And then you say to them, ""OK, well, you can have something to eat now, you can have some"
00:01:29,00:01:32,"conflites or whatever, but you can only have it if you're inside that lift."""
00:01:32,00:01:36,"And so they have to go in the lift because they're so hungry, and then I reckon just because"
00:01:36,00:01:39,"they've gone in there and they're kind of getting used to it, then they feel like-"
00:01:39,00:01:40,This is insane.
00:01:40,00:01:42,There's like pamphlet.
00:01:42,00:01:45,"Well, and then they're okay with being in the lift because they're enjoying the eating"
00:01:45,00:01:46,"process, so-"
00:01:46,00:01:51,"No, because what it is with fobias, one good way of getting over it is by forcing yourself"
00:01:51,00:01:55,to kind of go to these places or see these things or touch these things that you're scared
00:01:55,00:01:59,"of, and slowly you kind of build up resistance and you realise that not maybe as bad as you"
00:01:59,00:02:01,"think, and you kind of get over it."
00:02:01,00:02:04,"Really, the food is genuinely just to lure them into the lift."
00:02:04,00:02:05,It really is.
00:02:05,00:02:09,"Well, I mean, just pick the guy up and push him in, I think that might be a bit more humane."
00:02:09,00:02:11,Wouldn't that make the fobias a bit worse?
00:02:11,00:02:16,"Well, the thing is, they think a lot of it is something bad has happened that you associate"
00:02:16,00:02:21,"with this thing, and usually it happens when you're between four and seven as child,"
00:02:21,00:02:26,"and then later on you kind of, even if it's subconsciously, you put these two things together"
00:02:26,00:02:27,and so you're scared.
00:02:27,00:02:30,"I'm scared of mushrooms, so when I'm as four years old I must have been attacked by a mushroom"
00:02:30,00:02:31,or something.
00:02:31,00:02:32,I don't know.
00:02:32,00:02:33,Thank a lot of Mario.
00:02:33,00:02:38,"So, if I'm scared of spiders, do I have to eat all my food off a spider?"
00:02:38,00:02:40,Is that how it's going to work?
00:02:40,00:02:46,"Well, they think that one good way of stopping being scared of spiders is by to touch spiders,"
00:02:46,00:02:50,so you go to like a zoo and they put a tarantula on your hand and maybe it makes you feel
00:02:50,00:02:51,better.
00:02:51,00:02:56,"They call it in vivo exposure, but the problem is that people don't really like to go to the"
00:02:56,00:03:01,"spider house and have the spiders put on them, and I was reading an article in improbable.com"
00:03:01,00:03:07,"and they said that a way of doing this is by augmented reality, so say you're sat in front"
00:03:07,00:03:10,of a computer and you put your hand down and there's a camera looking at your hand.
00:03:10,00:03:14,The computer makes it look as if there's like cockroaches running across your hand.
00:03:14,00:03:18,"You'll think that they're running across your hand when they're not actually, and that"
00:03:18,00:03:21,can maybe kind of cure you have been scared of cockroaches.
00:03:21,00:03:23,"Wait, why is that better than just having the cockroaches run over your hand?"
00:03:23,00:03:27,"Because people don't like to go, if they see cockroaches, they'll just freak out, but"
00:03:27,00:03:32,"if they put the hand down and they're just looking at a computer, then it's easy to get someone"
00:03:32,00:03:35,in front of a computer then in front of a cockroach house.
00:03:35,00:03:36,Okay.
00:03:36,00:03:41,"There are more computers than cockroach houses for one, there's way more."
00:03:41,00:03:45,"There's quite an interesting theory about where Phobias come from, that scientists have"
00:03:45,00:03:49,"just come up with, so you were saying that it's probably a memory that you have, maybe"
00:03:49,00:03:53,"a memory that you have from childhood, but in 2013 there was some new research done that"
00:03:53,00:03:57,showed you could sort of inherit memories from your ancestors.
00:03:57,00:03:58,No.
00:03:58,00:04:01,"Yeah, so what happens is if one of your ancestors had a horrible experience, like they've"
00:04:01,00:04:06,"been bitten by a spider a long long time ago, then their response to that makes a chemical"
00:04:06,00:04:11,"imprint on your DNA, and that chemical imprint can then be passed down, so then you'll have"
00:04:11,00:04:12,this Phobias.
00:04:12,00:04:15,You knew research that was done in 2013.
00:04:15,00:04:21,Is this why I'm scared of Nazis?
00:04:21,00:04:24,That explains your totally rational phobia of the Nazi plastic.
00:04:24,00:04:28,"Just because my grandparents had to, you know, and sort of, there's a lot of deprivation and"
00:04:28,00:04:30,"I think that's definitely true in mice, isn't it?"
00:04:30,00:04:32,They showed that that was true in mice.
00:04:32,00:04:33,Yes.
00:04:33,00:04:34,I'm not sure it's true in humans.
00:04:34,00:04:37,"Yeah, it's weird that that can be imprinted into DNA."
00:04:37,00:04:38,"Yeah, so it is quite a new thing."
00:04:38,00:04:44,"To my sperm, the fact that I was attacked by a dog, my sperm will have that knowledge as it"
00:04:44,00:04:45,goes across.
00:04:45,00:04:46,Yeah.
00:04:46,00:04:48,"I mean, not the fact you're not going to have a grandchild who's like, ""Hey, I remember this"
00:04:48,00:04:51,"weird time in the QI offices when a dog bit my textbook."""
00:04:51,00:04:52,"No, I know a bit."
00:04:52,00:04:55,But is the response to that makes a chemical imprint on your DNA?
00:04:55,00:04:56,"Yeah, that's mad."
00:04:56,00:04:57,"Yeah, that's cool."
00:04:57,00:04:58,That's mad.
00:04:58,00:04:59,A fear of clowns.
00:04:59,00:05:00,That's a big thing.
00:05:00,00:05:01,Coolophobia.
00:05:01,00:05:02,"Yes, exactly."
00:05:02,00:05:06,"Sorry, I thought you were saying it was a cool phobia."
00:05:06,00:05:07,Coolophobia.
00:05:07,00:05:10,I thought you were saying it was a fear of coolers.
00:05:10,00:05:12,"Well, everyone's confused."
00:05:12,00:05:15,"So what they do now, circuses are starting to do this."
00:05:15,00:05:20,"They have sessions before the circus starts where if you're afraid of clowns, you can go"
00:05:20,00:05:24,"and watch the clown do their makeup, start from a normal person and do their makeup so"
00:05:24,00:05:28,"by the time the circus starts, you feel comfortable with them and they call it clounciling"
00:05:28,00:05:29,and use...
00:05:29,00:05:30,"Oh, God's sake."
00:05:30,00:05:31,It's true.
00:05:31,00:05:32,This is true.
00:05:32,00:05:35,You do clounciling and you can watch clowns get their makeup done and it's meant to
00:05:35,00:05:37,help you massively to see the transformation happen.
00:05:37,00:05:40,But it's quite obvious that the name preceded the actual idea.
00:05:40,00:05:41,So...
00:05:41,00:05:49,A good method is to starve someone for a day and then they can only custom-pise.
00:05:49,00:05:53,"There was, I read a report that for people who were afraid of elevators."
00:05:53,00:05:59,"In some cases, they will opt for a job that pays less if it's in a lower floor of a building."
00:05:59,00:06:00,Wow.
00:06:00,00:06:02,"So, this is the thing."
00:06:02,00:06:05,"Otis, the elevator company, they estimate that every"
00:06:05,00:06:10,five days the equivalent of the entire population of the planet uses a lift.
00:06:10,00:06:13,So seven billion journeys are made and left every five days.
00:06:13,00:06:15,I think it was even in their lifts.
00:06:15,00:06:16,Exactly.
00:06:16,00:06:17,Yes.
00:06:17,00:06:19,"So just the brand otis, not even a shindler."
00:06:19,00:06:23,"I read about an amazing lift that maybe the three of you have heard of, but I hint of."
00:06:23,00:06:24,And I discovered it.
00:06:24,00:06:29,"I discovered a great website called Elevatorpedia, which is just the Wikipedia of elevators."
00:06:29,00:06:34,"It's got 492 articles, 9 million registered users, over 9 million."
00:06:34,00:06:36,"Yeah, active users was about 22."
00:06:36,00:06:37,Right.
00:06:37,00:06:39,But 9 million registered users.
00:06:39,00:06:40,Yeah.
00:06:40,00:06:41,"They're just spumb up, is that they?"
00:06:41,00:06:42,Probably.
00:06:42,00:06:43,Yeah.
00:06:43,00:06:44,But they're proud.
00:06:44,00:06:48,"So yeah, so I started reading about, I pressed random page and just brought up different"
00:06:48,00:06:49,random pages.
00:06:49,00:06:51,And the first one that came up was the double-decker elevator.
00:06:51,00:06:52,Have you heard of that?
00:06:52,00:06:53,No.
00:06:53,00:06:54,No.
00:06:54,00:06:55,I like the idea of pressing random article in it.
00:06:55,00:06:56,You don't have to wait 30 seconds for it.
00:06:56,00:06:57,That's what it is.
00:06:57,00:06:58,Yeah.
00:06:58,00:07:05,"So, a double-decker elevator, it stops at two floors at a time, so you're able to cut the"
00:07:05,00:07:08,journey in half effectively.
00:07:08,00:07:12,But it's impossible to go from the very bottom floor to the very top floor because you're
00:07:12,00:07:13,yes.
00:07:13,00:07:14,And vice versa.
00:07:14,00:07:18,And you'll be a little thing on the roof where it just pops out.
00:07:18,00:07:19,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:07:19,00:07:24,I'm pretty sure that you're either in a lift that goes into a sort of attic that has
00:07:24,00:07:27,no door to let you out when the lift below you is trying to go.
00:07:27,00:07:31,"And there's a basement for the below lift to not so, yeah, you can still go to the top floor"
00:07:31,00:07:35,and it's very unsatisfying to get to a floor where you're not allowed to get out.
00:07:35,00:07:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:36,00:07:37,This sounds like almost as terrible as well.
00:07:37,00:07:40,I imagined you were describing then when I imagined that they would just stop at the
00:07:40,00:07:44,same floor on both levels and either the lift would open and you'd have a six foot drop
00:07:44,00:07:47,as you stepped out or it would open and you'd just be faced with the wall because you're
00:07:47,00:07:48,on the lower level.
00:07:48,00:07:49,Yeah.
00:07:49,00:07:52,I think what we're saying is that this isn't a particularly good idea though.
00:07:52,00:07:54,"It's, they're using it in so many different countries."
00:07:54,00:07:55,"Oh, no."
00:07:55,00:07:56,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:56,00:08:02,The Burj Khalifa has it and so do a lot of Taiwan and Hong Kong and Japan skyscrapers have
00:08:02,00:08:03,it as well.
00:08:03,00:08:04,Wow.
00:08:04,00:08:08,"The thing about that is about Burj Khalifa and that, is it not the case that lifts can only"
00:08:08,00:08:13,go a certain number of flaws because after that the cable gets too heavy or something?
00:08:13,00:08:18,"Well, exciting times in lift news because they've got a new technology which means that"
00:08:18,00:08:20,lifts might be able to go twice as far.
00:08:20,00:08:21,"Oh, really?"
00:08:21,00:08:22,They've got a new kind of rope.
00:08:22,00:08:24,It's called ultra-rope and it's made of carbon fiber.
00:08:24,00:08:29,And the maximum used to be about 500 metres but now it's much bigger and they reckon that
00:08:29,00:08:33,"this is the only thing preventing us from building 2,000 metre high skyscrapers."
00:08:33,00:08:34,Wow.
00:08:34,00:08:39,"I've been reading loads of reviews of this book called Lifted, A Cultural History of the"
00:08:39,00:08:40,Elevator by Andreas Bernat.
00:08:40,00:08:45,I haven't read the book yet but I found one review which started off just from a member
00:08:45,00:08:46,of the public.
00:08:46,00:08:50,It said this book had its ups and downs and then it went on.
00:08:50,00:08:53,"Now that the joke is out of the way, this is a very interesting book."
00:08:53,00:08:56,Kind of like.
00:08:56,00:09:00,"So they did have kind of Elevator type things, didn't they?"
00:09:00,00:09:05,But then the first modern Elevators they came in the 19th century.
00:09:05,00:09:11,And I read that the first Elevator shaft preceded the first Elevator by four years.
00:09:11,00:09:12,Wow.
00:09:12,00:09:13,Wow.
00:09:13,00:09:16,This is in the Wikipedia actually but I think it does stack up and this is just normal
00:09:16,00:09:17,Wikipedia.
00:09:17,00:09:18,Just normal Wikipedia.
00:09:18,00:09:19,"It was the Lifted, I know Elevator."
00:09:19,00:09:20,"Elevator, yeah."
00:09:20,00:09:21,"Elevator, yeah."
00:09:21,00:09:22,It wasn't in that one.
00:09:22,00:09:29,So this was in the Cooper Union Foundation building in New York in 1853 and they built it
00:09:29,00:09:34,with lift shaft because the guy who built it was sure that lifts would be invented quite
00:09:34,00:09:35,soon.
00:09:35,00:09:36,Wow.
00:09:36,00:09:37,It was so confident.
00:09:37,00:09:38,Oh my God.
00:09:38,00:09:43,"And sure enough, four years later they did invent them but his shaft was circular and all"
00:09:43,00:09:48,"lifts aren't circular and so they couldn't fit the lifts in, they couldn't fit a square"
00:09:48,00:09:49,lift in a round hole.
00:09:49,00:09:50,That's interesting.
00:09:50,00:09:55,"Maybe not just make a circle, a bit later, Otis designed a special lift just for that building."
00:09:55,00:09:56,Right.
00:09:56,00:09:57,That's so cool.
00:09:57,00:10:01,Do you know the secret override for a lift?
00:10:01,00:10:07,"If you press the floor down left right, some lifts which use particular, there's a system"
00:10:07,00:10:12,called Logic Controller which is the sort of the brain of the lift basically.
00:10:12,00:10:16,"If the lift uses Logic Controller, if you press your floor and the closed door button"
00:10:16,00:10:21,"at the same time, you can go to whatever floor you like in a lift immediately and bypass"
00:10:21,00:10:22,all the others.
00:10:22,00:10:23,Right.
00:10:23,00:10:26,So this is according to someone on the internet who I read who said he works in a building
00:10:26,00:10:27,with loads of lifts.
00:10:27,00:10:36,So he works on a lift system he was sort of part of the lift team for the building.
00:10:36,00:10:40,He said that if the lift uses this system that does work but obviously you can't tell.
00:10:40,00:10:41,That sounds very much like an urban lift.
00:10:41,00:10:42,Give it a go.
00:10:42,00:10:43,Give it a go listening to this.
00:10:43,00:10:48,"But if everyone knows of that with you with a guy who walks and tries to do it, you've"
00:10:48,00:10:51,"now stuck in a lift with someone who's going, you dickhead."
00:10:51,00:10:55,It doesn't work but you tried to ruin my lift ride by going past my floor.
00:10:55,00:10:57,"If you're already in the lift, you can just press a button."
00:10:57,00:10:59,It's for people on the outside who requested the lift.
00:10:59,00:11:01,That's an extremely selfish thing to do though.
00:11:01,00:11:02,Yeah.
00:11:02,00:11:03,Or you might be in a hurry.
00:11:03,00:11:04,You might need a piece.
00:11:04,00:11:05,We're not advocating it.
00:11:05,00:11:06,I know.
00:11:06,00:11:07,It's a possibility.
00:11:07,00:11:09,And he's a very selfish man.
00:11:09,00:11:11,The rest of us would advise against it.
00:11:11,00:11:15,"I want to know if this is a if this is a myth and I imagine it is, people say that pressing"
00:11:15,00:11:17,the close button doesn't actually do it.
00:11:17,00:11:19,There's no consensus on this.
00:11:19,00:11:20,Okay.
00:11:20,00:11:23,I swear to God that no one's properly refuted it.
00:11:23,00:11:28,"No people on the internet who work in and these lift companies, we film a QI in a building"
00:11:28,00:11:30,with a lot of lifts.
00:11:30,00:11:35,And so I realize we had an expert.
00:11:35,00:11:37,I press the closed star and I reckon they do work.
00:11:37,00:11:38,But maybe not.
00:11:38,00:11:41,We're doing in thrillers and horror movies.
00:11:41,00:11:45,"They're always in there, pressing it like crazy and the lift is just chilled."
00:11:45,00:11:49,It's definitely true that there are some road crossings where the button doesn't really
00:11:49,00:11:50,work.
00:11:50,00:11:52,"Yeah, because they're just on time, especially busy crossings."
00:11:52,00:11:56,I think the closed door button is likely to work on all the lifts before health and safety
00:11:56,00:11:57,was invented.
00:11:57,00:11:58,There isn't.
00:11:58,00:11:59,One has to just cut people up in lifts.
00:11:59,00:12:04,"You know, lifts in Singapore have urine detector devices in them."
00:12:04,00:12:08,And I can't work out whether this is because Singaporean authorities are really paranoid
00:12:08,00:12:13,"about this or because there was a spate of urinating because they did say in the 90s, there was"
00:12:13,00:12:16,in a year there was something like 40 incidents of lifts opening and there being a puddle of
00:12:16,00:12:18,urine left in them.
00:12:18,00:12:19,Right.
00:12:19,00:12:23,"And so now if you urinate in a lift in Singapore that has one of these devices in it, then"
00:12:23,00:12:24,an alarm gets set off.
00:12:24,00:12:25,The lift stops.
00:12:25,00:12:26,So you're stuck in the elevator.
00:12:26,00:12:29,The police are called and they come round and then start the lift so that you can get
00:12:29,00:12:31,out and be arrested by the police for weighing in an elevator.
00:12:31,00:12:32,Wow.
00:12:32,00:12:33,So don't do that.
00:12:33,00:12:34,How can I tell that it's urine?
00:12:34,00:12:39,"It's urine detectors, what if I spilled my bottle of water, for example."
00:12:39,00:12:41,And it had like a lot of kind of urea in it.
00:12:41,00:12:42,Yeah.
00:12:42,00:12:43,"Like all my water, don't you?"
00:12:43,00:12:49,"I just think by water from different outlets, you can just tell people that you've got"
00:12:49,00:12:52,your introduction devices and I think that will deal with the majority of cases.
00:12:52,00:12:53,That's true.
00:12:53,00:12:56,"It's like that stuff they don't put in swimming pools, isn't it?"
00:12:56,00:12:59,It's like an ink that turns colour when you pee in the pool.
00:12:59,00:13:00,Is that not actually in there?
00:13:00,00:13:01,"No, it doesn't exist."
00:13:01,00:13:04,"Oh my God, I always got so worried when I actually do have a piss and waiting for"
00:13:04,00:13:05,a colour to emerge.
00:13:05,00:13:07,And then I wonder if there's something wrong with my piss.
00:13:07,00:13:08,Go to the doctor.
00:13:08,00:13:11,I'm really worried my piss isn't blue.
00:13:11,00:13:19,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is my fact."
00:13:19,00:13:25,My fact this week is that the Russian space agency light their rockets using giant wooden
00:13:25,00:13:27,matchsticks.
00:13:27,00:13:31,"So this is to me, unbelievable, to me too."
00:13:31,00:13:32,But it's real.
00:13:32,00:13:33,This is from popular mechanics.
00:13:33,00:13:38,"So it's been verified and the idea is that the Soyuz rockets, when they're going up, so"
00:13:38,00:13:40,this is not for every single rocket that they launch.
00:13:40,00:13:43,"However, it's been used hundreds of times."
00:13:43,00:13:47,"The idea is that you need a consistency, there's so many booster rockets, you need a consistency"
00:13:47,00:13:51,of all of them to go to be lit at the same time and something needs to light them.
00:13:51,00:13:57,"So what they've created are these giant bits of birch wood all put together, created into"
00:13:57,00:13:59,effectively a giant looking match.
00:13:59,00:14:01,They're sat underneath the boosters.
00:14:01,00:14:05,They all have little wiring that goes right to the top and the problem is obviously as the
00:14:05,00:14:08,"fire picks up, the wiring gets cut off."
00:14:08,00:14:13,"So the idea of using the wood is to keep it lit like a match, to have the wood just flaming"
00:14:13,00:14:16,up and so they can light all these rockets at the same time and then that's how it goes
00:14:16,00:14:18,into space.
00:14:18,00:14:19,Giant matchsticks.
00:14:19,00:14:20,It's nuts.
00:14:20,00:14:21,It's very cool.
00:14:21,00:14:22,It's so old-fashioned.
00:14:22,00:14:23,They've been doing that for 60 years.
00:14:23,00:14:24,Wow.
00:14:24,00:14:25,Yeah.
00:14:25,00:14:29,I read that it's the only part of a modern rocket launch system that's made of wood.
00:14:29,00:14:30,Oh really?
00:14:30,00:14:31,Yeah.
00:14:31,00:14:32,"Unsurprisingly, I suppose."
00:14:32,00:14:33,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:33,00:14:35,"Yeah, reassuringly."
00:14:35,00:14:38,Did you guys know that the first lighters were guns.
00:14:38,00:14:44,So they were flintlock guns and they were converted to the purpose of becoming lighters in
00:14:44,00:14:45,the 16th century.
00:14:45,00:14:51,So flintlock guns are any firearm that uses flint to strike up and create a flame which
00:14:51,00:14:53,would propel the bullets out of it.
00:14:53,00:14:56,And people realise that you could turn this ignition mechanism into a lighter and that
00:14:56,00:14:57,was the world's first lighters.
00:14:57,00:14:58,Wow.
00:14:58,00:14:59,How cool is that?
00:14:59,00:15:00,It's cool looking guns.
00:15:00,00:15:04,It is cool because then you get the actual lighters today that look like guns but aren't
00:15:04,00:15:05,really guns.
00:15:05,00:15:06,"Yes, exactly."
00:15:06,00:15:09,This was the original one of those for the real cowboys.
00:15:09,00:15:13,"There were novelty lighters before there were lighters, but you know what we're saying."
00:15:13,00:15:16,It's exactly what I'm saying.
00:15:16,00:15:20,I found one of the earliest references to matchsticks from ancient China and they were
00:15:20,00:15:25,originally in their translation described as light-bringing slaves.
00:15:25,00:15:27,That was their name.
00:15:27,00:15:33,"And they were from a book called The Records of the Unworldly and the Strange, which is"
00:15:33,00:15:36,a great title for a book and I've never heard of that before.
00:15:36,00:15:39,It's an old ancient Chinese book and that's where it comes from.
00:15:39,00:15:42,"Yeah, the old Chinese ones, they had sulfur on the end of them."
00:15:42,00:15:46,"But you had to light them from another light, basically."
00:15:46,00:15:48,You needed another fire source in order to light them.
00:15:48,00:15:50,So I don't know if that counts as much.
00:15:50,00:15:51,"Oh, okay."
00:15:51,00:15:52,I'm cheesy.
00:15:52,00:15:53,Definitely cheesy.
00:15:53,00:15:57,"I used in the, for 19th century matches as well and that was where matches really took"
00:15:57,00:16:01,off and we got match factories and match girls and things like this.
00:16:01,00:16:05,The problem with matches in the first place was that they were very easy to light and so
00:16:05,00:16:08,they would set fires and things like this.
00:16:08,00:16:11,"But in 1844, the safety match was invented."
00:16:11,00:16:16,It was by a Swedish professor called Pash and what he did was he just split up the chemicals
00:16:16,00:16:18,that he needed to set the match aflame.
00:16:18,00:16:22,"So the phosphorus that he did need, he just put on, that's what's on the surface of"
00:16:22,00:16:23,the box.
00:16:23,00:16:27,"So you have to combine the two elements, which had originally been both in the match head"
00:16:27,00:16:28,together.
00:16:28,00:16:29,"Oh, wow."
00:16:29,00:16:30,And that was why I see.
00:16:30,00:16:34,"It ignited so easily, it's because it's all there ready for you, whereas this is guaranteed"
00:16:34,00:16:35,time.
00:16:35,00:16:38,"So what could because before that, I think if, because it was all together, if you just sort"
00:16:38,00:16:41,"of accidentally rubbed your match up against any surface, what is that nice?"
00:16:41,00:16:45,"So you get people sort of striking it on, you know, jeans or stubble or the gravet or"
00:16:45,00:16:46,a wall or whatever.
00:16:46,00:16:47,Yeah.
00:16:47,00:16:51,So these dodgy ones were the ones invented by the guy from Stockton called John Walker and
00:16:51,00:16:54,they were banned in France and Germany because they were so dangerous.
00:16:54,00:16:56,And they were giant matches as well.
00:16:56,00:16:59,"So the first problem matches were giant matches, they were a yard long."
00:16:59,00:17:00,What?
00:17:00,00:17:01,Yes.
00:17:01,00:17:05,"And to like them, you had to pull, you got a fold of sandpaper, put the match in between"
00:17:05,00:17:06,"there, pulled it out."
00:17:06,00:17:11,"And it, they were so dangerous though, because often a flaming ball of material would fall"
00:17:11,00:17:15,off the end of the match and so far as to the ground or the carpet or wherever you were
00:17:15,00:17:17,or someone's dress.
00:17:17,00:17:21,"He was, he was a good guy though, John Walker, because he refused to pay it in his matches."
00:17:21,00:17:23,He had a decent amount of money.
00:17:23,00:17:26,"So he, he really did invent the lighting match, even though it was a little bit dodgy to start"
00:17:26,00:17:27,with.
00:17:27,00:17:32,It was based on what he did that everyone else built their match technology.
00:17:32,00:17:36,"And he, yeah, had enough money and said he didn't want to pay it in the imagine at all."
00:17:36,00:17:40,Michael Faraday and other people like that said that he should get money out of it.
00:17:40,00:17:43,He never made a penny and he never got the credit for it until after he died.
00:17:43,00:17:48,So what was actually a Frenchman called Chancel who came up with one 20 years before him?
00:17:48,00:17:49,"Oh, what's that?"
00:17:49,00:17:50,Yeah.
00:17:50,00:17:54,And that one had an end tipped with potassium chlorate and sulphur.
00:17:54,00:17:59,"And you had to put acid on it to set that one safe, even more dangerous."
00:17:59,00:18:03,"And the one, there was another Frenchman Charles Soria, who invented one very shortly after"
00:18:03,00:18:05,John Walker and it relied on phosphorus.
00:18:05,00:18:08,"And they kept using the phosphorus in this country, so it sounds like they banned it in"
00:18:08,00:18:09,other countries.
00:18:09,00:18:13,But in this country they kept using phosphorus in matches until 1906.
00:18:13,00:18:15,And it was incredibly poisonous.
00:18:15,00:18:19,"So everyone who worked in those factories got this thing called fossy jaw, which was where"
00:18:19,00:18:23,your teeth would rot and your whole face would swell up and your jaw bones would rot because
00:18:23,00:18:26,the phosphorus was so toxic your hair would fall out.
00:18:26,00:18:30,"So anyone who like used regularly or worked with making these matches would just, they'd"
00:18:30,00:18:31,fall apart.
00:18:31,00:18:35,"And I read that it would make you vomit, even a tiny amount breathing it in would make"
00:18:35,00:18:36,you vomit.
00:18:36,00:18:40,And you could see the way people walked home from the phosphorus factory because there
00:18:40,00:18:46,would be like pools of fluorescent vomit on the wall.
00:18:46,00:18:49,Do you know the world match stick model record?
00:18:49,00:18:50,What are we going for?
00:18:50,00:18:51,Size.
00:18:51,00:18:52,So a number of matches.
00:18:52,00:18:53,That's a number of matches.
00:18:53,00:18:54,A million.
00:18:54,00:18:55,"280,000."
00:18:55,00:18:56,I do know.
00:18:56,00:19:00,So I'm only cheating for me to say.
00:19:00,00:19:04,"It's the answer is, it's a model of an oil rig."
00:19:04,00:19:08,"It's made by a man called David Reynolds, who used to work on oil rigs."
00:19:08,00:19:13,"It contains 4,075,000 matches."
00:19:13,00:19:14,Wow.
00:19:14,00:19:15,It's huge.
00:19:15,00:19:16,That's amazing.
00:19:16,00:19:17,It's really good.
00:19:17,00:19:19,It took him over 15 years to make.
00:19:19,00:19:20,Wow.
00:19:20,00:19:21,Yeah.
00:19:21,00:19:22,What a great use of a life.
00:19:22,00:19:23,I know.
00:19:23,00:19:25,"There's other people who are telling these things and he just does this, you know."
00:19:25,00:19:26,Yeah.
00:19:26,00:19:27,It's quite cool.
00:19:27,00:19:30,But we are not suggesting you build the world's biggest match stick thing instead of watching
00:19:30,00:19:31,our show on Fridays.
00:19:31,00:19:32,"No, great."
00:19:32,00:19:33,Good point.
00:19:33,00:19:38,"Yeah, I feel really sorry for his son because he said that it was just that one Christmas his"
00:19:38,00:19:42,son bought him a match stick kit of a train to build a train of match sticks.
00:19:42,00:19:43,And that feels really like the sun.
00:19:43,00:19:44,Doesn't know what to get his dad.
00:19:44,00:19:45,I'll just get him to this.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Who cares?
00:19:46,00:19:47,He can put it in a corner.
00:19:47,00:19:48,Forget about it.
00:19:48,00:19:52,And I bet he really regrets that 20 years later when all his dad's done or talked about
00:19:52,00:19:54,"is the fact that he's built 100,000 match stick items."
00:19:54,00:19:58,"All he's forever been trying to make up for this shit present that he got by going,"
00:19:58,00:19:59,"""No, I really love it."
00:19:59,00:20:00,"Look, I'm making my next thing."
00:20:00,00:20:01,"Look, I'm going to make my way."""
00:20:01,00:20:03,He hates it.
00:20:03,00:20:07,"And again, it has two other match stick related world records."
00:20:07,00:20:08,"Okay, let's hear them."
00:20:08,00:20:11,Most match sticks stacked into a tower in one minute.
00:20:11,00:20:12,"Yeah, great."
00:20:12,00:20:15,"Let's say one a second, 60."
00:20:15,00:20:16,Very close.
00:20:16,00:20:17,59.
00:20:17,00:20:18,Not bad.
00:20:18,00:20:19,4 million.
00:20:19,00:20:21,It's 74.
00:20:21,00:20:22,Wow.
00:20:22,00:20:23,Yeah.
00:20:23,00:20:28,"And the other one, this is the one which I think is most beatable, possibly, is the largest collection"
00:20:28,00:20:31,of musical instruments made from match sticks.
00:20:31,00:20:32,Okay.
00:20:32,00:20:33,Which is about 10.
00:20:33,00:20:36,I know what I'm getting you for your next match.
00:20:36,00:20:37,11 kits.
00:20:37,00:20:38,Yeah.
00:20:38,00:20:43,"I've just got a couple of things on, I've been looking into odd ways things are lit."
00:20:43,00:20:46,"I suddenly thought, ""How do you light the Olympic torch?"""
00:20:46,00:20:48,What's the process there?
00:20:48,00:20:50,And so probably we all know it's lit in Olympia.
00:20:50,00:20:52,It's got a classic kind.
00:20:52,00:20:53,It actually is a flame that goes though.
00:20:53,00:20:57,But I had no idea how much backup flame that they have.
00:20:57,00:20:58,Should it go out?
00:20:58,00:20:59,Have you heard about this?
00:20:59,00:21:01,I thought it pretty much went out all the time.
00:21:01,00:21:02,"Yes, it does."
00:21:02,00:21:06,They have backup flame that they've brought with them from Olympia from the very same fire
00:21:06,00:21:08,and they relight it using that exact flame.
00:21:08,00:21:14,So the flame has broken up into all different little compartments so that it can be relit with
00:21:14,00:21:15,the original flame.
00:21:15,00:21:16,"Wait, so what are they storing the flame on?"
00:21:16,00:21:18,And there are just lots of other people holding back up Olympic torchers.
00:21:18,00:21:22,"They're in buses and stuff that travel with them, yeah."
00:21:22,00:21:24,What's this just containing giant fires?
00:21:24,00:21:25,"Yeah, you can see a photo."
00:21:25,00:21:31,"So when they leave Olympia, they take lifelame on the planes over to where they're going."
00:21:31,00:21:36,"So you can see there's a photo of British Airways where two seats have lifelames, four capsules"
00:21:36,00:21:37,of lifelames.
00:21:37,00:21:39,They're obviously got a lid on them.
00:21:39,00:21:43,"And they carry that by, I think that's the only lifelame that you're allowed to take on"
00:21:43,00:21:44,a plane.
00:21:44,00:21:49,"I just think that backup Olympic flame thing is the stupidest thing I've ever, it's so,"
00:21:49,00:21:50,it doesn't matter.
00:21:50,00:21:51,It's a flame.
00:21:51,00:21:52,Yeah.
00:21:52,00:21:53,It's symbolic.
00:21:53,00:21:54,I guess that's what they're going for.
00:21:54,00:21:56,They're invented by the Nazis as well.
00:21:56,00:21:57,What's it?
00:21:57,00:21:58,I think so.
00:21:58,00:21:59,Fire.
00:21:59,00:22:03,"No, I think they invented the idea of like a Olympic flame relay."
00:22:03,00:22:04,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:04,00:22:05,If you're right.
00:22:05,00:22:09,"I've got such a cool thing about fire, making fire."
00:22:09,00:22:13,Just do you guys know about the new fire ceremony that the Aztecs had?
00:22:13,00:22:14,No.
00:22:14,00:22:17,This was this so that the Aztec calendar cycle was every 52 years.
00:22:17,00:22:23,"And at the end of every 52 years, the Aztecs ordered the all fires in the whole Aztec"
00:22:23,00:22:26,Empire were extinguished and they had to start again.
00:22:26,00:22:29,So every single person after 52 years had to put out their fire.
00:22:29,00:22:33,"And then they go on top of this, on top of this mountain and a priest would light the"
00:22:33,00:22:36,first fire for the new calendar cycle and what was called the new fire ceremony.
00:22:36,00:22:41,And what he did was he'd light it inside the chest cavity of a sacrificed person.
00:22:41,00:22:44,"So they'd sacrifice someone, they'd take it up to the top of this mountain, they open"
00:22:44,00:22:45,up their chest.
00:22:45,00:22:48,And then the Aztec priest lights a fire inside his chest.
00:22:48,00:22:52,"And then he'd, a bunch of people would be allowed to come forward and dip their sticks"
00:22:52,00:22:55,in the fire and take it up.
00:22:55,00:22:56,Oh my God.
00:22:56,00:23:00,It is tasting barbecue I ever had.
00:23:00,00:23:01,Wow.
00:23:01,00:23:03,And then the fire would be distributed throughout the Empire again and that marked the start
00:23:03,00:23:04,of the new calendar.
00:23:04,00:23:05,Wow.
00:23:05,00:23:12,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy."
00:23:12,00:23:16,My fact is that the film The Who Framed Roger Rabbit is based on a true story.
00:23:16,00:23:17,Okay.
00:23:17,00:23:23,"It's a heartwarming story of a rabbit, no, so it's loosely based, but it is based on an"
00:23:23,00:23:27,actual story of something that happened in America in the early 20th century.
00:23:27,00:23:30,So can you explain to me what happens in The Who Framed Roger Rabbit because I haven't
00:23:30,00:23:31,seen it.
00:23:31,00:23:35,"It's very complicated, but basically there's a transport conspiracy."
00:23:35,00:23:39,"You don't want to give away all the spoilers of the film and it's about, you know, the"
00:23:39,00:23:40,car and about.
00:23:40,00:23:42,"And there's a giant rabbit, isn't there?"
00:23:42,00:23:43,He's not a giant rabbit.
00:23:43,00:23:44,"Oh, is he not?"
00:23:44,00:23:45,I think it is.
00:23:45,00:23:49,"He is bigger than a normal rabbit, but he's not taller than Bob Hoskins."
00:23:49,00:23:55,"Well, I still think that that's what the size of a rabbit and Bob Hoskins, if you can imagine"
00:23:55,00:24:00,"such a thing and he's got a bow tie on, how tall would you say he is, taller than four"
00:24:00,00:24:01,feet?
00:24:01,00:24:02,Yeah.
00:24:02,00:24:05,I think that that has a very big rabbit with his upright.
00:24:05,00:24:07,"He's probably taller than Bob Hoskins, isn't it?"
00:24:07,00:24:08,"No, I don't think he is."
00:24:08,00:24:09,"No, no, he's not."
00:24:09,00:24:12,"He never is taller than Bob Hoskins, even he was poised."
00:24:12,00:24:13,Really?
00:24:13,00:24:14,And Bob Hoskins was a very short man.
00:24:14,00:24:16,"Actually, perhaps it isn't a more rabbit-sized."
00:24:16,00:24:17,Yeah.
00:24:17,00:24:22,"Anyway, I think this isn't the true element of the story."
00:24:22,00:24:24,"It sounds like a great film, actually."
00:24:24,00:24:29,"It is a really good film, but the story that it's based on is the thing that actually happened."
00:24:29,00:24:33,"It's a group of car and oil companies, they were called national city lines, right?"
00:24:33,00:24:35,And there was control by general motors.
00:24:35,00:24:39,"And the thing that they did in the early years of the 20th century, they bought up loads"
00:24:39,00:24:44,"of streetcar lines, so these streetcars with rails, trolley buses, things like this."
00:24:44,00:24:49,"All across America, they bought these up, and they dismantled them and shut them off."
00:24:49,00:24:54,"And they also ran a lot of buses, so as an automobile bus is running on roads, as opposed"
00:24:54,00:24:56,to running on rails.
00:24:56,00:25:02,"And they were eventually fined a huge amount for kind of monopolising, attempting to monopolise"
00:25:02,00:25:04,the market for transport equipment.
00:25:04,00:25:10,So some people think that this was a huge conspiracy designed to create the age of the
00:25:10,00:25:14,car and to shut down public transport in favour of it.
00:25:14,00:25:18,Because there was oil and car companies that were doing this.
00:25:18,00:25:22,"It's a bit more complicated than that, because the streetcar industry was already in decline,"
00:25:22,00:25:26,"and it's also a lot easier to run a bus, which doesn't need a rail, than it is to run"
00:25:26,00:25:27,a streetcar.
00:25:27,00:25:30,I'm glad you debunked that popular business.
00:25:30,00:25:34,"This was absolutely huge, and the low to people still believe it."
00:25:34,00:25:39,I think in America it's a really big idea that the age of the car was stitched up by
00:25:39,00:25:40,a load of these companies.
00:25:40,00:25:47,"I've got to say, Roger Abbott didn't really do justice to the seriousness of the, it's"
00:25:47,00:25:48,based on it.
00:25:48,00:25:51,I am starting to understand why they felt they needed to add car to encourage us to live
00:25:51,00:25:54,not the story.
00:25:54,00:25:58,Just to give a quick proper background on Roger Abbott as a movie.
00:25:58,00:26:02,"It was Robert Zemeckis, who directed it, which was the back to the future director."
00:26:02,00:26:08,"It came out in 1988, and the technology of the animation mixed with real life footage"
00:26:08,00:26:13,"was so advanced, so new that the very same year that was made, or let's say the Oscars"
00:26:13,00:26:19,"that happened post the movie's release, recognized its animator, Richard Williams, as an innovator"
00:26:19,00:26:20,and gave him a special Oscar.
00:26:20,00:26:25,Like it's just a completely separate special Oscar to say this movie has changed everything
00:26:25,00:26:29,"for filmmaking with animation, so it's a really important movie in the history of cinema."
00:26:29,00:26:36,"Also, it's the only film where Loonie Tune's characters and Disney cartoon characters appear"
00:26:36,00:26:37,in the same film.
00:26:37,00:26:41,"It's very rare to see, for example, Mickey Mouse and Boogie Pick."
00:26:41,00:26:46,"And they insisted, both companies insisted, that their characters have exactly equal amount"
00:26:46,00:26:48,of screen time as the other company's characters didn't they?
00:26:48,00:26:53,"And that was why, and like I say, I haven't seen it, but apparently Bugs Bunny, so wherever"
00:26:53,00:26:57,"you see Warner Bros. character, that's accompanied by a Disney character."
00:26:57,00:27:01,"So I think that there are two pairings of characters in the film, and the pairings are always"
00:27:01,00:27:04,"a Warner Bros. character and a Disney character, because both companies said if your guy's getting"
00:27:04,00:27:06,"screen time, my guy's going to get screen time."
00:27:06,00:27:11,"Yeah, because Roger Rabbit with Loonie Tunes and Bob Hoskins is, of course, a Disney cartoon"
00:27:11,00:27:12,character.
00:27:12,00:27:13,Yeah.
00:27:13,00:27:16,So one thing that's interesting about this is that it mustn't necessarily be the movie
00:27:16,00:27:21,"that was based on real life stuff, because Roger Rabbit was based off a novel called"
00:27:21,00:27:24,"Who Sensored Roger Rabbit, which was written by Gary K Wolfe."
00:27:24,00:27:29,"Very dark and very different to the, had no Loonie Tune characters, for example."
00:27:29,00:27:36,"So that, I'm wondering if that's where the original political message about what you were so"
00:27:36,00:27:41,interestingly talking about.
00:27:41,00:27:44,That's beyond the pile.
00:27:44,00:27:47,Did you see that Bill Murray was the first choice to play the Bob Hoskins character?
00:27:47,00:27:48,It was too tall.
00:27:48,00:27:51,He was just that bit bigger than a rabbit.
00:27:51,00:27:55,You make the rabbit look like a rabbit.
00:27:55,00:27:59,"He, no, they couldn't get hold of him, because you know Bill Murray has that famous thing"
00:27:59,00:28:01,where he refuses to have an agent.
00:28:01,00:28:04,So he was Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spiel got Bob Hoskins first choice.
00:28:04,00:28:05,They couldn't get hold of him.
00:28:05,00:28:08,And Bill Murray said afterwards it was a real regret and he wished he could have done it.
00:28:08,00:28:10,"And it does make you think we'll get a starting agent then, mate."
00:28:10,00:28:13,"But yeah, he said that my Bob Hoskins is instead."
00:28:13,00:28:14,Right.
00:28:14,00:28:19,"I did read reviews for Who Sensored Roger Rabbit, the first one, that it's got my favorite"
00:28:19,00:28:22,"opening line of a review, of a review here as person said."
00:28:22,00:28:27,"This would have been a decent airplane book, but I wasn't flying anywhere."
00:28:27,00:28:28,And there's a lot of differences.
00:28:28,00:28:31,"Like in the book, Roger Rabbit actually is killed."
00:28:31,00:28:35,And they have a really interesting literary device where cartoon characters are able to
00:28:35,00:28:39,create a doppelganger of themselves immediately to do stunt double work in movies.
00:28:39,00:28:44,"So in the novel Roger Rabbit is killed, but he creates a doppelganger who can last a few"
00:28:44,00:28:47,"days, the longest doppelganger of any of them, who helps the story."
00:28:47,00:28:51,"The rules of cartoons are very different to the rules of real life, aren't they?"
00:28:51,00:28:52,What?
00:28:52,00:28:53,Yeah.
00:28:53,00:28:55,And they're getting my plans for jumping off that building later.
00:28:55,00:29:00,"This I haven't seen Who Sensored Roger Rabbit, but I think they kind of explore this in the"
00:29:00,00:29:02,"film, don't they?"
00:29:02,00:29:08,"There's a thing called the O'Donnell's Laws of Cartoon Motion, which was in a squire, and"
00:29:08,00:29:12,there are few like rules that happen in cartoons which don't happen in real life.
00:29:12,00:29:17,So anybody suspended in space will remain in space until made aware of its situation.
00:29:17,00:29:18,"Wow, yeah, yeah."
00:29:18,00:29:19,Kind of thing.
00:29:19,00:29:20,Yeah.
00:29:20,00:29:22,Everything falls faster than an anvil is another one.
00:29:22,00:29:23,Okay.
00:29:23,00:29:27,"I'm just saying that if you're falling down and so is an anvil, you'll hit the floor and"
00:29:27,00:29:30,then the anvil will hit your head on this thing.
00:29:30,00:29:34,And there was a guy called Art Babits who is an animator from Walt Disney Studios and he
00:29:34,00:29:39,said animation follows a lot of physics unless it's funnier otherwise.
00:29:39,00:29:41,"And I think they mentioned that movie as well, don't they?"
00:29:41,00:29:42,Something similar to that.
00:29:42,00:29:46,And they've got things like tunnels that you throw onto walls and then you can run into
00:29:46,00:29:47,the tunnel.
00:29:47,00:29:51,"But you can't follow them, you sort of, if you follow the human, you hit the wall."
00:29:51,00:29:52,Yeah.
00:29:52,00:29:53,It's the kind of thing.
00:29:53,00:29:57,So Bob Hoskinson didn't speak to him for a while after he made two-frame Roger Abbott.
00:29:57,00:29:59,Do you know why?
00:29:59,00:30:03,It was because so his son Jack was three at the time and Hoskinson said an interview a few
00:30:03,00:30:07,"years ago that when his son Jack found out what he'd been working on, he wouldn't speak"
00:30:07,00:30:09,to him for a long time and Hoskins was really upset.
00:30:09,00:30:14,And after about two weeks his son admitted that the reason he wasn't speaking to him was
00:30:14,00:30:17,because he'd been working with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck the whole time and hadn't even
00:30:17,00:30:18,introduced him to him.
00:30:18,00:30:19,"Oh, amazing."
00:30:19,00:30:20,That's great.
00:30:20,00:30:28,"Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show and that is Chisinski."
00:30:28,00:30:32,My fact is that the first ever wristwatch doubled up as a thermometer.
00:30:32,00:30:35,"Yeah, I just really like this."
00:30:35,00:30:36,"It's like a modern day gadget, but..."
00:30:36,00:30:44,"What sort of thermometer is in Oral or, as James says, rectal?"
00:30:44,00:30:47,"It was a whistle, a Ristal thermometer."
00:30:47,00:30:50,"Oh, it was a little thermometer on the..."
00:30:50,00:30:53,"You had to shove your wrist up, your butt."
00:30:53,00:30:55,It was designed for very flexible people.
00:30:55,00:31:01,So this was a watch that was designed by Abraham Louis Breguet who was known as the Father
00:31:01,00:31:02,of Modern Horology.
00:31:02,00:31:08,"He was sort of the leading person in watchmaking, in clockmaking and watchmaking at the turn of"
00:31:08,00:31:10,the 19th century.
00:31:10,00:31:15,And one of the things he did work out how to do was to stop changes in the temperature
00:31:15,00:31:17,altering a clock mechanism.
00:31:17,00:31:21,"So watches at the time, pocket watches, 'cause wristwatches didn't exist yet."
00:31:21,00:31:24,"Watches at the time, if the temperature change, would be a bit disrupted by that."
00:31:24,00:31:29,So you could only guarantee that your watch would be correct within about two hours at the
00:31:29,00:31:30,end of the 18th century.
00:31:30,00:31:35,"And he created a little thing, like a thermostat inside watches, which would work out when the"
00:31:35,00:31:38,temperature had got to a certain point and adjust the watch accordingly.
00:31:38,00:31:41,"And so he thought, well, I'll just add a little thermometer in, things I'm sensing"
00:31:41,00:31:43,the temperature anyway.
00:31:43,00:31:48,"And so he made this watch and it was for Napoleon's sister, actually, the Queen of Naples."
00:31:48,00:31:50,She was called Caroline Murat.
00:31:50,00:31:56,"And he made it in 1810, started making it in 1810, and he delivered to her in 1812."
00:31:56,00:31:58,"And yeah, it was the first ever wristwatch."
00:31:58,00:32:02,And the bracelet was made of a thread of hair and a little bit of gold thread.
00:32:02,00:32:03,A thread of hair.
00:32:03,00:32:05,A few threads of hair.
00:32:05,00:32:06,Yeah.
00:32:06,00:32:07,It was made of some hair.
00:32:07,00:32:08,Like lots of threads of hair.
00:32:08,00:32:09,More than one thread.
00:32:09,00:32:10,She had to think her.
00:32:10,00:32:11,Oh my God.
00:32:11,00:32:17,I find it amazing how wristwatches were seen as really sort of effeminate and not suitable
00:32:17,00:32:21,for proper men was basic implication for loads of their history.
00:32:21,00:32:25,"It was only in the first world war that they really took off, because it was very important"
00:32:25,00:32:30,for officers to be able to consult the same time and also pocket watches were pretty impractical
00:32:30,00:32:31,in the trenches.
00:32:31,00:32:36,"We read an article in the Atlantic about the history of the wristwatch, and they said"
00:32:36,00:32:41,"that someone at the time, when they first became popular after the war, someone said"
00:32:41,00:32:47,that Vodville artists and moving picture actors have utilized it as a fun maker as a Ciliass
00:32:47,00:32:48,Fad.
00:32:48,00:32:49,Yeah.
00:32:49,00:32:50,Ciliass Fad.
00:32:50,00:32:51,The wristwatch.
00:32:51,00:32:52,Fools.
00:32:52,00:32:54,Did you guys know about repeaters on watches?
00:32:54,00:32:57,Because I didn't really understand what they were until I was really up on this.
00:32:57,00:32:58,No.
00:32:58,00:33:02,So this was a technology that was found on watches at the turn of the 19th century.
00:33:02,00:33:08,It was on this watch that Brege gave to the Queen of Naples.
00:33:08,00:33:10,"And what it was was, it was a way of telling the time in the dark."
00:33:10,00:33:14,"If you wanted to tell the time, but it was dark, so you couldn't see a watch, you would press"
00:33:14,00:33:18,"a little button on it, and it would, an alarm would go off, that would tell you the hour,"
00:33:18,00:33:21,and then how many quarters passed the hour you passed.
00:33:21,00:33:22,"Oh, nice."
00:33:22,00:33:23,So you could tell the time to within a quarter of an hour.
00:33:23,00:33:30,"So if it was, let's say, 5.30, it would give five chimes in a certain deep tone, and then"
00:33:30,00:33:34,"it would give two chimes in a lighter tone, which would show you it was five o'clock, and"
00:33:34,00:33:35,then two quarter hours had passed.
00:33:35,00:33:36,That's pretty simple.
00:33:36,00:33:37,And all watches at this time had this.
00:33:37,00:33:38,This quarter repeated thing.
00:33:38,00:33:41,"It's half a pizza, which would give it to, obviously, within half an hour."
00:33:41,00:33:42,It's amazing.
00:33:42,00:33:43,"Yeah, really cool."
00:33:43,00:33:44,Yeah.
00:33:44,00:33:49,"I was at the design museum last year, and they had a watch, a wristwatch for blind people,"
00:33:49,00:33:54,"which was, if I remember rightly, it just kind of looked like a normal face, but it had"
00:33:54,00:33:58,"these little marbles on it, and they were magnetic, and they moved around, depending on"
00:33:58,00:34:02,"the time, so you could kind of feel like a Braille, a Braille watch."
00:34:02,00:34:03,That's amazing.
00:34:03,00:34:04,It is really cool.
00:34:04,00:34:05,That's awesome.
00:34:05,00:34:06,That's really incredible.
00:34:06,00:34:10,"But what we used to do before we had watches and clocks, because obviously, I know about"
00:34:10,00:34:15,"the sun dial, but I was just thinking, what if you just didn't, if you went further back,"
00:34:15,00:34:19,"and what people used to do, and in spots of Africa used to do this, you would just, you"
00:34:19,00:34:23,would know the arc of the sun throughout the day.
00:34:23,00:34:27,"You'd know where it would pass, and so what you would do is you would point to a bit of"
00:34:27,00:34:32,"the sky and say, let's meet when the sun's there in the sky, when it's reached that"
00:34:32,00:34:33,bit of the sky.
00:34:33,00:34:37,"And because they know the mapping of how the sun goes across so well, they would just know"
00:34:37,00:34:40,"to look up and go, oh yeah, it's effectively four o'clock."
00:34:40,00:34:42,I'd better go and meet Mike now.
00:34:42,00:34:43,"Oh, really?"
00:34:43,00:34:44,That's how it works.
00:34:44,00:34:45,Yeah.
00:34:45,00:34:48,"It was not confusing though, because if you point and you say, let's meet there, and you"
00:34:48,00:34:53,"point it somewhere, what people go, do you mean then at that time, or there in that place?"
00:34:53,00:34:54,"Oh, you point it to the sky."
00:34:54,00:34:59,"So no one, unless it was a really mountainous region, yeah, I guess you were."
00:34:59,00:35:01,So you just turn to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro.
00:35:01,00:35:02,Yeah.
00:35:02,00:35:03,Where is Mike?
00:35:03,00:35:06,"Oh, no, he must have meant four o'clock."
00:35:06,00:35:09,I'm so embarrassed.
00:35:09,00:35:14,"So this reminds me of something that we've covered on QI, which is about how it was hard"
00:35:14,00:35:18,"actually to know the exact time in the 19th century, even most people didn't have watches."
00:35:18,00:35:23,"And there was one family in London who for 100 years made a living, out of letting people"
00:35:23,00:35:25,look at their watches.
00:35:25,00:35:26,Which is so cool.
00:35:26,00:35:27,That's amazing.
00:35:27,00:35:33,He's called Ruth Belville and her parents and her father started the company in 1836.
00:35:33,00:35:34,They worked in Greenwich.
00:35:34,00:35:37,And so he'd set his watch to Greenwich time at the start of the day.
00:35:37,00:35:41,"And then he'd get what's described as a buggy, which I'm not sure what that was in 1836."
00:35:41,00:35:45,And he'd drive around London and he'd have people on contracts who would pay him in exchange
00:35:45,00:35:46,for him telling them the time.
00:35:46,00:35:47,And she kept doing that.
00:35:47,00:35:48,She did it up until 1940.
00:35:48,00:35:49,Yeah.
00:35:49,00:35:52,"I think you could kind of get season tickets from them as well, couldn't you?"
00:35:52,00:35:55,Like it'd be a bit cheaper and they'd come every week or something.
00:35:55,00:35:56,"Oh, could you."
00:35:56,00:35:57,Yeah.
00:35:57,00:36:03,And there was a guy called Mr. St. John Win who in 1908 wrote to the Times saying that her
00:36:03,00:36:06,methods were completely out of date and it was ridiculous.
00:36:06,00:36:11,And he suggested that she was using her femininity to gain business.
00:36:11,00:36:16,"Maybe she kept the watch in a cleavage or something like that, something that's all see."
00:36:16,00:36:25,"Did the letter of the Times say, dear, the Times, you of all newspapers should know that."
00:36:25,00:36:27,"This guy, sorry, this guy said John Win."
00:36:27,00:36:32,He was the director of Standard Time Company who happened to be one of her like biggest kind
00:36:32,00:36:33,of competitors.
00:36:33,00:36:36,"Oh, did they make watches?"
00:36:36,00:36:40,They were the people who supposedly start in charge of Standard Time in London.
00:36:40,00:36:41,Okay.
00:36:41,00:36:42,Makes sense.
00:36:42,00:36:45,But it gave a massive publicity as well as set off the back of it.
00:36:45,00:36:48,So actually business boomed for her.
00:36:48,00:36:51,"So in your face, Mr. St. John, what's your call?"
00:36:51,00:36:52,"Win, yeah."
00:36:52,00:36:55,"It was St. John last moment, God."
00:36:55,00:37:00,"So in 1936, there was a big moment for her business in a bad way, which was the telephone"
00:37:00,00:37:03,speaking clock that really stopped a lot of business.
00:37:03,00:37:08,"But weirdly, then it was voiced by a lady and her name was Ethel Cain."
00:37:08,00:37:13,And Ethel Cain lived in the exact same town as Ruth.
00:37:13,00:37:16,They were virtually next door neighbors.
00:37:16,00:37:18,"Oh, but they never spoke to each other."
00:37:18,00:37:19,What a sitcom.
00:37:19,00:37:21,There is to be written there.
00:37:21,00:37:24,Outskirts of Croydon is where they both lived.
00:37:24,00:37:25,Wow.
00:37:25,00:37:26,Yeah.
00:37:26,00:37:27,"God, attention."
00:37:27,00:37:29,Attention in that neighborhood must have been palpable.
00:37:29,00:37:30,Yeah.
00:37:30,00:37:32,"I do think it's amazing the sort of just to go back to wristwatches very, very briefly."
00:37:32,00:37:38,"The sort of, it was basically homophobia was what it was going on was people were saying"
00:37:38,00:37:43,"that people who wear wristwatches are effeminate and not sort of, not the right sort of people."
00:37:43,00:37:48,"So if you had a wristwatch, you would be called a wristwatch boy and people would say this"
00:37:48,00:37:51,about you and it's sort of really in an insulting way.
00:37:51,00:37:52,Yeah.
00:37:52,00:37:55,"And there was, so here's something from the Albuquerque journal in May 1914."
00:37:55,00:37:59,The fellow who wears a wristwatch is frequently suspected of having lace on his laundry and
00:37:59,00:38:01,of braiding his hair at night.
00:38:01,00:38:02,"I mean, it's pretty plain."
00:38:02,00:38:06,"And in New Orleans, there was a theater where there was a play on it."
00:38:06,00:38:11,"They said the main character is not portrayed by a wristwatch screen actor, dude, but by"
00:38:11,00:38:12,a man's man.
00:38:12,00:38:15,I'm not surprised of dude being used in that sense of that.
00:38:15,00:38:17,"That dude is very, yeah, dude is nice in century, I think."
00:38:17,00:38:18,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:38:18,00:38:22,"But basically, it took the first world war to shift that perception."
00:38:22,00:38:23,"Should we wrap up, Sunish?"
00:38:23,00:38:24,Yeah.
00:38:24,00:38:30,"There's a really cool story related to wristwatches and the original guy in this fact, and this"
00:38:30,00:38:36,"is about the Marriant Onet Watch, which was another watch that Abraham Louis Brege made."
00:38:36,00:38:42,"So this was commissioned by a guy who fancied Marriant Onet in 1782, and it was completed"
00:38:42,00:38:49,"by Brege's son in 1827, 44 years after it had been ordered, 34 years after Marriant Onet"
00:38:49,00:38:53,"had died, and four years after he'd actually died, but it was unbelievably complicated."
00:38:53,00:38:58,"So it's still the fifth, consider the fifth most complicated watch ever made."
00:38:58,00:39:02,"It was really, really beautiful, and it was handed down various generations, and it ended"
00:39:02,00:39:09,"up in the Maya Museum of Islamic Art in Jerusalem in 1983, where it got stolen in that year."
00:39:09,00:39:11,"And so there was a big police hunt, no one could find where it was."
00:39:11,00:39:14,There's this original watch made for Marriant Onet.
00:39:14,00:39:18,"And then this guy called Nicholas Hayek, who was the CEO of the Swatch Group, which had taken"
00:39:18,00:39:23,"over the Brege company, said in 1999 that he was the term that they'd make a replica."
00:39:23,00:39:27,"And so he went about making this replica, and that even took a few years."
00:39:27,00:39:29,So that was commissioned in 2004.
00:39:29,00:39:35,"And just before the replica was about to be completed and displayed, then lawyer in America"
00:39:35,00:39:40,got a letter from a woman who said that she had to return a bunch of objects that her
00:39:40,00:39:44,"husband had left in his will, saying that he'd stolen them decades earlier."
00:39:44,00:39:47,And one of those objects was the Marriant Onet watch.
00:39:47,00:39:51,"And so just as this replica was about to reappear, the watch itself surfaced."
00:39:51,00:39:52,Wow.
00:39:52,00:39:53,How great is that?
00:39:53,00:39:54,Yeah.
00:39:54,00:39:57,"Okay, that's it."
