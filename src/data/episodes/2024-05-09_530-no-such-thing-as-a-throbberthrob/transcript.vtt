00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
 [Music]

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.500
 Hi everybody, Andy and James here with an announcement.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.300
 Yes, absolutely. It's a very exciting announcement for people who like going to no-search-things-of-fish

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.660
 tour shows live. Oh, I think I might have given it away.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.480
 James, you fool! We were saving it for three minutes into the announcement, but James is right. We're going on tour!

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:32.220
 Right, so if you live in a large city in the UK or Ireland or some places on mainland Europe,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:40.120
 or excitingly in Australia or New Zealand, then we may well be coming to a place near you quite soon.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.640
 That's right. It's a world tour if you have a very limited definition of what the world is.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.000
 And it's basically like an earth sandwich tour. We're doing this antipode and we're doing the other antipode.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.380
 And it's going to be great. It's going to be between September and November. We should say that.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:04.820
 It's months of touring. Yes, and the reason that we're telling you today is that tickets are going to be on sale in one week's time.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.980
 Yes. In seven days, you must go to no-search-things-of-fish.com/live

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.060
 and all the details of our tour will be there and you'll be able to snaffle up those best seats in the house.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:25.660
 The only way to get tickets faster is if you're a member of Club Fish when you will receive bonus instructions in your forthcoming bit of extra material.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:32.120
 What a great thing Club Fish sounds like. That's what I say. Anyway, we're going on tour around the world. It's going to be amazing.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.560
 The other two will be there as well. It's not just me and James doing a world tour. It would be good.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.400
 Yeah, that would be great. And the great thing about going to Club Fish is not only do you get early access to tickets,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.360
 but you get a much cleaner and more clear announcement than this. Oh, yeah. Probably Anna and Dan will do it and it will be so professional.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.220
 Oh, yeah. That's nice. Like, yeah.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.240
 And so, yes, that is our news. We are going on tour around the world to both antipodes.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:10.000
 It's going to be a whole lot of fun and you guys can get tickets to come and see us by going to no-search-things-of-fish.com/live any time after Friday, the 17th of May.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 - On with the show! - On with the podcast. That was slick, Andy. I reckon.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 That was very slick. Very slick.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No-Search-Things-of-Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI Offices in Covent Garden.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray and I'm sitting here, joined by Anna Tijinski, James Harkin and Dan Schreiber.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 But wait, Dan's normally the host. What's going on? It's all on topsy-turvy.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Don't worry, everybody. It's an audience fact special. Yay!

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Hooray.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 And it's because we have an inbox, podcast@qr.com, and people send in all sorts of questions, comments, complaints, insults, praise sometimes.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 And also a lot of facts. And the facts are so good that we thought we'd just take a show to go through some of the best ones.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Starting with audience fact section number one, and that is you, James.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Yes, so thank you, Andrew. You have sent me a big pile of audience facts.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 So here's the first one that you sent me.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Karo Durken sent it, and she, he, they have an astrophysics, PhD, and they say that the more massive a white dwarf becomes, the smaller it gets.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 [Sigh]

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Huh?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Riddle me this.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 What?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Made a sting for riddle me this.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Yeah.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Really, I'll be honest, probably you're only gonna get this if you also have an astrophysics, PhD.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Oh.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 It's not really something you can guess.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 We're off the box with an unbelievably hard fact to understand.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Yeah, it's like you've sent me these on purpose, I think.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 I thought, who knows physics? And Dan's out of office was on, so.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Is that why I've got all the Bigfoot facts in my watch?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 That's right, they're meant for Dan's, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 So in normal stars, you have fusion happening at the core.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 So you're getting elements turning into other elements and making energy.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 But in white dwarfs, that doesn't happen.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 And so if you just put stuff into it, then there's nothing to stop gravity from just squishing them smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Got more massive.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 More massive?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 More, 'cause they've got more mass.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Absolutely.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 So it doesn't just, did you say it looks smaller? Was that the way it's put in the fact?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 It's not only looks smaller, it is smaller.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 It is smaller.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 But it's heavier.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 But it's heavier, it's more massive.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Gotta be careful with words like heavy, haven't you?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 You never know.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Yeah, you can't do that.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 You never know if you're gonna fly that.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 There are physicists waiting around every corner, ready to jump out and beat you up.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 And it's actually not heavier, it's more massive.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 I get that a lot.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 I just want 100 grams of gob stoppers.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 You know how I spend my pocket money, that's great.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Caro goes on, this one is bonkers in my opinion.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 After a certain distance, the further away something is from Earth, the bigger it looks.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Okay.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 So Dan, you see that cow out of the window, they look small.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 That's actually far away.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 But it looks small because it's further away.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 But if you take it far enough away, it'll start to get bigger.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Is that because it's coming around the back?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 It's coming towards you again.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Someone's left the gate open.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Well, I have this, I've not said this to you guys before,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 but I have this thing outside my house where when I turn to the left,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 I can see the sea front and I can see ships and they're massive.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 But then when I walk down to the edge of the cliff, they are further away.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 But that's just because they've moved away from me.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 No, no, no, it's a genuine, it's a horizon effect, it's called.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 What could you think of from the top of a cliff versus the bottom?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Oh, I see, yeah, that makes sense.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 But they're huge and then you go down and they're literally,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 sometimes they feel twice the distance and twice the size.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 And you're sure you're not looking at the dinghies that are on the sea front.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 That's not it.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Someone's peddling them.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 I didn't know that was a thing, that's really interesting.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 I don't understand it, it's magic, I don't get it.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Right.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 But I've been told by people like Levenskara, it's a real thing.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 That's cool.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 He knows his ship.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 So the thing is with galaxies, if you go far enough away,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 you're looking at something that was sending out its light quite near the start of the universe.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 The whole of the universe was quite small in those days.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 So if you're looking at something in the sky, if you're an astronomer,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 you're working out how much of the sky it's using up.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 But these things that are way, way further away are using up more of the sky

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 because actually space itself was smaller.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 That's incredible.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 That's so confusing.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 I was speaking to an astrophysics student recently who said,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 "There are some things in the sky that appear in three different places."

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Depending on, I can't remember what it was depending on.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Depending on what time of day it is in the suns, it's in the east now.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 And how much you've had to drink as well, that's the other factor.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 They're baffling these facts, they're so baffling.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 The reason they messed it up for us is when scientists decided about 100 years ago

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 that space and time are sort of the same but sort of different.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 So the thing you're looking at is longer ago.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 You're talking about Einstein here?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 He screwed up for everyone, didn't he? He made it a bit of a headfuck.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Yeah, well things were certainly easier when it was just,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 "How long does it take this apple to fall out of the tree and land on my head?"

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Exactly.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 It certainly was. I feel like we started quite difficult.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Yeah, can you give us an easy one?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Andrew Lillia says, "Sacadas pee in jets, not droplets."

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 That's nice.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 What does that mean?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Well, imagine you're urinating.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 I pee in the jet, don't I?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 I can't say for sure, but as a human, probably.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 It depends how much you've had to drink, that's the thing.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Old men pee in droplets, I've heard.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 So the thing is that most insects feed on sap.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 But cicadas drink so much sap that peeing in droplets doesn't work.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 And so they have to pee out in streams because they've just got so much of this stuff inside them.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Oh my goodness.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 You just need to get rid of it.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 So it becomes more energy effective to pee in a stream than in drops.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 And cicadas are actually the smallest animals that pee in streams.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Are they?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Yeah.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Good on them.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 What a niche record for them to have.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 I think they're proud of that.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 And it's been discovered by scientists who are looking into it using it.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 I'm guessing for a big military application somehow.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Yep, that's absolutely right.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 This would be used in the next war.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 No, it's like in any science, you learn something and you find the applications later, don't you?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Yeah.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Just thinking of cicada's penises or other genitals.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 It's reminded me of a phrase I learned just the other day, which is a bee's dick.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 Have you heard that?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Is it like the bee's knees only a bit?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 No, it's a unit to describe a very small distance.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 So you would say it's an Australian term.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 Oh, you miss crashing into the truck by a bee's dick?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Of course it's an Australian term.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 Of course it is so Aussie.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Do we know, I'm sure we've mentioned on the show at some point,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 but do we know if that's a fair comparison?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Do bees have proportionally small penises?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 I think regardless, they are small.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 And so if it's the size of a bee's dick, that's an incredibly tiny distance.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 I could just see bees objecting to that on proportion grounds.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 Fair do.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Fair do.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 Most Australian thing you ever said.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Carl Hepocoskey writes about a guy called Dave Bresnahan,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 who was a minor league baseball player,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 and he used a peeled potato in the sport.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 And what he would do is he would grab the potato and throw it.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 And so the opponent thought that he was throwing the ball,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 but actually he kept the ball concealed about his person.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 And in baseball, one way to get someone out is if you tag them with the ball

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 when they're between bases.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 And the other person thought, well, he can't possibly do that

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 because he's just thrown it.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 And he's like, aha, that was a potato that I threw.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Classic move.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 So he wasn't allowed to do that.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 Well, the interesting thing is I don't think it was against the rules,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 but it was against the spirit of the rules.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 I think that's fair.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 I do think that's fair.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 I think there was a thing in cricket once where W.G. Grace

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 was maybe the most famous cricketer of, maybe of all time,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 certainly the 19th century.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 He was a legend.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 I think he caught the ball in his jumper when he was batting

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 and then just kept running around with the ball on him

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 or about his person.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 It wasn't in his beard, but he did have a great big beard.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 I can't remember for sure.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 But basically he was just running back and forth,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 scoring lots of runs because he was the ball at that moment.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 But then if someone grabbed him.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Exactly.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 He hadn't touched the ground.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 Yeah, the ball hadn't touched the ground.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Oh, that's a good boy.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 He could be caught out.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 So maybe you just ended up running like just elsewhere.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Yeah, you ran over the boundary line in the end and got six.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Got six, yeah.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 It's a lot like in the sports book, in fact,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 which you and I have recently written, James.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 What was that?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 It's just to remind us, Colt again.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 It's called a load of old balls, actually.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 That's what the paperback's called, but it's not available yet.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 It's coming out soon.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 But it's not available yet.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 This is going to go out before that.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 So it's called everything to play for, actually.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Oh, OK.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 Yeah.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Actually, it's not part of the title.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 It's not a Richard Curtis-esque run.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 No, it's called everything to play for, full stop.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 And we do mention there that the Carlisle Indians

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 were an American football team at the turn of the 20th century.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 And they had pictures of football sown into all of their jerseys

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 so that no one on the opposing team knew which one was the actual ball.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 And we portrayed that as quite an ingenious move.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 So I think I'm probably the potato.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 OK, yeah, yeah.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Baseball, they do do this all the time.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 What you need is for whoever's standing on base,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 let's say you're on second base, while the picture is about to throw--

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Does that mean you're snugging the picture?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 Yeah.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 No, it means you're touching him downstairs, but on the surface.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 OK.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 So pitch is about to pitch towards the batter.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 In that time, the person who is on second base

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 can walk forward away from the pad on the ground, right?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 So the deal is, if the ball touches you and you're not with a foot on a pad,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 then you can be out, right?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 So that's when they use the trick.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 So they sometimes have weird beanbags in baseball,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 and I don't know the specific use,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 but that's often been used as a decoy baseball as well.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Really?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 So you would do a huddle, and then you'd come out of the huddle,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 and the person marking the base would have the ball in their hand,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 but the picture would look as if they had the ball,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 but it was this beanbag.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 I think this is all a bit unsportsmanlike.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 I don't have to say--

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 It's like playing football,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 but then if you had one giant toe on your foot,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 and then you sort of drew--

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 Drew Dodette.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 Drew-- I mean, Hentakins and Hacksmiths all over here.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Or if we're playing ice hockey,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 and I secretly slice up a black pudding before the match,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 and then at some point, I release all the slices.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 You know, it's mayhem.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Does it count if I score with a black pudding slice?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 It does not.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Yeah, that's pretty clear, isn't it?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 I don't think anything's clear in this new world of shadow sport

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 that we've been introduced to.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 You know why they use pucks in ice hockey?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Because they didn't originally--

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Did they start with balls?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Yeah, because it was based on an old sport that had balls.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Is it because--

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Oh, because they wouldn't snowball.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 They wouldn't--

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 If they were rolling, they would gather so many avalanches.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 I'll be honest, if you're playing ice hockey on the snow,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 that's probably the least of your problems.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 They're balls going nowhere.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Yeah.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 What happens to a ball when you hit it really hard on ice?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 It rolls, it goes up, slides.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 That's it, isn't it, James?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 Yeah, yeah, it goes up.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 It's so they didn't go up.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Make it safer, really,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 but it meant it stayed down on the ice the whole time.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Pucks slide.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 The original way they made one was by taking a rubber ball

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 and cutting off the top and the bottom

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 so that it was a flat disc.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Really?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Right.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 Just a heads-up, I'm pretty sure my description scenario

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 of that whole thing with the beanbag was from the movie

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Rookie of the Year,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 which is a fantastic movie, regardless,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 but that was a tactic used in that when Henry's arm

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 suddenly doesn't have the force any more.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Great movie, check it out.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 I think I've seen that.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 It's awesome.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Is it about a kid who gets a magic arm to play baseball?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Because I can't believe I've seen one of your weird awful films.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 He breaks his arm and they, in the cast,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 tightens it too much and has the greatest movie line

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 where they take the cast off and they discover his big arm

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 and it slaps the doctor's nose and he goes,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 "Funky butt-loving."

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 The finest line.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 So he says what?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 "Funky butt-loving."

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 Wow.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Why have you never used that on the show?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 We use it at home now.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 We watched it the other day.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 He does say it, but I always bleep it out because it's spelf.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Doesn't he, he throws a ball through someone else's hand.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 He gets such a powerful throwing arm that it just leaves

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 a sort of comedy cut-out hole.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 And I thought of that years later.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 I thought of that years later.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 I thought that's actually an incredibly upsetting thing.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 And we don't stay with that character who's just had a ball

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 thrown through his body.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Does that not happen?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 No, it doesn't.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Maybe it's through his glove.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 It's through his glove, I think.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 But if you go through the middle of the club,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 you're also going through the middle of that.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 It looks like he's going to lose at least a couple of fingers

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 and it just is glossed over.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 No, that might be from the movie Ed,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 which stars Matt LeBlanc, who brings a...

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Are there two separate films about magic baseball fans?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 Yeah, well, he brings a monkey and a chimp as a player on the team.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 That was a height of friends.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 It's gone lowbrow since that physics chat, hasn't it?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Yeah.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 OK, it's time for facts.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 Facts number two, I guess.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Lovely.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Let's say Anna, what have you got?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 I've got one from Gwen Wilkie.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 And this is incredible.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 I didn't know about this.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 She's written in about industrial musicals.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 Have you ever talked about these?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 I've not heard of that.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 I think so.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 They are big-budget musical theatre productions,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 massively expensive, that were put on entirely in private

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 by big capitalist corporations in the middle of the 20th century.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 And she actually cited a podcast called 20,000 Hertz,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 which I might listen to, which looks like it's a podcast

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 about really interesting sounds, lots of interesting sounds.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 Anyway, between, I think, sort of the 1940s to the 1980s,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 companies like Ford and General Electric and Coca-Cola

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 put on Broadway-style productions,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 but just to their employees as a sort of team bonding experience.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 And they were, I was looking into this a bit more.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 There was one in 1957, which was the Chevrolet musical,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 and it cost six times the amount it took to put

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 My Fair Lady onto the stage that same year.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 And this is just a musical that's been shown to Chevrolet employees

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 somewhere in order to make them feel like

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 they're part of a big old company.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 I can see that that's a good thing,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 but could you not just take them bowling?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Take them to see My Fair Lady at a sixth of the price.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 It would be less expensive, but it doesn't make you feel

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 like you're part of such a big operation.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 There were shows like The Bathrooms Are Coming,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 which was a 1969 show put on by American Standard Plumbers.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 There was Diesel Dazzle by General Motors in 1966.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 That one is quite good.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 It's alright, isn't it?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 Worth making a big budget musical out of it.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 So it seemed to start when I looked further into it

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 in the early 20th century, when companies would have these songs

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 that were written and performed in-house,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 just individual songs for them.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 So like the Larkin Soap Company released its own songbook

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 of songs they'd written.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Oh, as basically team-building exercises.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Again, team-building, and they'd get together and sing,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 they'd get a choir in, they'd get a little orchestra.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 I like this.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 I think maybe we should write our own musical.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Shall we?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Yeah.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 And then drain QI's budget.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 Only allow our colleagues to listen to it.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 Yes.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 Yes.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Okay.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 I think probably no one else would want to.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 In fact, I'd be surprised if our colleagues

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 sat around until the end.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 Playing all the roles in this musical as well.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 I guess so.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 I think we'll have to.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 But you can do the old like paint half of your face,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 you know, as Dr. Dolittle and not Dr. Dolittle.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 Hamlet.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 Yeah.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Henry Dolittle.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 Henry Dolittle.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 Eliza Dolittle.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Oh, Eliza Dolittle.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 Sorry.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 And Henry, whatever it's called.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 Higgins.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Yeah.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 Unless it was Dr. Dolittle, the musical.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 We could put that on.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 Based on the Eddie Murphy movie.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 I love, and that's crying out for a musical, I think.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 Okay.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 Yeah.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 I think.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 There was a Dr. Dolittle.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 The Dr. Dolittle movie had songs in it.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 The Rex Harrison one.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 He talks to the animals.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 Yeah.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Yes, that was it.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 Absolutely was.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 Whatever it facts we've ever done on the show.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 I think it was yours, Andy.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 Rex Harrison, the giraffe had the movie.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 Filming was stopped because it accidentally stood on its penis.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 That's right.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 The giraffe stood on its own penis.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 Yeah.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 It feels like I wish I was a bee.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Anyway, yeah, amazing fact there from Gwen Wilkie.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 I have another fact.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 This is from Michela or Michela Comperi.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 And this is that the tuba part for Antonin Dvorak's New World Symphony is very bad.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 That's not the end of the fact.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 What?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 Is it bad?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Well, it's very bad in that it's extremely short.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 So it's a very long symphony.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 It's like 40 minute symphony.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 The tuba part is just 14 notes.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 It's seven notes at the start of one of the movements.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 Oh, no.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Seven notes at the end.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 Okay.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Oh, my God.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 So it, I don't know if you guys have been in orchestras and stuff, but you're basically

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 for the entire rest of the piece just going one, two, three, four.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Oh, no.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Two, two, three, four.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Exactly.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 Three, two, three, four.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 Seven hundred and sixty-five, two, three, four.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 Yeah.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 That's absolutely correct.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Why might he have done this?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 This could be guessable.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 The composer?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Yeah, Dvorak.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Because he was in love with the tuba player and wanted...

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Exactly the opposite answer.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 Hated the tuba player.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Hated the tuba player.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Sorry.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 The clue of the opposite.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 No, I understand that.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 But you guided Dan to the round.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 So he hated the tuba player specifically because he thought he was having an affair with his

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 wife.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 And they were about to go on tour, I think, with this, you know, this new piece he'd written.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 The tuba player was getting quite close to his wife.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 And he thought, "I'm going to have to take this tuba player away with me."

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 So he quickly shoved in 14 notes of tuba as a lovely punishment for this guy.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 That's amazing.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 And dragging him away from his wife.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 I couldn't find much firsthand evidence of it online, although it is repeated by conductors

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 and a lot.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 It's a great idea.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 It is.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 But it is a bizarre quirk.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 You get tuba players the world over talking about it, saying, "Why on earth has he forced

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 us to sit through this 40 minutes for the sake of seven notes at one end and seven notes

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 at the other?"

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 And you can't be on your phone, can you, when you're in the orchestra and the audience is

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 all there.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 You can't just go on and play Snake for 40 minutes.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Can you?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 I don't know.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 Maybe it was changing.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 I like to think your head, though, was like, "You can't be on your phone."

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 You're like, "Dvorak wouldn't have had iPhones."

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Maybe he had a Nokia 3310.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 I'll say play Snake.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 I genuinely couldn't think of anything more modern to be doing on my phone.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 That New World Symphony is from the Hovis adverts, isn't it?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 It's not from the Hovis adverts.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 It's not.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 That's wonderful that I've got the idea.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 It was in love with a Lady Baker.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 No, that little boy who walks up the street with his bike, he was having an affair with

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 his wife.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 Oh.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 Oh.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 That one.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 No, that's Coronation Street.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 I think he goes, "Sorry."

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 And that's Puccini.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Yes.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 I think he goes, "Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo."

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 Sorry.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 I've got it here.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 A lovely piece of music, I'm sorry.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 It is good.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 It's very nice.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 It's Tuba Controversial.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 Sibelius refused to write for the Tuba after what his Tuba player turned up drunk.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 He just completely mangled the part and Sibelius went, "Sod this."

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 He's punishing all Tuba players with a loss of income.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 So is it more as well that you travel as a band?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Is this like, you would have your unit that would do all your tours, all your, you know,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 it's the same supporting band?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 It's an orchestra, isn't it?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Yeah, orchestra.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Yeah.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 But as you know, Dan, why do orchestra players, you know, need music?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 I bet the Tuba player still has the sheet music up there to know when they've got to

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 play.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 Like, no memories.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 They're no springsteens, are they?

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 Oh, dear.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 I don't think I got that reference.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 That's a very deep cut for us.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 Oh, you weren't here.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 When you're on that leave for Bassoon Gate, yeah.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Dan claimed that, what was the claim you made that it was a joke, which then became serious

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 as I got angrier about the response to it.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 I know the vibe.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 It was basically that if you're in U2, you can learn all the songs easy.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 You don't need sheet music.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 So why does a bassoon player in an orchestra need sheet music?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 We were talking about this amazing, no, you were on the show.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 You brought the fact in.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 You were about the first female conductor and she took all the sheet music away from her.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Yeah, that was me.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 Yeah.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.540
 And I was just saying, isn't that amazing that you just shut down as an orchestra as soon

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.000
 as the music's gone, the sheet music.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 Christ, I blanked that out.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 You weren't here for the fallout.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 You weren't here for every episode of Drop As A Line for the subsequent year.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 Right.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 We had a lot of bassoon player correspondence.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 Have we?

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 I think we've heard from every bassoonist on the planet.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 That was great.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 That's great.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 I'm so happy.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 I missed that.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Actually, there is a reference to a show that I did miss.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 This is from Theo Tamashiro Harris, who said that on the most recent episode, which is

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 no longer the most recent, Olga Koch talked about French kissing in Swedish tables.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 You guys remember her talking about that?

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 No, yeah.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 I think it'll be about the fact that French kissing is called French kissing.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 It was called Swedish Tables.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 She was talking about an Irish goodbye or an English goodbye.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 That's what you don't say goodbye to anyone.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 You just walk off.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 There you go.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 And this person said, they reminded that in Spanish, the word for roller coaster is Russian

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 Mountain.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.320
 I didn't know that was what it was in Spanish, but I think we probably mentioned because

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.000
 Russian Mountains were the original roller coaster, right?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 Yeah.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 Big ice slides that you used to go.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 Yeah.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 Oh, so you would just push people down and that would be the ride.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 Yeah.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 It's like a roller coaster, but it's a big sort of like a ski jump.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Yeah, right.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 Wow.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 And this is 17th century, I think.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 18th century.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 And then this person said that in the course of researching this, which I like because

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.500
 they obviously just went quite deep.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:58.000
 They found out that the Russian word for roller coaster is American Hill, which is quite cool.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Yeah.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 That's pretty cool.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 How tall would these be?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 Do you know?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 21 meters is the height that I'm saying.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 That's very tall.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 That's high.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 Yeah.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 It depends on the gradient of the slope though, doesn't it?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 Yeah, that's true.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Yeah.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 That could be terrifying or it could be incredibly dull.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 It's so boring.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 It's just 200 meters long and who cares?

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 It gives another one.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 Okay.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Here's another good one that I didn't know about and should have gone and asked sports

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 book that this is from Alan Dimmock.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 What's that cop though?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Everything to play for.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.660
 Alan Dimmock says that the England captain, he means the rugby England captain, is meant

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:36.000
 to write a letter every year asking rugby schools permission to wear white.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 Really?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 I didn't know that.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 It's meant to.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 So is it still held up?

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Apparently the rule faded in early 2000.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 That's a long time to keep it going.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 I mean, that's what 100 years of actually doing that every year.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 Yeah, quite irresponsible to let it lapse actually.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 Yeah.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 I think Martin Johnson didn't know how to write.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Wow.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 That's such a deep, that's such a specific slam that I don't know.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 You know what?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 I'm kind of guessing that that was his name.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 I'm not even sure because I don't really follow up Union.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 I think it was.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 It is Martin Johnson and actually you might be right because he, Martin Johnson, remember

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 the days when you would call.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 So he made phone calls to rugby school.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 I'm really sorry, Martin Johnson.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 It was like, it was just a natural joke and yours was the first name that came into my

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 head.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Because you're a rugby player.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 You're a lot bigger than me.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 Yeah.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 I mean, at least Dan had the sense to pick on bassoon players.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 Oh no, we're going to email some gigantic bassoon players now.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 The England rugby team orchestra is going to get in contact.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Okay.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 Well, that's great.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 It's one more amazing one.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 This is from Robin who says that the earliest known picture of Jesus depicts him as a donkey.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 No.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Yeah.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 Wait, but no, he got a donkey to Jerusalem.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Yeah.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 That's a misconception.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 It was the donkey.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 That is a good, that's a great thing.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 It's good.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 It's not quite true actually.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 I think it was like, was it like graffiti kind of thing?

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 It absolutely was.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 Grafito, the Alexa Menos Grafito in Rome and it was actually an insulting thing.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 But this is the earliest picture we have.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 And it was scratched onto a wall in Rome in the second century.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 Grafito, I'm sorry.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 I know.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 I'm sorry, but like the council, I'm not going to send anyone if you complain about a grafito.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 And rightly so.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Well, there's a Banksy Grafito quite near my house.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 There you go.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Yeah.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 I 100% said to my wife, should we go and see the grafito?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 Of course you did.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 She refused.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Yeah, it was scratched into a wall and underneath it, it said something like in Latin, obviously,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 you know, here is the person that Alexa Menos worships and it shows them on worshipping

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 a donkey being crucified.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Oh, I've seen that.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 Yes.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 You've seen it.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 Or I've seen someone do a reproduction of it if it doesn't exist anymore.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Can I give you a Jesus fact while we're here, which I learned this morning.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 You know, they have the Apocrypha.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 So these are like in the Gospels.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 There's Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, but actually loads of other Gospels were written

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 and they didn't make it into the final Bible.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 They didn't make the edit.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 They didn't make the edit.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 The publisher really hacked.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 The Virgin Mary's vagina makes your hand wither if you touch it.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Oh, gosh, who's touching it?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 The midwife.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 Oh, no.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Yeah, Salome the midwife.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 But that's very, is it a punishment?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 Yeah, basically because she was a virgin, the Salome the midwife is like, well, I'm going

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 to check if you're a virgin and did whatever gynecologists in the first century AD did in

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 those situations.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 And it was such a bad thing that her arm withered away.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 And actually it grew back when she touched the baby Jesus.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Oh, did it?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 Wow.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 But hang on, that's not fair, isn't it?

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Isn't it meant to protect the Virgin Mary from people with sort of bad intentions towards her?

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Oh, you think it was like, oh, I see.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Sort of defence mechanism, basically.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 It's sort of like no wonder she's a virgin if that's what happens to you, if you start

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 trying to have sex with her.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 You'd have to really love her, wouldn't you?

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 No, no, it's not with her, darling.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 It's just cold.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Yeah.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 That's crazy.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 How can we don't see that as part of the birth depiction of Jesus where they're all happy,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 there's all the three wise men and there's just a screaming midwife with a melting hand

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 like she's in Raiders of the Lost Ark at the end.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Where's that scene?

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 I think you've answered your own question because the primary schools are not going to

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 go for it, are they?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 Yeah, I guess so.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 But I've been cast and none of them have been played.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 OK, it's time for our next facts, and those come from, or should I say via, Downtriver.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 Yep, so the first fact, this was sent in by Sarah Gaffin and her son, Harry Gaffin.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 And the fact is, the great-grandfather of the actor who plays Spock was literally a son of Vulcan.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 Oh, right.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 It feels like we're in Riddle Corner now.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 This is awesome.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 OK, so Leonard Nimoy?

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 Not Leonard Nimoy.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Oh, well, I thought I was getting in with an easy point.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 That's a bit of Star Trek knowledge.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 So in the remake movies of Star Trek, Spock was played by Zachary Quinto.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 Zachary Quinto did in America, I think, I don't know how long it's been there.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 It feels like it's quite recent, but who do you think you are as now in America?

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 And one of the revelations that they found out is that his great-grandfather, who's called P.J.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 McGardy, and he was very active in a thing called the Amalgamated Association of Iron

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 and Steel Workers, but they were originally known as the Sons of Vulcan.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 Oh, that's great.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 Yeah, that's good.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 Now, that's Vulcan the god of the forge and fires.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 Yeah.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 Yeah, but this is, it gets even better.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 So this is 1899.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 So we're talking a long time before Star Trek was everything.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 He also was someone who used to write for the official organ of the Amalgamated Association of Iron

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Steel and Tin Workers.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 And one of the pieces that he published ends with the phrase, may it live long and prosper.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 No.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Yeah.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 What?

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 No.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 That's not possible.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 It is possible.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 Well, then there is a god.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 Well, there you go.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 That sounds great.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 Isn't that incredible?

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 He's a dork.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 Yeah.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Wow.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 It's amazing.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 Do you think Zachary Quintale maybe went to the audition with all this information

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 and said, you've got to give me the part?

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Yeah, you'd think so.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 You would hope so.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 But it turns out that this was a revelation in the show.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 There's quotes of him going, that's crazy.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 That's insane.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 Now, it was pointed out to him that that connection of may it live long and prosper.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 Yes, that's extraordinary.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 However, that was a phrase that was in use at the time.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 So, yeah, so there was a stage play of Rip Van Winkle, which it's possible that old PJ

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 McCardle was able to see.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 But you know, like...

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 That doesn't take anything away from it for me.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Exactly.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 That's an extraordinary coincidence.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 Yeah.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 So Sarah and Harry, that's awesome.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Thank you for sending that in.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 Yeah.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 More facts.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.500
 Let's go to another one.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:04.280
 This is from Jonas Belfridge and he says, "Grasshoppers have existed almost 200 million years longer

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.280
 than grass."

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.280
 Lovely.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.280
 Lovely.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.280
 Lovely.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.280
 What were they called?

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.280
 Poppers.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280
 Yeah.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.280
 No, we, yeah.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.280
 So grasshoppers date back to the early Triassic, around 250 million years ago.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.280
 But fossil findings have indicated that grass evolved around 55 million years ago.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.280
 So, yeah, so they were there far longer before they...

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.280
 Nothing to hop over.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.280
 That is the absolutely classic QI/5.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:33.280
 I love the things which existed before the other things, like the button hole.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.280
 Hole?

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.280
 No, the button existed before the button hole.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.280
 Yeah, a couple of hundred years.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.280
 No, we did a few weeks ago.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.280
 Yeah.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.280
 Basketball nets.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.280
 You name it.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.280
 They didn't exist before the basket.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:48.280
 Yeah, basketball nets existed before basketball.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.280
 The train tunnel existed before the train.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.280
 Yes.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.280
 Which I cut out of this week's show.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.280
 What?

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.280
 That's fair enough.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.280
 God, send in more.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.280
 I'd love a list of those.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.280
 It's just weird when you find out when bits of earth arrived, right?

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.280
 I remember Ash, who did our theme tune.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.280
 He used to have a petrified bit of wood that sat in his house.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.280
 It's hundreds of million years old.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.280
 And he would say, this was here before flowers.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.280
 Like, this is older than the concept of flowers.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.280
 His wife going, I prefer that you had flowers in our house.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.280
 Yeah, Valentine's Day.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.280
 Yeah, so yeah, amazing fact.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.280
 Should we get another?

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.280
 Yeah.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:37.280
 Paul Baker, who writes the spinning circle/pinwheel/loading mouse cursor on computers, is called a throbber.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.280
 Come on.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.280
 Oh, that explains so much.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.280
 That explains why that guy is shouting that in the library when I go in.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280
 He's on the computer.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.280
 Great.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.280
 Get rid of that throbber.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.280
 Yeah, I didn't know that.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.280
 Now we know.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.280
 The spinning wheel of death.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.280
 The spinning wheel of death.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.280
 Yeah.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.280
 That's a good insult as well.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:01.280
 Because it's, I like insults that are quite, they're not actually saying any rude or swear words,

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.280
 but it's very clear what you think of the person.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.280
 So calling someone a roaster, for example, is an absolute roaster.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.280
 I think throbber is a penis, right?

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.280
 I mean, that's what he's calling you.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.280
 You're right.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.280
 It's less ambiguous calling someone an absolute throbber.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.280
 I don't think of those wheels as throbbing.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.280
 No, worse than them.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.280
 Yeah, good question.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.280
 Let's find out.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.280
 I don't think it's going to, are you actually googling that?

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.280
 Well, no, presumably it's someone who has called it that.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.280
 Maybe they use the throb.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.280
 Maybe.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.280
 Maybe it was an insult to what someone they hated, a co-worker.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:37.280
 I maybe just build gates like the word or Steve Jobs or, I don't know.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:43.280
 The link that was given to me by Paul Baker leads to a paper that's called How Throbber Components

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.280
 Affect Users Perception of Waiting Time.

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.280
 So it's clearly a word that is so well known within its industry.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:58.280
 How interesting, because that to me sounds like another paper that I've read, which is, you know, like the loading bar?

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.280
 Yeah.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.280
 It says, this is how much of this is loaded.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.280
 That usually is not true.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.280
 I remember you saying this.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.280
 Yeah.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.280
 They rig it so that it makes you think it's going faster than it is or something.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.280
 Yeah.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.280
 What do they do?

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.280
 It kind of just makes you less likely to be annoyed, basically.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.280
 Yeah.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.280
 Those things, they tend to go quite slowly, quite slowly, and then speed up.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.280
 Yeah.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.280
 And then they'll slow down a bit, and then they'll speed up at the end.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:24.280
 And the idea is, if they went the actual speed, then you'd be like, well, this is just going to take forever.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.280
 It looks quite pedestrian.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.280
 Yeah.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.280
 Yeah.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.280
 That's a really good idea.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.280
 That's kind of like this show.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:34.280
 You know, it actually takes longer than you think to listen to.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:42.280
 But James in the edit speeds up and slows down bit selectively to make it seem like it's actually passing at an interesting rate.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.280
 So this bit that Addy's just said is one of those really pedestrian moments.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:56.280
 It's a bit like they did a study of people standing at bus stops, and they found that when they put lots of trees next to the bus stops, people thought they were waiting for less amount of time.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.280
 Oh, that's good.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.280
 Not sure why.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.280
 Is that?

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.280
 Yeah, because the trees are waiting even longer, or by comparison, I've been here less long than that tree.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.280
 I guess because it's less dull and boring.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.280
 That's nice.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.280
 Yeah.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.280
 Put a telly there.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.280
 Whoa.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:16.280
 Conversely, if you put someone there and get them to play seven notes on a tuba, then it feels like it's ages.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.280
 Do you know, actually, bus stops are good places to put a graffiti?

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.280
 Are they?

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.280
 Yes, they are.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.280
 And that's because birds fly into them.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:35.280
 And they did a study in Scandinavia somewhere, I think, where they looked at bus stops, glass bus stops, with no graffiti, and then one with a graffiti on it.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.280
 And they found that birds didn't crash into the graffiti-wise ones.

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.280
 Of course they wouldn't, because they could see it.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.280
 That's brilliant.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.280
 But wait, don't do a graffiti of a bird's nest.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.280
 No, no.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.280
 Or the big worm.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.280
 Or the big worm.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:52.280
 So, yeah, I mean, Colin's dictionary says that it's a throwback.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.280
 I can't get into OED because you need to sign into it.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.280
 I can sign you in.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.280
 Okay, cool.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.280
 I'm not getting the etymology of it.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.280
 I don't know if it's worth it.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.280
 I feel like--

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.280
 Yeah.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.280
 Your time is ticking down.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.280
 My time is ticking down.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.280
 So you've got to get in there.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.280
 Okay, all right.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.280
 Well, let's move on to our next fact.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.280
 And this has been sent in by Andy Wenger.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.280
 Or Wenger.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.280
 And--

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.280
 All above the Wenger bus.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.280
 And Andy writes, and this is pretty astonishing,

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.280
 "Every possible melody has been copyrighted."

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.280
 Right.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:29.280
 "Every possible melody has been copyrighted and stored on a single hard drive."

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.280
 Well, no.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.280
 Yeah, so Andy writes, "In a unique effort to combat the high volume of dubious lawsuits

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:39.280
 flying back and forth in the music industry today, a team of musicians has recorded every

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:44.280
 possible melody onto a single hard drive and then put each melody in the public domain."

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.280
 How have you recorded every possible melody?

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.280
 Well, okay.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.280
 So music has a set number of notes, right?

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.280
 Yeah, but every possible melody would be like infinitely billions.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.280
 Yes, exactly right.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:01.280
 However, Andy Wenger sent a link to the Atlantic, which is where he got this fact from.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:06.280
 And within that article, it says, "Most pop melodies run fewer than 12 notes.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:10.280
 If you generated every possible melody with just the eight notes of the C scale,

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.280
 that would be eight to the upside down V of 12."

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.280
 What's that?

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.280
 To the power of 12.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.280
 Is that power?

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:24.280
 Eight to the power of 12 melodies, which is 68,719,476,736.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:29.280
 Big number, but achievable when you put it into a computer and you generate all of those

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.280
 melodies.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.280
 So that's what they did.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.280
 They wrote every melody, at least within that popular phrase.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.280
 So all I need to do is write my song in D sharp.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.280
 Is that right?

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.280
 Because that's just in the C scale.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.280
 Exactly.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.280
 That's just in the C.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.280
 Yeah, I think so, yeah.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.280
 But melody, I guess, can apply to different keys.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.280
 Yeah, yeah.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.280
 It's the argument that if one was accused of stealing someone's melody,

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.280
 then you could go to that and say, "No, it's not Christmas."

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.280
 It's been copyrighted and it's in the public domain.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.280
 Right.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.280
 It's the idea.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.280
 So they just wanted to stop.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.280
 That's a cool idea.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.280
 Led Zeppelin calling in every band to, not that they do that.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.280
 In fact, they're the ones who are called in.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:10.280
 When you said it, I thought you were going to say that this hard drive contains not only

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:16.280
 the score from Mission Impossible 7, but also the score from the as yet unreleased Mission

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.280
 Impossible 8, because it's just got all music for all time.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.280
 Like somewhere in there.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.280
 Yeah.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.280
 There is a perfect, yeah, yeah.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.280
 Throbber.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.280
 Oh.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.280
 There's no need to be personally.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:32.280
 First meaning, chiefly colloquial, the heart.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.280
 Now rare.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.280
 That dates from 1828.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.280
 Okay.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:39.280
 And then there's only one more meaning, a person or a thing which throbs.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.280
 Right.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.280
 Oh.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:48.280
 And the most recent citation is, "The DJ and producer has unleashed a hammer of four

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:55.280
 throbber that'll find favor with the tenaglius and super chumbos of the world."

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.280
 I'm always wondering how the super chumbos are going to react to each week's episode.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.280
 So the OED doesn't have anything about the...

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.280
 No, it's too new, I guess.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.280
 They're updating it all the time.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.280
 It's nice to know that it used to be a heart though.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.280
 Yes.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.280
 You could say my throbber burns for you.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.280
 Yes.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.280
 I don't say it though.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.280
 Don't make that your next chat up line.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.280
 But if there was a really sexy film star, they might be a throbber throb.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.280
 Yes.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.280
 Now we're cooking.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.280
 Lovely.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.280
 Super.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.280
 The meanings of the word throbber.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:31.280
 I got one more here, which is this was sent in by Aidan from Nene New Zealand.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:38.280
 And he wrote about a Hawaiian guy who was called Duke Kahanamuku, who broke two world records

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.280
 and equaled a third in his first official swim race.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:46.280
 He became the first successful Hollywood actor from Hawaii, taught presidents and royalty

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.280
 how to surf.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:52.280
 And during his first 100-meter final at the Olympics, he was so far ahead, he was able

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.280
 to look back and survey the field.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.280
 He also invented a new way to kick.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.280
 No.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.280
 Introduced surfing.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.280
 He has in swimming, I think.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.280
 There's a ball over there and he's like, what is this?

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.280
 What did he do to that ball?

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:10.280
 I don't know.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:14.280
 That's a heartwarming 90s Disney movie for all the family, isn't it?

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.280
 Yeah.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.280
 The new way to kick.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.280
 Kick the ball through his chest.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:23.280
 Introduced surfing to Australia, where it's become one of their favorite pastas.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.280
 That didn't need to be in that.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.280
 Not necessarily Aidan, but thank you for that.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:34.280
 And once saved eight people from a cap-sized boat in heavy surf while on location for a

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.280
 film.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:40.280
 Oh, and after the first swim race, the authorities didn't believe his time, so they made him

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.280
 travel all the way to the US mainland to prove it, where he swam even faster.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.280
 They should have made him swim there.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.280
 Yeah.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.280
 That would have proved it.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.280
 So yeah.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.280
 Great.

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.280
 Someone I've never heard of before.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.280
 Juke Kahanamoku.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.280
 What a guy.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:41:01.280
 Inventor of a new kick.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.280
 All right.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.280
 It's time for the final batch of facts.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.280
 And those are my ones.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.840
 I'm going to start with another mind-blowing one.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.780
 This is from Aidan Chauhan.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:16.040
 And Aidan says this, a bacteriophage is a virus that infects bacteria, right?

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:22.360
 It's so tiny, 20 to 200 nanometers in height, but they are so abundant on Earth that if

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:29.200
 you stacked them all on top of each other, it would be 200 million light years of distance

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.200
 that they reached.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:34.320
 For reference, the Milky Way is about 90 million light years in diameter.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:40.680
 So more than double, the entire width of the Milky Way is just the bacteriophages on Earth.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.840
 And would they look bigger the further they got away?

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.080
 After a certain point, yes.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.880
 Unfortunately, not at the point we've got to.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.880
 Oh, okay.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:49.880
 I still think this is a good fact.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.880
 No, it's a great fact.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:57.760
 Did we ever mention, I think, about bacteriophages, the amount of bacterias they eat every day?

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.400
 I think we might have done, actually.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:03.600
 They eat something like a third of all the bacteria in the ocean every single day.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.600
 Oh, thank goodness.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:06.600
 That's right.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.600
 Thank goodness.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.840
 And every planet is at midnight on the door every night.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.400
 But, yeah, bacteriophages are amazing.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.720
 I wrote back saying, "Ugh," he wrote back saying, "Yeah, it's true."

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.720
 That is amazing.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.720
 His wife learned it.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.720
 They should do it.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.720
 In class.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.720
 They should do it.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.720
 We should do it.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.720
 Well, no, but who's going to eat all the bacteria?

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.640
 If we do that, it'll be a disaster, because then there'll be lots of bacteria in the oceans

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.440
 and probably spill over or something.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.060
 All right, here's another one.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.520
 This is from Daniel Nusdayo, and it's a riddle, right?

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:38.360
 I wanted you all to know that in March 2003, Air Algerie Flight 6289 crashed during takeoff,

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:44.040
 killed 102 on board, leaving just one survivor who survived because he wasn't wearing his

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.040
 seat belt.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.040
 Mm-hmm.

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.040
 How?

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.040
 What was it, yeah?

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.540
 2003, quite recent.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:50.540
 Oh, okay.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.540
 Well, the plane crashed.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.040
 Did he fly out of the window or something?

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.560
 Yeah, he was flying out while everyone couldn't get out.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.120
 Okay, so it's an easier riddle than I thought it was.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:04.000
 He was in the back row, and yeah, he was immediately ejected when it landed from the seat, clear

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.440
 of whatever had then happened.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.440
 All right, fine.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.960
 I've got another plane-related riddle for you.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:08.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.440
 I just thought in case that one didn't work out as well as I hope.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.800
 That's an extraordinary survival story.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.800
 It is extraordinary.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.800
 That's insane.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:15.800
 I think-

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.800
 Do you remember the lady we spoke about?

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.800
 I don't know if it made it into the show.

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.960
 Either her parachute failed or she didn't have a parachute.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:26.320
 She landed softly around an ant's nest, and then the ants acted by biting her.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.320
 They were kind of acted as a defibrillator and brought her back.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.320
 Do you remember that?

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.240
 I think like the adrenaline that caused her-

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.520
 She landed in the Amazon and she survived.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.960
 I remember the girl who landed in the Amazon and who like spent days kind of crawling through

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.280
 the Amazon's really bad language.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.280
 Was it her?

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.280
 I think this is a different one.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.280
 No, I think this is a different one as well.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.360
 There's also Bess Navalovic, who fell further than anyone else in history.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:53.720
 She was either Croatian or Serbian, I think, and she was- there was a big explosion on

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.720
 board, I think.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.520
 In fact, she must be Serbian because it was Croatian bomb.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:04.280
 She was kind of pinned to the fuselage with the drinks trolley and fell with the fuselage

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:08.480
 and somehow, and I think she had very low blood pressure, so her heart didn't explode

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.480
 or something.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.480
 Wow, grief.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.480
 And then she became like a hero of the-

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.480
 That's incredible.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.480
 Then there's Flight 401, that was an American flight.

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:19.800
 It was the first flight to have dual sides, so you could walk down the aisle in the middle,

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.440
 so it had seats either side of the plane.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.440
 Wide body.

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:26.000
 Yeah, okay, first commercial flight that did that, and a lot of people managed to survive

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.720
 because it crash landed into a swamp, so the swamp gave it a bit of a break.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.920
 And then they repurposed quite a lot of the stuff because the plane was actually in good

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.560
 shape like bits of it, so they took bits and put it into other planes, and then people

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:44.720
 started reporting ghostly encounters because they believed that the pieces that were repurposed

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.720
 were now cursed.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.000
 I knew- I had this sound of familiar as you started saying it.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 Ghost flight.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 Ghost 401.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 Is it a film?

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 It was, yeah.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 Right.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Yeah.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.920
 With a really big actor, and I can't remember who the big actor is in it.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.920
 Sorry, is this not true?

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:03.320
 No, it's based on a story that was written by a paranormal expert who put that angle

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.920
 on it, and then it was converted into a movie because it was such a big- Got it.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.280
 I'm dragging this back to the realm of facts.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.160
 Here's another plane-related riddle from Kester Wolf.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.480
 The Labrador.

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.720
 You may have come across this before, but I learned it yesterday.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:20.240
 Did you know that Air Force One has taken off more times than it has landed?

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.920
 Oh, I did know this.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.360
 It's currently in the air.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.360
 That would be true.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.360
 That would be true.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.360
 That would be true.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.920
 The plane has changed while it's in the air.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:28.920
 Yes.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.920
 Bingo.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.920
 That was it.

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:31.920
 And what happened?

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.920
 Which president was it?

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:33.920
 Was it Kennedy?

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:34.920
 It wasn't Kennedy.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.920
 Nixon.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.720
 Nixon was on board Air Force One at the time his resignation took effect, so the plane

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.920
 took off with the call sign Air Force One and landed with a normal call sign at the other

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.920
 end.

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.920
 Right.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:48.920
 Isn't that great?

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:49.920
 Yeah, that is.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:50.920
 So it's confusing, though.

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:51.920
 Well, that's riddles for you.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.920
 No, I mean for the air traffic control on that day.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:59.240
 Well, suddenly the plane just disappears and the other one just appears out of place.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.240
 Yep.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.240
 True.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.680
 Here's a fact from Meredith McBride.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.680
 Hi there.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.760
 A long time, let's know whose son shared a fact and wanted me to send it in.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.760
 So here it is.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.760
 This is great.

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.760
 You know the Burj Khalifa?

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.760
 Yeah.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:11.760
 That's the very tallest building?

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.760
 I've been there.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.760
 Been up it.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:21.240
 Well, James, if while there, you had laid it on its side, I would have been arrested.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.680
 It would be longer than Vatican City.

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:29.120
 I went to Vatican City in the same year as I went to Burj Khalifa.

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:33.760
 That surprised me, actually, because I remember crossing the border into Vatican and walking

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:39.320
 all the way up to wherever the Pope lives, his house, and it's quite a walk.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.320
 It's quite a walk.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.840
 Well, it's still not as long as the Burj Khalifa will be at all.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.920
 So a building in Asia, Meredith writes, is larger than a European country.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.920
 That is cool.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.920
 That's pretty cool.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:49.920
 That's a great fact.

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.320
 I was in Georgia because I'm guessing you didn't walk up in the Burj Khalifa.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.320
 No, I was in a lift.

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.320
 Yeah.

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.320
 So that does seem a lot shorter than that.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.880
 Did you do the sunset thing?

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.880
 No.

00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:58.880
 God did that.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:46:59.880
 Oh, no.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:00.880
 So you're on that.

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:01.880
 I see why you thought I invented that.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.880
 And the Pope told you, didn't he?

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.880
 He made that clear when you were there.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.500
 There's apparently a thing where it's so tall that if you get into the lift at the right

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:13.400
 moment, you can see a sunset twice by going up it.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.400
 The sun goes down.

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.400
 You go up the lift.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.120
 You go up and you get a second sunset.

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.520
 You know what would be weird?

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:22.560
 If you were at the top of the Burj Khalifa, those ships would look enormous.

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.560
 Yeah.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.560
 Yeah.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.560
 Man, huge.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:26.560
 They'd be in my face.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.560
 Yeah.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.560
 There's also a thing which is apparently it doesn't have any...

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.560
 And you lose.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.560
 It's so weird.

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.560
 It has toys.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:34.560
 And they didn't put them in.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.080
 So they would kick themselves afterwards.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.080
 What'd they do?

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.080
 I went to...

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.080
 Sorry to say this.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.360
 I went to a building in Copenhagen.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.120
 It's like a round building.

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.720
 And they just had like a drop where you poo into it.

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.720
 No.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:49.720
 So it's like a chair.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:54.480
 And it's like it's a hollow building and you kind of sit with your bum facing the inside

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.480
 of the building.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.480
 No.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.960
 And you poo and it just goes into the bottom of the tower.

00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.840
 But sorry, like a modern building?

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:00.840
 Or an ancient castle?

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.840
 No, no.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.840
 Ancient, old, old, old.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.840
 Sorry.

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.840
 Because it sounded like you were describing it as a modern architect's dream, like, you

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.600
 know, beautiful glass everywhere, spiral staggers.

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:09.600
 It's the latest helmet.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:15.160
 It's built around a slowly growing corn of poo.

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:20.000
 According to my memory of this fact, the Burj Khalifa is not 100% dissimilar to that.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.280
 In that, there's no sewage underneath it.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.040
 And so the poo collects at the bottom of the building.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:30.440
 And every day at the end of the day, trucks have to take the poo and the wee out away

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.000
 from the building and go to a dumping ground and put it there.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.880
 So like living on a canal boat, you've got to collect it and then deposit it.

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:42.160
 Are you saying that the tallest building in the world doesn't have foundations?

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.320
 It does have foundations, but it's built on a raft, I think.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:48.000
 I thought it was built on sand.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 Shifting sand.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 Yeah.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 But that's why they had to put it on a raft.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.960
 Because you can't build foundations that deep in sand because it shifts.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:56.960
 Right.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.800
 But you wouldn't want to have your poo to be landing on the raft?

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.800
 No.

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.800
 No.

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.800
 But I didn't know that thing about that.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.960
 Because like I said, it did go there and I read all of the boards to see if there were

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.080
 interesting facts and they didn't say anything about poo, are we?

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.080
 Yeah.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.280
 I can imagine they wouldn't have the top of the bird to be like, we have a bunch of

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:18.180
 lackeys at the bottom who have to carry your shit away every day, but it's a great building.

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:22.980
 It's also the location and this brings two things we were talking about earlier of Grafito

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:27.200
 that was put there by Star of Mission Impossible during a Mission Impossible shoot.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.200
 Oh, did Tom Cruise leave a...

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.200
 Supposedly.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.120
 So you've seen all the movies, he scales the building at some point, doesn't he?

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.120
 Mission Impossible 4.

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.120
 Mission Impossible 4.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.120
 Yeah.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.400
 And then is there a big sandstorm that comes in?

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.400
 It certainly is.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.400
 Right.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.200
 So, and he turns around and he's like, there's a massive ship in my face.

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.280
 It's a very scary moment.

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.000
 But no, apparently he...

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 This is the story.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.160
 He wrote Katie Holmes' name.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.920
 He was maritor at the time and then they found out and they had to get to the top of the

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.580
 building and scrub it out.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:56.580
 No more Grafito.

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:57.580
 Wow.

00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:58.580
 That's good.

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:00.580
 Didn't know that, boy.

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.080
 Here's another one.

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.080
 Roland Pierce, right?

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:06.020
 Just listening to your later steps, some good Titanic stuff there, okay.

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.160
 In fact, I heard a few years ago.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.160
 Don't quote me on this.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.160
 Oh, no.

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.160
 Sorry.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.160
 Well, we're doing it now.

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.540
 But there were a couple of ways they could have rescued every single passenger, right?

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.040
 Number one, engines in full reverse for as long as possible would have brought the ship

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:24.080
 closer to the Carpathia rescue ship.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:31.280
 Number two, tie the Titanic to the iceberg, use the onboard cranes or planks or whatever

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:34.280
 to load all the passengers onto the berg.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.280
 Wait there for rescue.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.200
 I think they were quite far past.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:39.480
 I feel like that would have been hard as well.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.480
 Yeah.

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:41.480
 I don't know if that's realistic.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.960
 Are these facts or are these guys kind of sort of...

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.960
 I've been to...

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:45.960
 Just a claim, I think.

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:50.200
 I went to a lake in Iceland that has icebergs on it.

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:54.160
 They're carving from the glacier and then they come into the lake and it's kind of attached

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:57.720
 to the sea and they flip a lot icebergs.

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:02.080
 Yeah, so I reckon if loads of people were on it, it might just flip over and then you're

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.080
 all buggered.

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.080
 Yeah.

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.440
 That's probably why they didn't do it.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.440
 Yeah.

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.600
 Also, I don't know if it's the Carpathia or however it's pronounced, it was one of the

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:16.240
 ships didn't go to rescue the Titanic because it looked bigger than it should have.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.240
 What?

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.240
 You took it.

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.240
 A lot of weird...

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:23.440
 Because obviously of how cold it was, there was a lot of atmospheric illusions that were

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:28.800
 going on and there was one ship that was told it's a thousand metres away and it's this

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:33.240
 long, but they saw a ship that was much closer and a different size and they went, "Can't

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:36.200
 be that ship, that must be another ship, so we need to keep looking for the Titanic."

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:37.200
 I have heard that.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.200
 Yes.

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.200
 Yeah, this is a real thing.

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.200
 It's a real thing.

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.280
 But there's another theory recently that they didn't see the iceberg because of, again,

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.200
 atmospheric mucking about and that actually it wasn't just that it was far away and hard

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.040
 to see the iceberg, it was that literally it would have been impossible to see.

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.200
 Yeah, everything was a fog, they call it a fog.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.840
 Does this guy got any facts?

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.840
 No.

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:59.560
 Well, let's have a suggestion from Tony Frost of an invention because we discuss inventions.

00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.520
 Have you heard James of the Euro Club?

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.520
 Have I heard of it?

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:03.520
 Yeah.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.520
 What is this, James specific?

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.520
 It is.

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.520
 Oh, it's golf.

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:07.520
 It's golf.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.520
 Oh, right, I see.

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:09.520
 Have you heard of the Euro Club?

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.520
 I don't think so.

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.520
 Well, let me read out the little brief for you.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.520
 On the golf course, I need some urgent relief in 2010.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.120
 Oh, yes, I've heard of it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.120
 We've done this, haven't we, on the show?

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.120
 Have we?

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:19.120
 Have we?

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.120
 Yeah, unless it was cut.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.120
 Just go into the golf club but you sit your willy in and take your week.

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:26.240
 Well, it is a golf club but it is hollow and it does allow you to discreetly urinate into

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.240
 it.

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.680
 And then it says a fabric privacy shield will have observers thinking you're just taking

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.680
 a practice swing.

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:36.440
 I doubt that because we were trying to work out when we spoke about it whether or not

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:41.560
 you would gain an advantage from a heavier golf club off the back of urine being inside

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.560
 it.

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.560
 Because it would change a lot.

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.200
 And if you're a top pro, you probably can't use this one.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.200
 No, you wouldn't be able to.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:51.560
 And also, my experience is that men in particular don't have much trouble finding somewhere

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:53.080
 to urinate on golf courses.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.080
 Right.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.200
 And this sounds quite difficult for a woman to, yeah.

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.200
 Yes.

00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.200
 Well, the thing is men pee in jets.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.200
 Well, no.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.200
 It depends what age golf.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.200
 And women pee in droplets.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.200
 Oh, yes.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.200
 All right.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.200
 Here's one last one.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.200
 Yeah.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.200
 From David McLaren.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:11.840
 The winner of the 1970 Australian National Sheepdog Trial was Bob Ross, while no relation

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:12.840
 to the painter.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:13.840
 What?

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:14.840
 Bob Ross.

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.840
 The dog called Bob Ross.

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:16.840
 What painter?

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:21.440
 He was a famous painter who was on American TV loads, I think in the 1970s.

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:22.440
 Oh, my God.

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.440
 He was still in America.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.440
 Yeah.

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.440
 I know who you mean.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.440
 I know who you mean.

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.880
 While no relation to the painter, Bob Ross, the dog was also known to have a soft, gentle

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.880
 voice.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:33.040
 You said that one for last.

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.840
 That's our closer.

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:41.280
 PS, I went this year and the winning dog gets their portrait painted.

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.280
 That's great.

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:43.280
 Yeah.

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.280
 Thank you.

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.280
 What's your name, McLaren?

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.280
 David McLaren.

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:47.280
 That's a...

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.280
 I think that's...

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:53.280
 I really like that one.

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:57.880
 OK, that's it.

00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.640
 That's all of your facts.

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:02.560
 Just a nice little twist on the formula.

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:03.720

00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:58.840
 than yourself.

00:54:58.840 --> 00:54:59.960
 And I think that's the real thing about clubfish.

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.960
 Yeah.

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:01.960
 Nothing against you in person.

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:02.960
 No.

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.960
 You might be great.

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.280
 You're probably having a wonderful and fulfilled life, but you could be leading a more fulfilled

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.560
 life, if you know what I'm saying.

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.560
 So, you know.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:12.480
 So, anyway, go there for that, NoSuchThingAsFish.com.

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.480
 That's it from us.

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:17.000

 We'll see you then.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 Goodbye.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 Thanks.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 Bye.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 Bye.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 Bye.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 Bye.
