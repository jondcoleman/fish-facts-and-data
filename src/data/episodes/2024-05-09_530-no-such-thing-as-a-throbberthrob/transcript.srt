00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
 [Music]

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,500
 Hi everybody, Andy and James here with an announcement.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,300
 Yes, absolutely. It's a very exciting announcement for people who like going to no-search-things-of-fish

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,660
 tour shows live. Oh, I think I might have given it away.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,480
 James, you fool! We were saving it for three minutes into the announcement, but James is right. We're going on tour!

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:32,220
 Right, so if you live in a large city in the UK or Ireland or some places on mainland Europe,

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:40,120
 or excitingly in Australia or New Zealand, then we may well be coming to a place near you quite soon.

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:46,640
 That's right. It's a world tour if you have a very limited definition of what the world is.

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,000
 And it's basically like an earth sandwich tour. We're doing this antipode and we're doing the other antipode.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,380
 And it's going to be great. It's going to be between September and November. We should say that.

11
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:04,820
 It's months of touring. Yes, and the reason that we're telling you today is that tickets are going to be on sale in one week's time.

12
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,980
 Yes. In seven days, you must go to no-search-things-of-fish.com/live

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:17,060
 and all the details of our tour will be there and you'll be able to snaffle up those best seats in the house.

14
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:25,660
 The only way to get tickets faster is if you're a member of Club Fish when you will receive bonus instructions in your forthcoming bit of extra material.

15
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:32,120
 What a great thing Club Fish sounds like. That's what I say. Anyway, we're going on tour around the world. It's going to be amazing.

16
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,560
 The other two will be there as well. It's not just me and James doing a world tour. It would be good.

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,400
 Yeah, that would be great. And the great thing about going to Club Fish is not only do you get early access to tickets,

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,360
 but you get a much cleaner and more clear announcement than this. Oh, yeah. Probably Anna and Dan will do it and it will be so professional.

19
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,220
 Oh, yeah. That's nice. Like, yeah.

20
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:58,240
 And so, yes, that is our news. We are going on tour around the world to both antipodes.

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:10,000
 It's going to be a whole lot of fun and you guys can get tickets to come and see us by going to no-search-things-of-fish.com/live any time after Friday, the 17th of May.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 - On with the show! - On with the podcast. That was slick, Andy. I reckon.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 That was very slick. Very slick.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No-Search-Things-of-Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI Offices in Covent Garden.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray and I'm sitting here, joined by Anna Tijinski, James Harkin and Dan Schreiber.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 But wait, Dan's normally the host. What's going on? It's all on topsy-turvy.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Don't worry, everybody. It's an audience fact special. Yay!

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Hooray.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And it's because we have an inbox, podcast@qr.com, and people send in all sorts of questions, comments, complaints, insults, praise sometimes.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And also a lot of facts. And the facts are so good that we thought we'd just take a show to go through some of the best ones.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Starting with audience fact section number one, and that is you, James.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Yes, so thank you, Andrew. You have sent me a big pile of audience facts.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 So here's the first one that you sent me.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Karo Durken sent it, and she, he, they have an astrophysics, PhD, and they say that the more massive a white dwarf becomes, the smaller it gets.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 [Sigh]

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Huh?

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Riddle me this.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 What?

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Made a sting for riddle me this.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Yeah.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Really, I'll be honest, probably you're only gonna get this if you also have an astrophysics, PhD.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Oh.

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 It's not really something you can guess.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 We're off the box with an unbelievably hard fact to understand.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Yeah, it's like you've sent me these on purpose, I think.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I thought, who knows physics? And Dan's out of office was on, so.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Is that why I've got all the Bigfoot facts in my watch?

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 That's right, they're meant for Dan's, yeah, yeah, yeah.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 So in normal stars, you have fusion happening at the core.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So you're getting elements turning into other elements and making energy.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 But in white dwarfs, that doesn't happen.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And so if you just put stuff into it, then there's nothing to stop gravity from just squishing them smaller and smaller and smaller.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Got more massive.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 More massive?

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 More, 'cause they've got more mass.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Absolutely.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So it doesn't just, did you say it looks smaller? Was that the way it's put in the fact?

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 It's not only looks smaller, it is smaller.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 It is smaller.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 But it's heavier.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 But it's heavier, it's more massive.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Gotta be careful with words like heavy, haven't you?

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 You never know.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Yeah, you can't do that.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 You never know if you're gonna fly that.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 There are physicists waiting around every corner, ready to jump out and beat you up.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And it's actually not heavier, it's more massive.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 I get that a lot.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I just want 100 grams of gob stoppers.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 You know how I spend my pocket money, that's great.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Caro goes on, this one is bonkers in my opinion.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 After a certain distance, the further away something is from Earth, the bigger it looks.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Okay.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 So Dan, you see that cow out of the window, they look small.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 That's actually far away.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 But it looks small because it's further away.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 But if you take it far enough away, it'll start to get bigger.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Is that because it's coming around the back?

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 It's coming towards you again.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Someone's left the gate open.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Well, I have this, I've not said this to you guys before,

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 but I have this thing outside my house where when I turn to the left,

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 I can see the sea front and I can see ships and they're massive.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 But then when I walk down to the edge of the cliff, they are further away.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 But that's just because they've moved away from me.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 No, no, no, it's a genuine, it's a horizon effect, it's called.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 What could you think of from the top of a cliff versus the bottom?

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Oh, I see, yeah, that makes sense.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 But they're huge and then you go down and they're literally,

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 sometimes they feel twice the distance and twice the size.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And you're sure you're not looking at the dinghies that are on the sea front.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 That's not it.

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Someone's peddling them.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 I didn't know that was a thing, that's really interesting.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 I don't understand it, it's magic, I don't get it.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Right.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 But I've been told by people like Levenskara, it's a real thing.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 That's cool.

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 He knows his ship.

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 So the thing is with galaxies, if you go far enough away,

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 you're looking at something that was sending out its light quite near the start of the universe.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 The whole of the universe was quite small in those days.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 So if you're looking at something in the sky, if you're an astronomer,

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 you're working out how much of the sky it's using up.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 But these things that are way, way further away are using up more of the sky

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 because actually space itself was smaller.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 That's incredible.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 That's so confusing.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 I was speaking to an astrophysics student recently who said,

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 "There are some things in the sky that appear in three different places."

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Depending on, I can't remember what it was depending on.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Depending on what time of day it is in the suns, it's in the east now.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 And how much you've had to drink as well, that's the other factor.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 They're baffling these facts, they're so baffling.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 The reason they messed it up for us is when scientists decided about 100 years ago

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 that space and time are sort of the same but sort of different.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 So the thing you're looking at is longer ago.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 You're talking about Einstein here?

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 He screwed up for everyone, didn't he? He made it a bit of a headfuck.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Yeah, well things were certainly easier when it was just,

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 "How long does it take this apple to fall out of the tree and land on my head?"

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Exactly.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 It certainly was. I feel like we started quite difficult.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Yeah, can you give us an easy one?

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Andrew Lillia says, "Sacadas pee in jets, not droplets."

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 That's nice.

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 What does that mean?

128
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Well, imagine you're urinating.

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 I pee in the jet, don't I?

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I can't say for sure, but as a human, probably.

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 It depends how much you've had to drink, that's the thing.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Old men pee in droplets, I've heard.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 So the thing is that most insects feed on sap.

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 But cicadas drink so much sap that peeing in droplets doesn't work.

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And so they have to pee out in streams because they've just got so much of this stuff inside them.

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Oh my goodness.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 You just need to get rid of it.

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 So it becomes more energy effective to pee in a stream than in drops.

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And cicadas are actually the smallest animals that pee in streams.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Are they?

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Yeah.

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Good on them.

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 What a niche record for them to have.

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I think they're proud of that.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 And it's been discovered by scientists who are looking into it using it.

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 I'm guessing for a big military application somehow.

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Yep, that's absolutely right.

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 This would be used in the next war.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 No, it's like in any science, you learn something and you find the applications later, don't you?

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Yeah.

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Just thinking of cicada's penises or other genitals.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 It's reminded me of a phrase I learned just the other day, which is a bee's dick.

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Have you heard that?

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Is it like the bee's knees only a bit?

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 No, it's a unit to describe a very small distance.

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 So you would say it's an Australian term.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Oh, you miss crashing into the truck by a bee's dick?

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Of course it's an Australian term.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Of course it is so Aussie.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Do we know, I'm sure we've mentioned on the show at some point,

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 but do we know if that's a fair comparison?

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Do bees have proportionally small penises?

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 I think regardless, they are small.

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And so if it's the size of a bee's dick, that's an incredibly tiny distance.

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 I could just see bees objecting to that on proportion grounds.

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Fair do.

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Fair do.

168
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Most Australian thing you ever said.

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Carl Hepocoskey writes about a guy called Dave Bresnahan,

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 who was a minor league baseball player,

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 and he used a peeled potato in the sport.

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And what he would do is he would grab the potato and throw it.

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 And so the opponent thought that he was throwing the ball,

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 but actually he kept the ball concealed about his person.

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 And in baseball, one way to get someone out is if you tag them with the ball

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 when they're between bases.

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And the other person thought, well, he can't possibly do that

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 because he's just thrown it.

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 And he's like, aha, that was a potato that I threw.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Classic move.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 So he wasn't allowed to do that.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Well, the interesting thing is I don't think it was against the rules,

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 but it was against the spirit of the rules.

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I think that's fair.

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 I do think that's fair.

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 I think there was a thing in cricket once where W.G. Grace

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 was maybe the most famous cricketer of, maybe of all time,

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 certainly the 19th century.

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 He was a legend.

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 I think he caught the ball in his jumper when he was batting

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 and then just kept running around with the ball on him

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 or about his person.

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 It wasn't in his beard, but he did have a great big beard.

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 I can't remember for sure.

195
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 But basically he was just running back and forth,

196
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 scoring lots of runs because he was the ball at that moment.

197
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 But then if someone grabbed him.

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Exactly.

199
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 He hadn't touched the ground.

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Yeah, the ball hadn't touched the ground.

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Oh, that's a good boy.

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 He could be caught out.

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 So maybe you just ended up running like just elsewhere.

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Yeah, you ran over the boundary line in the end and got six.

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Got six, yeah.

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 It's a lot like in the sports book, in fact,

207
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 which you and I have recently written, James.

208
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Oh, yeah.

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 What was that?

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 It's just to remind us, Colt again.

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 It's called a load of old balls, actually.

212
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 That's what the paperback's called, but it's not available yet.

213
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 It's coming out soon.

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 But it's not available yet.

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 This is going to go out before that.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 So it's called everything to play for, actually.

217
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Oh, OK.

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Yeah.

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Actually, it's not part of the title.

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 It's not a Richard Curtis-esque run.

221
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 No, it's called everything to play for, full stop.

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And we do mention there that the Carlisle Indians

223
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 were an American football team at the turn of the 20th century.

224
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And they had pictures of football sown into all of their jerseys

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 so that no one on the opposing team knew which one was the actual ball.

226
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And we portrayed that as quite an ingenious move.

227
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 So I think I'm probably the potato.

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 OK, yeah, yeah.

229
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Baseball, they do do this all the time.

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 What you need is for whoever's standing on base,

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 let's say you're on second base, while the picture is about to throw--

232
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Does that mean you're snugging the picture?

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Yeah.

234
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 No, it means you're touching him downstairs, but on the surface.

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 OK.

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 So pitch is about to pitch towards the batter.

237
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 In that time, the person who is on second base

238
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 can walk forward away from the pad on the ground, right?

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 So the deal is, if the ball touches you and you're not with a foot on a pad,

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 then you can be out, right?

241
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 So that's when they use the trick.

242
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 So they sometimes have weird beanbags in baseball,

243
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 and I don't know the specific use,

244
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 but that's often been used as a decoy baseball as well.

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Really?

246
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 So you would do a huddle, and then you'd come out of the huddle,

247
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 and the person marking the base would have the ball in their hand,

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 but the picture would look as if they had the ball,

249
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 but it was this beanbag.

250
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I think this is all a bit unsportsmanlike.

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 I don't have to say--

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 It's like playing football,

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 but then if you had one giant toe on your foot,

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 and then you sort of drew--

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Drew Dodette.

256
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Drew-- I mean, Hentakins and Hacksmiths all over here.

257
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Or if we're playing ice hockey,

259
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 and I secretly slice up a black pudding before the match,

260
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 and then at some point, I release all the slices.

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 You know, it's mayhem.

262
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Does it count if I score with a black pudding slice?

263
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 It does not.

264
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Yeah, that's pretty clear, isn't it?

265
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 I don't think anything's clear in this new world of shadow sport

266
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 that we've been introduced to.

267
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 You know why they use pucks in ice hockey?

268
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Because they didn't originally--

269
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Did they start with balls?

270
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Yeah, because it was based on an old sport that had balls.

271
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Is it because--

272
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Oh, because they wouldn't snowball.

273
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 They wouldn't--

274
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 If they were rolling, they would gather so many avalanches.

275
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 I'll be honest, if you're playing ice hockey on the snow,

276
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 that's probably the least of your problems.

277
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 They're balls going nowhere.

278
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Yeah.

279
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 What happens to a ball when you hit it really hard on ice?

280
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 It rolls, it goes up, slides.

281
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 That's it, isn't it, James?

282
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Yeah, yeah, it goes up.

283
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 It's so they didn't go up.

284
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Make it safer, really,

285
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 but it meant it stayed down on the ice the whole time.

286
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Pucks slide.

287
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 The original way they made one was by taking a rubber ball

288
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 and cutting off the top and the bottom

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 so that it was a flat disc.

290
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Really?

291
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Right.

292
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Just a heads-up, I'm pretty sure my description scenario

293
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 of that whole thing with the beanbag was from the movie

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Rookie of the Year,

295
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 which is a fantastic movie, regardless,

296
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 but that was a tactic used in that when Henry's arm

297
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 suddenly doesn't have the force any more.

298
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Great movie, check it out.

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 I think I've seen that.

300
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 It's awesome.

301
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Is it about a kid who gets a magic arm to play baseball?

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

303
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Because I can't believe I've seen one of your weird awful films.

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 He breaks his arm and they, in the cast,

305
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 tightens it too much and has the greatest movie line

306
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 where they take the cast off and they discover his big arm

307
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 and it slaps the doctor's nose and he goes,

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 "Funky butt-loving."

309
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 The finest line.

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 So he says what?

311
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 "Funky butt-loving."

312
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Wow.

313
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Why have you never used that on the show?

314
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 We use it at home now.

315
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 We watched it the other day.

316
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 He does say it, but I always bleep it out because it's spelf.

317
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Doesn't he, he throws a ball through someone else's hand.

318
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 He gets such a powerful throwing arm that it just leaves

319
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 a sort of comedy cut-out hole.

320
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And I thought of that years later.

321
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 I thought of that years later.

322
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 I thought that's actually an incredibly upsetting thing.

323
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And we don't stay with that character who's just had a ball

324
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 thrown through his body.

325
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Does that not happen?

326
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 No, it doesn't.

327
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Maybe it's through his glove.

328
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 It's through his glove, I think.

329
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 But if you go through the middle of the club,

330
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 you're also going through the middle of that.

331
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 It looks like he's going to lose at least a couple of fingers

332
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 and it just is glossed over.

333
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 No, that might be from the movie Ed,

334
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 which stars Matt LeBlanc, who brings a...

335
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Are there two separate films about magic baseball fans?

336
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Yeah, well, he brings a monkey and a chimp as a player on the team.

337
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 That was a height of friends.

338
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 It's gone lowbrow since that physics chat, hasn't it?

339
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Yeah.

340
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 OK, it's time for facts.

341
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Facts number two, I guess.

342
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Lovely.

343
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Let's say Anna, what have you got?

344
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 I've got one from Gwen Wilkie.

345
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Oh, yeah.

346
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 And this is incredible.

347
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 I didn't know about this.

348
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 She's written in about industrial musicals.

349
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Have you ever talked about these?

350
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 I've not heard of that.

351
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 I think so.

352
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 They are big-budget musical theatre productions,

353
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 massively expensive, that were put on entirely in private

354
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 by big capitalist corporations in the middle of the 20th century.

355
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And she actually cited a podcast called 20,000 Hertz,

356
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 which I might listen to, which looks like it's a podcast

357
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 about really interesting sounds, lots of interesting sounds.

358
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Anyway, between, I think, sort of the 1940s to the 1980s,

359
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 companies like Ford and General Electric and Coca-Cola

360
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 put on Broadway-style productions,

361
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 but just to their employees as a sort of team bonding experience.

362
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And they were, I was looking into this a bit more.

363
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 There was one in 1957, which was the Chevrolet musical,

364
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 and it cost six times the amount it took to put

365
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 My Fair Lady onto the stage that same year.

366
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And this is just a musical that's been shown to Chevrolet employees

367
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 somewhere in order to make them feel like

368
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 they're part of a big old company.

369
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 I can see that that's a good thing,

370
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 but could you not just take them bowling?

371
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Take them to see My Fair Lady at a sixth of the price.

372
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 It would be less expensive, but it doesn't make you feel

373
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 like you're part of such a big operation.

374
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 There were shows like The Bathrooms Are Coming,

375
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 which was a 1969 show put on by American Standard Plumbers.

376
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 There was Diesel Dazzle by General Motors in 1966.

377
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 That one is quite good.

378
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 It's alright, isn't it?

379
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Worth making a big budget musical out of it.

380
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 So it seemed to start when I looked further into it

381
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 in the early 20th century, when companies would have these songs

382
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 that were written and performed in-house,

383
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 just individual songs for them.

384
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 So like the Larkin Soap Company released its own songbook

385
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 of songs they'd written.

386
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Oh, as basically team-building exercises.

387
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Again, team-building, and they'd get together and sing,

388
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 they'd get a choir in, they'd get a little orchestra.

389
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 I like this.

390
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 I think maybe we should write our own musical.

391
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Shall we?

392
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Yeah.

393
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And then drain QI's budget.

394
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Only allow our colleagues to listen to it.

395
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Yes.

396
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Yes.

397
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Okay.

398
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 I think probably no one else would want to.

399
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 In fact, I'd be surprised if our colleagues

400
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 sat around until the end.

401
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Playing all the roles in this musical as well.

402
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I guess so.

403
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 I think we'll have to.

404
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Yeah, yeah.

405
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 But you can do the old like paint half of your face,

406
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 you know, as Dr. Dolittle and not Dr. Dolittle.

407
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Hamlet.

408
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Yeah.

409
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Henry Dolittle.

410
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Henry Dolittle.

411
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Eliza Dolittle.

412
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Oh, Eliza Dolittle.

413
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Sorry.

414
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 And Henry, whatever it's called.

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Higgins.

416
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Yeah.

417
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Unless it was Dr. Dolittle, the musical.

418
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 We could put that on.

419
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Based on the Eddie Murphy movie.

420
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 I love, and that's crying out for a musical, I think.

421
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Okay.

422
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Yeah.

423
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I think.

424
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 There was a Dr. Dolittle.

425
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 The Dr. Dolittle movie had songs in it.

426
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 The Rex Harrison one.

427
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 He talks to the animals.

428
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Yeah.

429
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Yes, that was it.

430
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Absolutely was.

431
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Whatever it facts we've ever done on the show.

432
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I think it was yours, Andy.

433
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Rex Harrison, the giraffe had the movie.

434
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Oh, yeah.

435
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Filming was stopped because it accidentally stood on its penis.

436
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 That's right.

437
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 The giraffe stood on its own penis.

438
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Yeah.

439
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

440
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 It feels like I wish I was a bee.

441
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Anyway, yeah, amazing fact there from Gwen Wilkie.

442
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I have another fact.

443
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 This is from Michela or Michela Comperi.

444
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 And this is that the tuba part for Antonin Dvorak's New World Symphony is very bad.

445
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 That's not the end of the fact.

446
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 What?

447
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Is it bad?

448
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Well, it's very bad in that it's extremely short.

449
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 So it's a very long symphony.

450
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 It's like 40 minute symphony.

451
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 The tuba part is just 14 notes.

452
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 It's seven notes at the start of one of the movements.

453
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Oh, no.

454
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Seven notes at the end.

455
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Okay.

456
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Oh, my God.

457
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 So it, I don't know if you guys have been in orchestras and stuff, but you're basically

458
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 for the entire rest of the piece just going one, two, three, four.

459
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Oh, no.

460
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Two, two, three, four.

461
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Exactly.

462
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Three, two, three, four.

463
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Seven hundred and sixty-five, two, three, four.

464
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Yeah.

465
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 That's absolutely correct.

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Why might he have done this?

467
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 This could be guessable.

468
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 The composer?

469
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Yeah, Dvorak.

470
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Because he was in love with the tuba player and wanted...

471
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Exactly the opposite answer.

472
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Hated the tuba player.

473
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Hated the tuba player.

474
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Sorry.

475
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 The clue of the opposite.

476
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 No, I understand that.

477
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 But you guided Dan to the round.

478
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 So he hated the tuba player specifically because he thought he was having an affair with his

479
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 wife.

480
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And they were about to go on tour, I think, with this, you know, this new piece he'd written.

481
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 The tuba player was getting quite close to his wife.

482
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And he thought, "I'm going to have to take this tuba player away with me."

483
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 So he quickly shoved in 14 notes of tuba as a lovely punishment for this guy.

484
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 That's amazing.

485
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And dragging him away from his wife.

486
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 I couldn't find much firsthand evidence of it online, although it is repeated by conductors

487
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 and a lot.

488
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 It's a great idea.

489
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 It is.

490
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 But it is a bizarre quirk.

491
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 You get tuba players the world over talking about it, saying, "Why on earth has he forced

492
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 us to sit through this 40 minutes for the sake of seven notes at one end and seven notes

493
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 at the other?"

494
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 And you can't be on your phone, can you, when you're in the orchestra and the audience is

495
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 all there.

496
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 You can't just go on and play Snake for 40 minutes.

497
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Can you?

498
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 I don't know.

499
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Maybe it was changing.

500
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 I like to think your head, though, was like, "You can't be on your phone."

501
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 You're like, "Dvorak wouldn't have had iPhones."

502
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Maybe he had a Nokia 3310.

503
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 I'll say play Snake.

504
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 I genuinely couldn't think of anything more modern to be doing on my phone.

505
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 That New World Symphony is from the Hovis adverts, isn't it?

506
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 It's not from the Hovis adverts.

507
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 It's not.

508
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 That's wonderful that I've got the idea.

509
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 It was in love with a Lady Baker.

510
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 No, that little boy who walks up the street with his bike, he was having an affair with

511
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 his wife.

512
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Oh.

513
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Oh.

514
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 That one.

515
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 No, that's Coronation Street.

516
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 I think he goes, "Sorry."

517
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 And that's Puccini.

518
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Yes.

519
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 I think he goes, "Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo."

520
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Oh, yeah.

521
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Sorry.

522
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I've got it here.

523
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 A lovely piece of music, I'm sorry.

524
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 It is good.

525
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 It's very nice.

526
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 It's Tuba Controversial.

527
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Sibelius refused to write for the Tuba after what his Tuba player turned up drunk.

528
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 He just completely mangled the part and Sibelius went, "Sod this."

529
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 He's punishing all Tuba players with a loss of income.

530
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 So is it more as well that you travel as a band?

531
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Is this like, you would have your unit that would do all your tours, all your, you know,

532
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 it's the same supporting band?

533
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 It's an orchestra, isn't it?

534
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Yeah, orchestra.

535
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Yeah.

536
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 But as you know, Dan, why do orchestra players, you know, need music?

537
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I bet the Tuba player still has the sheet music up there to know when they've got to

538
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 play.

539
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Like, no memories.

540
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 They're no springsteens, are they?

541
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Oh, dear.

542
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I don't think I got that reference.

543
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 That's a very deep cut for us.

544
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Oh, you weren't here.

545
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 When you're on that leave for Bassoon Gate, yeah.

546
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Dan claimed that, what was the claim you made that it was a joke, which then became serious

547
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 as I got angrier about the response to it.

548
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Oh, yeah.

549
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 I know the vibe.

550
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 It was basically that if you're in U2, you can learn all the songs easy.

551
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 You don't need sheet music.

552
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 So why does a bassoon player in an orchestra need sheet music?

553
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 We were talking about this amazing, no, you were on the show.

554
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 You brought the fact in.

555
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 You were about the first female conductor and she took all the sheet music away from her.

556
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Yeah, that was me.

557
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Yeah.

558
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,540
 And I was just saying, isn't that amazing that you just shut down as an orchestra as soon

559
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,000
 as the music's gone, the sheet music.

560
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Christ, I blanked that out.

561
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 You weren't here for the fallout.

562
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 You weren't here for every episode of Drop As A Line for the subsequent year.

563
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Right.

564
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 We had a lot of bassoon player correspondence.

565
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Have we?

566
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 I think we've heard from every bassoonist on the planet.

567
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 That was great.

568
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 That's great.

569
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 I'm so happy.

570
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 I missed that.

571
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Actually, there is a reference to a show that I did miss.

572
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 This is from Theo Tamashiro Harris, who said that on the most recent episode, which is

573
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 no longer the most recent, Olga Koch talked about French kissing in Swedish tables.

574
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 You guys remember her talking about that?

575
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 No, yeah.

576
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 I think it'll be about the fact that French kissing is called French kissing.

577
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 It was called Swedish Tables.

578
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 She was talking about an Irish goodbye or an English goodbye.

579
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 That's what you don't say goodbye to anyone.

580
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 You just walk off.

581
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 There you go.

582
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And this person said, they reminded that in Spanish, the word for roller coaster is Russian

583
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Mountain.

584
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,320
 I didn't know that was what it was in Spanish, but I think we probably mentioned because

585
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,000
 Russian Mountains were the original roller coaster, right?

586
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Yeah.

587
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Big ice slides that you used to go.

588
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Yeah.

589
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Oh, so you would just push people down and that would be the ride.

590
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Yeah.

591
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 It's like a roller coaster, but it's a big sort of like a ski jump.

592
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Yeah, right.

593
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Wow.

594
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And this is 17th century, I think.

595
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 18th century.

596
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 And then this person said that in the course of researching this, which I like because

597
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,500
 they obviously just went quite deep.

598
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:58,000
 They found out that the Russian word for roller coaster is American Hill, which is quite cool.

599
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Yeah.

600
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 That's pretty cool.

601
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 How tall would these be?

602
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Do you know?

603
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 21 meters is the height that I'm saying.

604
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 That's very tall.

605
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 That's high.

606
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Yeah.

607
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 It depends on the gradient of the slope though, doesn't it?

608
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Yeah, that's true.

609
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Yeah.

610
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 That could be terrifying or it could be incredibly dull.

611
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 It's so boring.

612
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 It's just 200 meters long and who cares?

613
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 It gives another one.

614
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Okay.

615
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Here's another good one that I didn't know about and should have gone and asked sports

616
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 book that this is from Alan Dimmock.

617
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 What's that cop though?

618
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Everything to play for.

619
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,660
 Alan Dimmock says that the England captain, he means the rugby England captain, is meant

620
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,000
 to write a letter every year asking rugby schools permission to wear white.

621
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Really?

622
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 I didn't know that.

623
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It's meant to.

624
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 So is it still held up?

625
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Apparently the rule faded in early 2000.

626
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 That's a long time to keep it going.

627
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I mean, that's what 100 years of actually doing that every year.

628
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Yeah, quite irresponsible to let it lapse actually.

629
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Yeah.

630
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 I think Martin Johnson didn't know how to write.

631
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Wow.

632
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 That's such a deep, that's such a specific slam that I don't know.

633
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 You know what?

634
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 I'm kind of guessing that that was his name.

635
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 I'm not even sure because I don't really follow up Union.

636
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 I think it was.

637
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 It is Martin Johnson and actually you might be right because he, Martin Johnson, remember

638
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 the days when you would call.

639
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 So he made phone calls to rugby school.

640
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 I'm really sorry, Martin Johnson.

641
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 It was like, it was just a natural joke and yours was the first name that came into my

642
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 head.

643
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Because you're a rugby player.

644
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 You're a lot bigger than me.

645
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Yeah.

646
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 I mean, at least Dan had the sense to pick on bassoon players.

647
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Oh no, we're going to email some gigantic bassoon players now.

648
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 The England rugby team orchestra is going to get in contact.

649
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Okay.

650
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Well, that's great.

651
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 It's one more amazing one.

652
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 This is from Robin who says that the earliest known picture of Jesus depicts him as a donkey.

653
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 No.

654
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Yeah.

655
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Wait, but no, he got a donkey to Jerusalem.

656
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Yeah.

657
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 That's a misconception.

658
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 It was the donkey.

659
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 That is a good, that's a great thing.

660
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 It's good.

661
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 It's not quite true actually.

662
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 I think it was like, was it like graffiti kind of thing?

663
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 It absolutely was.

664
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Grafito, the Alexa Menos Grafito in Rome and it was actually an insulting thing.

665
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 But this is the earliest picture we have.

666
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And it was scratched onto a wall in Rome in the second century.

667
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Grafito, I'm sorry.

668
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 I know.

669
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 I'm sorry, but like the council, I'm not going to send anyone if you complain about a grafito.

670
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And rightly so.

671
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Well, there's a Banksy Grafito quite near my house.

672
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 There you go.

673
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Yeah.

674
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 I 100% said to my wife, should we go and see the grafito?

675
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Of course you did.

676
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 She refused.

677
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Yeah, it was scratched into a wall and underneath it, it said something like in Latin, obviously,

678
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 you know, here is the person that Alexa Menos worships and it shows them on worshipping

679
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 a donkey being crucified.

680
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Oh, I've seen that.

681
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Yes.

682
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 You've seen it.

683
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Or I've seen someone do a reproduction of it if it doesn't exist anymore.

684
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Can I give you a Jesus fact while we're here, which I learned this morning.

685
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 You know, they have the Apocrypha.

686
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 So these are like in the Gospels.

687
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 There's Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, but actually loads of other Gospels were written

688
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 and they didn't make it into the final Bible.

689
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 They didn't make the edit.

690
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 They didn't make the edit.

691
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 The publisher really hacked.

692
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 The Virgin Mary's vagina makes your hand wither if you touch it.

693
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Oh, gosh, who's touching it?

694
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 The midwife.

695
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Oh, no.

696
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Yeah, Salome the midwife.

697
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 But that's very, is it a punishment?

698
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Yeah, basically because she was a virgin, the Salome the midwife is like, well, I'm going

699
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 to check if you're a virgin and did whatever gynecologists in the first century AD did in

700
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 those situations.

701
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And it was such a bad thing that her arm withered away.

702
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 And actually it grew back when she touched the baby Jesus.

703
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Oh, did it?

704
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 Wow.

705
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 But hang on, that's not fair, isn't it?

706
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Isn't it meant to protect the Virgin Mary from people with sort of bad intentions towards her?

707
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Oh, you think it was like, oh, I see.

708
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Sort of defence mechanism, basically.

709
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 It's sort of like no wonder she's a virgin if that's what happens to you, if you start

710
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 trying to have sex with her.

711
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 You'd have to really love her, wouldn't you?

712
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 No, no, it's not with her, darling.

713
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 It's just cold.

714
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Yeah.

715
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 That's crazy.

716
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 How can we don't see that as part of the birth depiction of Jesus where they're all happy,

717
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 there's all the three wise men and there's just a screaming midwife with a melting hand

718
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 like she's in Raiders of the Lost Ark at the end.

719
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Where's that scene?

720
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 I think you've answered your own question because the primary schools are not going to

721
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 go for it, are they?

722
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Yeah, I guess so.

723
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 But I've been cast and none of them have been played.

724
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 OK, it's time for our next facts, and those come from, or should I say via, Downtriver.

725
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Yep, so the first fact, this was sent in by Sarah Gaffin and her son, Harry Gaffin.

726
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 And the fact is, the great-grandfather of the actor who plays Spock was literally a son of Vulcan.

727
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Oh, right.

728
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 It feels like we're in Riddle Corner now.

729
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 This is awesome.

730
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 OK, so Leonard Nimoy?

731
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Not Leonard Nimoy.

732
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Oh, well, I thought I was getting in with an easy point.

733
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 That's a bit of Star Trek knowledge.

734
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 So in the remake movies of Star Trek, Spock was played by Zachary Quinto.

735
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Zachary Quinto did in America, I think, I don't know how long it's been there.

736
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 It feels like it's quite recent, but who do you think you are as now in America?

737
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 And one of the revelations that they found out is that his great-grandfather, who's called P.J.

738
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 McGardy, and he was very active in a thing called the Amalgamated Association of Iron

739
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 and Steel Workers, but they were originally known as the Sons of Vulcan.

740
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Oh, that's great.

741
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Yeah, that's good.

742
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Now, that's Vulcan the god of the forge and fires.

743
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Yeah.

744
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Yeah, but this is, it gets even better.

745
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 So this is 1899.

746
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 So we're talking a long time before Star Trek was everything.

747
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 He also was someone who used to write for the official organ of the Amalgamated Association of Iron

748
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Steel and Tin Workers.

749
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 And one of the pieces that he published ends with the phrase, may it live long and prosper.

750
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 No.

751
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Yeah.

752
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 What?

753
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 No.

754
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 That's not possible.

755
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 It is possible.

756
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Well, then there is a god.

757
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Well, there you go.

758
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 That sounds great.

759
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Isn't that incredible?

760
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 He's a dork.

761
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Yeah.

762
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Wow.

763
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 It's amazing.

764
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Do you think Zachary Quintale maybe went to the audition with all this information

765
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 and said, you've got to give me the part?

766
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Yeah, you'd think so.

767
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 You would hope so.

768
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 But it turns out that this was a revelation in the show.

769
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 There's quotes of him going, that's crazy.

770
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 That's insane.

771
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Now, it was pointed out to him that that connection of may it live long and prosper.

772
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Yes, that's extraordinary.

773
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 However, that was a phrase that was in use at the time.

774
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 So, yeah, so there was a stage play of Rip Van Winkle, which it's possible that old PJ

775
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 McCardle was able to see.

776
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 But you know, like...

777
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 That doesn't take anything away from it for me.

778
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Exactly.

779
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 That's an extraordinary coincidence.

780
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Yeah.

781
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 So Sarah and Harry, that's awesome.

782
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Thank you for sending that in.

783
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 Yeah.

784
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 More facts.

785
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,500
 Let's go to another one.

786
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:04,280
 This is from Jonas Belfridge and he says, "Grasshoppers have existed almost 200 million years longer

787
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
 than grass."

788
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
 Lovely.

789
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
 Lovely.

790
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
 Lovely.

791
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
 What were they called?

792
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
 Poppers.

793
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
 Yeah.

794
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,280
 No, we, yeah.

795
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,280
 So grasshoppers date back to the early Triassic, around 250 million years ago.

796
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,280
 But fossil findings have indicated that grass evolved around 55 million years ago.

797
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,280
 So, yeah, so they were there far longer before they...

798
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
 Nothing to hop over.

799
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,280
 That is the absolutely classic QI/5.

800
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,280
 I love the things which existed before the other things, like the button hole.

801
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
 Hole?

802
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,280
 No, the button existed before the button hole.

803
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
 Yeah, a couple of hundred years.

804
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,280
 No, we did a few weeks ago.

805
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
 Yeah.

806
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
 Basketball nets.

807
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
 You name it.

808
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
 They didn't exist before the basket.

809
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,280
 Yeah, basketball nets existed before basketball.

810
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,280
 The train tunnel existed before the train.

811
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
 Yes.

812
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
 Which I cut out of this week's show.

813
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
 What?

814
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,280
 That's fair enough.

815
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
 God, send in more.

816
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,280
 I'd love a list of those.

817
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,280
 It's just weird when you find out when bits of earth arrived, right?

818
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
 I remember Ash, who did our theme tune.

819
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,280
 He used to have a petrified bit of wood that sat in his house.

820
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,280
 It's hundreds of million years old.

821
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,280
 And he would say, this was here before flowers.

822
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,280
 Like, this is older than the concept of flowers.

823
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,280
 His wife going, I prefer that you had flowers in our house.

824
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,280
 Yeah, Valentine's Day.

825
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,280
 Yeah, so yeah, amazing fact.

826
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
 Should we get another?

827
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
 Yeah.

828
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:37,280
 Paul Baker, who writes the spinning circle/pinwheel/loading mouse cursor on computers, is called a throbber.

829
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
 Come on.

830
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
 Oh, that explains so much.

831
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,280
 That explains why that guy is shouting that in the library when I go in.

832
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
 He's on the computer.

833
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
 Yeah, yeah.

834
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
 Great.

835
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,280
 Get rid of that throbber.

836
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
 Yeah, I didn't know that.

837
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,280
 Now we know.

838
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
 The spinning wheel of death.

839
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
 The spinning wheel of death.

840
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,280
 Yeah.

841
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
 That's a good insult as well.

842
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,280
 Because it's, I like insults that are quite, they're not actually saying any rude or swear words,

843
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,280
 but it's very clear what you think of the person.

844
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,280
 So calling someone a roaster, for example, is an absolute roaster.

845
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,280
 I think throbber is a penis, right?

846
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,280
 I mean, that's what he's calling you.

847
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
 You're right.

848
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,280
 It's less ambiguous calling someone an absolute throbber.

849
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
 I don't think of those wheels as throbbing.

850
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,280
 No, worse than them.

851
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,280
 Yeah, good question.

852
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
 Let's find out.

853
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,280
 I don't think it's going to, are you actually googling that?

854
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,280
 Well, no, presumably it's someone who has called it that.

855
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
 Maybe they use the throb.

856
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
 Maybe.

857
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,280
 Maybe it was an insult to what someone they hated, a co-worker.

858
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:37,280
 I maybe just build gates like the word or Steve Jobs or, I don't know.

859
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,280
 The link that was given to me by Paul Baker leads to a paper that's called How Throbber Components

860
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,280
 Affect Users Perception of Waiting Time.

861
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,280
 So it's clearly a word that is so well known within its industry.

862
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:58,280
 How interesting, because that to me sounds like another paper that I've read, which is, you know, like the loading bar?

863
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
 Yeah.

864
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
 It says, this is how much of this is loaded.

865
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
 That usually is not true.

866
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
 I remember you saying this.

867
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
 Yeah.

868
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,280
 They rig it so that it makes you think it's going faster than it is or something.

869
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
 Yeah.

870
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,280
 What do they do?

871
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,280
 It kind of just makes you less likely to be annoyed, basically.

872
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
 Yeah.

873
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,280
 Those things, they tend to go quite slowly, quite slowly, and then speed up.

874
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
 Yeah.

875
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
 And then they'll slow down a bit, and then they'll speed up at the end.

876
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:24,280
 And the idea is, if they went the actual speed, then you'd be like, well, this is just going to take forever.

877
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
 It looks quite pedestrian.

878
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
 Yeah.

879
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
 Yeah.

880
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
 That's a really good idea.

881
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
 That's kind of like this show.

882
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:34,280
 You know, it actually takes longer than you think to listen to.

883
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:42,280
 But James in the edit speeds up and slows down bit selectively to make it seem like it's actually passing at an interesting rate.

884
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,280
 So this bit that Addy's just said is one of those really pedestrian moments.

885
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:56,280
 It's a bit like they did a study of people standing at bus stops, and they found that when they put lots of trees next to the bus stops, people thought they were waiting for less amount of time.

886
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
 Oh, that's good.

887
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
 Not sure why.

888
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,280
 Is that?

889
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,280
 Yeah, because the trees are waiting even longer, or by comparison, I've been here less long than that tree.

890
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
 I guess because it's less dull and boring.

891
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
 That's nice.

892
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
 Yeah.

893
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
 Put a telly there.

894
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,280
 Whoa.

895
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:16,280
 Conversely, if you put someone there and get them to play seven notes on a tuba, then it feels like it's ages.

896
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,280
 Do you know, actually, bus stops are good places to put a graffiti?

897
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
 Are they?

898
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
 Yes, they are.

899
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,280
 And that's because birds fly into them.

900
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:35,280
 And they did a study in Scandinavia somewhere, I think, where they looked at bus stops, glass bus stops, with no graffiti, and then one with a graffiti on it.

901
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,280
 And they found that birds didn't crash into the graffiti-wise ones.

902
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,280
 Of course they wouldn't, because they could see it.

903
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,280
 That's brilliant.

904
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,280
 But wait, don't do a graffiti of a bird's nest.

905
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
 No, no.

906
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,280
 Or the big worm.

907
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,280
 Or the big worm.

908
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:52,280
 So, yeah, I mean, Colin's dictionary says that it's a throwback.

909
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,280
 I can't get into OED because you need to sign into it.

910
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
 I can sign you in.

911
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
 Okay, cool.

912
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,280
 I'm not getting the etymology of it.

913
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,280
 I don't know if it's worth it.

914
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,280
 I feel like--

915
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
 Yeah.

916
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,280
 Your time is ticking down.

917
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
 My time is ticking down.

918
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,280
 So you've got to get in there.

919
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
 Okay, all right.

920
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,280
 Well, let's move on to our next fact.

921
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,280
 And this has been sent in by Andy Wenger.

922
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
 Or Wenger.

923
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
 And--

924
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
 All above the Wenger bus.

925
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,280
 And Andy writes, and this is pretty astonishing,

926
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,280
 "Every possible melody has been copyrighted."

927
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,280
 Right.

928
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,280
 "Every possible melody has been copyrighted and stored on a single hard drive."

929
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
 Well, no.

930
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,280
 Yeah, so Andy writes, "In a unique effort to combat the high volume of dubious lawsuits

931
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,280
 flying back and forth in the music industry today, a team of musicians has recorded every

932
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,280
 possible melody onto a single hard drive and then put each melody in the public domain."

933
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
 How have you recorded every possible melody?

934
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
 Well, okay.

935
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,280
 So music has a set number of notes, right?

936
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,280
 Yeah, but every possible melody would be like infinitely billions.

937
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
 Yes, exactly right.

938
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,280
 However, Andy Wenger sent a link to the Atlantic, which is where he got this fact from.

939
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,280
 And within that article, it says, "Most pop melodies run fewer than 12 notes.

940
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,280
 If you generated every possible melody with just the eight notes of the C scale,

941
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,280
 that would be eight to the upside down V of 12."

942
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
 What's that?

943
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
 To the power of 12.

944
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
 Is that power?

945
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:24,280
 Eight to the power of 12 melodies, which is 68,719,476,736.

946
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,280
 Big number, but achievable when you put it into a computer and you generate all of those

947
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
 melodies.

948
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
 So that's what they did.

949
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,280
 They wrote every melody, at least within that popular phrase.

950
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,280
 So all I need to do is write my song in D sharp.

951
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
 Is that right?

952
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
 Because that's just in the C scale.

953
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
 Exactly.

954
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,280
 That's just in the C.

955
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
 Yeah, I think so, yeah.

956
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,280
 But melody, I guess, can apply to different keys.

957
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
 Yeah, yeah.

958
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,280
 It's the argument that if one was accused of stealing someone's melody,

959
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
 then you could go to that and say, "No, it's not Christmas."

960
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
 It's been copyrighted and it's in the public domain.

961
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,280
 Right.

962
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
 It's the idea.

963
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
 So they just wanted to stop.

964
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
 That's a cool idea.

965
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,280
 Led Zeppelin calling in every band to, not that they do that.

966
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,280
 In fact, they're the ones who are called in.

967
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,280
 When you said it, I thought you were going to say that this hard drive contains not only

968
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:16,280
 the score from Mission Impossible 7, but also the score from the as yet unreleased Mission

969
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,280
 Impossible 8, because it's just got all music for all time.

970
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
 Like somewhere in there.

971
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
 Yeah.

972
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
 There is a perfect, yeah, yeah.

973
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,280
 Throbber.

974
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
 Oh.

975
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,280
 There's no need to be personally.

976
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,280
 First meaning, chiefly colloquial, the heart.

977
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
 Now rare.

978
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
 That dates from 1828.

979
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
 Okay.

980
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,280
 And then there's only one more meaning, a person or a thing which throbs.

981
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
 Right.

982
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
 Oh.

983
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:48,280
 And the most recent citation is, "The DJ and producer has unleashed a hammer of four

984
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,280
 throbber that'll find favor with the tenaglius and super chumbos of the world."

985
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,280
 I'm always wondering how the super chumbos are going to react to each week's episode.

986
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,280
 So the OED doesn't have anything about the...

987
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
 No, it's too new, I guess.

988
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
 They're updating it all the time.

989
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,280
 It's nice to know that it used to be a heart though.

990
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
 Yes.

991
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
 You could say my throbber burns for you.

992
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
 Yes.

993
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
 I don't say it though.

994
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
 Don't make that your next chat up line.

995
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,280
 But if there was a really sexy film star, they might be a throbber throb.

996
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,280
 Yes.

997
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
 Now we're cooking.

998
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,280
 Lovely.

999
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
 Super.

1000
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,280
 The meanings of the word throbber.

1001
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,280
 I got one more here, which is this was sent in by Aidan from Nene New Zealand.

1002
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,280
 And he wrote about a Hawaiian guy who was called Duke Kahanamuku, who broke two world records

1003
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,280
 and equaled a third in his first official swim race.

1004
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,280
 He became the first successful Hollywood actor from Hawaii, taught presidents and royalty

1005
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
 how to surf.

1006
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,280
 And during his first 100-meter final at the Olympics, he was so far ahead, he was able

1007
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,280
 to look back and survey the field.

1008
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,280
 He also invented a new way to kick.

1009
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
 No.

1010
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,280
 Introduced surfing.

1011
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,280
 He has in swimming, I think.

1012
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,280
 There's a ball over there and he's like, what is this?

1013
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,280
 What did he do to that ball?

1014
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,280
 I don't know.

1015
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,280
 That's a heartwarming 90s Disney movie for all the family, isn't it?

1016
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
 Yeah.

1017
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,280
 The new way to kick.

1018
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,280
 Kick the ball through his chest.

1019
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,280
 Introduced surfing to Australia, where it's become one of their favorite pastas.

1020
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,280
 That didn't need to be in that.

1021
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,280
 Not necessarily Aidan, but thank you for that.

1022
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,280
 And once saved eight people from a cap-sized boat in heavy surf while on location for a

1023
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,280
 film.

1024
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,280
 Oh, and after the first swim race, the authorities didn't believe his time, so they made him

1025
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,280
 travel all the way to the US mainland to prove it, where he swam even faster.

1026
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,280
 They should have made him swim there.

1027
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
 Yeah.

1028
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
 That would have proved it.

1029
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
 So yeah.

1030
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,280
 Great.

1031
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
 Someone I've never heard of before.

1032
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
 Juke Kahanamoku.

1033
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
 What a guy.

1034
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:01,280
 Inventor of a new kick.

1035
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
 All right.

1036
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
 It's time for the final batch of facts.

1037
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
 And those are my ones.

1038
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,840
 I'm going to start with another mind-blowing one.

1039
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,780
 This is from Aidan Chauhan.

1040
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:16,040
 And Aidan says this, a bacteriophage is a virus that infects bacteria, right?

1041
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:22,360
 It's so tiny, 20 to 200 nanometers in height, but they are so abundant on Earth that if

1042
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:29,200
 you stacked them all on top of each other, it would be 200 million light years of distance

1043
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,200
 that they reached.

1044
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,320
 For reference, the Milky Way is about 90 million light years in diameter.

1045
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,680
 So more than double, the entire width of the Milky Way is just the bacteriophages on Earth.

1046
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,840
 And would they look bigger the further they got away?

1047
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,080
 After a certain point, yes.

1048
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,880
 Unfortunately, not at the point we've got to.

1049
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
 Oh, okay.

1050
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,880
 I still think this is a good fact.

1051
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,880
 No, it's a great fact.

1052
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,760
 Did we ever mention, I think, about bacteriophages, the amount of bacterias they eat every day?

1053
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,400
 I think we might have done, actually.

1054
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,600
 They eat something like a third of all the bacteria in the ocean every single day.

1055
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
 Oh, yeah.

1056
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
 Oh, thank goodness.

1057
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
 That's right.

1058
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
 Thank goodness.

1059
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,840
 And every planet is at midnight on the door every night.

1060
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,400
 But, yeah, bacteriophages are amazing.

1061
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,720
 I wrote back saying, "Ugh," he wrote back saying, "Yeah, it's true."

1062
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
 That is amazing.

1063
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,720
 His wife learned it.

1064
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
 They should do it.

1065
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,720
 In class.

1066
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,720
 They should do it.

1067
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,720
 We should do it.

1068
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,720
 Well, no, but who's going to eat all the bacteria?

1069
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,640
 If we do that, it'll be a disaster, because then there'll be lots of bacteria in the oceans

1070
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,440
 and probably spill over or something.

1071
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,060
 All right, here's another one.

1072
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,520
 This is from Daniel Nusdayo, and it's a riddle, right?

1073
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:38,360
 I wanted you all to know that in March 2003, Air Algerie Flight 6289 crashed during takeoff,

1074
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:44,040
 killed 102 on board, leaving just one survivor who survived because he wasn't wearing his

1075
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
 seat belt.

1076
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,040
 Mm-hmm.

1077
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
 How?

1078
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,040
 What was it, yeah?

1079
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,540
 2003, quite recent.

1080
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,540
 Oh, okay.

1081
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,540
 Well, the plane crashed.

1082
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,040
 Did he fly out of the window or something?

1083
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,560
 Yeah, he was flying out while everyone couldn't get out.

1084
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,120
 Okay, so it's an easier riddle than I thought it was.

1085
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:04,000
 He was in the back row, and yeah, he was immediately ejected when it landed from the seat, clear

1086
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,440
 of whatever had then happened.

1087
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,440
 All right, fine.

1088
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,960
 I've got another plane-related riddle for you.

1089
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,960
 Oh, yeah.

1090
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,440
 I just thought in case that one didn't work out as well as I hope.

1091
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,800
 That's an extraordinary survival story.

1092
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
 It is extraordinary.

1093
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800
 That's insane.

1094
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,800
 I think-

1095
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,800
 Do you remember the lady we spoke about?

1096
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,800
 I don't know if it made it into the show.

1097
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,960
 Either her parachute failed or she didn't have a parachute.

1098
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:26,320
 She landed softly around an ant's nest, and then the ants acted by biting her.

1099
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,320
 They were kind of acted as a defibrillator and brought her back.

1100
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,320
 Do you remember that?

1101
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,240
 I think like the adrenaline that caused her-

1102
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,520
 She landed in the Amazon and she survived.

1103
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,960
 I remember the girl who landed in the Amazon and who like spent days kind of crawling through

1104
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,280
 the Amazon's really bad language.

1105
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,280
 Was it her?

1106
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,280
 I think this is a different one.

1107
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,280
 No, I think this is a different one as well.

1108
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,360
 There's also Bess Navalovic, who fell further than anyone else in history.

1109
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,360
 Oh, yeah.

1110
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,720
 She was either Croatian or Serbian, I think, and she was- there was a big explosion on

1111
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,720
 board, I think.

1112
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,520
 In fact, she must be Serbian because it was Croatian bomb.

1113
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:04,280
 She was kind of pinned to the fuselage with the drinks trolley and fell with the fuselage

1114
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,480
 and somehow, and I think she had very low blood pressure, so her heart didn't explode

1115
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,480
 or something.

1116
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,480
 Wow, grief.

1117
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,480
 And then she became like a hero of the-

1118
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,480
 That's incredible.

1119
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,480
 Then there's Flight 401, that was an American flight.

1120
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,800
 It was the first flight to have dual sides, so you could walk down the aisle in the middle,

1121
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,440
 so it had seats either side of the plane.

1122
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
 Wide body.

1123
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,000
 Yeah, okay, first commercial flight that did that, and a lot of people managed to survive

1124
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,720
 because it crash landed into a swamp, so the swamp gave it a bit of a break.

1125
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,920
 And then they repurposed quite a lot of the stuff because the plane was actually in good

1126
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,560
 shape like bits of it, so they took bits and put it into other planes, and then people

1127
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:44,720
 started reporting ghostly encounters because they believed that the pieces that were repurposed

1128
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,720
 were now cursed.

1129
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,000
 I knew- I had this sound of familiar as you started saying it.

1130
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 Ghost flight.

1131
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 Ghost 401.

1132
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 Is it a film?

1133
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 It was, yeah.

1134
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 Right.

1135
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 Yeah.

1136
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,920
 With a really big actor, and I can't remember who the big actor is in it.

1137
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,920
 Sorry, is this not true?

1138
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,320
 No, it's based on a story that was written by a paranormal expert who put that angle

1139
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,920
 on it, and then it was converted into a movie because it was such a big- Got it.

1140
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,280
 I'm dragging this back to the realm of facts.

1141
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,160
 Here's another plane-related riddle from Kester Wolf.

1142
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,480
 The Labrador.

1143
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,720
 You may have come across this before, but I learned it yesterday.

1144
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,240
 Did you know that Air Force One has taken off more times than it has landed?

1145
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,920
 Oh, I did know this.

1146
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,360
 It's currently in the air.

1147
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,360
 That would be true.

1148
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,360
 That would be true.

1149
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,360
 That would be true.

1150
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,920
 The plane has changed while it's in the air.

1151
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,920
 Yes.

1152
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,920
 Bingo.

1153
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,920
 That was it.

1154
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,920
 And what happened?

1155
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,920
 Which president was it?

1156
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,920
 Was it Kennedy?

1157
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,920
 It wasn't Kennedy.

1158
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,920
 Nixon.

1159
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,720
 Nixon was on board Air Force One at the time his resignation took effect, so the plane

1160
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,920
 took off with the call sign Air Force One and landed with a normal call sign at the other

1161
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,920
 end.

1162
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,920
 Right.

1163
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,920
 Isn't that great?

1164
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,920
 Yeah, that is.

1165
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
 So it's confusing, though.

1166
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,920
 Well, that's riddles for you.

1167
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,920
 No, I mean for the air traffic control on that day.

1168
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,240
 Well, suddenly the plane just disappears and the other one just appears out of place.

1169
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,240
 Yep.

1170
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,240
 True.

1171
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,680
 Here's a fact from Meredith McBride.

1172
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,680
 Hi there.

1173
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,760
 A long time, let's know whose son shared a fact and wanted me to send it in.

1174
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
 So here it is.

1175
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,760
 This is great.

1176
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
 You know the Burj Khalifa?

1177
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,760
 Yeah.

1178
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,760
 That's the very tallest building?

1179
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,760
 I've been there.

1180
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,760
 Been up it.

1181
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:21,240
 Well, James, if while there, you had laid it on its side, I would have been arrested.

1182
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,680
 It would be longer than Vatican City.

1183
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:29,120
 I went to Vatican City in the same year as I went to Burj Khalifa.

1184
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,760
 That surprised me, actually, because I remember crossing the border into Vatican and walking

1185
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,320
 all the way up to wherever the Pope lives, his house, and it's quite a walk.

1186
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,320
 It's quite a walk.

1187
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,840
 Well, it's still not as long as the Burj Khalifa will be at all.

1188
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,920
 So a building in Asia, Meredith writes, is larger than a European country.

1189
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,920
 That is cool.

1190
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,920
 That's pretty cool.

1191
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
 That's a great fact.

1192
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,320
 I was in Georgia because I'm guessing you didn't walk up in the Burj Khalifa.

1193
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,320
 No, I was in a lift.

1194
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
 Yeah.

1195
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,320
 So that does seem a lot shorter than that.

1196
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,880
 Did you do the sunset thing?

1197
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,880
 No.

1198
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,880
 God did that.

1199
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,880
 Oh, no.

1200
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,880
 So you're on that.

1201
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,880
 I see why you thought I invented that.

1202
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,880
 And the Pope told you, didn't he?

1203
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,880
 He made that clear when you were there.

1204
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,500
 There's apparently a thing where it's so tall that if you get into the lift at the right

1205
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:13,400
 moment, you can see a sunset twice by going up it.

1206
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,400
 The sun goes down.

1207
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,400
 You go up the lift.

1208
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,120
 You go up and you get a second sunset.

1209
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,520
 You know what would be weird?

1210
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,560
 If you were at the top of the Burj Khalifa, those ships would look enormous.

1211
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,560
 Yeah.

1212
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,560
 Yeah.

1213
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,560
 Man, huge.

1214
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,560
 They'd be in my face.

1215
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,560
 Yeah.

1216
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,560
 There's also a thing which is apparently it doesn't have any...

1217
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,560
 And you lose.

1218
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,560
 It's so weird.

1219
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,560
 It has toys.

1220
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,560
 And they didn't put them in.

1221
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,080
 So they would kick themselves afterwards.

1222
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,080
 What'd they do?

1223
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,080
 I went to...

1224
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,080
 Sorry to say this.

1225
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,360
 I went to a building in Copenhagen.

1226
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,120
 It's like a round building.

1227
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,720
 And they just had like a drop where you poo into it.

1228
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,720
 No.

1229
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,720
 So it's like a chair.

1230
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,480
 And it's like it's a hollow building and you kind of sit with your bum facing the inside

1231
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
 of the building.

1232
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,480
 No.

1233
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,960
 And you poo and it just goes into the bottom of the tower.

1234
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,840
 But sorry, like a modern building?

1235
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,840
 Or an ancient castle?

1236
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,840
 No, no.

1237
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,840
 Ancient, old, old, old.

1238
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,840
 Sorry.

1239
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,840
 Because it sounded like you were describing it as a modern architect's dream, like, you

1240
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,600
 know, beautiful glass everywhere, spiral staggers.

1241
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,600
 It's the latest helmet.

1242
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:15,160
 It's built around a slowly growing corn of poo.

1243
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:20,000
 According to my memory of this fact, the Burj Khalifa is not 100% dissimilar to that.

1244
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,280
 In that, there's no sewage underneath it.

1245
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,040
 And so the poo collects at the bottom of the building.

1246
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,440
 And every day at the end of the day, trucks have to take the poo and the wee out away

1247
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,000
 from the building and go to a dumping ground and put it there.

1248
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,880
 So like living on a canal boat, you've got to collect it and then deposit it.

1249
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,160
 Are you saying that the tallest building in the world doesn't have foundations?

1250
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,320
 It does have foundations, but it's built on a raft, I think.

1251
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,000
 I thought it was built on sand.

1252
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 Shifting sand.

1253
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 Yeah.

1254
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 But that's why they had to put it on a raft.

1255
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,960
 Because you can't build foundations that deep in sand because it shifts.

1256
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,960
 Right.

1257
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,800
 But you wouldn't want to have your poo to be landing on the raft?

1258
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,800
 No.

1259
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,800
 No.

1260
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,800
 But I didn't know that thing about that.

1261
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,960
 Because like I said, it did go there and I read all of the boards to see if there were

1262
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,080
 interesting facts and they didn't say anything about poo, are we?

1263
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,080
 Yeah.

1264
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,280
 I can imagine they wouldn't have the top of the bird to be like, we have a bunch of

1265
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,180
 lackeys at the bottom who have to carry your shit away every day, but it's a great building.

1266
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:22,980
 It's also the location and this brings two things we were talking about earlier of Grafito

1267
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:27,200
 that was put there by Star of Mission Impossible during a Mission Impossible shoot.

1268
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,200
 Oh, did Tom Cruise leave a...

1269
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,200
 Supposedly.

1270
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,120
 So you've seen all the movies, he scales the building at some point, doesn't he?

1271
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,120
 Mission Impossible 4.

1272
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,120
 Mission Impossible 4.

1273
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,120
 Yeah.

1274
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,400
 And then is there a big sandstorm that comes in?

1275
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,400
 It certainly is.

1276
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,400
 Right.

1277
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,200
 So, and he turns around and he's like, there's a massive ship in my face.

1278
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,280
 It's a very scary moment.

1279
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,000
 But no, apparently he...

1280
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 This is the story.

1281
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,160
 He wrote Katie Holmes' name.

1282
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,920
 He was maritor at the time and then they found out and they had to get to the top of the

1283
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,580
 building and scrub it out.

1284
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,580
 No more Grafito.

1285
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,580
 Wow.

1286
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,580
 That's good.

1287
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,580
 Didn't know that, boy.

1288
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,080
 Here's another one.

1289
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,080
 Roland Pierce, right?

1290
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,020
 Just listening to your later steps, some good Titanic stuff there, okay.

1291
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,160
 In fact, I heard a few years ago.

1292
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,160
 Don't quote me on this.

1293
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,160
 Oh, no.

1294
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,160
 Sorry.

1295
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,160
 Well, we're doing it now.

1296
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,540
 But there were a couple of ways they could have rescued every single passenger, right?

1297
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,040
 Number one, engines in full reverse for as long as possible would have brought the ship

1298
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:24,080
 closer to the Carpathia rescue ship.

1299
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:31,280
 Number two, tie the Titanic to the iceberg, use the onboard cranes or planks or whatever

1300
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,280
 to load all the passengers onto the berg.

1301
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,280
 Wait there for rescue.

1302
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,200
 I think they were quite far past.

1303
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,480
 I feel like that would have been hard as well.

1304
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,480
 Yeah.

1305
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,480
 I don't know if that's realistic.

1306
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,960
 Are these facts or are these guys kind of sort of...

1307
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,960
 I've been to...

1308
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,960
 Just a claim, I think.

1309
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,200
 I went to a lake in Iceland that has icebergs on it.

1310
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,160
 They're carving from the glacier and then they come into the lake and it's kind of attached

1311
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,720
 to the sea and they flip a lot icebergs.

1312
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:02,080
 Yeah, so I reckon if loads of people were on it, it might just flip over and then you're

1313
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,080
 all buggered.

1314
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,080
 Yeah.

1315
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,440
 That's probably why they didn't do it.

1316
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,440
 Yeah.

1317
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,600
 Also, I don't know if it's the Carpathia or however it's pronounced, it was one of the

1318
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:16,240
 ships didn't go to rescue the Titanic because it looked bigger than it should have.

1319
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,240
 What?

1320
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,240
 You took it.

1321
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,240
 A lot of weird...

1322
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,440
 Because obviously of how cold it was, there was a lot of atmospheric illusions that were

1323
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,800
 going on and there was one ship that was told it's a thousand metres away and it's this

1324
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,240
 long, but they saw a ship that was much closer and a different size and they went, "Can't

1325
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,200
 be that ship, that must be another ship, so we need to keep looking for the Titanic."

1326
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,200
 I have heard that.

1327
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,200
 Yes.

1328
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,200
 Yeah, this is a real thing.

1329
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,200
 It's a real thing.

1330
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,280
 But there's another theory recently that they didn't see the iceberg because of, again,

1331
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,200
 atmospheric mucking about and that actually it wasn't just that it was far away and hard

1332
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,040
 to see the iceberg, it was that literally it would have been impossible to see.

1333
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,200
 Yeah, everything was a fog, they call it a fog.

1334
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,840
 Does this guy got any facts?

1335
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,840
 No.

1336
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:59,560
 Well, let's have a suggestion from Tony Frost of an invention because we discuss inventions.

1337
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,520
 Have you heard James of the Euro Club?

1338
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,520
 Have I heard of it?

1339
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,520
 Yeah.

1340
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,520
 What is this, James specific?

1341
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,520
 It is.

1342
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,520
 Oh, it's golf.

1343
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,520
 It's golf.

1344
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,520
 Oh, right, I see.

1345
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,520
 Have you heard of the Euro Club?

1346
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,520
 I don't think so.

1347
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,520
 Well, let me read out the little brief for you.

1348
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,520
 On the golf course, I need some urgent relief in 2010.

1349
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,120
 Oh, yes, I've heard of it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1350
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,120
 We've done this, haven't we, on the show?

1351
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,120
 Have we?

1352
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,120
 Have we?

1353
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,120
 Yeah, unless it was cut.

1354
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,120
 Just go into the golf club but you sit your willy in and take your week.

1355
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:26,240
 Well, it is a golf club but it is hollow and it does allow you to discreetly urinate into

1356
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,240
 it.

1357
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,680
 And then it says a fabric privacy shield will have observers thinking you're just taking

1358
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,680
 a practice swing.

1359
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,440
 I doubt that because we were trying to work out when we spoke about it whether or not

1360
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:41,560
 you would gain an advantage from a heavier golf club off the back of urine being inside

1361
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,560
 it.

1362
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,560
 Because it would change a lot.

1363
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,200
 And if you're a top pro, you probably can't use this one.

1364
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,200
 No, you wouldn't be able to.

1365
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,560
 And also, my experience is that men in particular don't have much trouble finding somewhere

1366
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,080
 to urinate on golf courses.

1367
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,080
 Right.

1368
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,200
 And this sounds quite difficult for a woman to, yeah.

1369
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,200
 Yes.

1370
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,200
 Well, the thing is men pee in jets.

1371
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,200
 Well, no.

1372
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,200
 It depends what age golf.

1373
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
 And women pee in droplets.

1374
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,200
 Oh, yes.

1375
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1376
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,200
 All right.

1377
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,200
 Here's one last one.

1378
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,200
 Yeah.

1379
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,200
 From David McLaren.

1380
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,840
 The winner of the 1970 Australian National Sheepdog Trial was Bob Ross, while no relation

1381
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,840
 to the painter.

1382
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,840
 What?

1383
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,840
 Bob Ross.

1384
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,840
 The dog called Bob Ross.

1385
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,840
 What painter?

1386
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:21,440
 He was a famous painter who was on American TV loads, I think in the 1970s.

1387
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,440
 Oh, my God.

1388
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,440
 He was still in America.

1389
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
 Yeah.

1390
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,440
 I know who you mean.

1391
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,440
 I know who you mean.

1392
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,880
 While no relation to the painter, Bob Ross, the dog was also known to have a soft, gentle

1393
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,880
 voice.

1394
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,040
 You said that one for last.

1395
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,840
 That's our closer.

1396
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:41,280
 PS, I went this year and the winning dog gets their portrait painted.

1397
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,280
 That's great.

1398
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,280
 Yeah.

1399
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,280
 Thank you.

1400
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,280
 What's your name, McLaren?

1401
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,280
 David McLaren.

1402
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,280
 That's a...

1403
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,280
 I think that's...

1404
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:53,280
 I really like that one.

1405
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,880
 OK, that's it.

1406
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,640
 That's all of your facts.

1407
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,560
 Just a nice little twist on the formula.

1408
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,720
 Thank you very much for listening, everybody.

00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,840

1429
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,960
 And I think that's the real thing about clubfish.

1430
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,960
 Yeah.

1431
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,960
 Nothing against you in person.

1432
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,960
 No.

1433
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,960
 You might be great.

1434
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,280
 You're probably having a wonderful and fulfilled life, but you could be leading a more fulfilled

1435
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,560
 life, if you know what I'm saying.

1436
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,560
 So, you know.

1437
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,480
 So, anyway, go there for that, NoSuchThingAsFish.com.

1438
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,480
 That's it from us.

1439

 We'll be back again next week with another normal episode of the podcast.

1440
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
 We'll see you then.

1441
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,000
 Goodbye.

1442
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 Thanks.

1443
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
 Bye.

1444
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
 Bye.

1445
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
 Bye.

1446
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,000
 Bye.

1447

 Bye.

1448
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 Bye.

1449
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
 Bye.

1450
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,000
 Bye.

1451
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
 Bye.

1452
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,580
