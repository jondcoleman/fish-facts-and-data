1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,400
 Yeah.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,240
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,480
 You have a nice, such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,280
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dixie Marie of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,560
 He says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:25,560
 [MUSIC]

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,920
 Hello, and welcome to another edition of No Such Thing as a Fish.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,880
 Coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,080
 My name is Dan.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,240
 I'm sitting here with the regular three elves,

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,000
 James, Anna, and Andy.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,840
 And once again, we are going to go over our favorite facts

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,280
 from the last seven days.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,600
 [MUSIC]

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,560
 Fact number one, this is my fact.

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,720
 And the fact is that 30 million Chinese people live in caves.

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,240
 Whoa.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,760
 Yeah, really?

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,680
 I've been reading a Paul Theroux book called "Riding the Iron Rooster."

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,080
 I was initially reading it because of a fact I'd read a long time ago.

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,440
 He was talking about all the great Chinese inventions.

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,920
 He said, you know, the Chinese invented paper and gump out and wheelbarrows.

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,840
 And the guy who is telling it to him in the book ended by saying,

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,080
 "We even have wheelbarrows in China that you and the West don't yet know about."

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,600
 What?

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,320
 Yeah, that was the most exciting sentence.

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,280
 Wait a minute, what this is?

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
 This is different.

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,080
 I know what great innovations have happened to the wheelbarrows that we don't know about.

31
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,640
 So they got secret wheelbarrows in China that we in the West don't know.

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,480
 Yeah, I know about.

33
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,680
 But it was on the following page that it then said 30 million people live in caves in China.

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,160
 And that in 1986, there was a program to relocate all these people,

35
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,800
 but not into houses, but to relocate them into better caves.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,680
 I went to Mary Islands quite a few years ago and they traditionally lived in caves as well.

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,840
 And they wanted to bring back this kind of old tradition.

38
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,920
 So you could get a government grant to live in a cave rather than live in a normal place.

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
 Oh, wow!

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,720
 Why would you live in a cave like a shot?

41
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,200
 Would you?

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,800
 Yes, definitely.

43
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,160
 Wasn't there a story about English people?

44
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,400
 Yes, there was.

45
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,680
 During the Second World War, there were caves called Chiselhurst Caves in Kent

46
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,560
 and 15,000 people stayed there.

47
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,800
 And I found some guidelines.

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,040
 It really, in the middle of this cave, there's a very English notice board

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,120
 saying, "No admission or reentry to the dormitory section after 9.30pm."

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,120
 There must be reasonable quiet by 10pm, lights out an absolute silence by 10.30pm.

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,120
 You can still visit them, I think, aren't you?

52
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
 You can.

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
 I think I feel like I've visited them in my childhood.

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,440
 There are 17 rules and about 15 are about going to bed on time.

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,880
 I wouldn't think that would have happened.

56
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,120
 The president of China used to live in a cave.

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
 What?

58
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
 Is she Jinping?

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
 Uh-huh.

60
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
 You'll be better on the pronunciation than me.

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,000
 Yeah, he lived for seven years in a cave when he was exiled during the Cultural Revolution.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,840
 I remember, we looked at this in the series C, unsurprisingly.

63
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,760
 We found out that, like you said, 30 million people lived in China and caves.

64
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,520
 But we also found out the entire population of the world in the Stone Age was only 5 million.

65
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,160
 So that means that there were more cavemen now than there have ever been in history, basically.

66
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
 Which I think is possible.

67
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
 That's great.

68
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
 And most people didn't live in caves.

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
 No, no, no.

70
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
 During the Stone Age?

71
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
 I mean, a few people worked up.

72
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
 But most people just lived in the open.

73
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
 Yeah, of course.

74
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,480
 I think most cases were basically always been unlivable, haven't they?

75
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,760
 I think that's what I read, which is why most people couldn't live in caves.

76
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,720
 Although, so I feel like this can get easily confused with the fact that a lot of people in Beijing,

77
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
 they've underground, don't they?

78
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
 They're used to.

79
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
 I think they still do.

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
 Two million people at the moment.

81
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
 They think they live underground.

82
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
 10% of the population in Beijing.

83
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
 I'm talking in a basement flat.

84
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,720
 They either live in, like, basement flat, windowless basements, air-raid shelters.

85
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,840
 There are something like pipe networks, because just, like, probably surprises are so high.

86
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
 I remember.

87
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,400
 I read a biography on Mousey Tung, which I found that great fact that his barber was called

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
 Big Beard Plan.

89
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,960
 And there was amazing stuff about him.

90
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
 I mean, it was an incredible biography.

91
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,360
 It was written by his personal physician.

92
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,600
 And in it, he says that Mao built an entire under-Beijing city, like an entire city that

93
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
 never got used.

94
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,920
 But it was in the event of a massive war that everyone would relocate under the city.

95
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
 And they would live there.

96
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,160
 They're trying to do more research on it, but I can't find anything else on it.

97
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,000
 If you can't find the secret wheelbarrow, they're not going to tell you about the Mousey

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Tung City.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 They're not going to tell you about the Mousey Tung City.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,200
 Actually, Leonardo had a design for a city, which was on two layers, and the poor people

101
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,720
 would live on the bottom layer, and the rich people would live on top layer.

102
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,800
 He was, like, an architect, as well as everything else.

103
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
 Eventually, we're talking about--

104
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
 Yeah, sorry.

105
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
 Not a capray.

106
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
 Not the teenage turtle.

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
 He had a--

108
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
 He lived in the sewers.

109
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
 Oh, yeah.

110
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
 Great.

111
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
 I read the other day.

112
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,480
 I have any solid information on this.

113
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,640
 They found in 2009, I think, it was about 60 kilometers more of the Great Wall of China,

114
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,360
 that they didn't know existed when they were doing a Google Earth survey of it.

115
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,120
 They discovered a missing bit of the wall.

116
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,840
 And they discovered a local village nearby, who had just obviously come across this wall

117
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,880
 and gone, well, no one seems to be using this.

118
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
 And they took the bricks.

119
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,280
 And they made a village out of it.

120
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,280
 Yeah.

121
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,880
 I think that happened with Hadrian as well, as well, didn't they?

122
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,360
 They took bits of the wall and just made houses out of it.

123
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,960
 And with Rome in the Renaissance, they used old buildings to make new ones here.

124
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,800
 I heard a brilliant fact about stones this week.

125
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
 Oh, yeah.

126
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
 Yeah.

127
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,960
 So the world's largest piece of limestone.

128
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,640
 You can see where all the elves are coming from for the L-Series of QI.

129
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,080
 The world's largest piece of limestone is in Lebanon.

130
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,480
 It was cut up by the Romans, and they were going to make a massive, great, big temple with

131
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
 it.

132
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,040
 But once they cut it open, they realized that it was too big to carry.

133
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,640
 And so it's still there when they cut it.

134
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
 That's wonderful.

135
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:53,640
 I read recently that the oldest thing on Earth, they know they know the oldest rock on

136
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
 Earth.

137
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
 What?

138
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,560
 You would think that that's impossible, but it's a bit of a cheat.

139
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
 It's a crystal.

140
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,800
 It's a crystal that they found as 4.4 billion years old.

141
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
 Wow.

142
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
 Yeah.

143
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
 So it's the oldest.

144
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,240
 I love it when you have like a little object that you can date Ash, who's a friend of mine.

145
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,520
 And for yes, in our theme tune, he has a chair in his house, which is a trunk, bit of a tree

146
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
 trunk.

147
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,840
 But it's so old that it's crystallized.

148
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
 Is it crystallized the word?

149
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
 No, what is it?

150
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
 Oh, petrified.

151
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
 Petrified.

152
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,080
 And so it's, but it feels like marble when you touch it.

153
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
 And I was touching it.

154
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,400
 And you kind of go, this is amazing enough.

155
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,560
 And then he said, check this out.

156
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,320
 This chair is older than flowers.

157
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
 Wow.

158
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
 That's great.

159
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
 Oh my God.

160
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
 That's amazing.

161
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,960
 And my favorite thing, by the way, about the wall, the Great Wall of China is that, you know,

162
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,160
 when they say, oh, we found a bit more Great Wall, you go, you expect it to be five more

163
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,160
 meters of it.

164
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,240
 And then when they say 100 kilometers, that's just, I love it when things are found in

165
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,480
 such a ridiculous bulk.

166
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,240
 One of my favorite facts of all time is Barbara Cartland, after she died, they discovered

167
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
 unpublished novels.

168
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,000
 You know, like after an author dies and like, oh, we found unpublished novels, they found

169
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 160 unpublished novels.

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,200
 But with the Great Wall, you would have just thought someone would have gone from one end

171
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,800
 to the other, just to say, like, I've seen it all now.

172
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
 Yeah.

173
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
 Not to draw that.

174
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
 Why haven't they done that?

175
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
 I find it weird.

176
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
 Well, there have been.

177
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,480
 There were two conceptual artists who walked the length of the Great Wall of China towards

178
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
 each other.

179
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,680
 And then they met in the middle and kissed each other once and then they never met again.

180
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
 And that sounds like a dream or a very fancy film, but it's not.

181
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
 It did happen.

182
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,000
 The guy died this week, who was the person who kissed at the end of World War II.

183
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Do you remember that?

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Yeah, he did.

185
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Iconic picture.

186
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Yes.

187
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Did he die?

188
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Yeah, he died this week.

189
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,360
 Because I thought there was doubt over who it was.

190
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,240
 I think these were the guys who are accepted because they have other pictures that look very

191
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,160
 similar to them, but there were other people who claimed to be.

192
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,600
 After the war, he was a male carrier and some professional baseball player.

193
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
 Oh, really?

194
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
 Yeah.

195
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,040
 They were identified by the Houston Police Department forensic artist.

196
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,920
 She took about 100 pictures of him using a pillow to pose as he did.

197
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,440
 And she said she could match the muscles, ears and other features of the 80-year-old McDuffy

198
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,880
 to the sailor in the picture.

199
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,200
 You don't want to be committing any crimes in Houston anytime soon, do you?

200
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
 You've got that.

201
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
 Especially not near an artist.

202
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,520
 You don't have to paint you at the time.

203
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,560
 His name is Glenn McDuffy.

204
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,120
 And after he was identified, he went around fundraisers and parties telling his story and

205
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,760
 women would pay $10 to kiss him on the cheek.

206
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,960
 Why the cheek, though, that?

207
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,200
 I mean, that's not what they do in the photo.

208
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,280
 You just thought you'd go for the full-on bent over backwards, wouldn't you?

209
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,760
 Otherwise, what's the point?

210
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,080
 Maybe that was a bit more, like £10 on the cheek, isn't it?

211
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
 Yeah.

212
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,600
 He was changing trains in New York when he was told that Japan had surrendered.

213
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
 He said, "I was so happy.

214
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,920
 I ran out in the street," said Mr. McDuffy, then age 18, along his way to visit his girlfriend

215
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
 in Brooklyn.

216
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,040
 And then I saw that nurse, he said.

217
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,840
 She saw me hollering and with a big smile on my face, I just went right over to her and kissed

218
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
 her.

219
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,880
 Afterwards, I just went on the subway across the street and went to Brooklyn.

220
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
 Wow.

221
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,880
 And you imagine if she's just reading the newspaper the next day and she just sees stuff?

222
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,680
 I know those muscles in that earlobe.

223
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:28,920
 OK, um, yeah, my fact this week is there is a banker in Latvia who will lend you money

224
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,000
 using your immortal soul as security.

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,800
 So what form do you hand over your immortal soul?

226
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,600
 When is it like a piece of paper you sign?

227
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,200
 No, it's just your word, do you think?

228
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
 Your word?

229
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
 I think so, yeah.

230
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,680
 This guy is not very evil.

231
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
 What?

232
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,600
 Weird thing is, he's an atheist and he doesn't believe in souls, this guy apparently.

233
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,560
 And what his point is, is that a lot of people are not repaying their loans at the moment

234
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,320
 and he said, "I decided that in such times a man's word is more of precious pledge than

235
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,920
 a car or an apartment which had depreciating in value."

236
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,920
 How much money has he got?

237
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
 He sees trading.

238
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,000
 Exactly, I imagine in that one debt he lent her all his money.

239
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,040
 It was a maximum of $1,000 you could borrow.

240
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
 Right.

241
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,320
 There was a gaming company in 2010 who put in their terms and conditions you know the things

242
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,120
 that no one reads.

243
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,040
 By placing an order you agree to grant us a non transferable option to claim for now

244
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,920
 and evermore your immortal soul.

245
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,200
 Should we wish to exercise this option, you agree to surrender your immortal soul and

246
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,400
 any claim you may have on it within five working days.

247
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,720
 Yeah, but the belief in soul is quite common, like even today in this country you'll get...

248
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,440
 I happen to know that in some hospitals when someone dies they'll open the window just

249
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,960
 so that the soul can escape.

250
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,320
 Well, that is a question of a nurse with a superstition that is not policy.

251
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
 I know it's not policies.

252
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:59,200
 I can say to me that I could borrow money in exchange for my immortal soul.

253
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,560
 I don't believe in my immortal soul, but I think I would hesitate before doing it.

254
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
 Wouldn't you like to just incase?

255
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,600
 Right, so like I was saying before people in history always seem to believe that people

256
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
 live forever.

257
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,760
 After you die you go on and you do something else.

258
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,960
 There's a huge number of Chinese emperors who all died because they were seeking out the

259
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
 illiterate life.

260
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
 Yeah, the chin.

261
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,400
 The man who effectively unified China gave it its name.

262
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,480
 He died because of his constant search for the illiterate life.

263
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,780
 He did a number of things in his life.

264
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,920
 He did the terracotta warriors.

265
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
 Oh, yeah.

266
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
 And they still haven't gotten into it.

267
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:37,600
 His main aerial place and it's incredible because the descriptions of it from legend were

268
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,400
 that it was made with a river of mercury and they've put pests to see if it's dangerous

269
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,640
 or not to go in and they levels of mercury are extremely high, extremely high.

270
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,600
 So it kind of suggests that maybe he did make it contrary.

271
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,440
 But he died from drinking mercury because he was told that he was going to live forever

272
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
 that way also.

273
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
 Is that to some work, does it?

274
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
 Does exactly the opposite.

275
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,640
 It does exactly the opposite.

276
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
 The irony.

277
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,840
 He was also told by a thousand-year-old wizard who he met once and could never find

278
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
 again.

279
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
 Oh, yeah.

280
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,160
 That there was an island in which they would find the illiterate life.

281
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,640
 He sent off a boat full of people and supposedly that boat never came back.

282
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,120
 Supposedly that's the boat that founded Japan.

283
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,400
 But also that he sent off another expedition after the first one didn't come back to look

284
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,160
 through the islands of the immortals.

285
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,160
 Only one line came back saying that the herbs on the island were guarded by fierce whales

286
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,440
 and that the expedition had failed because they had been frightened by a huge fish.

287
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,240
 Speaking of people living forever, there was a politician in America called Leonard Live

288
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
 Forever Jones.

289
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,240
 He ran for Governor of Kentucky in the 1860s and he ran on a platform of being immortal.

290
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,340
 And because he was immortal, he refused any medical help of any kind and he died of a chest

291
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,840
 cold in 1868.

292
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,680
 Just with the age thing, I read this the other day which I found amazing.

293
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,480
 The 10th president of America, John Tyler, born 1790.

294
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,840
 His grandson is still alive.

295
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
 Yeah.

296
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
 Wow.

297
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
 His grandson.

298
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
 It's really impressive.

299
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,840
 You know the oldest, the oldest complete skeleton found in Britain was the guy who was

300
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:20,120
 found in Chedigorge, who's 9,000 years old and you know they tried to trace some of his descendants.

301
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,640
 They decided to just look in the local area and they found this guy, Adrian Target, who's

302
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,480
 a schoolteacher, who's a direct descendant on his mother's side of this 9,000 year old skeleton.

303
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,520
 So he's now like, he's broken the world record for someone who can trace his descendants

304
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
 back.

305
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
 Oh.

306
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
 Tracer's ancestry back to the furthest.

307
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,160
 His wife said, this is all a bit of a surprise, but maybe it explains why he likes his

308
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:50,000
 steaks rare and it does explain everything's falling into place.

309
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,480
 Do you guys know about Joyce Heff?

310
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
 No.

311
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
 No.

312
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,920
 She was a, she was, do you know P.T. Barnham, the great secretary in Prasario from the 19th

313
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
 century America?

314
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
 One one every minute.

315
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
 Okay.

316
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,440
 One one every minute, which he didn't ever say unfortunately.

317
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,640
 But Joyce Heff was one of his earliest successors, she was 161 year old African-American

318
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
 woman.

319
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,280
 Well, this is the thing.

320
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:17,960
 She was part of his shows and he claimed she had been George Washington's nanny.

321
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:25,840
 After she died, he hired someone to test it and the surgeon responsible said, and this woman

322
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,640
 is about 80 years old, which he claimed that the autopsie victim was another person and

323
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,920
 that the real Joyce Heff was alive in Europe during a tour.

324
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,360
 It was good in those days when you could just walk around pretending to be something

325
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,360
 you could.

326
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
 Yeah.

327
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,120
 So, one of your favourite facts is about the two-headed Mexicans.

328
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

329
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:53,200
 Pascal Fernan, the two-headed Mexican, he's got one head and he's from Texas.

330
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:03,520
 Time to move on to fact number three, which is you, Hannah?

331
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
 Yeah.

332
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:11,480
 So, I found out this week that for 100 years almost all the maps we had of Africa contained

333
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,720
 a mountain range that didn't exist.

334
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,000
 They were called the Mountains of Kong.

335
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,560
 It was this enormous mountain, yeah, it was, but the map first appeared in 1798.

336
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,560
 It was an English jogger for James Reynolds who recorded the, you know, Mungo Park who went

337
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
 to Africa.

338
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
 Yes.

339
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,200
 So, he was recording the notes of Mungo Park and he just elaborated a bit and he invented

340
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,680
 the Mountains of Kong, which stretched like from the east side to the west side of Africa.

341
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,160
 The only problem with it, I think, was that explorers then went there, but they, because he said

342
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,920
 it was impossible, he said they were mountains of stupendous height, it was in an insuperable

343
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
 barrier.

344
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,560
 So, explorers didn't even bother to try and cross it.

345
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
 Oh.

346
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,240
 Because they didn't get, they were like, no, the mountains are over there, I can't get

347
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
 them.

348
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
 The south side of Africa.

349
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
 Yeah, let's go.

350
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
 So, what should we keep going until we've hit the mountains?

351
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
 Take a picture?

352
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
 No, no, no.

353
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
 We haven't even got to France yet.

354
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,140
 We're going back to London, but that's my favorite fact about this whole thing is that there's

355
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,440
 an explorer whose main discovery was undiscovering the mountains of Kong.

356
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
 Yeah, yeah.

357
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,940
 His name is Louis Gustav Binger.

358
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,280
 There's this town name approom, Bingerville.

359
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
 It's in...

360
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
 It doesn't exist.

361
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
 Yeah.

362
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
 Basically, he donated up all the graphics.

363
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
 But no, he did.

364
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,440
 He discovered the mountains of Kong.

365
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,120
 Speaking of places that don't exist, like Bingerville, Bingerville exists.

366
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
 Okay.

367
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,000
 Well, there's a place called Aglow in New York State, and it was made up by a guy.

368
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,600
 He put it on a map, and he, I think it was Nanagram of his name or Nanagram of someone's

369
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
 name.

370
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,300
 And it was a completely made up thing, but it got copied by maps and copied by maps and

371
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,720
 copied by maps, and then someone put a gas station where it should be, and they called

372
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,400
 it Aglow gas station, and now there's house there, and now it has become a real place.

373
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
 So now, he is...

374
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
 That's good to hear.

375
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
 He is no longer a liar.

376
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
 Yeah.

377
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,840
 And the map will map's launch last year, or the year before was it, and all those errors

378
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
 that were hilarious.

379
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,440
 One of which was the Senkaku islands, the Japan and China dispute, and Apple maps just made

380
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
 two.

381
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,520
 So there was one on the Chinese side and one on the Japanese side, just like my side.

382
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
 Isn't that nice?

383
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,320
 That's a good way of solving conflict.

384
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
 It is a good way.

385
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
 If it just made two crimeers, then Russian...

386
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,520
 You can't really have to worry about that.

387
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,040
 Yeah, because how often do they really go there?

388
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,520
 They just want to write it down, don't they?

389
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
 That they own it.

390
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
 They think they do.

391
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
 Yeah.

392
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
 They think it's as well.

393
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
 Because the...

394
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
 Mexico wanted...

395
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
 There's a bit...

396
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,160
 A bear and me hat island is strategically important, because if you get the water around it,

397
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,640
 you get a little oil deposits, and unfortunately for Mexico, it also vanished several years ago.

398
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
 So now they don't end up in that bit of water, it's...

399
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
 No, no.

400
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,600
 Because what you do is you own a certain distance around your land.

401
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,880
 And what it used to be, it was a distance that a cannon could fire.

402
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
 So you'd let...

403
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
 You'd own...

404
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,920
 Say a cannon could fire 500 metres, that's the distance.

405
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,560
 You would own out to sea.

406
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
 Wow.

407
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
 And it's changed over the sea.

408
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
 Come to sea.

409
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
 But that's what it originally was, yeah.

410
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
 Wow.

411
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,720
 I think that might've been in Reagan's time, certainly pretty sure it was in the 80s, America

412
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,840
 changed their rules and said, "Okay, it used to be the common distance.

413
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,360
 Now we're going to say we actually own 10 kilometres out to sea."

414
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,240
 And that increased the area of the United States by an enormous amount.

415
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,280
 I feel like we should mention, just in case there were people that I didn't know about

416
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,400
 California, in the fact that it was an island, until the 18th century, which is probably

417
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,800
 the most famous map cook-up and lasted from, I think it was, 1510, the first map appeared

418
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,800
 that made California into an island.

419
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,160
 And yeah, like Frances Drake went out, sailed out there, caught her, sailed out there, all

420
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,640
 sent voyages out there.

421
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,560
 And none of the managed to just come back and say, "No, it definitely isn't good."

422
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,040
 I think in one of the other Britannic as it said, it is unsure whether it is an island or

423
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
 peninsula.

424
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
 Yeah.

425
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,960
 There's a theory that it got confused with Guam, which is, if you look at a map, not

426
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
 very close at all.

427
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,280
 It was a very long way away.

428
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
 It was very far.

429
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,880
 They were doing, yeah, they were bigging themselves up there claiming they'd sailed to Guam.

430
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,280
 Do you know the Good Guam fact?

431
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
 No.

432
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,480
 And so Guam is this island in the Pacific, owned by America.

433
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,520
 They have a naval base there, and an air base there.

434
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,520
 And they drop some snakes there, some brown snakes, by accident, one day, just a couple

435
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
 of them.

436
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,640
 And with no other predators on the island, they multiplied and multiplied and multiplied.

437
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,880
 And now the one is just covered in snakes.

438
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,360
 I know the snake population.

439
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:32,160
 They've now dropped dead poisoned mice onto the island, stuffed with 80 milligrams of

440
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,200
 parasitamol, which is deadly to brown trees snakes, tied to miniature cardboard parachutes.

441
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,640
 I've read a story which is in the news about a mystery ghost ship that's carrying nothing

442
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
 but cannibal rats.

443
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
 That's a very, it's the same thing.

444
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,200
 They've multiplied and multiplied, and now they're worried that this ship is going

445
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
 to...

446
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
 They don't know if the ship is still out there, because they think storm is fine.

447
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,240
 It's been seen to our island, wasn't it?

448
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
 Yeah, yeah.

449
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
 But it's amazing.

450
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
 You could say they were pyratts.

451
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
 Yeah.

452
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
 Just around the window.

453
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
 Yeah, just a nice environment.

454
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
 Very good.

455
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
 Here we go.

456
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
 I have seen this.

457
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,240
 This has been debunked.

458
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
 Apparently there are no more inclined to eat one another than humans.

459
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,320
 Dr. Penny Hawkins of the RSPCA said, rats have a really bad press, and this doesn't

460
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
 help.

461
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:25,400
 Okay, let's head to the final fact of the show, fact number four, and let's see you, Andy.

462
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,200
 Okay, this is that male Pennsylvania grass spiders are much more likely to approach a female

463
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,320
 for sex if she has recently killed and eaten another male.

464
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,320
 Exactly.

465
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,640
 Because I think she's already sated, so maybe she won't eat them.

466
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
 This is the thing.

467
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,800
 If females typically only eat one male, so if your girlfriend is already killed and eaten

468
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,680
 one male, she's probably not going to kill and eat it.

469
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,680
 Yeah, it's you, it's the theory.

470
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
 So you think that for me.

471
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
 Yeah.

472
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:58,720
 And also, this is, some females don't kill and eat males, and there's these blurred lines.

473
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
 Exactly.

474
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,600
 Because you'd be waiting the whole time going, so if you eat in any one reason, wait.

475
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
 I don't remember.

476
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
 That's why you wouldn't approach.

477
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,520
 Because if you knew that females ate generally only one male, you would think, oh,

478
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,600
 well, I'll definitely go over the one who's definitely not going to eat me.

479
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
 Yeah.

480
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,000
 The redbacks actually ask for it, don't they?

481
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,600
 The redback male spiders sort of beg to be eaten, and I don't think people are 100% sure

482
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
 why.

483
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,240
 So basically, they come up to the female who's like 50 times as big as them, and they get

484
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,680
 onto that abdomen, and they put their palp, their kind of spider penis, into the lady.

485
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,760
 And then while they're doing that, they also use their palp to kind of sum assault themselves

486
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,880
 into the spider's mouth, and then she chooses them, because she's got two openings, so they

487
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,960
 can put the palp in both, and it's best if they get in there with both.

488
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,160
 They, so they repel themselves into her mouth.

489
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,560
 She feeds on them for a bit, so she sucks food out of this, like, males, abdomen, while

490
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,720
 he's still inserted into her.

491
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,440
 And then he inserts himself into, like, whole number two, and then spins back again into

492
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,760
 her mouth to let her eat the rest of him.

493
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
 Good grief.

494
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,360
 And there are more, which, there are more males which have techniques for not being

495
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,000
 eaten, though, those species which don't want to be.

496
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,080
 So some tetrag-nathid, please don't write them with pronunciation, though, spiders, have

497
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:19,400
 specialized jaws, which hold open the jaws of females during copulation, because they basically

498
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,920
 carry around sticks with which they can just leave her open her mouth, even though it takes

499
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
 to have sex.

500
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
 I know.

501
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
 Yeah.

502
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
 Yeah.

503
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,320
 The golden op spider is very similar to the first guy you were talking about, but they

504
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,800
 will only mate, or they prefer to mate with a spider who is currently eating another male,

505
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,240
 because she's busy eating, so she's just like, during dinner, he'll prefer to do it.

506
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
 Don't mind me.

507
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
 Just here.

508
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,240
 Wow.

509
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,440
 That's pretty much ultimate wingman behaviour, isn't it?

510
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
 Don't worry.

511
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
 I'll take the flak for this one.

512
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,600
 I really wish that women had what loads of other animals have, loads of spiders in sex,

513
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,160
 slugs, reptiles, birds have, and including the red-backed spider, which is cryptic female

514
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,160
 choice.

515
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,400
 Which is basically, it is the ability if someone has recently had sex with you to decide whether

516
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,960
 or not you're going to bother accepting their sperm and allow you to fertilise you.

517
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,520
 So they think that might be why it's good to get eaten as a red-backed by the woman, because

518
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
 then she likes you.

519
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,280
 She's like, "Oh, yeah, you sacrifice yourself to me.

520
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
 All right, fine.

521
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,160
 I'll let your sperm fertilise my egg."

522
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,200
 So they can, she can literally say, "Oh, not really, didn't we like you?"

523
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,200
 And how tasty it was, mate.

524
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
 Yeah, I guess so.

525
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
 Yeah, you were delicious.

526
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
 Oh, definitely have your offspring.

527
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
 That's amazing.

528
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
 But I like the term cryptic female choice.

529
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
 Yes, that is wonderful.

530
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,200
 So cannibalism is quite common in animal kingdom, not just in spires, is it?

531
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
 Yeah, I love it.

532
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
 Yeah.

533
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
 One of my favourite ones are those sharks.

534
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,200
 I can't remember the species, but they, in the womb, there's more than one shark.

535
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,920
 So they haven't been born yet, but they will fight each other and eat each other before

536
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
 they're even born.

537
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,920
 And I like the octopuses who will eat their own arm if they're stressed.

538
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
 So it's like auto cannibalism.

539
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,920
 Yeah.

540
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
 That's kind of why they'd want to what purpose does that serve?

541
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
 Just stressed.

542
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
 Come to me down.

543
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
 Come to me down.

544
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
 It's just like biting your nails.

545
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
 Have a cup of tea.

546
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
 And eat this.

547
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:16,920
 I would cease to become so soon into the process of eating my own arm.

548
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,920
 So going back to spiders, they have cannibals, aren't they?

549
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,920
 I remember reading, I don't know if this fact is true or not, but if you put 10,000 spiders in a room

550
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,920
 and just leave them to themselves, then they'll all keep eating each other.

551
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,920
 And in the end, you'll just end up with one big fat, satiated spider.

552
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,920
 So it's body would just be building on tiny legs.

553
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,920
 Wouldn't it be?

554
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
 Wouldn't that be okay?

555
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
 It's legs aren't going to grow.

556
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,920
 The spiders don't feed very often do this.

557
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
 That's not even the loose bones.

558
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,920
 And we should become giants.

559
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,920
 It's all eating giants.

560
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
 There'll be one big guy called Barry.

561
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:52,920
 Do you know that spiders' brains are so big enough that they spill into their legs?

562
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
 They're not big enough.

563
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
 Their heads are so small.

564
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
 They're right there.

565
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,920
 What's that again?

566
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,920
 So their brains spill into their legs?

567
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,920
 They have very small bodies, as I said.

568
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,920
 Very small heads, but they're mostly legs.

569
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,920
 So some spiders, the brains, will spill into their legs because the brains are bigger than the heads.

570
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,920
 It would be annoying to think that every time you've tripped over and grazed your knee,

571
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
 you might have brain damage.

572
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,920
 Imagine how stressed you'd be at home.

573
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,920
 Yeah, you'd probably bite your own arm off.

574
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,920
 But lions kill each other, which I didn't really realise.

575
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,920
 I know I'm so if a female lion has got a bunch of cubs that she's nursing

576
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,920
 and a male lion sees her and thinks, "Actually, I want to copulate with her."

577
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,920
 He can go and kill all the cubs, but within 24 hours of the male murdering their cubs,

578
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
 they'll be back on eat.

579
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,920
 They recover that fast.

580
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
 There's no morning period.

581
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
 They're just like, they're dead.

582
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:44,920
 So the Lion King really would just been the rest of them going for a Simba.

583
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
 Just get over it mate.

584
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
 Move on, have some sex.

585
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
 You're missing out on sex by me.

586
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,920
 And you were telling us about how often they have sex.

587
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,920
 Yes, when lions are in heat, it's 20 to 40 times a day.

588
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,920
 But it's always very for very short periods.

589
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,920
 Each coupling, as they call it, lasts for maybe 30 seconds.

590
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,920
 Well, wasn't there something about ladybirds about that?

591
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,920
 Yes, ladybirds have, they have a lot of sex, but they have sex for a very long time as well.

592
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,920
 So often it's for at least one or two hours.

593
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,920
 Sometimes it's up to nine hours, but that's mostly because the male wants to prevent the female

594
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,920
 from mating with any other males.

595
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,920
 But also, male ladybirds are so indiscriminate with who they approach that when they meet another ladybird,

596
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,920
 they will mount it, whether it's the same species of ladybird, whether or not it's the same sex.

597
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
 If it's a male ladybird, they mount.

598
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,920
 They just quickly dismount and pretend nothing's happened and walk off.

599
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
 Does it even have to be a ladybird?

600
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,920
 Like, when a ladybird flies lands on my arm, does it think that it's going to be me?

601
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,920
 What if I'm reading a ladybird?

602
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
 (laughter)

603
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,920
 It's the most beautiful ladybird ever.

604
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:54,920
 Okay, that's our show.

605
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
 Thanks everyone for listening.

606
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,920
 If you want to find out more about any of the subjects we've been talking about,

607
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,920
 we're going to put links, we're going to put videos, we're going to put pictures,

608
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,920
 and so on on our ki.com/podcastpage.

609
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:11,920
 We're also going to be on Twitter, constantly monitoring any ads that you have for us about things that we've said.

610
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,920
 Either wrong or right, if you just want to chat to us generally, say hi.

611
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
 I'm on @tribaland, Andy.

612
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
 I'm Andrew Hunter-M.

613
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,920
 I am @texshaped.

614
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,920
 And still not on Twitter, but buckling very quickly.

615
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,920
 So at the time of this podcast going out, she's at Quickopedia.

616
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,920
 And that's the official ki account.

617
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,920
 We're going to be back again next week with another episode of No Such Thing as a Bish.

618
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
 And we'll see you then.

619
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
 Goodbye.
