00:00:00,00:00:03,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:03,00:00:04,Yeah.
00:00:04,00:00:06,"Which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:06,00:00:07,"You have a nice, such thing as a fish."
00:00:07,00:00:11,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dixie Marie of Underwater Life."
00:00:11,00:00:14,"He says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."
00:00:14,00:00:25,[MUSIC]
00:00:25,00:00:29,"Hello, and welcome to another edition of No Such Thing as a Fish."
00:00:29,00:00:32,Coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:32,00:00:34,My name is Dan.
00:00:34,00:00:36,"I'm sitting here with the regular three elves,"
00:00:36,00:00:38,"James, Anna, and Andy."
00:00:38,00:00:40,"And once again, we are going to go over our favorite facts"
00:00:40,00:00:42,from the last seven days.
00:00:42,00:00:45,[MUSIC]
00:00:45,00:00:48,"Fact number one, this is my fact."
00:00:48,00:00:54,And the fact is that 30 million Chinese people live in caves.
00:00:54,00:00:55,Whoa.
00:00:55,00:00:55,"Yeah, really?"
00:00:55,00:00:59,"I've been reading a Paul Theroux book called ""Riding the Iron Rooster."""
00:00:59,00:01:03,I was initially reading it because of a fact I'd read a long time ago.
00:01:03,00:01:05,He was talking about all the great Chinese inventions.
00:01:05,00:01:09,"He said, you know, the Chinese invented paper and gump out and wheelbarrows."
00:01:09,00:01:13,"And the guy who is telling it to him in the book ended by saying,"
00:01:13,00:01:18,"""We even have wheelbarrows in China that you and the West don't yet know about."""
00:01:18,00:01:18,What?
00:01:18,00:01:20,"Yeah, that was the most exciting sentence."
00:01:20,00:01:21,"Wait a minute, what this is?"
00:01:21,00:01:22,This is different.
00:01:22,00:01:27,I know what great innovations have happened to the wheelbarrows that we don't know about.
00:01:27,00:01:29,So they got secret wheelbarrows in China that we in the West don't know.
00:01:29,00:01:30,"Yeah, I know about."
00:01:30,00:01:36,But it was on the following page that it then said 30 million people live in caves in China.
00:01:36,00:01:43,"And that in 1986, there was a program to relocate all these people,"
00:01:43,00:01:46,"but not into houses, but to relocate them into better caves."
00:01:46,00:01:53,I went to Mary Islands quite a few years ago and they traditionally lived in caves as well.
00:01:53,00:01:56,And they wanted to bring back this kind of old tradition.
00:01:56,00:02:00,So you could get a government grant to live in a cave rather than live in a normal place.
00:02:00,00:02:01,"Oh, wow!"
00:02:01,00:02:03,Why would you live in a cave like a shot?
00:02:03,00:02:04,Would you?
00:02:04,00:02:04,"Yes, definitely."
00:02:04,00:02:07,Wasn't there a story about English people?
00:02:07,00:02:08,"Yes, there was."
00:02:08,00:02:12,"During the Second World War, there were caves called Chiselhurst Caves in Kent"
00:02:12,00:02:15,"and 15,000 people stayed there."
00:02:15,00:02:18,And I found some guidelines.
00:02:18,00:02:24,"It really, in the middle of this cave, there's a very English notice board"
00:02:24,00:02:29,"saying, ""No admission or reentry to the dormitory section after 9.30pm."""
00:02:29,00:02:34,"There must be reasonable quiet by 10pm, lights out an absolute silence by 10.30pm."
00:02:34,00:02:36,"You can still visit them, I think, aren't you?"
00:02:36,00:02:37,You can.
00:02:37,00:02:39,I think I feel like I've visited them in my childhood.
00:02:39,00:02:42,There are 17 rules and about 15 are about going to bed on time.
00:02:42,00:02:44,I wouldn't think that would have happened.
00:02:44,00:02:47,The president of China used to live in a cave.
00:02:47,00:02:48,What?
00:02:48,00:02:49,Is she Jinping?
00:02:49,00:02:50,Uh-huh.
00:02:50,00:02:52,You'll be better on the pronunciation than me.
00:02:52,00:02:56,"Yeah, he lived for seven years in a cave when he was exiled during the Cultural Revolution."
00:02:56,00:03:00,"I remember, we looked at this in the series C, unsurprisingly."
00:03:00,00:03:04,"We found out that, like you said, 30 million people lived in China and caves."
00:03:04,00:03:09,But we also found out the entire population of the world in the Stone Age was only 5 million.
00:03:09,00:03:14,"So that means that there were more cavemen now than there have ever been in history, basically."
00:03:14,00:03:15,Which I think is possible.
00:03:15,00:03:16,That's great.
00:03:16,00:03:17,And most people didn't live in caves.
00:03:17,00:03:18,"No, no, no."
00:03:18,00:03:19,During the Stone Age?
00:03:19,00:03:20,"I mean, a few people worked up."
00:03:20,00:03:21,But most people just lived in the open.
00:03:21,00:03:22,"Yeah, of course."
00:03:22,00:03:25,"I think most cases were basically always been unlivable, haven't they?"
00:03:25,00:03:28,"I think that's what I read, which is why most people couldn't live in caves."
00:03:28,00:03:33,"Although, so I feel like this can get easily confused with the fact that a lot of people in Beijing,"
00:03:33,00:03:34,"they've underground, don't they?"
00:03:34,00:03:35,They're used to.
00:03:35,00:03:36,I think they still do.
00:03:36,00:03:37,Two million people at the moment.
00:03:37,00:03:38,They think they live underground.
00:03:38,00:03:39,10% of the population in Beijing.
00:03:39,00:03:40,I'm talking in a basement flat.
00:03:40,00:03:47,"They either live in, like, basement flat, windowless basements, air-raid shelters."
00:03:47,00:03:51,"There are something like pipe networks, because just, like, probably surprises are so high."
00:03:51,00:03:52,I remember.
00:03:52,00:03:57,"I read a biography on Mousey Tung, which I found that great fact that his barber was called"
00:03:57,00:03:58,Big Beard Plan.
00:03:58,00:04:00,And there was amazing stuff about him.
00:04:00,00:04:01,"I mean, it was an incredible biography."
00:04:01,00:04:04,It was written by his personal physician.
00:04:04,00:04:11,"And in it, he says that Mao built an entire under-Beijing city, like an entire city that"
00:04:11,00:04:12,never got used.
00:04:12,00:04:15,But it was in the event of a massive war that everyone would relocate under the city.
00:04:15,00:04:16,And they would live there.
00:04:16,00:04:20,"They're trying to do more research on it, but I can't find anything else on it."
00:04:20,00:04:24,"If you can't find the secret wheelbarrow, they're not going to tell you about the Mousey"
00:04:24,00:04:25,Tung City.
00:04:25,00:04:26,They're not going to tell you about the Mousey Tung City.
00:04:26,00:04:31,"Actually, Leonardo had a design for a city, which was on two layers, and the poor people"
00:04:31,00:04:33,"would live on the bottom layer, and the rich people would live on top layer."
00:04:33,00:04:35,"He was, like, an architect, as well as everything else."
00:04:35,00:04:36,"Eventually, we're talking about--"
00:04:36,00:04:37,"Yeah, sorry."
00:04:37,00:04:38,Not a capray.
00:04:38,00:04:40,Not the teenage turtle.
00:04:40,00:04:41,He had a--
00:04:41,00:04:42,He lived in the sewers.
00:04:42,00:04:43,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:43,00:04:44,Great.
00:04:44,00:04:45,I read the other day.
00:04:45,00:04:48,I have any solid information on this.
00:04:48,00:04:54,"They found in 2009, I think, it was about 60 kilometers more of the Great Wall of China,"
00:04:54,00:04:58,that they didn't know existed when they were doing a Google Earth survey of it.
00:04:58,00:05:01,They discovered a missing bit of the wall.
00:05:01,00:05:05,"And they discovered a local village nearby, who had just obviously come across this wall"
00:05:05,00:05:07,"and gone, well, no one seems to be using this."
00:05:07,00:05:08,And they took the bricks.
00:05:08,00:05:10,And they made a village out of it.
00:05:10,00:05:11,Yeah.
00:05:11,00:05:12,"I think that happened with Hadrian as well, as well, didn't they?"
00:05:12,00:05:15,They took bits of the wall and just made houses out of it.
00:05:15,00:05:19,"And with Rome in the Renaissance, they used old buildings to make new ones here."
00:05:19,00:05:23,I heard a brilliant fact about stones this week.
00:05:23,00:05:24,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:24,00:05:25,Yeah.
00:05:25,00:05:27,So the world's largest piece of limestone.
00:05:27,00:05:30,You can see where all the elves are coming from for the L-Series of QI.
00:05:30,00:05:34,The world's largest piece of limestone is in Lebanon.
00:05:34,00:05:38,"It was cut up by the Romans, and they were going to make a massive, great, big temple with"
00:05:38,00:05:39,it.
00:05:39,00:05:42,"But once they cut it open, they realized that it was too big to carry."
00:05:42,00:05:44,And so it's still there when they cut it.
00:05:44,00:05:45,That's wonderful.
00:05:45,00:05:53,"I read recently that the oldest thing on Earth, they know they know the oldest rock on"
00:05:53,00:05:54,Earth.
00:05:54,00:05:55,What?
00:05:55,00:05:59,"You would think that that's impossible, but it's a bit of a cheat."
00:05:59,00:06:00,It's a crystal.
00:06:00,00:06:03,It's a crystal that they found as 4.4 billion years old.
00:06:03,00:06:04,Wow.
00:06:04,00:06:05,Yeah.
00:06:05,00:06:06,So it's the oldest.
00:06:06,00:06:11,"I love it when you have like a little object that you can date Ash, who's a friend of mine."
00:06:11,00:06:18,"And for yes, in our theme tune, he has a chair in his house, which is a trunk, bit of a tree"
00:06:18,00:06:19,trunk.
00:06:19,00:06:21,But it's so old that it's crystallized.
00:06:21,00:06:22,Is it crystallized the word?
00:06:22,00:06:23,"No, what is it?"
00:06:23,00:06:24,"Oh, petrified."
00:06:24,00:06:25,Petrified.
00:06:25,00:06:28,"And so it's, but it feels like marble when you touch it."
00:06:28,00:06:29,And I was touching it.
00:06:29,00:06:30,"And you kind of go, this is amazing enough."
00:06:30,00:06:32,"And then he said, check this out."
00:06:32,00:06:35,This chair is older than flowers.
00:06:35,00:06:36,Wow.
00:06:36,00:06:37,That's great.
00:06:37,00:06:38,Oh my God.
00:06:38,00:06:39,That's amazing.
00:06:39,00:06:43,"And my favorite thing, by the way, about the wall, the Great Wall of China is that, you know,"
00:06:43,00:06:49,"when they say, oh, we found a bit more Great Wall, you go, you expect it to be five more"
00:06:49,00:06:50,meters of it.
00:06:50,00:06:54,"And then when they say 100 kilometers, that's just, I love it when things are found in"
00:06:54,00:06:56,such a ridiculous bulk.
00:06:56,00:07:01,"One of my favorite facts of all time is Barbara Cartland, after she died, they discovered"
00:07:01,00:07:02,unpublished novels.
00:07:02,00:07:07,"You know, like after an author dies and like, oh, we found unpublished novels, they found"
00:07:07,00:07:10,160 unpublished novels.
00:07:10,00:07:14,"But with the Great Wall, you would have just thought someone would have gone from one end"
00:07:14,00:07:16,"to the other, just to say, like, I've seen it all now."
00:07:16,00:07:17,Yeah.
00:07:17,00:07:18,Not to draw that.
00:07:18,00:07:19,Why haven't they done that?
00:07:19,00:07:20,I find it weird.
00:07:20,00:07:21,"Well, there have been."
00:07:21,00:07:26,There were two conceptual artists who walked the length of the Great Wall of China towards
00:07:26,00:07:27,each other.
00:07:27,00:07:31,And then they met in the middle and kissed each other once and then they never met again.
00:07:31,00:07:35,"And that sounds like a dream or a very fancy film, but it's not."
00:07:35,00:07:36,It did happen.
00:07:36,00:07:41,"The guy died this week, who was the person who kissed at the end of World War II."
00:07:41,00:07:42,Do you remember that?
00:07:42,00:07:43,"Yeah, he did."
00:07:43,00:07:44,Iconic picture.
00:07:44,00:07:45,Yes.
00:07:45,00:07:46,Did he die?
00:07:46,00:07:47,"Yeah, he died this week."
00:07:47,00:07:49,Because I thought there was doubt over who it was.
00:07:49,00:07:53,I think these were the guys who are accepted because they have other pictures that look very
00:07:53,00:07:56,"similar to them, but there were other people who claimed to be."
00:07:56,00:07:59,"After the war, he was a male carrier and some professional baseball player."
00:07:59,00:08:00,"Oh, really?"
00:08:00,00:08:01,Yeah.
00:08:01,00:08:07,They were identified by the Houston Police Department forensic artist.
00:08:07,00:08:10,She took about 100 pictures of him using a pillow to pose as he did.
00:08:10,00:08:16,"And she said she could match the muscles, ears and other features of the 80-year-old McDuffy"
00:08:16,00:08:17,to the sailor in the picture.
00:08:17,00:08:21,"You don't want to be committing any crimes in Houston anytime soon, do you?"
00:08:21,00:08:22,You've got that.
00:08:22,00:08:23,Especially not near an artist.
00:08:23,00:08:24,You don't have to paint you at the time.
00:08:24,00:08:26,His name is Glenn McDuffy.
00:08:26,00:08:31,"And after he was identified, he went around fundraisers and parties telling his story and"
00:08:31,00:08:34,women would pay $10 to kiss him on the cheek.
00:08:34,00:08:35,"Why the cheek, though, that?"
00:08:35,00:08:38,"I mean, that's not what they do in the photo."
00:08:38,00:08:41,"You just thought you'd go for the full-on bent over backwards, wouldn't you?"
00:08:41,00:08:42,"Otherwise, what's the point?"
00:08:42,00:08:46,"Maybe that was a bit more, like £10 on the cheek, isn't it?"
00:08:46,00:08:47,Yeah.
00:08:47,00:08:50,He was changing trains in New York when he was told that Japan had surrendered.
00:08:50,00:08:51,"He said, ""I was so happy."
00:08:51,00:08:55,"I ran out in the street,"" said Mr. McDuffy, then age 18, along his way to visit his girlfriend"
00:08:55,00:08:56,in Brooklyn.
00:08:56,00:08:59,"And then I saw that nurse, he said."
00:08:59,00:09:02,"She saw me hollering and with a big smile on my face, I just went right over to her and kissed"
00:09:02,00:09:03,her.
00:09:03,00:09:06,"Afterwards, I just went on the subway across the street and went to Brooklyn."
00:09:06,00:09:07,Wow.
00:09:07,00:09:11,And you imagine if she's just reading the newspaper the next day and she just sees stuff?
00:09:11,00:09:14,I know those muscles in that earlobe.
00:09:14,00:09:28,"OK, um, yeah, my fact this week is there is a banker in Latvia who will lend you money"
00:09:28,00:09:32,using your immortal soul as security.
00:09:32,00:09:34,So what form do you hand over your immortal soul?
00:09:34,00:09:36,When is it like a piece of paper you sign?
00:09:36,00:09:38,"No, it's just your word, do you think?"
00:09:38,00:09:39,Your word?
00:09:39,00:09:40,"I think so, yeah."
00:09:40,00:09:41,This guy is not very evil.
00:09:41,00:09:42,What?
00:09:42,00:09:46,"Weird thing is, he's an atheist and he doesn't believe in souls, this guy apparently."
00:09:46,00:09:52,"And what his point is, is that a lot of people are not repaying their loans at the moment"
00:09:52,00:09:57,"and he said, ""I decided that in such times a man's word is more of precious pledge than"
00:09:57,00:10:00,"a car or an apartment which had depreciating in value."""
00:10:00,00:10:02,How much money has he got?
00:10:02,00:10:03,He sees trading.
00:10:03,00:10:09,"Exactly, I imagine in that one debt he lent her all his money."
00:10:09,00:10:12,"It was a maximum of $1,000 you could borrow."
00:10:12,00:10:13,Right.
00:10:13,00:10:17,There was a gaming company in 2010 who put in their terms and conditions you know the things
00:10:17,00:10:19,that no one reads.
00:10:19,00:10:24,By placing an order you agree to grant us a non transferable option to claim for now
00:10:24,00:10:26,and evermore your immortal soul.
00:10:26,00:10:31,"Should we wish to exercise this option, you agree to surrender your immortal soul and"
00:10:31,00:10:35,any claim you may have on it within five working days.
00:10:35,00:10:41,"Yeah, but the belief in soul is quite common, like even today in this country you'll get..."
00:10:41,00:10:46,I happen to know that in some hospitals when someone dies they'll open the window just
00:10:46,00:10:47,so that the soul can escape.
00:10:47,00:10:52,"Well, that is a question of a nurse with a superstition that is not policy."
00:10:52,00:10:53,I know it's not policies.
00:10:53,00:10:59,I can say to me that I could borrow money in exchange for my immortal soul.
00:10:59,00:11:03,"I don't believe in my immortal soul, but I think I would hesitate before doing it."
00:11:03,00:11:04,Wouldn't you like to just incase?
00:11:04,00:11:10,"Right, so like I was saying before people in history always seem to believe that people"
00:11:10,00:11:11,live forever.
00:11:11,00:11:13,After you die you go on and you do something else.
00:11:13,00:11:17,There's a huge number of Chinese emperors who all died because they were seeking out the
00:11:17,00:11:18,illiterate life.
00:11:18,00:11:19,"Yeah, the chin."
00:11:19,00:11:22,The man who effectively unified China gave it its name.
00:11:22,00:11:25,He died because of his constant search for the illiterate life.
00:11:25,00:11:26,He did a number of things in his life.
00:11:26,00:11:28,He did the terracotta warriors.
00:11:28,00:11:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:29,00:11:30,And they still haven't gotten into it.
00:11:30,00:11:37,His main aerial place and it's incredible because the descriptions of it from legend were
00:11:37,00:11:44,that it was made with a river of mercury and they've put pests to see if it's dangerous
00:11:44,00:11:48,"or not to go in and they levels of mercury are extremely high, extremely high."
00:11:48,00:11:51,So it kind of suggests that maybe he did make it contrary.
00:11:51,00:11:56,But he died from drinking mercury because he was told that he was going to live forever
00:11:56,00:11:57,that way also.
00:11:57,00:11:58,"Is that to some work, does it?"
00:11:58,00:11:59,Does exactly the opposite.
00:11:59,00:12:00,It does exactly the opposite.
00:12:00,00:12:01,The irony.
00:12:01,00:12:06,He was also told by a thousand-year-old wizard who he met once and could never find
00:12:06,00:12:07,again.
00:12:07,00:12:08,"Oh, yeah."
00:12:08,00:12:12,That there was an island in which they would find the illiterate life.
00:12:12,00:12:17,He sent off a boat full of people and supposedly that boat never came back.
00:12:17,00:12:19,Supposedly that's the boat that founded Japan.
00:12:19,00:12:23,But also that he sent off another expedition after the first one didn't come back to look
00:12:23,00:12:26,through the islands of the immortals.
00:12:26,00:12:30,Only one line came back saying that the herbs on the island were guarded by fierce whales
00:12:30,00:12:34,and that the expedition had failed because they had been frightened by a huge fish.
00:12:34,00:12:39,"Speaking of people living forever, there was a politician in America called Leonard Live"
00:12:39,00:12:41,Forever Jones.
00:12:41,00:12:47,He ran for Governor of Kentucky in the 1860s and he ran on a platform of being immortal.
00:12:47,00:12:51,"And because he was immortal, he refused any medical help of any kind and he died of a chest"
00:12:51,00:12:55,cold in 1868.
00:12:55,00:12:58,"Just with the age thing, I read this the other day which I found amazing."
00:12:58,00:13:04,"The 10th president of America, John Tyler, born 1790."
00:13:04,00:13:06,His grandson is still alive.
00:13:06,00:13:07,Yeah.
00:13:07,00:13:08,Wow.
00:13:08,00:13:09,His grandson.
00:13:09,00:13:10,It's really impressive.
00:13:10,00:13:13,"You know the oldest, the oldest complete skeleton found in Britain was the guy who was"
00:13:13,00:13:20,"found in Chedigorge, who's 9,000 years old and you know they tried to trace some of his descendants."
00:13:20,00:13:23,"They decided to just look in the local area and they found this guy, Adrian Target, who's"
00:13:23,00:13:29,"a schoolteacher, who's a direct descendant on his mother's side of this 9,000 year old skeleton."
00:13:29,00:13:34,"So he's now like, he's broken the world record for someone who can trace his descendants"
00:13:34,00:13:35,back.
00:13:35,00:13:36,Oh.
00:13:36,00:13:37,Tracer's ancestry back to the furthest.
00:13:37,00:13:41,"His wife said, this is all a bit of a surprise, but maybe it explains why he likes his"
00:13:41,00:13:50,steaks rare and it does explain everything's falling into place.
00:13:50,00:13:51,Do you guys know about Joyce Heff?
00:13:51,00:13:52,No.
00:13:52,00:13:53,No.
00:13:53,00:13:57,"She was a, she was, do you know P.T. Barnham, the great secretary in Prasario from the 19th"
00:13:57,00:13:58,century America?
00:13:58,00:13:59,One one every minute.
00:13:59,00:14:00,Okay.
00:14:00,00:14:02,"One one every minute, which he didn't ever say unfortunately."
00:14:02,00:14:08,"But Joyce Heff was one of his earliest successors, she was 161 year old African-American"
00:14:08,00:14:09,woman.
00:14:09,00:14:11,"Well, this is the thing."
00:14:11,00:14:17,She was part of his shows and he claimed she had been George Washington's nanny.
00:14:17,00:14:25,"After she died, he hired someone to test it and the surgeon responsible said, and this woman"
00:14:25,00:14:31,"is about 80 years old, which he claimed that the autopsie victim was another person and"
00:14:31,00:14:35,that the real Joyce Heff was alive in Europe during a tour.
00:14:35,00:14:39,It was good in those days when you could just walk around pretending to be something
00:14:39,00:14:40,you could.
00:14:40,00:14:41,Yeah.
00:14:41,00:14:45,"So, one of your favourite facts is about the two-headed Mexicans."
00:14:45,00:14:46,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:46,00:14:53,"Pascal Fernan, the two-headed Mexican, he's got one head and he's from Texas."
00:14:53,00:15:03,"Time to move on to fact number three, which is you, Hannah?"
00:15:03,00:15:04,Yeah.
00:15:04,00:15:11,"So, I found out this week that for 100 years almost all the maps we had of Africa contained"
00:15:11,00:15:13,a mountain range that didn't exist.
00:15:13,00:15:15,They were called the Mountains of Kong.
00:15:15,00:15:21,"It was this enormous mountain, yeah, it was, but the map first appeared in 1798."
00:15:21,00:15:26,"It was an English jogger for James Reynolds who recorded the, you know, Mungo Park who went"
00:15:26,00:15:27,to Africa.
00:15:27,00:15:28,Yes.
00:15:28,00:15:33,"So, he was recording the notes of Mungo Park and he just elaborated a bit and he invented"
00:15:33,00:15:37,"the Mountains of Kong, which stretched like from the east side to the west side of Africa."
00:15:37,00:15:41,"The only problem with it, I think, was that explorers then went there, but they, because he said"
00:15:41,00:15:45,"it was impossible, he said they were mountains of stupendous height, it was in an insuperable"
00:15:45,00:15:46,barrier.
00:15:46,00:15:49,"So, explorers didn't even bother to try and cross it."
00:15:49,00:15:50,Oh.
00:15:50,00:15:52,"Because they didn't get, they were like, no, the mountains are over there, I can't get"
00:15:52,00:15:53,them.
00:15:53,00:15:54,The south side of Africa.
00:15:54,00:15:55,"Yeah, let's go."
00:15:55,00:15:57,"So, what should we keep going until we've hit the mountains?"
00:15:57,00:15:58,Take a picture?
00:15:58,00:15:59,"No, no, no."
00:15:59,00:16:00,We haven't even got to France yet.
00:16:00,00:16:06,"We're going back to London, but that's my favorite fact about this whole thing is that there's"
00:16:06,00:16:10,an explorer whose main discovery was undiscovering the mountains of Kong.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:16:11,00:16:12,His name is Louis Gustav Binger.
00:16:12,00:16:16,"There's this town name approom, Bingerville."
00:16:16,00:16:17,It's in...
00:16:17,00:16:18,It doesn't exist.
00:16:18,00:16:19,Yeah.
00:16:19,00:16:20,"Basically, he donated up all the graphics."
00:16:20,00:16:21,"But no, he did."
00:16:21,00:16:25,He discovered the mountains of Kong.
00:16:25,00:16:30,"Speaking of places that don't exist, like Bingerville, Bingerville exists."
00:16:30,00:16:31,Okay.
00:16:31,00:16:36,"Well, there's a place called Aglow in New York State, and it was made up by a guy."
00:16:36,00:16:40,"He put it on a map, and he, I think it was Nanagram of his name or Nanagram of someone's"
00:16:40,00:16:41,name.
00:16:41,00:16:45,"And it was a completely made up thing, but it got copied by maps and copied by maps and"
00:16:45,00:16:49,"copied by maps, and then someone put a gas station where it should be, and they called"
00:16:49,00:16:55,"it Aglow gas station, and now there's house there, and now it has become a real place."
00:16:55,00:16:56,"So now, he is..."
00:16:56,00:16:57,That's good to hear.
00:16:57,00:16:58,He is no longer a liar.
00:16:58,00:16:59,Yeah.
00:16:59,00:17:03,"And the map will map's launch last year, or the year before was it, and all those errors"
00:17:03,00:17:04,that were hilarious.
00:17:04,00:17:10,"One of which was the Senkaku islands, the Japan and China dispute, and Apple maps just made"
00:17:10,00:17:11,two.
00:17:11,00:17:14,"So there was one on the Chinese side and one on the Japanese side, just like my side."
00:17:14,00:17:15,Isn't that nice?
00:17:15,00:17:17,That's a good way of solving conflict.
00:17:17,00:17:18,It is a good way.
00:17:18,00:17:20,"If it just made two crimeers, then Russian..."
00:17:20,00:17:22,You can't really have to worry about that.
00:17:22,00:17:24,"Yeah, because how often do they really go there?"
00:17:24,00:17:25,"They just want to write it down, don't they?"
00:17:25,00:17:26,That they own it.
00:17:26,00:17:27,They think they do.
00:17:27,00:17:28,Yeah.
00:17:28,00:17:29,They think it's as well.
00:17:29,00:17:30,Because the...
00:17:30,00:17:31,Mexico wanted...
00:17:31,00:17:32,There's a bit...
00:17:32,00:17:37,"A bear and me hat island is strategically important, because if you get the water around it,"
00:17:37,00:17:42,"you get a little oil deposits, and unfortunately for Mexico, it also vanished several years ago."
00:17:42,00:17:44,"So now they don't end up in that bit of water, it's..."
00:17:44,00:17:45,"No, no."
00:17:45,00:17:50,Because what you do is you own a certain distance around your land.
00:17:50,00:17:53,"And what it used to be, it was a distance that a cannon could fire."
00:17:53,00:17:54,So you'd let...
00:17:54,00:17:55,You'd own...
00:17:55,00:17:57,"Say a cannon could fire 500 metres, that's the distance."
00:17:57,00:17:59,You would own out to sea.
00:17:59,00:18:00,Wow.
00:18:00,00:18:01,And it's changed over the sea.
00:18:01,00:18:02,Come to sea.
00:18:02,00:18:03,"But that's what it originally was, yeah."
00:18:03,00:18:04,Wow.
00:18:04,00:18:08,"I think that might've been in Reagan's time, certainly pretty sure it was in the 80s, America"
00:18:08,00:18:11,"changed their rules and said, ""Okay, it used to be the common distance."
00:18:11,00:18:15,"Now we're going to say we actually own 10 kilometres out to sea."""
00:18:15,00:18:20,And that increased the area of the United States by an enormous amount.
00:18:20,00:18:23,"I feel like we should mention, just in case there were people that I didn't know about"
00:18:23,00:18:27,"California, in the fact that it was an island, until the 18th century, which is probably"
00:18:27,00:18:32,"the most famous map cook-up and lasted from, I think it was, 1510, the first map appeared"
00:18:32,00:18:35,that made California into an island.
00:18:35,00:18:40,"And yeah, like Frances Drake went out, sailed out there, caught her, sailed out there, all"
00:18:40,00:18:41,sent voyages out there.
00:18:41,00:18:44,"And none of the managed to just come back and say, ""No, it definitely isn't good."""
00:18:44,00:18:49,"I think in one of the other Britannic as it said, it is unsure whether it is an island or"
00:18:49,00:18:50,peninsula.
00:18:50,00:18:51,Yeah.
00:18:51,00:18:54,"There's a theory that it got confused with Guam, which is, if you look at a map, not"
00:18:54,00:18:55,very close at all.
00:18:55,00:18:57,It was a very long way away.
00:18:57,00:18:58,It was very far.
00:18:58,00:19:01,"They were doing, yeah, they were bigging themselves up there claiming they'd sailed to Guam."
00:19:01,00:19:03,Do you know the Good Guam fact?
00:19:03,00:19:04,No.
00:19:04,00:19:08,"And so Guam is this island in the Pacific, owned by America."
00:19:08,00:19:11,"They have a naval base there, and an air base there."
00:19:11,00:19:17,"And they drop some snakes there, some brown snakes, by accident, one day, just a couple"
00:19:17,00:19:18,of them.
00:19:18,00:19:22,"And with no other predators on the island, they multiplied and multiplied and multiplied."
00:19:22,00:19:24,And now the one is just covered in snakes.
00:19:24,00:19:26,I know the snake population.
00:19:26,00:19:32,"They've now dropped dead poisoned mice onto the island, stuffed with 80 milligrams of"
00:19:32,00:19:37,"parasitamol, which is deadly to brown trees snakes, tied to miniature cardboard parachutes."
00:19:37,00:19:43,I've read a story which is in the news about a mystery ghost ship that's carrying nothing
00:19:43,00:19:45,but cannibal rats.
00:19:45,00:19:46,"That's a very, it's the same thing."
00:19:46,00:19:50,"They've multiplied and multiplied, and now they're worried that this ship is going"
00:19:50,00:19:51,to...
00:19:51,00:19:53,"They don't know if the ship is still out there, because they think storm is fine."
00:19:53,00:19:56,"It's been seen to our island, wasn't it?"
00:19:56,00:19:57,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:57,00:19:58,But it's amazing.
00:19:58,00:19:59,You could say they were pyratts.
00:19:59,00:20:00,Yeah.
00:20:00,00:20:01,Just around the window.
00:20:01,00:20:02,"Yeah, just a nice environment."
00:20:02,00:20:03,Very good.
00:20:03,00:20:04,Here we go.
00:20:04,00:20:05,I have seen this.
00:20:05,00:20:06,This has been debunked.
00:20:06,00:20:08,Apparently there are no more inclined to eat one another than humans.
00:20:08,00:20:12,"Dr. Penny Hawkins of the RSPCA said, rats have a really bad press, and this doesn't"
00:20:12,00:20:13,help.
00:20:13,00:20:25,"Okay, let's head to the final fact of the show, fact number four, and let's see you, Andy."
00:20:25,00:20:31,"Okay, this is that male Pennsylvania grass spiders are much more likely to approach a female"
00:20:31,00:20:35,for sex if she has recently killed and eaten another male.
00:20:35,00:20:36,Exactly.
00:20:36,00:20:38,"Because I think she's already sated, so maybe she won't eat them."
00:20:38,00:20:39,This is the thing.
00:20:39,00:20:45,"If females typically only eat one male, so if your girlfriend is already killed and eaten"
00:20:45,00:20:47,"one male, she's probably not going to kill and eat it."
00:20:47,00:20:48,"Yeah, it's you, it's the theory."
00:20:48,00:20:49,So you think that for me.
00:20:49,00:20:50,Yeah.
00:20:50,00:20:58,"And also, this is, some females don't kill and eat males, and there's these blurred lines."
00:20:58,00:20:59,Exactly.
00:20:59,00:21:03,"Because you'd be waiting the whole time going, so if you eat in any one reason, wait."
00:21:03,00:21:04,I don't remember.
00:21:04,00:21:05,That's why you wouldn't approach.
00:21:05,00:21:09,"Because if you knew that females ate generally only one male, you would think, oh,"
00:21:09,00:21:13,"well, I'll definitely go over the one who's definitely not going to eat me."
00:21:13,00:21:14,Yeah.
00:21:14,00:21:16,"The redbacks actually ask for it, don't they?"
00:21:16,00:21:21,"The redback male spiders sort of beg to be eaten, and I don't think people are 100% sure"
00:21:21,00:21:22,why.
00:21:22,00:21:27,"So basically, they come up to the female who's like 50 times as big as them, and they get"
00:21:27,00:21:32,"onto that abdomen, and they put their palp, their kind of spider penis, into the lady."
00:21:32,00:21:36,"And then while they're doing that, they also use their palp to kind of sum assault themselves"
00:21:36,00:21:40,"into the spider's mouth, and then she chooses them, because she's got two openings, so they"
00:21:40,00:21:43,"can put the palp in both, and it's best if they get in there with both."
00:21:43,00:21:46,"They, so they repel themselves into her mouth."
00:21:46,00:21:50,"She feeds on them for a bit, so she sucks food out of this, like, males, abdomen, while"
00:21:50,00:21:52,he's still inserted into her.
00:21:52,00:21:57,"And then he inserts himself into, like, whole number two, and then spins back again into"
00:21:57,00:21:59,her mouth to let her eat the rest of him.
00:21:59,00:22:00,Good grief.
00:22:00,00:22:04,"And there are more, which, there are more males which have techniques for not being"
00:22:04,00:22:07,"eaten, though, those species which don't want to be."
00:22:07,00:22:13,"So some tetrag-nathid, please don't write them with pronunciation, though, spiders, have"
00:22:13,00:22:19,"specialized jaws, which hold open the jaws of females during copulation, because they basically"
00:22:19,00:22:23,"carry around sticks with which they can just leave her open her mouth, even though it takes"
00:22:23,00:22:24,to have sex.
00:22:24,00:22:25,I know.
00:22:25,00:22:26,Yeah.
00:22:26,00:22:27,Yeah.
00:22:27,00:22:32,"The golden op spider is very similar to the first guy you were talking about, but they"
00:22:32,00:22:37,"will only mate, or they prefer to mate with a spider who is currently eating another male,"
00:22:37,00:22:42,"because she's busy eating, so she's just like, during dinner, he'll prefer to do it."
00:22:42,00:22:43,Don't mind me.
00:22:43,00:22:44,Just here.
00:22:44,00:22:45,Wow.
00:22:45,00:22:47,"That's pretty much ultimate wingman behaviour, isn't it?"
00:22:47,00:22:48,Don't worry.
00:22:48,00:22:49,I'll take the flak for this one.
00:22:49,00:22:55,"I really wish that women had what loads of other animals have, loads of spiders in sex,"
00:22:55,00:23:01,"slugs, reptiles, birds have, and including the red-backed spider, which is cryptic female"
00:23:01,00:23:02,choice.
00:23:02,00:23:08,"Which is basically, it is the ability if someone has recently had sex with you to decide whether"
00:23:08,00:23:11,or not you're going to bother accepting their sperm and allow you to fertilise you.
00:23:11,00:23:17,"So they think that might be why it's good to get eaten as a red-backed by the woman, because"
00:23:17,00:23:18,then she likes you.
00:23:18,00:23:20,"She's like, ""Oh, yeah, you sacrifice yourself to me."
00:23:20,00:23:21,"All right, fine."
00:23:21,00:23:24,"I'll let your sperm fertilise my egg."""
00:23:24,00:23:27,"So they can, she can literally say, ""Oh, not really, didn't we like you?"""
00:23:27,00:23:31,"And how tasty it was, mate."
00:23:31,00:23:32,"Yeah, I guess so."
00:23:32,00:23:33,"Yeah, you were delicious."
00:23:33,00:23:34,"Oh, definitely have your offspring."
00:23:34,00:23:35,That's amazing.
00:23:35,00:23:36,But I like the term cryptic female choice.
00:23:36,00:23:37,"Yes, that is wonderful."
00:23:37,00:23:41,"So cannibalism is quite common in animal kingdom, not just in spires, is it?"
00:23:41,00:23:42,"Yeah, I love it."
00:23:42,00:23:43,Yeah.
00:23:43,00:23:44,One of my favourite ones are those sharks.
00:23:44,00:23:49,"I can't remember the species, but they, in the womb, there's more than one shark."
00:23:49,00:23:52,"So they haven't been born yet, but they will fight each other and eat each other before"
00:23:52,00:23:53,they're even born.
00:23:53,00:23:59,And I like the octopuses who will eat their own arm if they're stressed.
00:23:59,00:24:01,So it's like auto cannibalism.
00:24:01,00:24:02,Yeah.
00:24:02,00:24:04,That's kind of why they'd want to what purpose does that serve?
00:24:04,00:24:05,Just stressed.
00:24:05,00:24:06,Come to me down.
00:24:06,00:24:07,Come to me down.
00:24:07,00:24:08,It's just like biting your nails.
00:24:08,00:24:09,Have a cup of tea.
00:24:09,00:24:10,And eat this.
00:24:10,00:24:16,I would cease to become so soon into the process of eating my own arm.
00:24:16,00:24:19,"So going back to spiders, they have cannibals, aren't they?"
00:24:19,00:24:24,"I remember reading, I don't know if this fact is true or not, but if you put 10,000 spiders in a room"
00:24:24,00:24:27,"and just leave them to themselves, then they'll all keep eating each other."
00:24:27,00:24:31,"And in the end, you'll just end up with one big fat, satiated spider."
00:24:31,00:24:34,So it's body would just be building on tiny legs.
00:24:34,00:24:35,Wouldn't it be?
00:24:35,00:24:36,Wouldn't that be okay?
00:24:36,00:24:37,It's legs aren't going to grow.
00:24:37,00:24:39,The spiders don't feed very often do this.
00:24:39,00:24:40,That's not even the loose bones.
00:24:40,00:24:42,And we should become giants.
00:24:42,00:24:43,It's all eating giants.
00:24:43,00:24:45,There'll be one big guy called Barry.
00:24:45,00:24:52,Do you know that spiders' brains are so big enough that they spill into their legs?
00:24:52,00:24:54,They're not big enough.
00:24:54,00:24:55,Their heads are so small.
00:24:55,00:24:56,They're right there.
00:24:56,00:24:57,What's that again?
00:24:57,00:24:59,So their brains spill into their legs?
00:24:59,00:25:01,"They have very small bodies, as I said."
00:25:01,00:25:04,"Very small heads, but they're mostly legs."
00:25:04,00:25:09,"So some spiders, the brains, will spill into their legs because the brains are bigger than the heads."
00:25:09,00:25:12,"It would be annoying to think that every time you've tripped over and grazed your knee,"
00:25:12,00:25:13,you might have brain damage.
00:25:13,00:25:15,Imagine how stressed you'd be at home.
00:25:15,00:25:18,"Yeah, you'd probably bite your own arm off."
00:25:18,00:25:21,"But lions kill each other, which I didn't really realise."
00:25:21,00:25:26,I know I'm so if a female lion has got a bunch of cubs that she's nursing
00:25:26,00:25:29,"and a male lion sees her and thinks, ""Actually, I want to copulate with her."""
00:25:29,00:25:33,"He can go and kill all the cubs, but within 24 hours of the male murdering their cubs,"
00:25:33,00:25:34,they'll be back on eat.
00:25:34,00:25:36,They recover that fast.
00:25:36,00:25:37,There's no morning period.
00:25:37,00:25:38,"They're just like, they're dead."
00:25:38,00:25:44,So the Lion King really would just been the rest of them going for a Simba.
00:25:44,00:25:45,Just get over it mate.
00:25:45,00:25:46,"Move on, have some sex."
00:25:46,00:25:48,You're missing out on sex by me.
00:25:48,00:25:51,And you were telling us about how often they have sex.
00:25:51,00:25:55,"Yes, when lions are in heat, it's 20 to 40 times a day."
00:25:55,00:25:58,But it's always very for very short periods.
00:25:58,00:26:02,"Each coupling, as they call it, lasts for maybe 30 seconds."
00:26:02,00:26:05,"Well, wasn't there something about ladybirds about that?"
00:26:05,00:26:10,"Yes, ladybirds have, they have a lot of sex, but they have sex for a very long time as well."
00:26:10,00:26:13,So often it's for at least one or two hours.
00:26:13,00:26:18,"Sometimes it's up to nine hours, but that's mostly because the male wants to prevent the female"
00:26:18,00:26:20,from mating with any other males.
00:26:20,00:26:25,"But also, male ladybirds are so indiscriminate with who they approach that when they meet another ladybird,"
00:26:25,00:26:29,"they will mount it, whether it's the same species of ladybird, whether or not it's the same sex."
00:26:29,00:26:30,"If it's a male ladybird, they mount."
00:26:30,00:26:34,They just quickly dismount and pretend nothing's happened and walk off.
00:26:34,00:26:35,Does it even have to be a ladybird?
00:26:35,00:26:39,"Like, when a ladybird flies lands on my arm, does it think that it's going to be me?"
00:26:39,00:26:41,What if I'm reading a ladybird?
00:26:41,00:26:42,(laughter)
00:26:42,00:26:45,It's the most beautiful ladybird ever.
00:26:45,00:26:54,"Okay, that's our show."
