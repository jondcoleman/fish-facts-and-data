00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.400
 Yeah.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.240
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.480
 You have a nice, such thing as a fish.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.280
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dixie Marie of Underwater Life.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.560
 He says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:25.560

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.920
 Hello, and welcome to another edition of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.880
 Coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.080
 My name is Dan.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.240
 I'm sitting here with the regular three elves,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.000
 James, Anna, and Andy.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.840
 And once again, we are going to go over our favorite facts

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.280
 from the last seven days.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.600
 [MUSIC]

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.560
 Fact number one, this is my fact.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.720
 And the fact is that 30 million Chinese people live in caves.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.240
 Whoa.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.760
 Yeah, really?

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.680
 I've been reading a Paul Theroux book called "Riding the Iron Rooster."

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.080
 I was initially reading it because of a fact I'd read a long time ago.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.440
 He was talking about all the great Chinese inventions.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.920
 He said, you know, the Chinese invented paper and gump out and wheelbarrows.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.840
 And the guy who is telling it to him in the book ended by saying,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.080
 "We even have wheelbarrows in China that you and the West don't yet know about."

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.600
 What?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.320
 Yeah, that was the most exciting sentence.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.280
 Wait a minute, what this is?

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.280
 This is different.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.080
 I know what great innovations have happened to the wheelbarrows that we don't know about.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.640
 So they got secret wheelbarrows in China that we in the West don't know.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.480
 Yeah, I know about.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.680
 But it was on the following page that it then said 30 million people live in caves in China.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.160
 And that in 1986, there was a program to relocate all these people,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.800
 but not into houses, but to relocate them into better caves.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.680
 I went to Mary Islands quite a few years ago and they traditionally lived in caves as well.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.840
 And they wanted to bring back this kind of old tradition.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.920
 So you could get a government grant to live in a cave rather than live in a normal place.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 Oh, wow!

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.720
 Why would you live in a cave like a shot?

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.200
 Would you?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.800
 Yes, definitely.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.160
 Wasn't there a story about English people?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.400
 Yes, there was.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.680
 During the Second World War, there were caves called Chiselhurst Caves in Kent

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.560
 and 15,000 people stayed there.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.800
 And I found some guidelines.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.040
 It really, in the middle of this cave, there's a very English notice board

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.120
 saying, "No admission or reentry to the dormitory section after 9.30pm."

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.120
 There must be reasonable quiet by 10pm, lights out an absolute silence by 10.30pm.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.120
 You can still visit them, I think, aren't you?

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.120
 You can.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.280
 I think I feel like I've visited them in my childhood.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.440
 There are 17 rules and about 15 are about going to bed on time.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.880
 I wouldn't think that would have happened.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.120
 The president of China used to live in a cave.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.120
 What?

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120
 Is she Jinping?

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.120
 Uh-huh.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.120
 You'll be better on the pronunciation than me.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.000
 Yeah, he lived for seven years in a cave when he was exiled during the Cultural Revolution.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.840
 I remember, we looked at this in the series C, unsurprisingly.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.760
 We found out that, like you said, 30 million people lived in China and caves.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.520
 But we also found out the entire population of the world in the Stone Age was only 5 million.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.160
 So that means that there were more cavemen now than there have ever been in history, basically.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.160
 Which I think is possible.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.160
 That's great.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.160
 And most people didn't live in caves.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.160
 No, no, no.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.160
 During the Stone Age?

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.160
 I mean, a few people worked up.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.160
 But most people just lived in the open.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.160
 Yeah, of course.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.480
 I think most cases were basically always been unlivable, haven't they?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.760
 I think that's what I read, which is why most people couldn't live in caves.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.720
 Although, so I feel like this can get easily confused with the fact that a lot of people in Beijing,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.720
 they've underground, don't they?

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.720
 They're used to.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.720
 I think they still do.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.720
 Two million people at the moment.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.720
 They think they live underground.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.720
 10% of the population in Beijing.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.720
 I'm talking in a basement flat.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.720
 They either live in, like, basement flat, windowless basements, air-raid shelters.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.840
 There are something like pipe networks, because just, like, probably surprises are so high.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.840
 I remember.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.400
 I read a biography on Mousey Tung, which I found that great fact that his barber was called

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400
 Big Beard Plan.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.960
 And there was amazing stuff about him.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.960
 I mean, it was an incredible biography.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.360
 It was written by his personal physician.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.600
 And in it, he says that Mao built an entire under-Beijing city, like an entire city that

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.600
 never got used.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.920
 But it was in the event of a massive war that everyone would relocate under the city.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.920
 And they would live there.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.160
 They're trying to do more research on it, but I can't find anything else on it.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.000
 If you can't find the secret wheelbarrow, they're not going to tell you about the Mousey

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Tung City.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 They're not going to tell you about the Mousey Tung City.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.200
 Actually, Leonardo had a design for a city, which was on two layers, and the poor people

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.720
 would live on the bottom layer, and the rich people would live on top layer.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.800
 He was, like, an architect, as well as everything else.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800
 Eventually, we're talking about--

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.800
 Yeah, sorry.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800
 Not a capray.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.800
 Not the teenage turtle.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.800
 He had a--

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.800
 He lived in the sewers.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.800
 Great.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.800
 I read the other day.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.480
 I have any solid information on this.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.640
 They found in 2009, I think, it was about 60 kilometers more of the Great Wall of China,

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.360
 that they didn't know existed when they were doing a Google Earth survey of it.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.120
 They discovered a missing bit of the wall.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.840
 And they discovered a local village nearby, who had just obviously come across this wall

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.880
 and gone, well, no one seems to be using this.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.880
 And they took the bricks.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.280
 And they made a village out of it.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.280
 Yeah.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.880
 I think that happened with Hadrian as well, as well, didn't they?

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.360
 They took bits of the wall and just made houses out of it.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.960
 And with Rome in the Renaissance, they used old buildings to make new ones here.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.800
 I heard a brilliant fact about stones this week.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 Yeah.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.960
 So the world's largest piece of limestone.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.640
 You can see where all the elves are coming from for the L-Series of QI.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.080
 The world's largest piece of limestone is in Lebanon.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.480
 It was cut up by the Romans, and they were going to make a massive, great, big temple with

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.480
 it.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.040
 But once they cut it open, they realized that it was too big to carry.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.640
 And so it's still there when they cut it.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.640
 That's wonderful.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:53.640
 I read recently that the oldest thing on Earth, they know they know the oldest rock on

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.640
 Earth.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.640
 What?

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.560
 You would think that that's impossible, but it's a bit of a cheat.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.560
 It's a crystal.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.800
 It's a crystal that they found as 4.4 billion years old.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800
 Wow.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.800
 Yeah.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800
 So it's the oldest.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.240
 I love it when you have like a little object that you can date Ash, who's a friend of mine.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:18.520
 And for yes, in our theme tune, he has a chair in his house, which is a trunk, bit of a tree

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.520
 trunk.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.840
 But it's so old that it's crystallized.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.840
 Is it crystallized the word?

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.840
 No, what is it?

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.840
 Oh, petrified.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.840
 Petrified.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.080
 And so it's, but it feels like marble when you touch it.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.080
 And I was touching it.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.400
 And you kind of go, this is amazing enough.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.560
 And then he said, check this out.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.320
 This chair is older than flowers.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.320
 Wow.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.320
 That's great.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.320
 Oh my God.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.320
 That's amazing.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.960
 And my favorite thing, by the way, about the wall, the Great Wall of China is that, you know,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.160
 when they say, oh, we found a bit more Great Wall, you go, you expect it to be five more

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.160
 meters of it.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.240
 And then when they say 100 kilometers, that's just, I love it when things are found in

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.480
 such a ridiculous bulk.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.240
 One of my favorite facts of all time is Barbara Cartland, after she died, they discovered

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.240
 unpublished novels.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.000
 You know, like after an author dies and like, oh, we found unpublished novels, they found

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 160 unpublished novels.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.200
 But with the Great Wall, you would have just thought someone would have gone from one end

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.800
 to the other, just to say, like, I've seen it all now.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.800
 Yeah.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.800
 Not to draw that.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.800
 Why haven't they done that?

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.800
 I find it weird.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.800
 Well, there have been.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.480
 There were two conceptual artists who walked the length of the Great Wall of China towards

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.480
 each other.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.680
 And then they met in the middle and kissed each other once and then they never met again.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.280
 And that sounds like a dream or a very fancy film, but it's not.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.280
 It did happen.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.000
 The guy died this week, who was the person who kissed at the end of World War II.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Do you remember that?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Yeah, he did.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Iconic picture.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 Yes.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Did he die?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Yeah, he died this week.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.360
 Because I thought there was doubt over who it was.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.240
 I think these were the guys who are accepted because they have other pictures that look very

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.160
 similar to them, but there were other people who claimed to be.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.600
 After the war, he was a male carrier and some professional baseball player.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.600
 Oh, really?

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.600
 Yeah.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.040
 They were identified by the Houston Police Department forensic artist.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.920
 She took about 100 pictures of him using a pillow to pose as he did.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.440
 And she said she could match the muscles, ears and other features of the 80-year-old McDuffy

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.880
 to the sailor in the picture.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.200
 You don't want to be committing any crimes in Houston anytime soon, do you?

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.200
 You've got that.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.200
 Especially not near an artist.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.520
 You don't have to paint you at the time.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.560
 His name is Glenn McDuffy.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.120
 And after he was identified, he went around fundraisers and parties telling his story and

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.760
 women would pay $10 to kiss him on the cheek.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.960
 Why the cheek, though, that?

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.200
 I mean, that's not what they do in the photo.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.280
 You just thought you'd go for the full-on bent over backwards, wouldn't you?

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.760
 Otherwise, what's the point?

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.080
 Maybe that was a bit more, like £10 on the cheek, isn't it?

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.080
 Yeah.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.600
 He was changing trains in New York when he was told that Japan had surrendered.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.600
 He said, "I was so happy.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.920
 I ran out in the street," said Mr. McDuffy, then age 18, along his way to visit his girlfriend

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.920
 in Brooklyn.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.040
 And then I saw that nurse, he said.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.840
 She saw me hollering and with a big smile on my face, I just went right over to her and kissed

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.840
 her.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.880
 Afterwards, I just went on the subway across the street and went to Brooklyn.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.880
 Wow.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.880
 And you imagine if she's just reading the newspaper the next day and she just sees stuff?

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.680
 I know those muscles in that earlobe.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:28.920
 OK, um, yeah, my fact this week is there is a banker in Latvia who will lend you money

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.000
 using your immortal soul as security.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.800
 So what form do you hand over your immortal soul?

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.600
 When is it like a piece of paper you sign?

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.200
 No, it's just your word, do you think?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.200
 Your word?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.200
 I think so, yeah.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.680
 This guy is not very evil.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.680
 What?

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.600
 Weird thing is, he's an atheist and he doesn't believe in souls, this guy apparently.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:52.560
 And what his point is, is that a lot of people are not repaying their loans at the moment

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.320
 and he said, "I decided that in such times a man's word is more of precious pledge than

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.920
 a car or an apartment which had depreciating in value."

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.920
 How much money has he got?

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.920
 He sees trading.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.000
 Exactly, I imagine in that one debt he lent her all his money.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.040
 It was a maximum of $1,000 you could borrow.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.040
 Right.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.320
 There was a gaming company in 2010 who put in their terms and conditions you know the things

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.120
 that no one reads.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.040
 By placing an order you agree to grant us a non transferable option to claim for now

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.920
 and evermore your immortal soul.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.200
 Should we wish to exercise this option, you agree to surrender your immortal soul and

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.400
 any claim you may have on it within five working days.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:41.720
 Yeah, but the belief in soul is quite common, like even today in this country you'll get...

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.440
 I happen to know that in some hospitals when someone dies they'll open the window just

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.960
 so that the soul can escape.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.320
 Well, that is a question of a nurse with a superstition that is not policy.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.320
 I know it's not policies.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:59.200
 I can say to me that I could borrow money in exchange for my immortal soul.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.560
 I don't believe in my immortal soul, but I think I would hesitate before doing it.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.560
 Wouldn't you like to just incase?

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.600
 Right, so like I was saying before people in history always seem to believe that people

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.600
 live forever.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.760
 After you die you go on and you do something else.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.960
 There's a huge number of Chinese emperors who all died because they were seeking out the

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.960
 illiterate life.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.960
 Yeah, the chin.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.400
 The man who effectively unified China gave it its name.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.480
 He died because of his constant search for the illiterate life.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.780
 He did a number of things in his life.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.920
 He did the terracotta warriors.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.920
 And they still haven't gotten into it.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:37.600
 His main aerial place and it's incredible because the descriptions of it from legend were

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:44.400
 that it was made with a river of mercury and they've put pests to see if it's dangerous

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.640
 or not to go in and they levels of mercury are extremely high, extremely high.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.600
 So it kind of suggests that maybe he did make it contrary.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.440
 But he died from drinking mercury because he was told that he was going to live forever

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.440
 that way also.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.440
 Is that to some work, does it?

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.440
 Does exactly the opposite.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.640
 It does exactly the opposite.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.640
 The irony.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.840
 He was also told by a thousand-year-old wizard who he met once and could never find

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.840
 again.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.160
 That there was an island in which they would find the illiterate life.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.640
 He sent off a boat full of people and supposedly that boat never came back.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.120
 Supposedly that's the boat that founded Japan.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.400
 But also that he sent off another expedition after the first one didn't come back to look

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.160
 through the islands of the immortals.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.160
 Only one line came back saying that the herbs on the island were guarded by fierce whales

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.440
 and that the expedition had failed because they had been frightened by a huge fish.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.240
 Speaking of people living forever, there was a politician in America called Leonard Live

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.240
 Forever Jones.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:47.240
 He ran for Governor of Kentucky in the 1860s and he ran on a platform of being immortal.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.340
 And because he was immortal, he refused any medical help of any kind and he died of a chest

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.840
 cold in 1868.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.680
 Just with the age thing, I read this the other day which I found amazing.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:04.480
 The 10th president of America, John Tyler, born 1790.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.840
 His grandson is still alive.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.840
 Yeah.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.840
 Wow.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.840
 His grandson.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.840
 It's really impressive.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.840
 You know the oldest, the oldest complete skeleton found in Britain was the guy who was

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:20.120
 found in Chedigorge, who's 9,000 years old and you know they tried to trace some of his descendants.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.640
 They decided to just look in the local area and they found this guy, Adrian Target, who's

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:29.480
 a schoolteacher, who's a direct descendant on his mother's side of this 9,000 year old skeleton.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.520
 So he's now like, he's broken the world record for someone who can trace his descendants

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520
 back.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.520
 Oh.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.520
 Tracer's ancestry back to the furthest.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.160
 His wife said, this is all a bit of a surprise, but maybe it explains why he likes his

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:50.000
 steaks rare and it does explain everything's falling into place.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.480
 Do you guys know about Joyce Heff?

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.480
 No.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.480
 No.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.920
 She was a, she was, do you know P.T. Barnham, the great secretary in Prasario from the 19th

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.920
 century America?

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.920
 One one every minute.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.920
 Okay.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.440
 One one every minute, which he didn't ever say unfortunately.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:08.640
 But Joyce Heff was one of his earliest successors, she was 161 year old African-American

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.640
 woman.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.280
 Well, this is the thing.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:17.960
 She was part of his shows and he claimed she had been George Washington's nanny.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:25.840
 After she died, he hired someone to test it and the surgeon responsible said, and this woman

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.640
 is about 80 years old, which he claimed that the autopsie victim was another person and

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.920
 that the real Joyce Heff was alive in Europe during a tour.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.360
 It was good in those days when you could just walk around pretending to be something

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.360
 you could.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.360
 Yeah.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.120
 So, one of your favourite facts is about the two-headed Mexicans.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:53.200
 Pascal Fernan, the two-headed Mexican, he's got one head and he's from Texas.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:15:03.520
 Time to move on to fact number three, which is you, Hannah?

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.520
 Yeah.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:11.480
 So, I found out this week that for 100 years almost all the maps we had of Africa contained

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.720
 a mountain range that didn't exist.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.000
 They were called the Mountains of Kong.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.560
 It was this enormous mountain, yeah, it was, but the map first appeared in 1798.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.560
 It was an English jogger for James Reynolds who recorded the, you know, Mungo Park who went

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.560
 to Africa.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.560
 Yes.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.200
 So, he was recording the notes of Mungo Park and he just elaborated a bit and he invented

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.680
 the Mountains of Kong, which stretched like from the east side to the west side of Africa.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.160
 The only problem with it, I think, was that explorers then went there, but they, because he said

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.920
 it was impossible, he said they were mountains of stupendous height, it was in an insuperable

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.920
 barrier.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.560
 So, explorers didn't even bother to try and cross it.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.560
 Oh.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.240
 Because they didn't get, they were like, no, the mountains are over there, I can't get

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.240
 them.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.240
 The south side of Africa.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.240
 Yeah, let's go.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.240
 So, what should we keep going until we've hit the mountains?

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.240
 Take a picture?

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.240
 No, no, no.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.240
 We haven't even got to France yet.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.140
 We're going back to London, but that's my favorite fact about this whole thing is that there's

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:10.440
 an explorer whose main discovery was undiscovering the mountains of Kong.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.940
 His name is Louis Gustav Binger.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.280
 There's this town name approom, Bingerville.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.280
 It's in...

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.280
 It doesn't exist.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.280
 Yeah.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.280
 Basically, he donated up all the graphics.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.280
 But no, he did.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.440
 He discovered the mountains of Kong.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.120
 Speaking of places that don't exist, like Bingerville, Bingerville exists.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.120
 Okay.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:36.000
 Well, there's a place called Aglow in New York State, and it was made up by a guy.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.600
 He put it on a map, and he, I think it was Nanagram of his name or Nanagram of someone's

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600
 name.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.300
 And it was a completely made up thing, but it got copied by maps and copied by maps and

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.720
 copied by maps, and then someone put a gas station where it should be, and they called

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:55.400
 it Aglow gas station, and now there's house there, and now it has become a real place.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.400
 So now, he is...

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.400
 That's good to hear.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.400
 He is no longer a liar.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.400
 Yeah.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.840
 And the map will map's launch last year, or the year before was it, and all those errors

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.840
 that were hilarious.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:10.440
 One of which was the Senkaku islands, the Japan and China dispute, and Apple maps just made

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.440
 two.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.520
 So there was one on the Chinese side and one on the Japanese side, just like my side.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.520
 Isn't that nice?

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.320
 That's a good way of solving conflict.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.320
 It is a good way.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.320
 If it just made two crimeers, then Russian...

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.520
 You can't really have to worry about that.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.040
 Yeah, because how often do they really go there?

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.520
 They just want to write it down, don't they?

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.520
 That they own it.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.520
 They think they do.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.520
 Yeah.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.520
 They think it's as well.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.520
 Because the...

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.520
 Mexico wanted...

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.520
 There's a bit...

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.160
 A bear and me hat island is strategically important, because if you get the water around it,

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.640
 you get a little oil deposits, and unfortunately for Mexico, it also vanished several years ago.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.640
 So now they don't end up in that bit of water, it's...

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.640
 No, no.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.600
 Because what you do is you own a certain distance around your land.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.880
 And what it used to be, it was a distance that a cannon could fire.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.880
 So you'd let...

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.880
 You'd own...

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.920
 Say a cannon could fire 500 metres, that's the distance.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.560
 You would own out to sea.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.560
 Wow.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.560
 And it's changed over the sea.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.560
 Come to sea.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.560
 But that's what it originally was, yeah.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.560
 Wow.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.720
 I think that might've been in Reagan's time, certainly pretty sure it was in the 80s, America

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.840
 changed their rules and said, "Okay, it used to be the common distance.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.360
 Now we're going to say we actually own 10 kilometres out to sea."

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.240
 And that increased the area of the United States by an enormous amount.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.280
 I feel like we should mention, just in case there were people that I didn't know about

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.400
 California, in the fact that it was an island, until the 18th century, which is probably

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.800
 the most famous map cook-up and lasted from, I think it was, 1510, the first map appeared

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.800
 that made California into an island.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.160
 And yeah, like Frances Drake went out, sailed out there, caught her, sailed out there, all

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.640
 sent voyages out there.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.560
 And none of the managed to just come back and say, "No, it definitely isn't good."

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.040
 I think in one of the other Britannic as it said, it is unsure whether it is an island or

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.040
 peninsula.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.040
 Yeah.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.960
 There's a theory that it got confused with Guam, which is, if you look at a map, not

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.960
 very close at all.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.280
 It was a very long way away.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.280
 It was very far.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.880
 They were doing, yeah, they were bigging themselves up there claiming they'd sailed to Guam.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.280
 Do you know the Good Guam fact?

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.280
 No.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.480
 And so Guam is this island in the Pacific, owned by America.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.520
 They have a naval base there, and an air base there.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:17.520
 And they drop some snakes there, some brown snakes, by accident, one day, just a couple

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.520
 of them.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.640
 And with no other predators on the island, they multiplied and multiplied and multiplied.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.880
 And now the one is just covered in snakes.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.360
 I know the snake population.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:32.160
 They've now dropped dead poisoned mice onto the island, stuffed with 80 milligrams of

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:37.200
 parasitamol, which is deadly to brown trees snakes, tied to miniature cardboard parachutes.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:43.640
 I've read a story which is in the news about a mystery ghost ship that's carrying nothing

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.640
 but cannibal rats.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.640
 That's a very, it's the same thing.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.200
 They've multiplied and multiplied, and now they're worried that this ship is going

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.200
 to...

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.200
 They don't know if the ship is still out there, because they think storm is fine.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.240
 It's been seen to our island, wasn't it?

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.240
 But it's amazing.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.240
 You could say they were pyratts.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.240
 Yeah.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.240
 Just around the window.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.240
 Yeah, just a nice environment.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.240
 Very good.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.240
 Here we go.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.240
 I have seen this.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.240
 This has been debunked.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.240
 Apparently there are no more inclined to eat one another than humans.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.320
 Dr. Penny Hawkins of the RSPCA said, rats have a really bad press, and this doesn't

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.320
 help.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:25.400
 Okay, let's head to the final fact of the show, fact number four, and let's see you, Andy.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:31.200
 Okay, this is that male Pennsylvania grass spiders are much more likely to approach a female

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.320
 for sex if she has recently killed and eaten another male.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.320
 Exactly.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.640
 Because I think she's already sated, so maybe she won't eat them.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.640
 This is the thing.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:45.800
 If females typically only eat one male, so if your girlfriend is already killed and eaten

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.680
 one male, she's probably not going to kill and eat it.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.680
 Yeah, it's you, it's the theory.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.680
 So you think that for me.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.680
 Yeah.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:58.720
 And also, this is, some females don't kill and eat males, and there's these blurred lines.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.720
 Exactly.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.600
 Because you'd be waiting the whole time going, so if you eat in any one reason, wait.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.600
 I don't remember.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.600
 That's why you wouldn't approach.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.520
 Because if you knew that females ate generally only one male, you would think, oh,

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.600
 well, I'll definitely go over the one who's definitely not going to eat me.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.600
 Yeah.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.000
 The redbacks actually ask for it, don't they?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.600
 The redback male spiders sort of beg to be eaten, and I don't think people are 100% sure

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.600
 why.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.240
 So basically, they come up to the female who's like 50 times as big as them, and they get

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.680
 onto that abdomen, and they put their palp, their kind of spider penis, into the lady.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.760
 And then while they're doing that, they also use their palp to kind of sum assault themselves

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.880
 into the spider's mouth, and then she chooses them, because she's got two openings, so they

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.960
 can put the palp in both, and it's best if they get in there with both.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.160
 They, so they repel themselves into her mouth.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.560
 She feeds on them for a bit, so she sucks food out of this, like, males, abdomen, while

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.720
 he's still inserted into her.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.440
 And then he inserts himself into, like, whole number two, and then spins back again into

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.760
 her mouth to let her eat the rest of him.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:00.760
 Good grief.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.360
 And there are more, which, there are more males which have techniques for not being

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.000
 eaten, though, those species which don't want to be.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.080
 So some tetrag-nathid, please don't write them with pronunciation, though, spiders, have

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:19.400
 specialized jaws, which hold open the jaws of females during copulation, because they basically

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.920
 carry around sticks with which they can just leave her open her mouth, even though it takes

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.920
 to have sex.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.920
 I know.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.920
 Yeah.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.920
 Yeah.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:32.320
 The golden op spider is very similar to the first guy you were talking about, but they

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:37.800
 will only mate, or they prefer to mate with a spider who is currently eating another male,

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.240
 because she's busy eating, so she's just like, during dinner, he'll prefer to do it.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.240
 Don't mind me.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.240
 Just here.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.240
 Wow.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.440
 That's pretty much ultimate wingman behaviour, isn't it?

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.440
 Don't worry.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.440
 I'll take the flak for this one.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:55.600
 I really wish that women had what loads of other animals have, loads of spiders in sex,

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:01.160
 slugs, reptiles, birds have, and including the red-backed spider, which is cryptic female

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.160
 choice.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:08.400
 Which is basically, it is the ability if someone has recently had sex with you to decide whether

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.960
 or not you're going to bother accepting their sperm and allow you to fertilise you.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:17.520
 So they think that might be why it's good to get eaten as a red-backed by the woman, because

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.520
 then she likes you.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.280
 She's like, "Oh, yeah, you sacrifice yourself to me.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.280
 All right, fine.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.160
 I'll let your sperm fertilise my egg."

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.200
 So they can, she can literally say, "Oh, not really, didn't we like you?"

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.200
 And how tasty it was, mate.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.200
 Yeah, I guess so.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.200
 Yeah, you were delicious.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.200
 Oh, definitely have your offspring.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.200
 That's amazing.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200
 But I like the term cryptic female choice.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200
 Yes, that is wonderful.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.200
 So cannibalism is quite common in animal kingdom, not just in spires, is it?

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200
 Yeah, I love it.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.200
 Yeah.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200
 One of my favourite ones are those sharks.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.200
 I can't remember the species, but they, in the womb, there's more than one shark.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.920
 So they haven't been born yet, but they will fight each other and eat each other before

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.920
 they're even born.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:59.920
 And I like the octopuses who will eat their own arm if they're stressed.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.920
 So it's like auto cannibalism.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.920
 Yeah.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.920
 That's kind of why they'd want to what purpose does that serve?

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.920
 Just stressed.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.920
 Come to me down.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.920
 Come to me down.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:08.920
 It's just like biting your nails.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.920
 Have a cup of tea.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.920
 And eat this.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:16.920
 I would cease to become so soon into the process of eating my own arm.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.920
 So going back to spiders, they have cannibals, aren't they?

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.920
 I remember reading, I don't know if this fact is true or not, but if you put 10,000 spiders in a room

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.920
 and just leave them to themselves, then they'll all keep eating each other.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.920
 And in the end, you'll just end up with one big fat, satiated spider.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.920
 So it's body would just be building on tiny legs.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.920
 Wouldn't it be?

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.920
 Wouldn't that be okay?

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.920
 It's legs aren't going to grow.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.920
 The spiders don't feed very often do this.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.920
 That's not even the loose bones.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.920
 And we should become giants.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.920
 It's all eating giants.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.920
 There'll be one big guy called Barry.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:52.920
 Do you know that spiders' brains are so big enough that they spill into their legs?

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.920
 They're not big enough.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.920
 Their heads are so small.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.920
 They're right there.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920
 What's that again?

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.920
 So their brains spill into their legs?

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.920
 They have very small bodies, as I said.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.920
 Very small heads, but they're mostly legs.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.920
 So some spiders, the brains, will spill into their legs because the brains are bigger than the heads.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.920
 It would be annoying to think that every time you've tripped over and grazed your knee,

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.920
 you might have brain damage.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.920
 Imagine how stressed you'd be at home.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.920
 Yeah, you'd probably bite your own arm off.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.920
 But lions kill each other, which I didn't really realise.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.920
 I know I'm so if a female lion has got a bunch of cubs that she's nursing

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.920
 and a male lion sees her and thinks, "Actually, I want to copulate with her."

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.920
 He can go and kill all the cubs, but within 24 hours of the male murdering their cubs,

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.920
 they'll be back on eat.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.920
 They recover that fast.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920
 There's no morning period.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.920
 They're just like, they're dead.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:44.920
 So the Lion King really would just been the rest of them going for a Simba.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:45.920
 Just get over it mate.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.920
 Move on, have some sex.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.920
 You're missing out on sex by me.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.920
 And you were telling us about how often they have sex.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.920
 Yes, when lions are in heat, it's 20 to 40 times a day.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.920
 But it's always very for very short periods.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.920
 Each coupling, as they call it, lasts for maybe 30 seconds.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.920
 Well, wasn't there something about ladybirds about that?

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:10.920
 Yes, ladybirds have, they have a lot of sex, but they have sex for a very long time as well.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.920
 So often it's for at least one or two hours.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.920
 Sometimes it's up to nine hours, but that's mostly because the male wants to prevent the female

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.920
 from mating with any other males.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.920
 But also, male ladybirds are so indiscriminate with who they approach that when they meet another ladybird,

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.920
 they will mount it, whether it's the same species of ladybird, whether or not it's the same sex.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.920
 If it's a male ladybird, they mount.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.920
 They just quickly dismount and pretend nothing's happened and walk off.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:35.920
 Does it even have to be a ladybird?

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.920
 Like, when a ladybird flies lands on my arm, does it think that it's going to be me?

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.920
 What if I'm reading a ladybird?

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.920
 (laughter)

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.920
 It's the most beautiful ladybird ever.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:54.920
 Okay, that's our show.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.920
 Thanks everyone for listening.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.920
 If you want to find out more about any of the subjects we've been talking about,

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.920
 we're going to put links, we're going to put videos, we're going to put pictures,

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.920
 and so on on our ki.com/podcastpage.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:11.920
 We're also going to be on Twitter, constantly monitoring any ads that you have for us about things that we've said.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.920
 Either wrong or right, if you just want to chat to us generally, say hi.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.920
 I'm on @tribaland, Andy.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.920
 I'm Andrew Hunter-M.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.920
 I am @texshaped.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.920
 And still not on Twitter, but buckling very quickly.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.920
 So at the time of this podcast going out, she's at Quickopedia.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.920
 And that's the official ki account.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.920
 We're going to be back again next week with another episode of No Such Thing as a Bish.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.920
 And we'll see you then.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.920
 Goodbye.
