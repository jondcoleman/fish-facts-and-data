00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,240
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,200
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,960
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,720
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,080
 from the last seven days.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,600
 And in no particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,800
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,040
 Okay, my fact this week is that the world's best Tetris player is a 13 year old from Texas.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,640
 The world's second best player is his 15 year old brother.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,280
 Are they also the only remaining Tetris players left on the planet?

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,880
 No!

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,480
 Anna, I'll tell you.

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,240
 It is hugely popular Anna.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,720
 Yeah, the third best is done by the sounds of it.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,040
 The only other player.

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,960
 I just think imagine being in that family like your two year younger brother beats you

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,400
 in the world championships.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,040
 But at least you are, you know, at least you're the second best.

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,080
 So the best player is called Dog Playing Tetris.

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,880
 I don't think that's his real name.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,960
 He beat his brother whose name is Pixel Andy.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,760
 The surname of these two people is Arteaga.

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,000
 And if you go online, you can watch the final.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,400
 It's only one hour and 15 minutes with all the interviews as well,

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,600
 which is 13 minutes shorter than the stop on my mum will shoot.

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,360
 So it's a good use of your time if you want to.

29
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,640
 But this is an interesting thing, I think,

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,120
 which is that all the best Tetris players in the world were people of my age

31
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,960
 who kind of grew up with it.

32
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,960
 And then very recently, suddenly all these kids have come in

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,520
 and started kicking everyone's ass at Tetris.

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,720
 And the reason is that if you think about how I would play Tetris

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,400
 as a kid, I would be like on my Game Boy or whatever playing on my own

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,760
 and wouldn't really talk to anyone else about it and would just have to learn it.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,080
 Whereas these days they learn it all on YouTube

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
 and they're all swapping tips and all that kind of stuff.

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,680
 And so the standard of Tetris has just gone through the roof in the last few years.

40
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,080
 I mean, just leave it to us.

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
 Why are they stealing Tetris from us?

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,400
 They've got a billion new fangled, colourful, high pixel games.

43
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
 Just let us have Tetris.

44
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,760
 No, it's new Tetrises. They're different games.

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,440
 It's not like the same Game Boy.

46
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,360
 That's like saying we shouldn't watch football anymore

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,120
 because the Great Manchester United team of 1990 is no longer together.

48
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,920
 But wait a minute.

49
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,480
 I mean, it's still blocks coming down from the roof.

50
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,680
 And in the World Championships, they are playing pretty much classic Tetris.

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,520
 So the basic formula is pretty unchanged.

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,560
 This is the same game.

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,320
 Yeah. The classic Tetris World Championships only dates from 2010,

54
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,840
 which I think is a massive swish anyway,

55
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,360
 because it sounds like it's been going for centuries.

56
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,040
 It started as a documentary, the World Tetris Championships.

57
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,040
 There was a few people online arguing about who was the greatest ever player

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,600
 and someone decided, well, let's get all these people together

59
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,280
 and have them play against each other.

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,280
 In that World Championships, the winner was a guy called Jonas Neubauer,

61
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,600
 who unfortunately died earlier this year.

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
 But one interesting thing about it, what I was saying,

63
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,360
 about how you would kind of learn on your own and now you learn on YouTube,

64
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,200
 there was the fourth place person was a woman called Dana Wilcox.

65
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,240
 There was only two women in this Championships and she came fourth.

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,160
 And when she turned up to the Championships,

67
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,960
 that was the first time she learned that you can flip the

68
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,520
 blocks in two different directions either clockwise or anti-clockwise.

69
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,240
 Oh, no way.

70
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,440
 And she'd become like one of the top 10 players in the whole world

71
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,960
 without even knowing that.

72
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,000
 How is that possible?

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,800
 That's amazing.

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,520
 Yeah.

75
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,440
 I'm trying to remember if I knew that.

76
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,680
 No, I don't think I did.

77
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,560
 I don't think I did.

78
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,760
 I lost to history.

79
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,240
 Yes.

80
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,680
 You know that champion you mentioned, James, Jonas Neubauer?

81
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,320
 Yeah.

82
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,680
 He won eight of the first 10 classic Tetris World Championships

83
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,120
 and he came second in the other two.

84
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
 So he's really very good at Tetris.

85
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,120
 And he wrote an article in 2019 about his life in Tetris, basically,

86
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,920
 which was lovely.

87
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,680
 And he said, "Tetris has helped me to make quick and plentiful decisions

88
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
 in everyday life.

89
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,280
 Have you ever been to a restaurant with a 12-page menu?

90
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,160
 I can scan the choices and make a decision almost immediately

91
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,520
 without a shred of regret.

92
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,520
 Even if they bring me the wrong order, I'll make it work."

93
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,320
 I love that.

94
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,280
 I just think.

95
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,920
 Wow.

96
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,320
 Yeah.

97
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,760
 How does he relate this exactly?

98
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,480
 Sorry, what's the logic leap between his Tetris champion status

99
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,160
 and the fact he's fast ordering in restaurants?

100
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,360
 Because you see the options.

101
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,880
 You see the options in front of you.

102
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,040
 You get presented with a range of choices and you think,

103
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,560
 "Bang, I know how to make that work."

104
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,520
 I see.

105
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,240
 I thought he was just, he was so desperate to get back to his Game Boy

106
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,880
 that he can't find a funny around choosing meals.

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,000
 Do you think he only orders things like fish fingers and sausages

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,920
 that are coming in that kind of blocky shape?

109
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,840
 Absolutely, absolutely.

110
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,160
 Square potato waffle.

111
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,120
 Yeah.

112
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,760
 That's too funny.

113
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,000
 I actually watched an incredible moment in Tetris history.

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,840
 It was Kevin Birrell who became the first ever Western Grandmaster.

115
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,600
 So there's never been a Western Grandmaster outside of Japan.

116
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,120
 And he recorded the video that allowed him to become a Grandmaster.

117
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,480
 And what you need to do in order to get to Grandmaster level

118
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,400
 is you complete Tetris and you then have to play

119
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,040
 with invisible blocks over the credits.

120
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,240
 And Kevin Birrell recorded him doing this.

121
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,520
 It's a minute 40 seconds, which is 48 seconds shorter than,

122
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,600
 "Stop on my mum will shoot the trailer on YouTube."

123
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,200
 So you can save some time there.

124
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,320
 And you watch him going, "Tetris," when he says that,

125
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,960
 and the moment that he wins it and becomes Grandmaster,

126
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,640
 you are just with him.

127
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,440
 It's heaven.

128
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,720
 And he's jumping around the room.

129
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,760
 Yeah.

130
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,280
 Do you think that any Grandmaster,

131
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,560
 I'm going to use inverted commas for that, in Tetris,

132
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,120
 has ever been introduced to a chess Grandmaster

133
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
 and really claimed, looked them in the eye and said,

134
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,640
 "I'm a Grandmaster too."

135
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,000
 To have a Grandmaster Club

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,880
 where all the Grandmasters of all the different games meet up.

137
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,520
 The chess people aren't letting the Tetris guys in that club.

138
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,080
 Why?

139
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,320
 They are turning those guys away at the door.

140
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,680
 You're a Grandmaster and Tetris.

141
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,000
 Yeah.

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,480
 Yeah, no.

143
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,240
 Your instinctive finger movements are at a level of no other human.

144
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,000
 Chess people take hours to play the game.

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,920
 They take single move.

146
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,440
 That's a fair point.

147
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,320
 They're winning on speed.

148
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,120
 True.

149
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,480
 We haven't talked about the origins of it,

150
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,440
 how it was officially owned by the Soviet Union.

151
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
 It was this guy, Alexei Pajitnov,

152
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,400
 who worked at the USSR's Academy of Science

153
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,280
 in their computer lab.

154
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,720
 And he liked making games.

155
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,200
 And he liked geometric games.

156
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
 And there was one which involved pentominos.

157
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,760
 Whereas Tetris users, what are they called?

158
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,680
 They're called tetrominoes, because it's four.

159
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
 And he had made this game.

160
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,440
 He didn't really know how to publish it.

161
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,040
 And it was already being pirated overseas

162
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,480
 because of how popular it was.

163
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,120
 So he gave the rights to the government for 10 years.

164
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,480
 And then the KGB got involved at one point

165
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,400
 in terms of the rights selling.

166
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,920
 They always did, didn't they?

167
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,280
 They liked to have a finger in most pies back in the day.

168
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,840
 Yeah.

169
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,640
 He named it after quite odd stuff.

170
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,800
 So Tetris, the Tetris and Tetris, that's just the four.

171
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,440
 But then the isp bit is because his favorite sport was tennis.

172
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,480
 It was mostly more for a man who devotes his life

173
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,720
 to sitting in front of a computer screen designing games.

174
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
 But I suppose you've got to have another hobby.

175
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,920
 So yeah, Tetris and tennis.

176
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,560
 And I quite like the whole ominos thing.

177
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
 This grew out of the domino,

178
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,800
 which was the original domino,

179
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,640
 which is just a piece with two bits.

180
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,040
 And then someone decided in sort of,

181
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,880
 I think the 60s or 70s to make polyominoes a thing.

182
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,120
 So that's one of those shapes

183
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,360
 with various numbers of squares in them.

184
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,320
 So yeah, you've got dominoes, you've got triominoes,

185
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,680
 you've got pentominoes.

186
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,760
 Did you say there was an original omino?

187
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,600
 Or is that just the...

188
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,480
 This is a botched etymology.

189
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,360
 No, that's the stem.

190
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,920
 Uh-huh.

191
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,800
 I don't think it is, though,

192
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,760
 because the dot in domino doesn't mean two.

193
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,600
 No, no, it's not a proper set.

194
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,840
 The dot was domino was a thing.

195
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,120
 And then a person said,

196
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
 "Oh, DOS sounds a bit like it could mean two.

197
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,280
 So let's create this whole class of things."

198
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,400
 It's fraudulent.

199
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,640
 It's a fraudulent etymology, is what I'm saying.

200
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,400
 Domino derives from a word.

201
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,200
 It was originally, we think, a hood that priests...

202
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,600
 Yes, Dominican monks, isn't it?

203
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,480
 Yeah, exactly.

204
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,200
 And so the domino was the hood worn by the Dominican monks.

205
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,640
 You know, it doesn't mean anything.

206
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,160
 So what should we call it then?

207
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,960
 I haven't got an alternative etymology just lined up,

208
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,160
 because I'm not a faker.

209
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,440
 I wouldn't do that to you guys.

210
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,880
 Okay.

211
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,400
 I mean, you seem quite angry about it.

212
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,360
 You had a few hours.

213
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,640
 I would happily call it a dot domino,

214
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,760
 because it's four sections,

215
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,360
 and that could be two dominoes together.

216
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,160
 Yeah.

217
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,120
 Yeah.

218
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,320
 Just sounds like you've got stutter.

219
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,240
 Do you know why Tetris is so addictive?

220
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,400
 This is due to something called the zygarnic effect.

221
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,960
 And what it is, is that your brain is hardwired

222
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,600
 to whenever there's an incomplete task,

223
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,680
 you really, really want to fix it.

224
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,880
 And so when the Tetris things come down,

225
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,720
 every time you do complete a task

226
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,040
 and you get rid of one or four of the lines,

227
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,480
 then it always kind of gives you more things to do,

228
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,640
 because there are more holes that you need to fill

229
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,520
 and stuff like that.

230
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,560
 And this was invented by a woman called Bluma Zygarnic,

231
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,080
 who was Lithuanian,

232
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,720
 and she worked this out quite early in her career.

233
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,800
 And then she went on to get a job working for the Soviet Union,

234
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,280
 but she carried on as a part-time research scientist,

235
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,200
 which I quite like because she was all about

236
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,560
 kind of incomplete tasks,

237
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,880
 and she decided to carry on working part-time on it.

238
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,640
 And then she won the Lewin Memorial Award,

239
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,440
 but unfortunately the Soviet Union wouldn't let her collect it,

240
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,960
 and she died before she could collect it.

241
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,000
 So again, that's another incomplete task in her life.

242
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,520
 So she died happy, probably.

243
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,480
 Yeah.

244
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,040
 She died doing what she loved, not completing a task.

245
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,760
 Yeah, exactly.

246
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,680
 And then there's the Tetris effect,

247
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,240
 which we will have all suffered from.

248
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,040
 I imagine.

249
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,200
 Yes.

250
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,640
 The Tetris effects.

251
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,800
 I think this is coined by a wire writer in the '90s,

252
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,960
 but basically where you start seeing Tetris blocks wherever you look.

253
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,680
 You start, you know,

254
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,120
 when everyone played Tetris in the '90s,

255
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,400
 you close your eyes and you just see Tetris blocks falling in front of the greens.

256
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,440
 And you can expand the Tetris effects to lots of other things.

257
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,240
 So it basically means that you're doing something so much

258
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,920
 to such a stupid extent

259
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,200
 that everything in it is overlaid on the reality around you.

260
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,000
 So sea legs is another example of the Tetris effects.

261
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,520
 So you get off a boat.

262
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,080
 Oh, yeah.

263
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,360
 So you're not at sea anymore,

264
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,960
 and yet you still feel like you're at sea.

265
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,520
 Yeah, right.

266
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,040
 Your body's too used to it.

267
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,080
 Very nice.

268
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,880
 Did you guys hear about the other study that was done on Tetris

269
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,440
 about how it can help with traumatic memories?

270
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,400
 This is amazing.

271
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,560
 It's if you, you've suffered some kind of trauma.

272
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,760
 Okay, so in this incident,

273
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,560
 it was people who'd been in a traumatic car accident.

274
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,080
 If you play Tetris for 20 minutes within six hours of the car crash,

275
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,800
 you'll get 62% fewer intrusive memories in the following week.

276
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,160
 It seems to prevent negative memories and flashbacks from even forming.

277
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,680
 Because you think of Tetris instead or no?

278
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,560
 I don't know.

279
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,800
 It's kind of that within those first hours

280
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,400
 is when the memories get consolidated for long-term storage, basically.

281
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,960
 So if you just disrupt during that time,

282
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,640
 Tetris seems to be especially good at it,

283
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,040
 although I'm sure there are other things which could do it as well.

284
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,600
 It kind of prevents the memories from forming in the first place,

285
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
 and then you don't get flashbacks later down the line.

286
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,200
 What if the terrible memory that you have is of being a 15-year-old

287
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,680
 and your younger brother beats you in the well Tetris final?

288
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,920
 You should play Super Mario.

289
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,600
 Just briefly back to Alexei, the inventor of Tetris.

290
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,880
 I love that the very first version of it,

291
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,840
 he built on a computer that had no graphics capabilities.

292
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,440
 So he had to make a text version of the game.

293
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,440
 So the blocks were basically brackets put next to each other.

294
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,640
 That was the first version.

295
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,120
 And then Alexei didn't just invent Tetris.

296
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,080
 He sort of quite quickly invented newer versions of the game.

297
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,400
 So did any one of you guys play Hattris?

298
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,840
 Hats come down with different, like a top hat and the, yeah.

299
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,200
 It's literally that, it's literally that.

300
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,480
 It's Tetris with hats and hats come down and you have to line them up.

301
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
 So he invented Hattris and then...

302
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
 I thought it was just playing Tetris three times.

303
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,000
 It sounds a bit like it's called a Hattris.

304
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,600
 That would be a fake etymology, Anna.

305
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,880
 So sorry.

306
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,920
 Yeah. So five hats of identical style had to be stacked.

307
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,080
 And that's how you would remove them.

308
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,960
 And entertainment weekly at the time said,

309
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,520
 there is after all a cure for Tetris addiction.

310
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,480
 It's Hattris habit that's even harder to kick.

311
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,480
 There's word Tris as well, which was another Alexei game.

312
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,720
 So word Tris, I actually think would be really fun.

313
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,640
 The idea is that you had to create blocks of three letters.

314
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,280
 So letters would drop and you'd have to create a word.

315
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,760
 So you could make it, it's basically like a big crossword

316
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,320
 and you just have to decide where to land a letter,

317
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,520
 hoping, yeah, the next one, yeah, pretty cool game.

318
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,520
 Do you know, I think that James would have point blank,

319
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,560
 refused to play Tetris when it first came to the world.

320
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,440
 So it was Andy sort of referenced it earlier,

321
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,400
 but it was a big deal that it was a Soviet export.

322
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
 And it was really, and no one had ever really

323
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,360
 exported something for financial gains in the Soviet Union before

324
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,960
 because it was so difficult to do

325
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,120
 because that just wasn't what they were about, obviously.

326
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,400
 So came out and the West was kind of very excited

327
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,920
 and it seems like the Soviet Union aspect was a bit of a gimmick.

328
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,880
 So they included the right visuals

329
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
 on the Tetris packaging for the West.

330
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,600
 And so, of course, when you got the Tetris box.

331
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,480
 Oh my God, I know.

332
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,040
 Backwards are, backwards are.

333
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,520
 Oh my days.

334
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,880
 I'm afraid it was backwards are.

335
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,360
 Oh my.

336
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,720
 I'm afraid it was spelled with the backwards are.

337
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,600
 Brilliant practice.

338
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,720
 Absolutely furious.

339
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,480
 It's really, I think it's like the Tetris effect

340
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,680
 that when you learn in Russian

341
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,320
 and you just see these backwards letters everywhere,

342
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,560
 you can only read them because you're used to doing it.

343
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,160
 You can only read them in the correct way.

344
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,400
 And it just, none of the words make any sense.

345
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,320
 Maybe we're supposed to be pronouncing Tetris that way.

346
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,000
 So how should we be pronouncing it, James?

347
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,800
 It would be like.

348
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,440
 But then also there's no I in the Russian language that looks like an I.

349
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,160
 So.

350
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,760
 I'm now picturing how pissed off James

351
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,400
 must have been going to buy this backward are Tetris

352
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,320
 as he's walking into Toys R Us to get it.

353
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,200
 [LAUGHTER]

354
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,480
 Hey, can I give you one last fact?

355
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,920
 Which is that the link between Tetris and cats.

356
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,760
 Was there a catress them?

357
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,680
 There wasn't a catress.

358
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,440
 I mean cats, the musical specifically.

359
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,160
 Oh.

360
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,800
 Oh.

361
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,320
 Which is that the text theme reached number six

362
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,640
 in the UK charts in 1992.

363
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,960
 And Andrew Lloyd Webber was the man behind it.

364
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,840
 I bought it.

365
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,640
 I remember.

366
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,520
 Did he really?

367
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,400
 Yeah, yeah.

368
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,120
 He had a pseudonym.

369
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,520
 He said he had the pseudonym Dr. Spin.

370
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,760
 So you, James, walking to the shots would have just thought,

371
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,240
 "Oh, I'm going to get the cool new track by Dr. Spin."

372
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,520
 It was actually Andrew Lloyd Webber.

373
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,240
 I think we knew at the time that it was Lloyd Webber.

374
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,880
 I think.

375
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,240
 I can't really remember it very well.

376
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,680
 But it was like at the time,

377
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,280
 a lot of video games kind of came out as dance tracks.

378
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,000
 OK.

379
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,960
 Oh, cool.

380
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,840
 Andrew Lloyd Webber composed the tune.

381
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,280
 No, he remixed it, didn't he?

382
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,760
 Because it's an old, it's a very old, well, it's in Tetris.

383
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,280
 So it sort of existed.

384
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,560
 It's a Russian folksong.

385
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,040
 Yeah.

386
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,680
 Yeah.

387
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,760
 It's by Nikolai Nekrasov.

388
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
 And it's the story of a young peddler

389
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,320
 who seduces a peasant girl in a field of rye.

390
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,040
 And he keeps saying that he'll offer her

391
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,960
 like some of his goods in return for a kiss slash a shag.

392
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,520
 And then she accepts a ring from him

393
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,840
 and he goes to sell his wares.

394
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,280
 And he says, "When I get all my money,

395
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,400
 then we'll kind of get married and stuff."

396
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,160
 And that's where the song ends.

397
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,680
 But the original poem, he actually gets robbed

398
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,800
 and killed by a forest ranger when he asks for directions

399
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,080
 on his way to the market.

400
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,840
 But that's not in the song.

401
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,720
 Game over.

402
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:11,360
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

403
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,120
 My fact this week is that the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh

404
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,720
 has ruled that all government offices must be cleaned

405
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,000
 with cow urine on pain of death.

406
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,360
 No, it's not death.

407
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,960
 But it is a new ruling.

408
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,720
 So Madhya Pradesh is the second biggest Indian state in size

409
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,200
 and it's got 72 million people living in it.

410
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,720
 And the government has released an order

411
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,520
 saying that usually they'll use chemically made fennel,

412
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,160
 P-H-E-N-Y-L, sort of chemical.

413
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,280
 Oh, right, not there.

414
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,000
 Oh, yeah.

415
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,080
 Not the aniseed tasting vegetable.

416
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,240
 Sorry, they're not just rubbing licorice flavour

417
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,400
 all over the offices, although that would be awesome.

418
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,280
 And they have to use cow urine instead

419
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,000
 or use sort of an acid extracted from cow urine.

420
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,480
 And the decision was made in a cow cabinet

421
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,400
 that was held for the last year.

422
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,600
 I think it's kind of quite a similar fennel or fennel

423
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,440
 that they make from the cow urine, isn't it?

424
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,520
 It's kind of a very similar thing.

425
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,880
 And is it the insides of the offices

426
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,080
 or is it like the walls on the outside or what do you know?

427
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,440
 Oh, I think it's the insides.

428
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,320
 I thought it was sort of like floors and surfaces.

429
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,080
 Yeah, so in place of detergent, right?

430
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,320
 Yeah, that's what you scrub with.

431
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,800
 And the idea is they want to create demand for cow urine

432
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,600
 in order that the state sets up loads of cow urine

433
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,440
 bottling factories and cow urine extraction factories.

434
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,280
 So they think that if they make this ruling

435
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,560
 that they'll have to set up factories

436
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,080
 that manufacture cow urine for them.

437
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,760
 Okay, and the idea is that at the moment people keep cows,

438
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,880
 especially for milking,

439
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,640
 but then the male cows are often kind of abandoned often.

440
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,880
 And so by creating this demand,

441
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,360
 it means that if you have a male cow,

442
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,800
 then you might not abandon it

443
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,440
 because you can milk it for its urine.

444
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,840
 Ah, that's a purpose.

445
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,240
 I would have thought looking into the amount

446
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,880
 that cow urine is used in India for various different things,

447
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,080
 you wouldn't have a need for sort of creating more demand.

448
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,520
 Yeah, well, there's a thing there,

449
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,920
 which is that there are literally millions and millions

450
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,880
 and millions of cows on the loose in India,

451
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,320
 too sacred to be killed to the Hindu religion.

452
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
 And so it is a supply and demand situation,

453
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,360
 but unfortunately the supply is so massive compared

454
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,920
 with a number of people willing to use cow urine for whatever.

455
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
 So what else do they use it for, Dan?

456
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,320
 So, you know, some people drink it there.

457
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,640
 It's seen as a health drink.

458
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,160
 I read particularly about one of Bollywood's biggest actors,

459
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,960
 Akshay Kumar, who drinks it every single day

460
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,640
 because it's part of his fitness regime.

461
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,240
 So that's one of the things.

462
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,800
 It's used for religious services as well.

463
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,160
 So if a new baby is born

464
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,560
 and you want to sort of bless your house for good luck,

465
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,680
 you might, you know, put some cow urine around the house

466
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,800
 in order to do that.

467
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,160
 In fact, they sell it in London.

468
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,120
 You can buy cow urine in London specifically for that,

469
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,840
 that I believe is imported sometimes from India,

470
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,080
 but also they manufacture it in Watford.

471
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,040
 And it's called Gal-Mutra.

472
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,000
 And there was a BBC report where they found it being sold

473
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,280
 in certain shops sort of on the shelf above the naan bread.

474
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,200
 And there was questions about whether or not

475
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,360
 you should be doing that because it's...

476
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,120
 Yeah, we should say this doesn't, it doesn't work.

477
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,160
 It's not good for your health.

478
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,680
 No, it doesn't help anything.

479
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,200
 It doesn't have health properties.

480
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,080
 We know that.

481
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,600
 Do we know that for sure?

482
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,160
 No, we don't know.

483
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,840
 But I imagine it works no better than placebo

484
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,920
 and in lots of cases, quite a lot worse than placebo.

485
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,000
 It can contain harmful bacteria and cause diseases

486
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,200
 such as leptospirosis, whatever that is.

487
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,240
 Oh, right.

488
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,600
 But are they in India where technology, science

489
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,640
 is such a big thing?

490
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,120
 Is there a big split between the people

491
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,960
 who believe that this is useful than the people?

492
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,280
 Is it kind of like homeopathy over there?

493
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,520
 It's not seen as part of science.

494
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,240
 It is, but obviously it's incredibly widespread.

495
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,880
 So it's part of the Ayurveda medicine, isn't it?

496
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,000
 Which 80% of people in India would subscribe to that

497
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,360
 to some extent, I think.

498
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,640
 But there definitely is a divide.

499
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,320
 So for instance, here with this ruling,

500
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,960
 there is a rival body that's been set up,

501
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,040
 which has launched a competition

502
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,360
 to challenge people to apply the scientific method

503
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,120
 to all these claims that the government's releasing

504
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
 about the good that cow urine can do

505
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,400
 and basically prove that it can't do any good.

506
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,880
 Because it's a big push by the government.

507
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,840
 It's huge at the moment.

508
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,920
 So there are cow ministries popping up

509
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,120
 all over the country and cow ministers in states.

510
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
 And it's kind of related a little bit

511
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,760
 to obviously a bit of Hindu nationalism

512
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,200
 at the top of government

513
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,600
 and it promotes that side of things.

514
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,200
 So yeah, there is a divide, but it's really widespread.

515
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,760
 Okay.

516
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,400
 Hey, by the way, if you spill your cup of cow urine

517
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,160
 while you're drinking it in the office,

518
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,280
 do you just sort of leave it?

519
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,920
 Because it's what cleans up the office now?

520
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,040
 Well, okay.

521
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,760
 If you are in the office and you have a glass of water

522
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,120
 and you spill it, do you just leave that?

523
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,880
 Well, you've asked the wrong person here.

524
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,560
 But would a normal person clean up?

525
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,760
 Yes, I imagine they won't.

526
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,160
 Well, yeah, I think you can analogize from that.

527
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,800
 Yeah, it is really good analogy.

528
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,760
 It is really bad.

529
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,680
 Lots of scientists in India have basically

530
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,120
 been under governmental pressure

531
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,880
 to make research proposals

532
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,600
 on the subject of Gomutra, which is cow urine.

533
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,080
 Or the related substance, Pantrigevia,

534
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
 which is a mix of milk, yogurt, butter.

535
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,960
 Lovely so far.

536
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,120
 Then cow urine and cow dung on top of that.

537
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,800
 And basically they're saying

538
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,920
 they won't get research funding

539
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,760
 unless they research this stuff.

540
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,160
 So, yeah, it's a problem.

541
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,880
 Pantrigevia means five cow derivatives.

542
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
 Just a bit of etymology.

543
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,520
 Oh, that's clever.

544
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,960
 It's just every bit of the cow,

545
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,440
 apart from the meat, of course, goes into it.

546
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,640
 Arguably, I would say the nicest bit,

547
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,800
 although that wouldn't get me very far in India

548
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,640
 because eating cows is so verboten

549
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,480
 in almost all the country.

550
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,320
 Cow politics in India dates back to the '60s.

551
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,920
 And this was when Indira Gandhi was in charge.

552
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,400
 Indira Gandhi, who was the daughter

553
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,600
 of the famous politician...

554
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,760
 I'd say...

555
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,240
 Nehru!

556
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,280
 I've completely ruined it.

557
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,840
 I'm so sorry.

558
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,920
 I was so excited that I learned that

559
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,360
 from my Asia and Africa course at university in second year.

560
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,440
 My foot was hovering over the landmine

561
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,480
 and Anna just stepped in and put a safe mat in.

562
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,000
 I can't believe I did that.

563
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,680
 I apologise to the listeners.

564
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,280
 I apologise to my parents.

565
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,040
 I've been looking forward to that all week.

566
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,160
 I knew he was going to fall for it.

567
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,480
 Yeah, Nehru's daughter, wasn't she?

568
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,680
 Look, we'll cut that.

569
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,400
 Do it again.

570
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,280
 Right, go.

571
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,080
 I'll say quiet.

572
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,040
 So, in 1966, there was a storm of the Indian parliament.

573
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,080
 They were trying to pressurise Gandhi

574
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,720
 to criminalise cow slaughter.

575
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,040
 And she refused to kind of count out

576
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,160
 to what they wanted.

577
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,600
 And she had, like...

578
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,640
 Well, very funny.

579
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,160
 Oh, yeah, I didn't think that.

580
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,720
 Yeah.

581
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,640
 That's one thing that I hadn't been looking forward to all week.

582
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,440
 I know you think that I was.

583
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,520
 And you think that I've been leading up to that.

584
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,120
 And that's the whole point of this fight, but no.

585
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,360
 So then Gandhi negotiated with these protesters.

586
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,240
 And actually, people really started respecting her

587
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,440
 a lot more after that.

588
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,040
 And her party, Congress, they chose the cow and calf symbol

589
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,440
 as a result of this.

590
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
 And then cow politics kind of became

591
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,040
 quite a big thing in India.

592
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,320
 But what I like about Indira Gandhi is

593
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,480
 she started at quite a young age.

594
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,080
 When she was 12 years old, she led a bunch of children

595
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
 in a group called the Monkey Brigade,

596
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,640
 which included 60,000 young revolutionaries.

597
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
 And they would like send letters to people.

598
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,920
 They would make flags.

599
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,000
 They would put up notices before the demonstration

600
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,040
 and stuff like this.

601
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,120
 And even before that, when she was five years old,

602
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,280
 she burned her own doll because she found out

603
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,400
 it was made in England.

604
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,520
 Wow.

605
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,040
 Yeah.

606
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,760
 The Monkey Brigade sounds like a deceptively innocuous name

607
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,960
 for a bunch of revolutionaries.

608
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,120
 It sounds like you're getting you little monkeys

609
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,800
 as they're burning your house down.

610
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,000
 Yes, correct.

611
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,360
 It's the Lord Rama in the epic Ramayana

612
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,720
 had an army of monkeys.

613
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,320
 And so they were named after that.

614
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,680
 And so what's the connection of why she has the name Gandhi?

615
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,160
 Is that through a marriage or is that something to you?

616
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,680
 She, I think, if memory serves, she was educated in England maybe,

617
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,760
 but she met someone who was not related to Muhammad Gandhi

618
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,960
 at university, I think.

619
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,680
 Right.

620
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,800
 It happened to be called Gandhi.

621
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:22,960
 Yeah.

622
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,080
 Wow.

623
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,360
 It's a good name.

624
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,720
 It's a good name to sort of take to the world of politics.

625
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,600
 Like, if I was a politician and I had the chance

626
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,760
 of changing my surname, I would so look for someone

627
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,040
 with the surname Obama.

628
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,600
 I just would.

629
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,960
 What's your name, Cathy Obama?

630
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,000
 Absolutely, we're marrying.

631
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,840
 OK, here is another use of cow excrement.

632
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,440
 It can be used as a mobile phone case.

633
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,000
 There's one quite hard line Indian politician called

634
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,800
 Shankar Lal who says that he has coated his mobile phone

635
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,200
 with cow dung and he said, if cow dung can treat cancer,

636
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,920
 why can't it save us from a phone's microwaves?

637
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,480
 OK, there is a flaw in that logic, isn't there?

638
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,280
 It's an if and it's a big if cow dung can treat cancer

639
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,000
 because it can't.

640
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,120
 It absolutely can't do that.

641
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,160
 And this is a man who's speaking with poo down half

642
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,120
 of the side of his face.

643
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,040
 So, I wouldn't take him seriously, would you?

644
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:25,040
 OK, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

645
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,560
 My fact is that in 2020, a woman in the UK

646
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,040
 received medical treatment in two different hospitals

647
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,160
 at the same time.

648
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,880
 What?

649
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
 How is that?

650
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,200
 What?

651
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,840
 I don't get it.

652
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,480
 It's great.

653
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,120
 Hey, what?

654
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,000
 So exciting.

655
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,920
 So this was a story that was in the news.

656
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,400
 It was about a lady called Jan Ritzen

657
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,280
 and she had a cancerous tumor in her leg.

658
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,000
 Now, she needed to have the operation where the shin bone

659
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,640
 was removed and then treated for the radiation.

660
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:01,200
 But unfortunately, due to COVID, all sorts of cancer

661
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,360
 operations have been moved to a specific hospital

662
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,960
 which has been kept clear of COVID patients.

663
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,520
 So procedures have kind of been separated out.

664
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,960
 So the surgeons who were planning the operation

665
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,720
 realized that they had to take out her shin bone,

666
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,160
 take it to a different hospital, irradiate it

667
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,080
 to completely kill any cancerous cells

668
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,160
 while she was still under anaesthetic,

669
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,800
 then bring it back and reinstall it in her leg.

670
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,680
 Oh my God.

671
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,240
 Unbelievable.

672
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,560
 I know.

673
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,080
 I phoned the surgeon who did the operation to ask him about it.

674
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,640
 Oh, cool.

675
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,440
 Yeah, he's an orthopedic on a call.

676
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
 A psychologist called Ashish Mahendra.

677
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,400
 And we had a whale of a time talking about it

678
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,880
 because it's just such an interesting kind of miraculous procedure.

679
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,400
 Was he the surgeon who dealt with it at the hospital

680
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,240
 where she was or where the shin was?

681
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,840
 Or was he just like the taxi driver?

682
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,560
 No, no, no.

683
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,880
 OK, so he was where the majority of Ms Ritzen was.

684
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,520
 He was with her, most of her.

685
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,040
 He wasn't with the shin bone.

686
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,920
 I read him one article.

687
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,400
 I don't know if Dr Mahendra said this to you,

688
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,880
 but that she could watch the footage

689
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,440
 of her shin bone being dealt with from her hospital bed.

690
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,440
 So they filmed it and she could watch it.

691
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,960
 But you said that she was anaesthetized,

692
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,080
 so I don't know if that's possible.

693
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,520
 Well, why would you want to watch that?

694
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,240
 Oh, why not?

695
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,640
 Oh, yeah.

696
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,360
 I mean, what else is on Snooker at the moment?

697
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,920
 I don't know.

698
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,480
 Netflix?

699
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,200
 You got Netflix.

700
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,120
 Watch Stopping Your Mum or She?

701
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,600
 I don't know.

702
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,480
 Come on.

703
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,480
 You'll watch an hour and 15 minutes of nerds playing Tetris

704
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,280
 and you won't watch your own shin bone being operated on.

705
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,320
 Well, is it a whole channel?

706
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,240
 Can I flick over to someone's nose being operated on

707
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,200
 in a separate hospital?

708
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,400
 Like, is it just one?

709
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,440
 I did say, when I spoke to Mr Mahendra,

710
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,440
 he did say that she was under.

711
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,800
 I'm pretty sure that he said that.

712
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,400
 So I don't know whether she was on.

713
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,520
 It's possible.

714
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,320
 I think maybe she might have watched it afterwards, maybe.

715
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,800
 She might have watched it on plus one or something.

716
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,480
 Yeah.

717
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
 But it's such a tricky operation to do this,

718
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,560
 because when you remove...

719
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,080
 Most of these tumors happen higher up,

720
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,840
 maybe the knee or the hip, that's more common.

721
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,760
 And reconstruction is much easier,

722
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,480
 because you can give someone a hip replacement, can't you?

723
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,640
 Or you can put some metal in which does the job.

724
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,000
 When it's a shin bone,

725
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,400
 it's much harder to reconstruct after the operation.

726
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,760
 There's not much muscle cover.

727
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,360
 The bone is really near the surface.

728
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,280
 And there are many fewer options for reconstruction afterwards.

729
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,760
 So the bone, the shin bone they had removed,

730
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,000
 was the best thing to go back in.

731
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,400
 And that's why they needed to do that.

732
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,600
 They irradiated the bone, killed off all the cells.

733
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,080
 But unfortunately, then you've killed off all the cells.

734
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,480
 There's no live matter left in that bone,

735
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,320
 and there normally is in our bones.

736
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,560
 So they had to use her fibula, which is the next door bone,

737
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,440
 and kind of use that as a spare

738
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,160
 to put that right against the now dead shin bone

739
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,000
 that was being reinstalled.

740
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,640
 And that then helped to bring that bone back to life.

741
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,760
 So amazing what we can do.

742
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,080
 And then did you have to have like an arm bone taken out

743
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,160
 to replace the fibula and then the side bone to replace the arm bone?

744
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,880
 It's not like rearranging a spice rack where you think,

745
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,160
 "Oh, well, if I just put that there."

746
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,000
 The only other thing I asked about was the container they used,

747
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,080
 because it's put in a special sterile container

748
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,440
 to be driven across the city.

749
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,720
 And he said there's no specific optimum size of the container.

750
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,560
 It depends on the tumor, it depends on the bone.

751
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,040
 So frequently they will have to tailor make

752
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,280
 a suitable container for the bone that is being moved around.

753
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,480
 I spoke to my sister-in-law, Beth, who used to be a nurse,

754
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,560
 and she said that she thought probably the reason they don't do it much

755
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,600
 is because of contamination, right?

756
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,280
 You don't really want to be taking stuff

757
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,560
 across the other side of the city

758
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,000
 in case you get some dust on it or a bit of grease or something.

759
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,040
 But then she did tell me that what they used to do

760
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,400
 to stop that sometimes with...

761
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,960
 You know, when you had to remove some skull,

762
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,640
 some of your skull to release some pressure,

763
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,600
 they would take that bone and then they would put it

764
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,360
 inside your belly almost, like inside your body,

765
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,200
 because that's where the perfect sterile place is for human bone.

766
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,040
 Isn't that amazing?

767
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,600
 Like they would cut you open, cut a little flap,

768
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,480
 they would put it in there while they let it all the pressure release

769
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,440
 and then they'd put it back.

770
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,200
 That's incredible.

771
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,760
 Isn't that amazing?

772
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
 That's amazing.

773
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,160
 I was talking also to a surgeon.

774
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,720
 So my buddy Harry, Harris Akram, is a brain surgeon in London

775
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,360
 and he was saying that when he was in India,

776
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,200
 the hospital that he was staying at,

777
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,720
 you would be fitted with this frame around your head.

778
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,520
 Imagine like in all those sort of mad scientist movies

779
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
 where they put this giant frame on your head.

780
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,040
 So it's metallic and it's big and it really sits on and clamps on.

781
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,360
 So they would put that on there.

782
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,960
 But at the surgery in India, they didn't have an MRI scanner.

783
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,560
 So they used to send their patients on the bus over to another hospital

784
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,120
 wearing the frame on their head.

785
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,720
 They would go have the scans done and be prepped

786
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,840
 and then get the bus back and then have their surgery

787
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,520
 once the scans have been sent over.

788
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,320
 Yeah. So in India, you would see people with these giant frames on their head

789
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,280
 who were just transporting themselves to a different hospital.

790
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,640
 Very good for social distancing.

791
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,120
 Because from what you're gesturing here,

792
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,880
 it looks like you couldn't get that close to them.

793
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,520
 Yeah, it's quite a big item.

794
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,680
 It sounds like that thing on SOAR that rips people's heads open.

795
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,280
 Like you put them in this contraption

796
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,520
 and if you don't get the key in time,

797
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
 I'm the only one who's seen that movie, okay never mind.

798
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,640
 It's not a reassuring thing to say to the person who's diagnosed on the bus chains

799
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,880
 on the way to their brain surgery.

800
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,040
 I was reading actually a study about a particular brain surgery

801
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,600
 where the surgeons use stickers to label little bits of the brain.

802
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,920
 So this is kind of just a throwaway comment in this study,

803
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,800
 but they referred to it as intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping

804
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,080
 and they were basically trying to work out

805
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,040
 which bits of their brain are responsible for which things.

806
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,000
 And so what they did was they would have a,

807
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,880
 you know, when patients are awake but you're operating on their brain,

808
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,240
 the surgeons stimulated different parts of their brain

809
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,000
 and then looked at what the patient did to see which things it affected.

810
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,800
 So if they prodded one bit, the patient might lose language.

811
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,000
 If they prodded another bit, the patient might start dribbling or something.

812
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,120
 And then they added a little label to each little bit

813
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,320
 saying language bit, dribbling bit, walking bit, playing the violin.

814
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,560
 So I didn't see a picture but I'm imagining a brain covered in post-its.

815
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,760
 That was incredible.

816
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,760
 There was another world world first of surgery which happened last year.

817
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,600
 This was the world's first double penis removal.

818
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,480
 Just from one person.

819
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,080
 From the same person.

820
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,600
 It was a baby boy who was born with three penises.

821
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,640
 One, not two, but three.

822
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,040
 Yeah.

823
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,600
 It's the first recorded ever case of human trifalia which is correct.

824
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,520
 I was going to say tree-ness but that's…

825
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,000
 That's Alexi's latest game he's working on.

826
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,800
 Anyone for tree-ness?

827
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,600
 That's incredible.

828
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,920
 Do they keep the middle one or the left one or the right one?

829
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,480
 Ooh, good call.

830
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,040
 They kept the functional one.

831
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,640
 Which, yeah.

832
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,400
 The other two were more stubs than full-on.

833
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,280
 They would have been able to get erections in but they were built.

834
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,080
 Could they urinate?

835
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,200
 Could you urinate out of them?

836
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,000
 You don't know if the chords.

837
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,640
 Yeah, no, fair enough.

838
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,200
 Fair enough.

839
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,560
 Like a sprinkler system though, Dan.

840
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,720
 You think you could stand him in a garden when he's older?

841
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,520
 You could stand at all three urinals at the same time.

842
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,960
 You could piss on three people's shoes at the same time.

843
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,360
 Do you think you would keep them if that happened to you?

844
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,480
 Would you ask to keep them because people do that for surgery, don't they?

845
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,600
 It's a vex question.

846
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,480
 Yeah, I don't know.

847
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,680
 You wouldn't wear the mizirings or anything but you might keep them in a drawer.

848
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,760
 Put them on a mantelpiece or something?

849
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,800
 I wouldn't know someone who kept her hip bone after it was replaced, yeah.

850
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,400
 Yeah, I was talking to someone we all know, Kase Molaker,

851
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,680
 who's the curator of the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam.

852
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,880
 Anytime he has surgery that is removed, a bit of his body is removed.

853
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,160
 So like gallstones or anything like that,

854
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,400
 he keeps it in a jar in his home and he's shown me them.

855
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,280
 And all the things to do with his kids when they were born, placentas and so on,

856
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,360
 they're all in formaldehyde sitting in his house.

857
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,800
 I know what you're saying, Dan.

858
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,440
 I love Kase, but he is a bit weird, so it's not...

859
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,000
 Oh, he should turn it into a museum and call it Kases Cases.

860
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,120
 Oh, that's good.

861
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,520
 That's wrong.

862
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,560
 Lovely.

863
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,280
 Yeah, tall.

864
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,760
 Yeah, it's weird the whole "do you keep your limbs" stuff.

865
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,760
 I was reading a thing online from someone who used to work in a funeral home

866
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,360
 and said that they'd been asked to keep a leg in a freezer

867
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,200
 and it ended up being for over a decade

868
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,640
 because the person who'd had it amputated

869
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,000
 wanted to be buried with it in the end.

870
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,560
 Wow, that's nice.

871
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,560
 I think that's a bit cheeky.

872
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:52,880
 Why?

873
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,840
 Well, it's using someone's freezer space, isn't it?

874
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,720
 If I said to Andy, "I've made some lasagna and I want to keep it,

875
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,320
 but I don't have enough room in my freezer,

876
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,600
 can I keep it in your freezer?"

877
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,440
 I think, I'd say yes.

878
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,000
 I know, but you would feel like you had to say yes.

879
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,120
 As the years went by, I would slowly grow more lasagna in the freezer.

880
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,600
 I think, "I've got some leftovers, but I can't freeze them

881
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,040
 because James had bloody lasagna."

882
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,120
 And you'd probably keep occasionally bringing up lasagna

883
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,280
 just in case I remembered that, wouldn't you?

884
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,360
 James, every conversation we had, I would bring up lasagna in some way

885
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,560
 or freezing or leftovers.

886
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,680
 Yeah, but this lady can't go.

887
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,280
 Any plan on dying soon?

888
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,720
 That's the only question she can ask.

889
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,200
 Hey, no.

890
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,600
 How's your health?

891
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,120
 You can come to a rental agreement in the end.

892
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,360
 I imagine that the rental agreement would be the best way for you.

893
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,320
 Really? Okay.

894
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,080
 Where James has to be for 50p a year, you could keep.

895
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,920
 You're going to charge me to pop my lasagnas in your freezer.

896
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,920
 After two years, James, which is my cuss off,

897
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,200
 but I think that's reasonable, I would insist on some kind of arrangement.

898
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,720
 That carefully, I thought we were friends.

899
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,680
 I don't know if you've got a freezer.

900
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,720
 I'm not getting involved in this.

901
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,880
 49p a year.

902
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,320
 [Laughter]

903
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,760
 You get briefed on how to care for your limbs if you choose to keep them.

904
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,120
 Do you get told?

905
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,480
 Because you can be given them in formaldehyde and water.

906
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,400
 For instance, there's one way they get stored.

907
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,720
 And apparently you get a little briefing booklet,

908
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,080
 which says you need to change the formaldehyde and water every 10 years.

909
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,880
 So just setting alarm every 10 years is like changing the fish tank,

910
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,800
 which I think is about the same from memory.

911
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,080
 That is a great alarm to go off mid-meeting, isn't it, Eric?

912
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,440
 [Laughter]

913
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,320
 Oh, damn, sorry.

914
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,160
 I just got to change the water and formaldehyde of my leg.

915
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,600
 Just lean over behind you and release one spigot.

916
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,400
 Start draining.

917
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,880
 Do you know that people didn't really like wearing surgical gloves

918
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,840
 when they first came in?

919
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,600
 Like any technology, I suppose.

920
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,880
 There's always some resistance.

921
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,480
 But there's quite a lot of hesitation with surgical gloves,

922
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,280
 because people would kind of root around with their hands,

923
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,680
 and they felt like if they wore gloves,

924
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,120
 then they wouldn't get the feeling,

925
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,200
 and they wouldn't be able to do the job quite as well.

926
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,440
 But one of the reasons is because some of the gloves that they used

927
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,280
 were not exactly good for purpose.

928
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,080
 So the first ones were like elbow length cotton or silk gloves,

929
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,680
 and they would just get covered with blood within about two seconds,

930
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,440
 and you'd have to keep changing them.

931
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,000
 And then there was one surgeon who put wax directly onto his hands,

932
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,040
 and so kind of dunked his hand in some molten wax,

933
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,360
 and then let it dry, and then would use that.

934
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,760
 And the idea, of course, was to try and make the operation sterile,

935
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,120
 but a lot of people thought that maybe that's a bit pointless.

936
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,160
 They thought it's impossible to make everything completely sterile,

937
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,640
 so we should just accept there'll be some contamination,

938
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,360
 but then try and kill the bacteria afterwards.

939
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,920
 Do you know what I mean?

940
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,960
 So there's like these two kind of sites of what they should do.

941
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,680
 But now they use gloves.

942
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:51,920
 Now they use gloves.

943
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,800
 Which did they go with?

944
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,680
 Yeah, although I'm not sure.

945
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,800
 I think sterilization for operations, largely speaking, is orthodoxy now.

946
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,640
 It's the preferred way.

947
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,200
 Although sometimes you don't have a choice.

948
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,760
 There was a case in 1995 when a woman just was getting onto a plane and slipped,

949
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,520
 and she thought she was okay,

950
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,600
 but then it turned out that she'd fractured her rib,

951
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,800
 which had punctured her lung.

952
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,920
 And the plane was already in the air,

953
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,480
 and so they weren't going to be able to do an emergency landing

954
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,040
 because the change in pressure might kill her.

955
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,960
 And so they had to do something about it.

956
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,320
 And there's these two doctors called Angus Wallace and Tom Wong.

957
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,120
 And the case was written up in the British Medical Journal,

958
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,800
 which honestly is such a good read.

959
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,000
 It's an incredible story.

960
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,360
 And they used a, they kind of got a urinary catheter,

961
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,360
 which was in the first aid kit,

962
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,120
 but it wasn't good to be used for a chest.

963
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,600
 So they had to use a clothes hanger to stiffen it up.

964
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,880
 They didn't have any sterilization stuff.

965
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,160
 So they used Covoisier cognac to make it sterile.

966
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,640
 They didn't have any surgical clamps.

967
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,120
 So they held the incision open with a knife and fork.

968
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,440
 Sorry, it's the first aid kit that's supposed to be on board.

969
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,680
 Well, since then, since this happened,

970
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,960
 the medical kits on certainly British airlines,

971
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,240
 and I think American as well,

972
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,040
 and probably throughout most of the world have improved a lot,

973
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,480
 and they've got a lot more stuff now.

974
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,640
 So I read the story too.

975
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,640
 And I love that she had complained about it before the plane took off.

976
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,760
 And she said that she'd had a slip and it was this rib problem.

977
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,800
 So the doctors actually saw her before the plane took off

978
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,960
 and they went, "Okay, no, you should be fine."

979
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,120
 And then when it got up to high altitude,

980
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,720
 it started really hurting.

981
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,360
 And then she came clean that she hadn't just slipped.

982
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,400
 She'd actually been knocked off her motorbike and hit by a car.

983
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,000
 Just before getting on the plane.

984
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,080
 So it was a proper accident.

985
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,120
 Actually, it was 10 minutes, this bit of surgery,

986
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,040
 and then they put this catheter in

987
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,520
 and she spent the rest of the flight just watching the movie.

988
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,360
 Yeah, unfortunately, it was top of my mumbled.

989
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,080
 She died of boredom.

990
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:08,560
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

991
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,600
 And that is my fact.

992
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,640
 My fact this week is that in 1990,

993
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,520
 five children in America were given the first name

994
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,920
 spelt A-B-C-D-E, or "absody".

995
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,440
 All were born in Hawaii,

996
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,160
 where the local alphabet doesn't actually contain the letters B, C, or D.

997
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,280
 Wow, there's a lot of things to unpick here.

998
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,840
 So it's pronounced absody.

999
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,320
 There's actually a couple of pronunciations,

1000
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,080
 but that is one of them, yeah.

1001
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,720
 And sometimes pronounced absity,

1002
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,320
 which is what I'm going to call my gym.

1003
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:50,240
 Yeah, so this was in an article that sort of erupted in 2018

1004
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,880
 when a girl who was trying to book herself,

1005
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,800
 her mom was trying to get her and her daughter

1006
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,400
 onto Southwest airplanes,

1007
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,360
 they took a picture and put it online going,

1008
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,400
 "Look at the name of this girl.

1009
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
 She's her first name is A-B-C-D-E."

1010
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,920
 And kind of shamed her and that turned into a national story.

1011
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,080
 But then people were digging into it and finding out

1012
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,520
 that this isn't as rare a name as one girl in America.

1013
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,280
 It turned out that as of 2017, 373 girls

1014
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,880
 were named A-B-C-D-E, or "absody".

1015
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,320
 And further people have done sort of their little checks

1016
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,000
 into how far back the name goes.

1017
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,320
 And in 1990, five were registered as being given that name.

1018
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,640
 And all five of them were located in Hawaii.

1019
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,240
 And yeah, and it's been growing ever since as a name.

1020
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,240
 And it doesn't really have an origin as far as I can tell.

1021
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,000
 Well, I mean, it does probably, but no one knows it.

1022
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,120
 It must have started somewhere,

1023
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,200
 it must have met some alphabet teacher

1024
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,400
 in primary school going,

1025
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
 "Oh, I think that sounds like a nice name."

1026
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,640
 And spread from there, but we'll never know,

1027
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,160
 unless someone out there does.

1028
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,760
 Yeah, and it's, yeah.

1029
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,880
 So, so the Hawaii,

1030
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,200
 this is the modern Hawaiian alphabet that doesn't have it.

1031
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,920
 And I looked up our names.

1032
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,440
 James, there's no J in the Hawaiian modern alphabet as well.

1033
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,800
 So your name is different.

1034
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,160
 So Anna, your name,

1035
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,320
 if you were being translated into Hawaiian name,

1036
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,480
 is still Anna with one N, A-N-A.

1037
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,160
 James, you are Kimo, K-I-M-O.

1038
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,640
 Strong.

1039
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,040
 I am Caniella.

1040
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,560
 So K-A-N instead of a D.

1041
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,280
 And Andy, you are Analu.

1042
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,400
 A-N-A-L-U, that's what you are.

1043
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,760
 Analu, yeah, yeah.

1044
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,200
 Yeah, Analu.

1045
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,960
 I like, I like that pronunciation

1046
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,000
 and I'm sure it's correct.

1047
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,440
 I don't know what the pronunciation is.

1048
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,040
 It's A-N-A-L-U, yeah.

1049
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,080
 It sounds like a product.

1050
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,840
 Are you bored of Anasol?

1051
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,960
 Then try Analu.

1052
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,600
 I thought it sounded like a bathroom cleaner.

1053
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,840
 It's more like something to sit next to the cow urine, I think.

1054
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,560
 A sequel to Despicable Me.

1055
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,960
 Analu.

1056
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,240
 So baby names.

1057
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,080
 Baby names, we only know about baby names

1058
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,040
 due to a guy called Michael Shackleford, who in the...

1059
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,720
 Before him, people just didn't give Baby's names.

1060
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,320
 They were like, "What's this called?"

1061
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,040
 No idea.

1062
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,680
 Just don't know.

1063
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,800
 1997, so late.

1064
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,320
 We need Michael Shackleford here.

1065
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,200
 He was a guy who...

1066
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,720
 What are you talking about?

1067
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,440
 He worked at...

1068
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,880
 So it's the sort of...

1069
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,560
 We only know that there are 373 absities,

1070
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,400
 for example, because of Michael Shackleford.

1071
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,440
 He worked at the Social Security Administration in Baltimore

1072
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,280
 and he and his wife were expecting a baby

1073
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,080
 and he just wanted to know if they were going to have

1074
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,360
 a baby with a very common name,

1075
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,400
 because he was called Michael,

1076
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,880
 which was a massively common name in America.

1077
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,240
 And, you know, wherever you go,

1078
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,920
 three people born in his generation,

1079
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,520
 you know, someone shouts, "Michael,

1080
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,480
 three people turned around."

1081
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,560
 And they didn't want that.

1082
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,160
 So he thought he'd just program

1083
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,520
 in a little computer program

1084
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,480
 and work out the names.

1085
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,320
 And he thinks he was the first person

1086
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,280
 to see an accurate nationwide sampling of first names.

1087
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:57,680
 Wow.

1088
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,200
 And that was 1997.

1089
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,000
 Good old Mike.

1090
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,960
 A lot of people listening now think that I'm saying...

1091
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,680
 I read an amazing book called

1092
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,360
 Fru Fru Frisbee and Brick,

1093
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,240
 The Book of Unfortunate Baby Names by Russel Ash.

1094
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,440
 And it's got people such as Mabel Abel, Ruth Booth,

1095
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,120
 Danny Fanny, Hugh Glue, and Nelly Smelly.

1096
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,200
 These are all people who were around.

1097
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,640
 There was someone in the 1830s in New York

1098
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,000
 called Preserved Fish.

1099
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,520
 His father was called Preserved Fish

1100
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,080
 and his grandfather was also called Preserved Fish.

1101
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,360
 But his father and grandfather were both blacksmiths,

1102
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,840
 but he was actually a shipping merchant.

1103
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,440
 He started off as a whaler

1104
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,160
 and then started selling fish.

1105
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,160
 And he was called Preserved Fish.

1106
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,760
 Amazing.

1107
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,640
 That's brilliant.

1108
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,680
 That's pretty much the most...

1109
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,320
 It's not a subtle, nominative determinism, is it?

1110
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:54,720
 Yeah.

1111
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,840
 It's a bit too on the nose.

1112
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,120
 I like it.

1113
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,360
 Does it help the name when you add the third to the end of it?

1114
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:01,920
 I don't know.

1115
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,000
 Preserved Fish the Third.

1116
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,560
 Yeah, just sort of like, why are you called the...

1117
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,600
 Okay, the third.

1118
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,080
 I get it.

1119
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,160
 You've got weird-ass grandparents and parents.

1120
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,560
 Eurythroscoggins, Philae leg and posthumous mints.

1121
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:14,880
 Just three others.

1122
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,000
 Philae leg?

1123
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,200
 Philae, P-H-E-L-I-A, leg.

1124
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,960
 Posthumous mints.

1125
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,240
 Posthumous mints.

1126
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,920
 I want all my mints to be posthumous.

1127
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,720
 Well, I've got some lasagna in my freezer, Anna.

1128
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,400
 I think you've been very welcome to.

1129
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:37,520
 Do you know when Baby sort of naming books took off?

1130
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,240
 1997.

1131
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,520
 No one had books before then.

1132
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,680
 Well, there were...

1133
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,120
 I mean, they sort of really did take off in the 80s.

1134
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,600
 But actually, they do date back way before that,

1135
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,200
 sort of names of interesting babies.

1136
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,360
 But they used to be in the back of cookbooks,

1137
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,840
 because cookbooks used to have all kinds of extra gubbins

1138
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,200
 in the later pages just to kind of pad out the recipes, I guess.

1139
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,600
 So Mrs. Clark's cookery book in 1883 was subtitled,

1140
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,520
 including what to name the baby.

1141
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,760
 It was kind of general all-purpose household guide.

1142
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,560
 So you've got that kind of thing in the 19th century.

1143
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,360
 It's weird, because you don't want to confuse a recipe

1144
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,120
 with a baby name.

1145
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,600
 I don't know what.

1146
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,080
 No, that's how actually preserved fish got his name.

1147
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,360
 Posthumous mints, yeah.

1148
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:27,760
 Couple of people who do have Hawaiian names that we all know.

1149
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,280
 So Keanu Reeves.

1150
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,040
 Keanu is a Hawaiian name.

1151
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,520
 And yeah, and it's a lovely unique name in Hollywood,

1152
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,040
 and it means cool mountain breeze.

1153
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,600
 But when he first started in Hollywood,

1154
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,600
 his agent said, this name's not going to work.

1155
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,600
 You need to go away and come back with another name,

1156
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,880
 because no one's going to hire you.

1157
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,840
 It's too weird.

1158
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,320
 So he agreed, and he went away, and he came back,

1159
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,400
 and he said, I've got my new name to his agents.

1160
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,360
 And they said, OK, what is it?

1161
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,720
 And he said, I want to now be known as Chuck Spadina.

1162
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,240
 Chuck Spadina.

1163
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,760
 So yeah, his agent said, I'm not sure that Chuck Spadina's

1164
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,480
 going to work.

1165
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,840
 Go away, come back with another one.

1166
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,640
 So then Keanu Reeves went away, brainstormed, came back,

1167
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,920
 and said, OK, I've got my new one.

1168
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,240
 I'll now be known as Templeton Page Taylor.

1169
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,920
 And they said, what?

1170
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,760
 Mate, you're not getting this.

1171
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,360
 And so they said, just keep Keanu.

1172
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,640
 And that's the only reason he kept it.

1173
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,360
 He was so ready to change it to either of those names.

1174
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,920
 So do you think that he came up with these stupid names

1175
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,400
 to stop the idea of him having to change it?

1176
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,280
 It was like a clever thing.

1177
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,000
 God, do you think he just is an idiot who doesn't know?

1178
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,120
 One all name at a time.

1179
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,400
 I think, yeah, I hadn't actually thought that.

1180
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,920
 So maybe that's exactly what he was doing.

1181
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,640
 Yeah, not sure.

1182
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,840
 It's sort of, that story reads like you're reading

1183
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,000
 Rumpelstiltskin backwards, doesn't it?

1184
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,280
 When you go and try and guess at the name every day.

1185
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:45,600
 Yeah.

1186
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:50,880
 In 1900, 91% of all children were given a name

1187
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,680
 from the top 1,000 most popular names.

1188
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,560
 This is in America.

1189
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:59,440
 But by 2000, only 75% of girls were given a name

1190
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,960
 from the top 1,000.

1191
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,640
 And for boys, it was 86%.

1192
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,400
 So a lot more children have been given unique names

1193
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,760
 or very unusual names.

1194
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,480
 And they've looked into this.

1195
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,600
 So it was a 1995 study and they find it's very common

1196
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,120
 in African American families.

1197
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,320
 And they looked at the whole country

1198
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,600
 over the whole of that century.

1199
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,960
 And they found that in Illinois in 1920,

1200
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,040
 31% of African American girls and 25% of African American boys

1201
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,520
 had unique names in the whole country.

1202
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,880
 And the reason they think this,

1203
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,360
 there's someone called Sandra L. West,

1204
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,400
 who is a co-author of the Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance.

1205
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,200
 And a couple of scholars called Ayanna F. Brown

1206
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,800
 and Janice Tuck Lively.

1207
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,360
 And what they think is basically the surnames

1208
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,040
 that African American families have are often things

1209
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,200
 that were given during slavery times.

1210
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,160
 And they were forced upon them by white people.

1211
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,320
 Whereas the first name is something that's given to you

1212
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,320
 by a loved one, by a family member.

1213
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:00,400
 And so people will give names that kind of show

1214
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,920
 that they're loved by their family.

1215
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,480
 They can show that by giving them unique sort of special first names

1216
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,760
 because they're stuck with these old fashioned surnames.

1217
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,560
 That's interesting.

1218
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,640
 That we are definitely getting more into our unusual names.

1219
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,400
 There have been various studies about why we have,

1220
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,240
 but I mean, it's largely obviously

1221
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,640
 because we're a bunch of individualistic millennials,

1222
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,960
 I suppose, and everyone wants a special name for their kid.

1223
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,480
 But there's also a really interesting study

1224
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,080
 which I thought sounded like rubbish.

1225
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:30,000
 And then I saw it being written up in a serious and reliable way

1226
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,120
 about how there's an exact correlation between how recently

1227
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,120
 a U.S. state joined the union

1228
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,960
 and how many newborn babies get unusual names.

1229
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,640
 And so there's the idea that if you're a frontier settler,

1230
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,280
 so you're going and you're settling a new land,

1231
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,200
 you are more sort of bold.

1232
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,320
 It's more bold society.

1233
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,440
 It's more individualistic.

1234
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,200
 It's more gung-ho, get out and make your own way.

1235
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,920
 And it's much more likely that you'll be willing to break the mold

1236
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,760
 and give your kid a weird name.

1237
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,080
 So there's literally an exact inverse correlation

1238
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,280
 between common names and how recently a state was settled.

1239
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,320
 Same with Canada.

1240
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,960
 On the east of Canada, which was settled first,

1241
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,880
 kids have much more common names.

1242
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,440
 But the west of Canada, which was settled more recently,

1243
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,280
 still has that hangover of,

1244
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,160
 "Yeah, when you hear, we'll do what the fuck we want."

1245
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,080
 And that correlates.

1246
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,920
 Wow, that's a very interesting idea.

1247
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,840
 Not many Ivankas, it turns out,

1248
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,920
 that people thought that perhaps there might be more Ivankas

1249
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,320
 because she was a prominent political figure.

1250
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,720
 Do you know why that might be?

1251
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,000
 Not many Ivankas.

1252
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,200
 Because it sounds Russian-y,

1253
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,400
 which might be a bit off-putting to all Americans.

1254
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,760
 There's something about that.

1255
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,720
 Basically, there is not much fashion at the moment

1256
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,920
 for any name which contains the letters N and K

1257
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,720
 next to each other.

1258
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,760
 This is according to Laura Wattenberg,

1259
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,760
 who wrote the baby name wizard book

1260
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,880
 and runs babynamewizard.com.

1261
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,520
 She said that basically NK is very much out of fashion.

1262
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,920
 So Frank, for instance, very much out of fashion.

1263
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,640
 Frank Ivank, anything like that.

1264
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,480
 Yet my son, Wanker, is fucking the trend.

1265
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,480
 You can get consultants, can't you?

1266
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,560
 You can get professional advice on this, if you like.

1267
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,400
 There are various services which do it.

1268
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,560
 There's one which I found in America, which is called,

1269
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,360
 I love this, it's called Appalachian Mountain.

1270
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,240
 So it's Appalachian as in naming,

1271
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,480
 but obviously there are the Appalachian Mountain.

1272
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,320
 Thank you, Andy.

1273
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,720
 Just in case not everyone knows the Appalachian Mountains,

1274
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,120
 they're not in the top three mountain ranges, I would say.

1275
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,880
 I reckon I'm more familiar with the mountain range

1276
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,240
 than the word to mean to give someone a name, actually.

1277
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,080
 Great point, really good point.

1278
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,000
 Well, anyway, I've covered the ground,

1279
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,280
 I think pretty exhaustively now.

1280
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,760
 You can pay for the very basics is a 45-minute call

1281
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,360
 as a kind of urgent assistance thing.

1282
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,360
 If you're, I don't know, maybe if you're hanging around

1283
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,200
 outside the baptism office, whatever.

1284
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,560
 Or you can pay a lot more and get an eight-page report.

1285
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,400
 You know, if you need a baby name to work

1286
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,680
 in three different languages, let's say,

1287
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,520
 because the parents are from different places,

1288
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,680
 then you can get that and it'll really drill down

1289
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,320
 into the detail.

1290
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,760
 You want to avoid particular syllables,

1291
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,480
 that's what you go for.

1292
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,040
 Interesting, so they basically kind of go through,

1293
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,240
 you know, like in The Simpsons, when they name Bart,

1294
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,840
 they try and work out if there's anything

1295
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,640
 that rhymes with it and they go, "Cart, dart, eart."

1296
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,760
 No, we're fine.

1297
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,400
 Does this, for these people, basically do eight pages

1298
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,960
 of possible ways that your child could be bullied

1299
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,000
 in every different country?

1300
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,760
 Bullying nicknames, basically, yeah.

1301
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,880
 I think it's if you want to avoid

1302
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,360
 particular abbreviations of the name,

1303
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,480
 they can do that too.

1304
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:34,960
 Interesting.

1305
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,960
 I think if you need professional consultation

1306
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,640
 over what to name your child,

1307
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,640
 you've got to take a really long and hard look

1308
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,600
 at your capacity to make an independent decision.

1309
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,760
 Okay, well, my parents wanted to call me anal you,

1310
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,480
 so I'm glad for one that they took that advice.

1311
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,640
 Okay, that's it.

1312
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,680
 That is all of our facts.

1313
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,120
