00:00:14,00:00:18,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:18,00:00:23,a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:24,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin."
00:00:28,00:00:32,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:32,00:00:34,from the last seven days.
00:00:34,00:00:37,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:40,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:40,00:00:47,"Okay, my fact this week is that the world's best Tetris player is a 13 year old from Texas."
00:00:47,00:00:50,The world's second best player is his 15 year old brother.
00:00:50,00:00:55,Are they also the only remaining Tetris players left on the planet?
00:00:55,00:00:56,No!
00:00:56,00:00:58,"Anna, I'll tell you."
00:00:58,00:01:00,It is hugely popular Anna.
00:01:00,00:01:02,"Yeah, the third best is done by the sounds of it."
00:01:02,00:01:05,The only other player.
00:01:05,00:01:10,I just think imagine being in that family like your two year younger brother beats you
00:01:10,00:01:12,in the world championships.
00:01:12,00:01:15,"But at least you are, you know, at least you're the second best."
00:01:15,00:01:18,So the best player is called Dog Playing Tetris.
00:01:18,00:01:20,I don't think that's his real name.
00:01:20,00:01:24,He beat his brother whose name is Pixel Andy.
00:01:24,00:01:27,The surname of these two people is Arteaga.
00:01:27,00:01:30,"And if you go online, you can watch the final."
00:01:30,00:01:34,"It's only one hour and 15 minutes with all the interviews as well,"
00:01:34,00:01:37,which is 13 minutes shorter than the stop on my mum will shoot.
00:01:37,00:01:41,So it's a good use of your time if you want to.
00:01:41,00:01:44,"But this is an interesting thing, I think,"
00:01:44,00:01:49,which is that all the best Tetris players in the world were people of my age
00:01:49,00:01:50,who kind of grew up with it.
00:01:50,00:01:54,"And then very recently, suddenly all these kids have come in"
00:01:54,00:01:57,and started kicking everyone's ass at Tetris.
00:01:57,00:02:00,And the reason is that if you think about how I would play Tetris
00:02:00,00:02:04,"as a kid, I would be like on my Game Boy or whatever playing on my own"
00:02:04,00:02:07,and wouldn't really talk to anyone else about it and would just have to learn it.
00:02:07,00:02:10,Whereas these days they learn it all on YouTube
00:02:10,00:02:13,and they're all swapping tips and all that kind of stuff.
00:02:13,00:02:17,And so the standard of Tetris has just gone through the roof in the last few years.
00:02:17,00:02:22,"I mean, just leave it to us."
00:02:22,00:02:23,Why are they stealing Tetris from us?
00:02:23,00:02:28,"They've got a billion new fangled, colourful, high pixel games."
00:02:28,00:02:30,Just let us have Tetris.
00:02:30,00:02:33,"No, it's new Tetrises. They're different games."
00:02:33,00:02:35,It's not like the same Game Boy.
00:02:35,00:02:37,That's like saying we shouldn't watch football anymore
00:02:37,00:02:41,because the Great Manchester United team of 1990 is no longer together.
00:02:41,00:02:41,But wait a minute.
00:02:41,00:02:44,"I mean, it's still blocks coming down from the roof."
00:02:44,00:02:47,"And in the World Championships, they are playing pretty much classic Tetris."
00:02:47,00:02:51,So the basic formula is pretty unchanged.
00:02:51,00:02:52,This is the same game.
00:02:52,00:02:56,"Yeah. The classic Tetris World Championships only dates from 2010,"
00:02:56,00:02:57,"which I think is a massive swish anyway,"
00:02:57,00:03:01,because it sounds like it's been going for centuries.
00:03:01,00:03:05,"It started as a documentary, the World Tetris Championships."
00:03:05,00:03:09,There was a few people online arguing about who was the greatest ever player
00:03:09,00:03:11,"and someone decided, well, let's get all these people together"
00:03:11,00:03:13,and have them play against each other.
00:03:13,00:03:17,"In that World Championships, the winner was a guy called Jonas Neubauer,"
00:03:17,00:03:19,who unfortunately died earlier this year.
00:03:19,00:03:21,"But one interesting thing about it, what I was saying,"
00:03:21,00:03:25,"about how you would kind of learn on your own and now you learn on YouTube,"
00:03:25,00:03:29,there was the fourth place person was a woman called Dana Wilcox.
00:03:29,00:03:32,There was only two women in this Championships and she came fourth.
00:03:32,00:03:34,"And when she turned up to the Championships,"
00:03:34,00:03:36,that was the first time she learned that you can flip the
00:03:36,00:03:41,blocks in two different directions either clockwise or anti-clockwise.
00:03:41,00:03:42,"Oh, no way."
00:03:42,00:03:45,And she'd become like one of the top 10 players in the whole world
00:03:45,00:03:46,without even knowing that.
00:03:46,00:03:48,How is that possible?
00:03:48,00:03:48,That's amazing.
00:03:48,00:03:49,Yeah.
00:03:49,00:03:51,I'm trying to remember if I knew that.
00:03:51,00:03:53,"No, I don't think I did."
00:03:53,00:03:54,I don't think I did.
00:03:54,00:03:55,I lost to history.
00:03:55,00:03:56,Yes.
00:03:56,00:03:59,"You know that champion you mentioned, James, Jonas Neubauer?"
00:03:59,00:04:00,Yeah.
00:04:00,00:04:03,He won eight of the first 10 classic Tetris World Championships
00:04:03,00:04:05,and he came second in the other two.
00:04:05,00:04:07,So he's really very good at Tetris.
00:04:07,00:04:11,"And he wrote an article in 2019 about his life in Tetris, basically,"
00:04:11,00:04:11,which was lovely.
00:04:11,00:04:15,"And he said, ""Tetris has helped me to make quick and plentiful decisions"
00:04:15,00:04:16,in everyday life.
00:04:16,00:04:19,Have you ever been to a restaurant with a 12-page menu?
00:04:19,00:04:22,I can scan the choices and make a decision almost immediately
00:04:22,00:04:23,without a shred of regret.
00:04:23,00:04:27,"Even if they bring me the wrong order, I'll make it work."""
00:04:27,00:04:28,I love that.
00:04:28,00:04:29,I just think.
00:04:29,00:04:29,Wow.
00:04:29,00:04:30,Yeah.
00:04:30,00:04:31,How does he relate this exactly?
00:04:31,00:04:36,"Sorry, what's the logic leap between his Tetris champion status"
00:04:36,00:04:38,and the fact he's fast ordering in restaurants?
00:04:38,00:04:39,Because you see the options.
00:04:39,00:04:40,You see the options in front of you.
00:04:40,00:04:43,"You get presented with a range of choices and you think,"
00:04:43,00:04:44,"""Bang, I know how to make that work."""
00:04:44,00:04:45,I see.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"I thought he was just, he was so desperate to get back to his Game Boy"
00:04:48,00:04:50,that he can't find a funny around choosing meals.
00:04:50,00:04:54,Do you think he only orders things like fish fingers and sausages
00:04:54,00:04:55,that are coming in that kind of blocky shape?
00:04:55,00:04:57,"Absolutely, absolutely."
00:04:57,00:05:00,Square potato waffle.
00:05:00,00:05:01,Yeah.
00:05:01,00:05:03,That's too funny.
00:05:03,00:05:08,I actually watched an incredible moment in Tetris history.
00:05:08,00:05:11,It was Kevin Birrell who became the first ever Western Grandmaster.
00:05:11,00:05:15,So there's never been a Western Grandmaster outside of Japan.
00:05:15,00:05:19,And he recorded the video that allowed him to become a Grandmaster.
00:05:19,00:05:22,And what you need to do in order to get to Grandmaster level
00:05:22,00:05:26,is you complete Tetris and you then have to play
00:05:26,00:05:29,with invisible blocks over the credits.
00:05:29,00:05:32,And Kevin Birrell recorded him doing this.
00:05:32,00:05:35,"It's a minute 40 seconds, which is 48 seconds shorter than,"
00:05:35,00:05:37,"""Stop on my mum will shoot the trailer on YouTube."""
00:05:37,00:05:41,So you can save some time there.
00:05:41,00:05:44,"And you watch him going, ""Tetris,"" when he says that,"
00:05:44,00:05:46,"and the moment that he wins it and becomes Grandmaster,"
00:05:46,00:05:48,you are just with him.
00:05:48,00:05:49,It's heaven.
00:05:49,00:05:50,And he's jumping around the room.
00:05:50,00:05:51,Yeah.
00:05:51,00:05:55,"Do you think that any Grandmaster,"
00:05:55,00:05:58,"I'm going to use inverted commas for that, in Tetris,"
00:05:58,00:06:01,has ever been introduced to a chess Grandmaster
00:06:01,00:06:03,"and really claimed, looked them in the eye and said,"
00:06:03,00:06:04,"""I'm a Grandmaster too."""
00:06:04,00:06:06,To have a Grandmaster Club
00:06:06,00:06:08,where all the Grandmasters of all the different games meet up.
00:06:08,00:06:11,The chess people aren't letting the Tetris guys in that club.
00:06:11,00:06:12,Why?
00:06:12,00:06:14,They are turning those guys away at the door.
00:06:14,00:06:15,You're a Grandmaster and Tetris.
00:06:15,00:06:16,Yeah.
00:06:16,00:06:16,"Yeah, no."
00:06:16,00:06:22,Your instinctive finger movements are at a level of no other human.
00:06:22,00:06:24,Chess people take hours to play the game.
00:06:24,00:06:25,They take single move.
00:06:25,00:06:27,That's a fair point.
00:06:27,00:06:28,They're winning on speed.
00:06:28,00:06:29,True.
00:06:29,00:06:30,"We haven't talked about the origins of it,"
00:06:30,00:06:33,how it was officially owned by the Soviet Union.
00:06:33,00:06:35,"It was this guy, Alexei Pajitnov,"
00:06:35,00:06:38,who worked at the USSR's Academy of Science
00:06:38,00:06:39,in their computer lab.
00:06:39,00:06:40,And he liked making games.
00:06:40,00:06:43,And he liked geometric games.
00:06:43,00:06:45,And there was one which involved pentominos.
00:06:45,00:06:47,"Whereas Tetris users, what are they called?"
00:06:47,00:06:49,"They're called tetrominoes, because it's four."
00:06:49,00:06:51,And he had made this game.
00:06:51,00:06:53,He didn't really know how to publish it.
00:06:53,00:06:55,And it was already being pirated overseas
00:06:55,00:06:56,because of how popular it was.
00:06:56,00:06:59,So he gave the rights to the government for 10 years.
00:06:59,00:07:02,And then the KGB got involved at one point
00:07:02,00:07:04,in terms of the rights selling.
00:07:04,00:07:05,"They always did, didn't they?"
00:07:06,00:07:09,They liked to have a finger in most pies back in the day.
00:07:09,00:07:09,Yeah.
00:07:09,00:07:12,He named it after quite odd stuff.
00:07:12,00:07:16,"So Tetris, the Tetris and Tetris, that's just the four."
00:07:16,00:07:19,But then the isp bit is because his favorite sport was tennis.
00:07:19,00:07:22,It was mostly more for a man who devotes his life
00:07:22,00:07:24,to sitting in front of a computer screen designing games.
00:07:24,00:07:26,But I suppose you've got to have another hobby.
00:07:26,00:07:27,"So yeah, Tetris and tennis."
00:07:27,00:07:30,And I quite like the whole ominos thing.
00:07:30,00:07:33,"This grew out of the domino,"
00:07:33,00:07:34,"which was the original domino,"
00:07:34,00:07:36,which is just a piece with two bits.
00:07:37,00:07:39,"And then someone decided in sort of,"
00:07:39,00:07:42,I think the 60s or 70s to make polyominoes a thing.
00:07:42,00:07:45,So that's one of those shapes
00:07:45,00:07:47,with various numbers of squares in them.
00:07:47,00:07:50,"So yeah, you've got dominoes, you've got triominoes,"
00:07:50,00:07:51,you've got pentominoes.
00:07:51,00:07:53,Did you say there was an original omino?
00:07:53,00:07:55,Or is that just the...
00:07:55,00:07:56,This is a botched etymology.
00:07:56,00:07:57,"No, that's the stem."
00:07:57,00:07:57,Uh-huh.
00:07:57,00:07:58,"I don't think it is, though,"
00:07:58,00:08:01,because the dot in domino doesn't mean two.
00:08:01,00:08:03,"No, no, it's not a proper set."
00:08:03,00:08:05,The dot was domino was a thing.
00:08:05,00:08:07,"And then a person said,"
00:08:07,00:08:09,"""Oh, DOS sounds a bit like it could mean two."
00:08:09,00:08:11,"So let's create this whole class of things."""
00:08:11,00:08:12,It's fraudulent.
00:08:12,00:08:14,"It's a fraudulent etymology, is what I'm saying."
00:08:14,00:08:16,Domino derives from a word.
00:08:16,00:08:19,"It was originally, we think, a hood that priests..."
00:08:19,00:08:21,"Yes, Dominican monks, isn't it?"
00:08:21,00:08:22,"Yeah, exactly."
00:08:22,00:08:25,And so the domino was the hood worn by the Dominican monks.
00:08:25,00:08:26,"You know, it doesn't mean anything."
00:08:26,00:08:28,So what should we call it then?
00:08:28,00:08:32,"I haven't got an alternative etymology just lined up,"
00:08:32,00:08:34,because I'm not a faker.
00:08:34,00:08:35,I wouldn't do that to you guys.
00:08:36,00:08:36,Okay.
00:08:36,00:08:38,"I mean, you seem quite angry about it."
00:08:38,00:08:39,You had a few hours.
00:08:39,00:08:42,"I would happily call it a dot domino,"
00:08:42,00:08:43,"because it's four sections,"
00:08:43,00:08:45,and that could be two dominoes together.
00:08:45,00:08:46,Yeah.
00:08:46,00:08:47,Yeah.
00:08:47,00:08:48,Just sounds like you've got stutter.
00:08:48,00:08:52,Do you know why Tetris is so addictive?
00:08:52,00:08:56,This is due to something called the zygarnic effect.
00:08:56,00:09:00,"And what it is, is that your brain is hardwired"
00:09:00,00:09:03,"to whenever there's an incomplete task,"
00:09:03,00:09:05,"you really, really want to fix it."
00:09:05,00:09:08,"And so when the Tetris things come down,"
00:09:08,00:09:10,every time you do complete a task
00:09:10,00:09:13,"and you get rid of one or four of the lines,"
00:09:13,00:09:16,"then it always kind of gives you more things to do,"
00:09:16,00:09:18,because there are more holes that you need to fill
00:09:18,00:09:19,and stuff like that.
00:09:19,00:09:24,"And this was invented by a woman called Bluma Zygarnic,"
00:09:24,00:09:26,"who was Lithuanian,"
00:09:26,00:09:28,and she worked this out quite early in her career.
00:09:28,00:09:32,"And then she went on to get a job working for the Soviet Union,"
00:09:32,00:09:35,"but she carried on as a part-time research scientist,"
00:09:35,00:09:37,which I quite like because she was all about
00:09:37,00:09:38,"kind of incomplete tasks,"
00:09:38,00:09:40,and she decided to carry on working part-time on it.
00:09:40,00:09:44,"And then she won the Lewin Memorial Award,"
00:09:44,00:09:47,"but unfortunately the Soviet Union wouldn't let her collect it,"
00:09:47,00:09:48,and she died before she could collect it.
00:09:48,00:09:52,"So again, that's another incomplete task in her life."
00:09:52,00:09:53,"So she died happy, probably."
00:09:53,00:09:54,Yeah.
00:09:54,00:09:57,"She died doing what she loved, not completing a task."
00:09:57,00:09:57,"Yeah, exactly."
00:09:57,00:09:59,"And then there's the Tetris effect,"
00:09:59,00:10:02,which we will have all suffered from.
00:10:02,00:10:03,I imagine.
00:10:03,00:10:03,Yes.
00:10:03,00:10:04,The Tetris effects.
00:10:04,00:10:06,"I think this is coined by a wire writer in the '90s,"
00:10:06,00:10:10,but basically where you start seeing Tetris blocks wherever you look.
00:10:10,00:10:11,"You start, you know,"
00:10:11,00:10:13,"when everyone played Tetris in the '90s,"
00:10:13,00:10:16,you close your eyes and you just see Tetris blocks falling in front of the greens.
00:10:16,00:10:21,And you can expand the Tetris effects to lots of other things.
00:10:21,00:10:24,So it basically means that you're doing something so much
00:10:24,00:10:25,to such a stupid extent
00:10:25,00:10:29,that everything in it is overlaid on the reality around you.
00:10:29,00:10:32,So sea legs is another example of the Tetris effects.
00:10:32,00:10:33,So you get off a boat.
00:10:33,00:10:34,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:34,00:10:35,"So you're not at sea anymore,"
00:10:35,00:10:36,and yet you still feel like you're at sea.
00:10:36,00:10:37,"Yeah, right."
00:10:37,00:10:39,Your body's too used to it.
00:10:39,00:10:40,Very nice.
00:10:40,00:10:42,Did you guys hear about the other study that was done on Tetris
00:10:42,00:10:45,about how it can help with traumatic memories?
00:10:45,00:10:46,This is amazing.
00:10:46,00:10:50,"It's if you, you've suffered some kind of trauma."
00:10:50,00:10:51,"Okay, so in this incident,"
00:10:51,00:10:54,it was people who'd been in a traumatic car accident.
00:10:54,00:11:00,"If you play Tetris for 20 minutes within six hours of the car crash,"
00:11:00,00:11:04,you'll get 62% fewer intrusive memories in the following week.
00:11:04,00:11:08,It seems to prevent negative memories and flashbacks from even forming.
00:11:08,00:11:11,Because you think of Tetris instead or no?
00:11:11,00:11:12,I don't know.
00:11:12,00:11:14,It's kind of that within those first hours
00:11:14,00:11:18,"is when the memories get consolidated for long-term storage, basically."
00:11:18,00:11:20,"So if you just disrupt during that time,"
00:11:20,00:11:22,"Tetris seems to be especially good at it,"
00:11:22,00:11:25,although I'm sure there are other things which could do it as well.
00:11:25,00:11:27,"It kind of prevents the memories from forming in the first place,"
00:11:27,00:11:29,and then you don't get flashbacks later down the line.
00:11:29,00:11:33,What if the terrible memory that you have is of being a 15-year-old
00:11:33,00:11:35,and your younger brother beats you in the well Tetris final?
00:11:35,00:11:39,You should play Super Mario.
00:11:39,00:11:45,"Just briefly back to Alexei, the inventor of Tetris."
00:11:45,00:11:48,"I love that the very first version of it,"
00:11:48,00:11:51,he built on a computer that had no graphics capabilities.
00:11:51,00:11:55,So he had to make a text version of the game.
00:11:55,00:11:59,So the blocks were basically brackets put next to each other.
00:11:59,00:12:00,That was the first version.
00:12:00,00:12:03,And then Alexei didn't just invent Tetris.
00:12:03,00:12:06,He sort of quite quickly invented newer versions of the game.
00:12:06,00:12:08,So did any one of you guys play Hattris?
00:12:08,00:12:13,"Hats come down with different, like a top hat and the, yeah."
00:12:13,00:12:15,"It's literally that, it's literally that."
00:12:15,00:12:18,It's Tetris with hats and hats come down and you have to line them up.
00:12:18,00:12:20,So he invented Hattris and then...
00:12:20,00:12:22,I thought it was just playing Tetris three times.
00:12:22,00:12:24,It sounds a bit like it's called a Hattris.
00:12:24,00:12:27,"That would be a fake etymology, Anna."
00:12:27,00:12:30,So sorry.
00:12:30,00:12:33,Yeah. So five hats of identical style had to be stacked.
00:12:33,00:12:36,And that's how you would remove them.
00:12:36,00:12:38,"And entertainment weekly at the time said,"
00:12:38,00:12:41,there is after all a cure for Tetris addiction.
00:12:41,00:12:44,It's Hattris habit that's even harder to kick.
00:12:44,00:12:48,"There's word Tris as well, which was another Alexei game."
00:12:48,00:12:50,"So word Tris, I actually think would be really fun."
00:12:50,00:12:54,The idea is that you had to create blocks of three letters.
00:12:54,00:12:57,So letters would drop and you'd have to create a word.
00:12:57,00:12:59,"So you could make it, it's basically like a big crossword"
00:12:59,00:13:02,"and you just have to decide where to land a letter,"
00:13:02,00:13:05,"hoping, yeah, the next one, yeah, pretty cool game."
00:13:05,00:13:09,"Do you know, I think that James would have point blank,"
00:13:09,00:13:12,refused to play Tetris when it first came to the world.
00:13:12,00:13:15,"So it was Andy sort of referenced it earlier,"
00:13:15,00:13:18,but it was a big deal that it was a Soviet export.
00:13:18,00:13:20,"And it was really, and no one had ever really"
00:13:20,00:13:23,exported something for financial gains in the Soviet Union before
00:13:23,00:13:24,because it was so difficult to do
00:13:24,00:13:27,"because that just wasn't what they were about, obviously."
00:13:27,00:13:30,So came out and the West was kind of very excited
00:13:30,00:13:33,and it seems like the Soviet Union aspect was a bit of a gimmick.
00:13:33,00:13:36,So they included the right visuals
00:13:36,00:13:38,on the Tetris packaging for the West.
00:13:38,00:13:41,"And so, of course, when you got the Tetris box."
00:13:41,00:13:42,"Oh my God, I know."
00:13:42,00:13:45,"Backwards are, backwards are."
00:13:45,00:13:45,Oh my days.
00:13:45,00:13:46,I'm afraid it was backwards are.
00:13:46,00:13:47,Oh my.
00:13:47,00:13:48,I'm afraid it was spelled with the backwards are.
00:13:48,00:13:49,Brilliant practice.
00:13:49,00:13:50,Absolutely furious.
00:13:50,00:13:54,"It's really, I think it's like the Tetris effect"
00:13:54,00:13:55,that when you learn in Russian
00:13:55,00:13:58,"and you just see these backwards letters everywhere,"
00:13:58,00:14:00,you can only read them because you're used to doing it.
00:14:00,00:14:02,You can only read them in the correct way.
00:14:02,00:14:04,"And it just, none of the words make any sense."
00:14:04,00:14:06,Maybe we're supposed to be pronouncing Tetris that way.
00:14:06,00:14:08,"So how should we be pronouncing it, James?"
00:14:08,00:14:08,It would be like.
00:14:08,00:14:15,But then also there's no I in the Russian language that looks like an I.
00:14:15,00:14:16,So.
00:14:16,00:14:17,I'm now picturing how pissed off James
00:14:17,00:14:20,must have been going to buy this backward are Tetris
00:14:20,00:14:22,as he's walking into Toys R Us to get it.
00:14:22,00:14:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:27,00:14:28,"Hey, can I give you one last fact?"
00:14:28,00:14:31,Which is that the link between Tetris and cats.
00:14:31,00:14:33,Was there a catress them?
00:14:33,00:14:35,There wasn't a catress.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"I mean cats, the musical specifically."
00:14:37,00:14:38,Oh.
00:14:38,00:14:38,Oh.
00:14:38,00:14:42,Which is that the text theme reached number six
00:14:42,00:14:44,in the UK charts in 1992.
00:14:44,00:14:46,And Andrew Lloyd Webber was the man behind it.
00:14:46,00:14:47,I bought it.
00:14:47,00:14:48,I remember.
00:14:48,00:14:49,Did he really?
00:14:49,00:14:50,"Yeah, yeah."
00:14:50,00:14:51,He had a pseudonym.
00:14:51,00:14:53,He said he had the pseudonym Dr. Spin.
00:14:53,00:14:55,"So you, James, walking to the shots would have just thought,"
00:14:55,00:14:58,"""Oh, I'm going to get the cool new track by Dr. Spin."""
00:14:58,00:14:59,It was actually Andrew Lloyd Webber.
00:14:59,00:15:02,I think we knew at the time that it was Lloyd Webber.
00:15:02,00:15:02,I think.
00:15:02,00:15:04,I can't really remember it very well.
00:15:04,00:15:05,"But it was like at the time,"
00:15:05,00:15:09,a lot of video games kind of came out as dance tracks.
00:15:09,00:15:10,OK.
00:15:10,00:15:10,"Oh, cool."
00:15:10,00:15:13,Andrew Lloyd Webber composed the tune.
00:15:13,00:15:15,"No, he remixed it, didn't he?"
00:15:15,00:15:17,"Because it's an old, it's a very old, well, it's in Tetris."
00:15:17,00:15:19,So it sort of existed.
00:15:19,00:15:20,It's a Russian folksong.
00:15:20,00:15:21,Yeah.
00:15:21,00:15:21,Yeah.
00:15:21,00:15:23,It's by Nikolai Nekrasov.
00:15:23,00:15:25,And it's the story of a young peddler
00:15:25,00:15:30,who seduces a peasant girl in a field of rye.
00:15:30,00:15:33,And he keeps saying that he'll offer her
00:15:33,00:15:38,like some of his goods in return for a kiss slash a shag.
00:15:38,00:15:41,And then she accepts a ring from him
00:15:41,00:15:43,and he goes to sell his wares.
00:15:43,00:15:45,"And he says, ""When I get all my money,"
00:15:45,00:15:48,"then we'll kind of get married and stuff."""
00:15:48,00:15:50,And that's where the song ends.
00:15:50,00:15:53,"But the original poem, he actually gets robbed"
00:15:53,00:15:56,and killed by a forest ranger when he asks for directions
00:15:56,00:15:58,on his way to the market.
00:15:58,00:15:59,But that's not in the song.
00:15:59,00:16:00,Game over.
00:16:00,00:16:11,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:16:11,00:16:15,My fact this week is that the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh
00:16:15,00:16:18,has ruled that all government offices must be cleaned
00:16:18,00:16:24,with cow urine on pain of death.
00:16:24,00:16:25,"No, it's not death."
00:16:25,00:16:26,But it is a new ruling.
00:16:26,00:16:30,So Madhya Pradesh is the second biggest Indian state in size
00:16:30,00:16:33,and it's got 72 million people living in it.
00:16:33,00:16:36,And the government has released an order
00:16:36,00:16:39,"saying that usually they'll use chemically made fennel,"
00:16:39,00:16:42,"P-H-E-N-Y-L, sort of chemical."
00:16:42,00:16:43,"Oh, right, not there."
00:16:43,00:16:44,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:44,00:16:46,Not the aniseed tasting vegetable.
00:16:46,00:16:48,"Sorry, they're not just rubbing licorice flavour"
00:16:48,00:16:50,"all over the offices, although that would be awesome."
00:16:50,00:16:53,And they have to use cow urine instead
00:16:53,00:16:56,or use sort of an acid extracted from cow urine.
00:16:56,00:16:58,And the decision was made in a cow cabinet
00:16:58,00:17:00,that was held for the last year.
00:17:00,00:17:05,I think it's kind of quite a similar fennel or fennel
00:17:05,00:17:07,"that they make from the cow urine, isn't it?"
00:17:07,00:17:09,It's kind of a very similar thing.
00:17:09,00:17:12,And is it the insides of the offices
00:17:12,00:17:16,or is it like the walls on the outside or what do you know?
00:17:16,00:17:17,"Oh, I think it's the insides."
00:17:17,00:17:20,I thought it was sort of like floors and surfaces.
00:17:20,00:17:22,"Yeah, so in place of detergent, right?"
00:17:22,00:17:24,"Yeah, that's what you scrub with."
00:17:24,00:17:28,And the idea is they want to create demand for cow urine
00:17:28,00:17:31,in order that the state sets up loads of cow urine
00:17:31,00:17:35,bottling factories and cow urine extraction factories.
00:17:35,00:17:37,So they think that if they make this ruling
00:17:37,00:17:38,that they'll have to set up factories
00:17:38,00:17:40,that manufacture cow urine for them.
00:17:40,00:17:43,"Okay, and the idea is that at the moment people keep cows,"
00:17:43,00:17:44,"especially for milking,"
00:17:44,00:17:48,but then the male cows are often kind of abandoned often.
00:17:48,00:17:50,"And so by creating this demand,"
00:17:50,00:17:53,"it means that if you have a male cow,"
00:17:53,00:17:54,then you might not abandon it
00:17:54,00:17:57,because you can milk it for its urine.
00:17:57,00:17:59,"Ah, that's a purpose."
00:17:59,00:18:02,I would have thought looking into the amount
00:18:02,00:18:04,"that cow urine is used in India for various different things,"
00:18:04,00:18:08,you wouldn't have a need for sort of creating more demand.
00:18:08,00:18:09,"Yeah, well, there's a thing there,"
00:18:09,00:18:11,which is that there are literally millions and millions
00:18:11,00:18:14,"and millions of cows on the loose in India,"
00:18:14,00:18:18,too sacred to be killed to the Hindu religion.
00:18:18,00:18:20,"And so it is a supply and demand situation,"
00:18:20,00:18:23,but unfortunately the supply is so massive compared
00:18:23,00:18:25,with a number of people willing to use cow urine for whatever.
00:18:25,00:18:27,"So what else do they use it for, Dan?"
00:18:27,00:18:30,"So, you know, some people drink it there."
00:18:30,00:18:32,It's seen as a health drink.
00:18:32,00:18:36,"I read particularly about one of Bollywood's biggest actors,"
00:18:36,00:18:38,"Akshay Kumar, who drinks it every single day"
00:18:38,00:18:40,because it's part of his fitness regime.
00:18:40,00:18:42,So that's one of the things.
00:18:42,00:18:44,It's used for religious services as well.
00:18:44,00:18:46,So if a new baby is born
00:18:46,00:18:48,"and you want to sort of bless your house for good luck,"
00:18:48,00:18:51,"you might, you know, put some cow urine around the house"
00:18:51,00:18:52,in order to do that.
00:18:52,00:18:54,"In fact, they sell it in London."
00:18:54,00:18:57,"You can buy cow urine in London specifically for that,"
00:18:57,00:18:59,"that I believe is imported sometimes from India,"
00:18:59,00:19:02,but also they manufacture it in Watford.
00:19:02,00:19:05,And it's called Gal-Mutra.
00:19:05,00:19:08,And there was a BBC report where they found it being sold
00:19:08,00:19:11,in certain shops sort of on the shelf above the naan bread.
00:19:11,00:19:13,And there was questions about whether or not
00:19:13,00:19:15,you should be doing that because it's...
00:19:15,00:19:17,"Yeah, we should say this doesn't, it doesn't work."
00:19:17,00:19:18,It's not good for your health.
00:19:18,00:19:19,"No, it doesn't help anything."
00:19:19,00:19:21,It doesn't have health properties.
00:19:21,00:19:22,We know that.
00:19:22,00:19:23,Do we know that for sure?
00:19:23,00:19:24,"No, we don't know."
00:19:24,00:19:25,But I imagine it works no better than placebo
00:19:25,00:19:27,"and in lots of cases, quite a lot worse than placebo."
00:19:27,00:19:32,It can contain harmful bacteria and cause diseases
00:19:32,00:19:35,"such as leptospirosis, whatever that is."
00:19:35,00:19:36,"Oh, right."
00:19:36,00:19:39,"But are they in India where technology, science"
00:19:39,00:19:40,is such a big thing?
00:19:40,00:19:43,Is there a big split between the people
00:19:43,00:19:44,who believe that this is useful than the people?
00:19:44,00:19:47,Is it kind of like homeopathy over there?
00:19:47,00:19:49,It's not seen as part of science.
00:19:49,00:19:52,"It is, but obviously it's incredibly widespread."
00:19:52,00:19:54,"So it's part of the Ayurveda medicine, isn't it?"
00:19:54,00:19:58,Which 80% of people in India would subscribe to that
00:19:58,00:19:59,"to some extent, I think."
00:19:59,00:20:00,But there definitely is a divide.
00:20:00,00:20:04,"So for instance, here with this ruling,"
00:20:04,00:20:06,"there is a rival body that's been set up,"
00:20:06,00:20:09,which has launched a competition
00:20:09,00:20:11,to challenge people to apply the scientific method
00:20:11,00:20:13,to all these claims that the government's releasing
00:20:13,00:20:15,about the good that cow urine can do
00:20:15,00:20:18,and basically prove that it can't do any good.
00:20:18,00:20:20,Because it's a big push by the government.
00:20:20,00:20:21,It's huge at the moment.
00:20:21,00:20:23,So there are cow ministries popping up
00:20:23,00:20:27,all over the country and cow ministers in states.
00:20:27,00:20:29,And it's kind of related a little bit
00:20:29,00:20:31,to obviously a bit of Hindu nationalism
00:20:31,00:20:33,at the top of government
00:20:33,00:20:35,and it promotes that side of things.
00:20:35,00:20:39,"So yeah, there is a divide, but it's really widespread."
00:20:39,00:20:39,Okay.
00:20:39,00:20:42,"Hey, by the way, if you spill your cup of cow urine"
00:20:42,00:20:44,"while you're drinking it in the office,"
00:20:44,00:20:45,do you just sort of leave it?
00:20:45,00:20:47,Because it's what cleans up the office now?
00:20:47,00:20:49,"Well, okay."
00:20:49,00:20:51,If you are in the office and you have a glass of water
00:20:51,00:20:53,"and you spill it, do you just leave that?"
00:20:53,00:20:56,"Well, you've asked the wrong person here."
00:20:57,00:21:00,But would a normal person clean up?
00:21:00,00:21:01,"Yes, I imagine they won't."
00:21:01,00:21:04,"Well, yeah, I think you can analogize from that."
00:21:04,00:21:06,"Yeah, it is really good analogy."
00:21:06,00:21:07,It is really bad.
00:21:07,00:21:09,Lots of scientists in India have basically
00:21:09,00:21:11,been under governmental pressure
00:21:11,00:21:12,to make research proposals
00:21:12,00:21:15,"on the subject of Gomutra, which is cow urine."
00:21:15,00:21:18,"Or the related substance, Pantrigevia,"
00:21:18,00:21:20,"which is a mix of milk, yogurt, butter."
00:21:20,00:21:20,Lovely so far.
00:21:20,00:21:23,Then cow urine and cow dung on top of that.
00:21:23,00:21:24,And basically they're saying
00:21:24,00:21:25,they won't get research funding
00:21:25,00:21:27,unless they research this stuff.
00:21:27,00:21:30,"So, yeah, it's a problem."
00:21:30,00:21:32,Pantrigevia means five cow derivatives.
00:21:32,00:21:34,Just a bit of etymology.
00:21:34,00:21:35,"Oh, that's clever."
00:21:35,00:21:36,"It's just every bit of the cow,"
00:21:36,00:21:39,"apart from the meat, of course, goes into it."
00:21:39,00:21:42,"Arguably, I would say the nicest bit,"
00:21:42,00:21:44,although that wouldn't get me very far in India
00:21:44,00:21:46,because eating cows is so verboten
00:21:46,00:21:48,in almost all the country.
00:21:48,00:21:52,Cow politics in India dates back to the '60s.
00:21:52,00:21:55,And this was when Indira Gandhi was in charge.
00:21:55,00:21:58,"Indira Gandhi, who was the daughter"
00:21:58,00:21:59,of the famous politician...
00:21:59,00:22:01,I'd say...
00:22:01,00:22:02,Nehru!
00:22:02,00:22:05,I've completely ruined it.
00:22:05,00:22:05,I'm so sorry.
00:22:05,00:22:07,I was so excited that I learned that
00:22:07,00:22:11,from my Asia and Africa course at university in second year.
00:22:11,00:22:13,My foot was hovering over the landmine
00:22:13,00:22:16,and Anna just stepped in and put a safe mat in.
00:22:16,00:22:18,I can't believe I did that.
00:22:18,00:22:19,I apologise to the listeners.
00:22:19,00:22:21,I apologise to my parents.
00:22:21,00:22:23,I've been looking forward to that all week.
00:22:23,00:22:26,I knew he was going to fall for it.
00:22:26,00:22:28,"Yeah, Nehru's daughter, wasn't she?"
00:22:28,00:22:29,"Look, we'll cut that."
00:22:29,00:22:30,Do it again.
00:22:30,00:22:31,"Right, go."
00:22:31,00:22:32,I'll say quiet.
00:22:32,00:22:37,"So, in 1966, there was a storm of the Indian parliament."
00:22:37,00:22:40,They were trying to pressurise Gandhi
00:22:40,00:22:42,to criminalise cow slaughter.
00:22:42,00:22:45,And she refused to kind of count out
00:22:45,00:22:46,to what they wanted.
00:22:46,00:22:47,"And she had, like..."
00:22:47,00:22:48,"Well, very funny."
00:22:48,00:22:50,"Oh, yeah, I didn't think that."
00:22:50,00:22:50,Yeah.
00:22:50,00:22:54,That's one thing that I hadn't been looking forward to all week.
00:22:54,00:22:57,I know you think that I was.
00:22:57,00:22:59,And you think that I've been leading up to that.
00:22:59,00:23:01,"And that's the whole point of this fight, but no."
00:23:01,00:23:05,So then Gandhi negotiated with these protesters.
00:23:05,00:23:08,"And actually, people really started respecting her"
00:23:08,00:23:09,a lot more after that.
00:23:09,00:23:13,"And her party, Congress, they chose the cow and calf symbol"
00:23:13,00:23:15,as a result of this.
00:23:15,00:23:17,And then cow politics kind of became
00:23:17,00:23:19,quite a big thing in India.
00:23:19,00:23:22,But what I like about Indira Gandhi is
00:23:22,00:23:24,she started at quite a young age.
00:23:24,00:23:28,"When she was 12 years old, she led a bunch of children"
00:23:28,00:23:30,"in a group called the Monkey Brigade,"
00:23:30,00:23:34,"which included 60,000 young revolutionaries."
00:23:34,00:23:36,And they would like send letters to people.
00:23:36,00:23:37,They would make flags.
00:23:37,00:23:40,They would put up notices before the demonstration
00:23:40,00:23:41,and stuff like this.
00:23:41,00:23:43,"And even before that, when she was five years old,"
00:23:43,00:23:45,she burned her own doll because she found out
00:23:45,00:23:46,it was made in England.
00:23:46,00:23:47,Wow.
00:23:48,00:23:49,Yeah.
00:23:49,00:23:51,The Monkey Brigade sounds like a deceptively innocuous name
00:23:51,00:23:52,for a bunch of revolutionaries.
00:23:52,00:23:55,It sounds like you're getting you little monkeys
00:23:55,00:23:56,as they're burning your house down.
00:23:56,00:23:58,"Yes, correct."
00:23:58,00:24:01,It's the Lord Rama in the epic Ramayana
00:24:01,00:24:02,had an army of monkeys.
00:24:02,00:24:04,And so they were named after that.
00:24:04,00:24:07,And so what's the connection of why she has the name Gandhi?
00:24:07,00:24:10,Is that through a marriage or is that something to you?
00:24:10,00:24:15,"She, I think, if memory serves, she was educated in England maybe,"
00:24:15,00:24:19,but she met someone who was not related to Muhammad Gandhi
00:24:19,00:24:20,"at university, I think."
00:24:20,00:24:21,Right.
00:24:21,00:24:22,It happened to be called Gandhi.
00:24:22,00:24:22,Yeah.
00:24:22,00:24:24,Wow.
00:24:24,00:24:25,It's a good name.
00:24:25,00:24:28,It's a good name to sort of take to the world of politics.
00:24:28,00:24:31,"Like, if I was a politician and I had the chance"
00:24:31,00:24:33,"of changing my surname, I would so look for someone"
00:24:33,00:24:35,with the surname Obama.
00:24:35,00:24:35,I just would.
00:24:35,00:24:38,"What's your name, Cathy Obama?"
00:24:38,00:24:40,"Absolutely, we're marrying."
00:24:41,00:24:45,"OK, here is another use of cow excrement."
00:24:45,00:24:47,It can be used as a mobile phone case.
00:24:47,00:24:52,There's one quite hard line Indian politician called
00:24:52,00:24:54,Shankar Lal who says that he has coated his mobile phone
00:24:54,00:24:59,"with cow dung and he said, if cow dung can treat cancer,"
00:24:59,00:25:01,why can't it save us from a phone's microwaves?
00:25:01,00:25:04,"OK, there is a flaw in that logic, isn't there?"
00:25:04,00:25:07,It's an if and it's a big if cow dung can treat cancer
00:25:07,00:25:08,because it can't.
00:25:08,00:25:09,It absolutely can't do that.
00:25:09,00:25:12,And this is a man who's speaking with poo down half
00:25:12,00:25:13,of the side of his face.
00:25:13,00:25:15,"So, I wouldn't take him seriously, would you?"
00:25:15,00:25:25,"OK, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy."
00:25:25,00:25:28,"My fact is that in 2020, a woman in the UK"
00:25:28,00:25:31,received medical treatment in two different hospitals
00:25:31,00:25:32,at the same time.
00:25:32,00:25:32,What?
00:25:32,00:25:34,How is that?
00:25:34,00:25:35,What?
00:25:35,00:25:35,I don't get it.
00:25:35,00:25:36,It's great.
00:25:36,00:25:37,"Hey, what?"
00:25:37,00:25:38,So exciting.
00:25:38,00:25:39,So this was a story that was in the news.
00:25:39,00:25:42,It was about a lady called Jan Ritzen
00:25:42,00:25:47,and she had a cancerous tumor in her leg.
00:25:47,00:25:52,"Now, she needed to have the operation where the shin bone"
00:25:52,00:25:54,was removed and then treated for the radiation.
00:25:54,00:26:01,"But unfortunately, due to COVID, all sorts of cancer"
00:26:01,00:26:03,operations have been moved to a specific hospital
00:26:03,00:26:04,which has been kept clear of COVID patients.
00:26:04,00:26:07,So procedures have kind of been separated out.
00:26:07,00:26:10,So the surgeons who were planning the operation
00:26:10,00:26:14,"realized that they had to take out her shin bone,"
00:26:14,00:26:18,"take it to a different hospital, irradiate it"
00:26:18,00:26:20,to completely kill any cancerous cells
00:26:20,00:26:22,"while she was still under anaesthetic,"
00:26:22,00:26:26,then bring it back and reinstall it in her leg.
00:26:26,00:26:27,Oh my God.
00:26:27,00:26:28,Unbelievable.
00:26:28,00:26:28,I know.
00:26:28,00:26:34,I phoned the surgeon who did the operation to ask him about it.
00:26:34,00:26:34,"Oh, cool."
00:26:34,00:26:37,"Yeah, he's an orthopedic on a call."
00:26:37,00:26:39,A psychologist called Ashish Mahendra.
00:26:39,00:26:42,And we had a whale of a time talking about it
00:26:42,00:26:46,because it's just such an interesting kind of miraculous procedure.
00:26:46,00:26:50,Was he the surgeon who dealt with it at the hospital
00:26:50,00:26:52,where she was or where the shin was?
00:26:52,00:26:53,Or was he just like the taxi driver?
00:26:53,00:26:56,"No, no, no."
00:26:56,00:27:00,"OK, so he was where the majority of Ms Ritzen was."
00:27:00,00:27:03,"He was with her, most of her."
00:27:03,00:27:05,He wasn't with the shin bone.
00:27:05,00:27:05,I read him one article.
00:27:05,00:27:08,"I don't know if Dr Mahendra said this to you,"
00:27:08,00:27:10,but that she could watch the footage
00:27:10,00:27:15,of her shin bone being dealt with from her hospital bed.
00:27:15,00:27:17,So they filmed it and she could watch it.
00:27:17,00:27:18,"But you said that she was anaesthetized,"
00:27:18,00:27:20,so I don't know if that's possible.
00:27:20,00:27:21,"Well, why would you want to watch that?"
00:27:21,00:27:22,"Oh, why not?"
00:27:22,00:27:22,"Oh, yeah."
00:27:22,00:27:25,"I mean, what else is on Snooker at the moment?"
00:27:25,00:27:25,I don't know.
00:27:25,00:27:26,Netflix?
00:27:26,00:27:27,You got Netflix.
00:27:27,00:27:29,Watch Stopping Your Mum or She?
00:27:29,00:27:29,I don't know.
00:27:29,00:27:30,Come on.
00:27:30,00:27:34,You'll watch an hour and 15 minutes of nerds playing Tetris
00:27:34,00:27:37,and you won't watch your own shin bone being operated on.
00:27:37,00:27:38,"Well, is it a whole channel?"
00:27:38,00:27:42,Can I flick over to someone's nose being operated on
00:27:42,00:27:43,in a separate hospital?
00:27:43,00:27:44,"Like, is it just one?"
00:27:44,00:27:47,"I did say, when I spoke to Mr Mahendra,"
00:27:47,00:27:49,he did say that she was under.
00:27:49,00:27:50,I'm pretty sure that he said that.
00:27:50,00:27:52,So I don't know whether she was on.
00:27:52,00:27:53,It's possible.
00:27:53,00:27:56,"I think maybe she might have watched it afterwards, maybe."
00:27:56,00:27:58,She might have watched it on plus one or something.
00:27:58,00:28:00,Yeah.
00:28:00,00:28:02,"But it's such a tricky operation to do this,"
00:28:02,00:28:04,because when you remove...
00:28:04,00:28:06,"Most of these tumors happen higher up,"
00:28:06,00:28:07,"maybe the knee or the hip, that's more common."
00:28:07,00:28:09,"And reconstruction is much easier,"
00:28:09,00:28:12,"because you can give someone a hip replacement, can't you?"
00:28:12,00:28:14,Or you can put some metal in which does the job.
00:28:14,00:28:16,"When it's a shin bone,"
00:28:16,00:28:18,it's much harder to reconstruct after the operation.
00:28:18,00:28:19,There's not much muscle cover.
00:28:19,00:28:21,The bone is really near the surface.
00:28:21,00:28:25,And there are many fewer options for reconstruction afterwards.
00:28:25,00:28:27,"So the bone, the shin bone they had removed,"
00:28:27,00:28:30,was the best thing to go back in.
00:28:30,00:28:32,And that's why they needed to do that.
00:28:32,00:28:35,"They irradiated the bone, killed off all the cells."
00:28:35,00:28:38,"But unfortunately, then you've killed off all the cells."
00:28:38,00:28:40,"There's no live matter left in that bone,"
00:28:40,00:28:42,and there normally is in our bones.
00:28:42,00:28:46,"So they had to use her fibula, which is the next door bone,"
00:28:46,00:28:49,and kind of use that as a spare
00:28:49,00:28:52,to put that right against the now dead shin bone
00:28:52,00:28:54,that was being reinstalled.
00:28:54,00:28:56,And that then helped to bring that bone back to life.
00:28:56,00:28:57,So amazing what we can do.
00:28:57,00:29:00,And then did you have to have like an arm bone taken out
00:29:00,00:29:04,to replace the fibula and then the side bone to replace the arm bone?
00:29:04,00:29:06,"It's not like rearranging a spice rack where you think,"
00:29:06,00:29:08,"""Oh, well, if I just put that there."""
00:29:08,00:29:12,"The only other thing I asked about was the container they used,"
00:29:12,00:29:14,because it's put in a special sterile container
00:29:14,00:29:15,to be driven across the city.
00:29:15,00:29:20,And he said there's no specific optimum size of the container.
00:29:20,00:29:22,"It depends on the tumor, it depends on the bone."
00:29:22,00:29:25,So frequently they will have to tailor make
00:29:25,00:29:29,a suitable container for the bone that is being moved around.
00:29:29,00:29:32,"I spoke to my sister-in-law, Beth, who used to be a nurse,"
00:29:32,00:29:36,and she said that she thought probably the reason they don't do it much
00:29:36,00:29:39,"is because of contamination, right?"
00:29:39,00:29:41,You don't really want to be taking stuff
00:29:41,00:29:42,across the other side of the city
00:29:42,00:29:46,in case you get some dust on it or a bit of grease or something.
00:29:46,00:29:49,But then she did tell me that what they used to do
00:29:49,00:29:50,to stop that sometimes with...
00:29:50,00:29:52,"You know, when you had to remove some skull,"
00:29:52,00:29:54,"some of your skull to release some pressure,"
00:29:54,00:29:57,they would take that bone and then they would put it
00:29:57,00:30:01,"inside your belly almost, like inside your body,"
00:30:01,00:30:05,because that's where the perfect sterile place is for human bone.
00:30:05,00:30:07,Isn't that amazing?
00:30:07,00:30:09,"Like they would cut you open, cut a little flap,"
00:30:09,00:30:12,they would put it in there while they let it all the pressure release
00:30:12,00:30:13,and then they'd put it back.
00:30:13,00:30:15,That's incredible.
00:30:15,00:30:15,Isn't that amazing?
00:30:15,00:30:17,That's amazing.
00:30:17,00:30:20,I was talking also to a surgeon.
00:30:21,00:30:24,"So my buddy Harry, Harris Akram, is a brain surgeon in London"
00:30:24,00:30:27,"and he was saying that when he was in India,"
00:30:27,00:30:29,"the hospital that he was staying at,"
00:30:29,00:30:32,you would be fitted with this frame around your head.
00:30:32,00:30:37,Imagine like in all those sort of mad scientist movies
00:30:37,00:30:39,where they put this giant frame on your head.
00:30:39,00:30:43,So it's metallic and it's big and it really sits on and clamps on.
00:30:43,00:30:45,So they would put that on there.
00:30:45,00:30:48,"But at the surgery in India, they didn't have an MRI scanner."
00:30:48,00:30:52,So they used to send their patients on the bus over to another hospital
00:30:52,00:30:55,wearing the frame on their head.
00:30:55,00:30:58,They would go have the scans done and be prepped
00:30:58,00:31:01,and then get the bus back and then have their surgery
00:31:01,00:31:03,once the scans have been sent over.
00:31:03,00:31:06,"Yeah. So in India, you would see people with these giant frames on their head"
00:31:06,00:31:09,who were just transporting themselves to a different hospital.
00:31:09,00:31:10,Very good for social distancing.
00:31:10,00:31:13,"Because from what you're gesturing here,"
00:31:13,00:31:14,it looks like you couldn't get that close to them.
00:31:14,00:31:17,"Yeah, it's quite a big item."
00:31:17,00:31:21,It sounds like that thing on SOAR that rips people's heads open.
00:31:21,00:31:23,Like you put them in this contraption
00:31:23,00:31:25,"and if you don't get the key in time,"
00:31:25,00:31:27,"I'm the only one who's seen that movie, okay never mind."
00:31:27,00:31:32,It's not a reassuring thing to say to the person who's diagnosed on the bus chains
00:31:32,00:31:34,on the way to their brain surgery.
00:31:34,00:31:41,I was reading actually a study about a particular brain surgery
00:31:41,00:31:45,where the surgeons use stickers to label little bits of the brain.
00:31:45,00:31:49,"So this is kind of just a throwaway comment in this study,"
00:31:49,00:31:54,but they referred to it as intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping
00:31:54,00:31:56,and they were basically trying to work out
00:31:56,00:31:59,which bits of their brain are responsible for which things.
00:31:59,00:32:02,"And so what they did was they would have a,"
00:32:02,00:32:04,"you know, when patients are awake but you're operating on their brain,"
00:32:04,00:32:08,the surgeons stimulated different parts of their brain
00:32:08,00:32:12,and then looked at what the patient did to see which things it affected.
00:32:12,00:32:14,"So if they prodded one bit, the patient might lose language."
00:32:14,00:32:18,"If they prodded another bit, the patient might start dribbling or something."
00:32:18,00:32:21,And then they added a little label to each little bit
00:32:21,00:32:26,"saying language bit, dribbling bit, walking bit, playing the violin."
00:32:26,00:32:30,So I didn't see a picture but I'm imagining a brain covered in post-its.
00:32:30,00:32:31,That was incredible.
00:32:31,00:32:35,There was another world world first of surgery which happened last year.
00:32:35,00:32:39,This was the world's first double penis removal.
00:32:39,00:32:42,Just from one person.
00:32:42,00:32:44,From the same person.
00:32:44,00:32:47,It was a baby boy who was born with three penises.
00:32:47,00:32:50,"One, not two, but three."
00:32:50,00:32:51,Yeah.
00:32:51,00:32:55,It's the first recorded ever case of human trifalia which is correct.
00:32:55,00:32:57,I was going to say tree-ness but that's…
00:32:57,00:33:02,That's Alexi's latest game he's working on.
00:33:02,00:33:04,Anyone for tree-ness?
00:33:04,00:33:05,That's incredible.
00:33:05,00:33:07,Do they keep the middle one or the left one or the right one?
00:33:07,00:33:08,"Ooh, good call."
00:33:08,00:33:11,They kept the functional one.
00:33:11,00:33:12,"Which, yeah."
00:33:12,00:33:16,The other two were more stubs than full-on.
00:33:16,00:33:19,They would have been able to get erections in but they were built.
00:33:19,00:33:20,Could they urinate?
00:33:20,00:33:21,Could you urinate out of them?
00:33:21,00:33:24,You don't know if the chords.
00:33:24,00:33:24,"Yeah, no, fair enough."
00:33:24,00:33:25,Fair enough.
00:33:25,00:33:26,"Like a sprinkler system though, Dan."
00:33:26,00:33:28,You think you could stand him in a garden when he's older?
00:33:28,00:33:31,You could stand at all three urinals at the same time.
00:33:31,00:33:34,You could piss on three people's shoes at the same time.
00:33:34,00:33:39,Do you think you would keep them if that happened to you?
00:33:39,00:33:42,"Would you ask to keep them because people do that for surgery, don't they?"
00:33:42,00:33:43,It's a vex question.
00:33:43,00:33:44,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:33:44,00:33:49,You wouldn't wear the mizirings or anything but you might keep them in a drawer.
00:33:49,00:33:51,Put them on a mantelpiece or something?
00:33:51,00:33:54,"I wouldn't know someone who kept her hip bone after it was replaced, yeah."
00:33:54,00:33:58,"Yeah, I was talking to someone we all know, Kase Molaker,"
00:33:58,00:34:01,who's the curator of the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam.
00:34:01,00:34:04,"Anytime he has surgery that is removed, a bit of his body is removed."
00:34:04,00:34:08,"So like gallstones or anything like that,"
00:34:08,00:34:10,he keeps it in a jar in his home and he's shown me them.
00:34:10,00:34:15,"And all the things to do with his kids when they were born, placentas and so on,"
00:34:15,00:34:17,they're all in formaldehyde sitting in his house.
00:34:17,00:34:18,"I know what you're saying, Dan."
00:34:18,00:34:21,"I love Kase, but he is a bit weird, so it's not..."
00:34:21,00:34:28,"Oh, he should turn it into a museum and call it Kases Cases."
00:34:28,00:34:29,"Oh, that's good."
00:34:29,00:34:29,That's wrong.
00:34:29,00:34:30,Lovely.
00:34:30,00:34:31,"Yeah, tall."
00:34:31,00:34:35,"Yeah, it's weird the whole ""do you keep your limbs"" stuff."
00:34:35,00:34:39,I was reading a thing online from someone who used to work in a funeral home
00:34:39,00:34:43,and said that they'd been asked to keep a leg in a freezer
00:34:43,00:34:45,and it ended up being for over a decade
00:34:45,00:34:46,because the person who'd had it amputated
00:34:46,00:34:48,wanted to be buried with it in the end.
00:34:48,00:34:50,"Wow, that's nice."
00:34:50,00:34:52,I think that's a bit cheeky.
00:34:52,00:34:52,Why?
00:34:52,00:34:55,"Well, it's using someone's freezer space, isn't it?"
00:34:55,00:35:00,"If I said to Andy, ""I've made some lasagna and I want to keep it,"
00:35:00,00:35:02,"but I don't have enough room in my freezer,"
00:35:02,00:35:03,"can I keep it in your freezer?"""
00:35:03,00:35:05,"I think, I'd say yes."
00:35:05,00:35:08,"I know, but you would feel like you had to say yes."
00:35:08,00:35:13,"As the years went by, I would slowly grow more lasagna in the freezer."
00:35:13,00:35:15,"I think, ""I've got some leftovers, but I can't freeze them"
00:35:15,00:35:17,"because James had bloody lasagna."""
00:35:17,00:35:21,And you'd probably keep occasionally bringing up lasagna
00:35:21,00:35:23,"just in case I remembered that, wouldn't you?"
00:35:23,00:35:27,"James, every conversation we had, I would bring up lasagna in some way"
00:35:27,00:35:28,or freezing or leftovers.
00:35:28,00:35:29,"Yeah, but this lady can't go."
00:35:29,00:35:31,Any plan on dying soon?
00:35:31,00:35:32,That's the only question she can ask.
00:35:32,00:35:33,"Hey, no."
00:35:35,00:35:35,How's your health?
00:35:35,00:35:37,You can come to a rental agreement in the end.
00:35:37,00:35:39,I imagine that the rental agreement would be the best way for you.
00:35:39,00:35:40,Really? Okay.
00:35:40,00:35:44,"Where James has to be for 50p a year, you could keep."
00:35:44,00:35:47,You're going to charge me to pop my lasagnas in your freezer.
00:35:47,00:35:49,"After two years, James, which is my cuss off,"
00:35:49,00:35:53,"but I think that's reasonable, I would insist on some kind of arrangement."
00:35:53,00:35:54,"That carefully, I thought we were friends."
00:35:54,00:35:57,I don't know if you've got a freezer.
00:35:57,00:36:00,I'm not getting involved in this.
00:36:00,00:36:02,49p a year.
00:36:02,00:36:06,[Laughter]
00:36:06,00:36:09,You get briefed on how to care for your limbs if you choose to keep them.
00:36:09,00:36:11,Do you get told?
00:36:11,00:36:14,Because you can be given them in formaldehyde and water.
00:36:14,00:36:16,"For instance, there's one way they get stored."
00:36:16,00:36:18,"And apparently you get a little briefing booklet,"
00:36:18,00:36:22,which says you need to change the formaldehyde and water every 10 years.
00:36:22,00:36:26,"So just setting alarm every 10 years is like changing the fish tank,"
00:36:26,00:36:28,which I think is about the same from memory.
00:36:28,00:36:32,"That is a great alarm to go off mid-meeting, isn't it, Eric?"
00:36:32,00:36:33,[Laughter]
00:36:33,00:36:34,"Oh, damn, sorry."
00:36:34,00:36:38,I just got to change the water and formaldehyde of my leg.
00:36:38,00:36:41,Just lean over behind you and release one spigot.
00:36:41,00:36:42,Start draining.
00:36:42,00:36:46,Do you know that people didn't really like wearing surgical gloves
00:36:46,00:36:47,when they first came in?
00:36:47,00:36:49,"Like any technology, I suppose."
00:36:49,00:36:50,There's always some resistance.
00:36:50,00:36:54,"But there's quite a lot of hesitation with surgical gloves,"
00:36:54,00:36:57,"because people would kind of root around with their hands,"
00:36:57,00:36:59,"and they felt like if they wore gloves,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,"then they wouldn't get the feeling,"
00:37:01,00:37:03,and they wouldn't be able to do the job quite as well.
00:37:03,00:37:07,But one of the reasons is because some of the gloves that they used
00:37:07,00:37:09,were not exactly good for purpose.
00:37:09,00:37:14,"So the first ones were like elbow length cotton or silk gloves,"
00:37:14,00:37:17,"and they would just get covered with blood within about two seconds,"
00:37:17,00:37:19,and you'd have to keep changing them.
00:37:19,00:37:24,"And then there was one surgeon who put wax directly onto his hands,"
00:37:24,00:37:27,"and so kind of dunked his hand in some molten wax,"
00:37:27,00:37:29,"and then let it dry, and then would use that."
00:37:30,00:37:33,"And the idea, of course, was to try and make the operation sterile,"
00:37:33,00:37:37,but a lot of people thought that maybe that's a bit pointless.
00:37:37,00:37:40,"They thought it's impossible to make everything completely sterile,"
00:37:40,00:37:42,"so we should just accept there'll be some contamination,"
00:37:42,00:37:45,but then try and kill the bacteria afterwards.
00:37:45,00:37:45,Do you know what I mean?
00:37:45,00:37:48,So there's like these two kind of sites of what they should do.
00:37:48,00:37:51,But now they use gloves.
00:37:51,00:37:51,Now they use gloves.
00:37:51,00:37:52,Which did they go with?
00:37:52,00:37:53,"Yeah, although I'm not sure."
00:37:53,00:37:58,"I think sterilization for operations, largely speaking, is orthodoxy now."
00:37:58,00:38:02,It's the preferred way.
00:38:02,00:38:05,Although sometimes you don't have a choice.
00:38:05,00:38:11,"There was a case in 1995 when a woman just was getting onto a plane and slipped,"
00:38:11,00:38:13,"and she thought she was okay,"
00:38:13,00:38:15,"but then it turned out that she'd fractured her rib,"
00:38:15,00:38:16,which had punctured her lung.
00:38:16,00:38:19,"And the plane was already in the air,"
00:38:19,00:38:22,and so they weren't going to be able to do an emergency landing
00:38:22,00:38:25,because the change in pressure might kill her.
00:38:25,00:38:26,And so they had to do something about it.
00:38:26,00:38:30,And there's these two doctors called Angus Wallace and Tom Wong.
00:38:30,00:38:33,"And the case was written up in the British Medical Journal,"
00:38:33,00:38:34,which honestly is such a good read.
00:38:34,00:38:36,It's an incredible story.
00:38:36,00:38:41,"And they used a, they kind of got a urinary catheter,"
00:38:41,00:38:43,"which was in the first aid kit,"
00:38:43,00:38:45,but it wasn't good to be used for a chest.
00:38:45,00:38:47,So they had to use a clothes hanger to stiffen it up.
00:38:47,00:38:50,They didn't have any sterilization stuff.
00:38:50,00:38:54,So they used Covoisier cognac to make it sterile.
00:38:54,00:38:56,They didn't have any surgical clamps.
00:38:56,00:38:59,So they held the incision open with a knife and fork.
00:38:59,00:39:03,"Sorry, it's the first aid kit that's supposed to be on board."
00:39:03,00:39:05,"Well, since then, since this happened,"
00:39:05,00:39:08,"the medical kits on certainly British airlines,"
00:39:08,00:39:10,"and I think American as well,"
00:39:10,00:39:13,"and probably throughout most of the world have improved a lot,"
00:39:13,00:39:14,and they've got a lot more stuff now.
00:39:14,00:39:16,So I read the story too.
00:39:16,00:39:20,And I love that she had complained about it before the plane took off.
00:39:20,00:39:23,And she said that she'd had a slip and it was this rib problem.
00:39:23,00:39:26,So the doctors actually saw her before the plane took off
00:39:26,00:39:28,"and they went, ""Okay, no, you should be fine."""
00:39:28,00:39:31,"And then when it got up to high altitude,"
00:39:31,00:39:32,it started really hurting.
00:39:32,00:39:35,And then she came clean that she hadn't just slipped.
00:39:35,00:39:38,She'd actually been knocked off her motorbike and hit by a car.
00:39:38,00:39:42,Just before getting on the plane.
00:39:42,00:39:44,So it was a proper accident.
00:39:44,00:39:47,"Actually, it was 10 minutes, this bit of surgery,"
00:39:47,00:39:49,and then they put this catheter in
00:39:49,00:39:51,and she spent the rest of the flight just watching the movie.
00:39:52,00:39:55,"Yeah, unfortunately, it was top of my mumbled."
00:39:55,00:39:58,She died of boredom.
00:39:58,00:40:08,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:40:08,00:40:09,And that is my fact.
00:40:09,00:40:12,"My fact this week is that in 1990,"
00:40:12,00:40:15,five children in America were given the first name
00:40:15,00:40:19,"spelt A-B-C-D-E, or ""absody""."
00:40:19,00:40:21,"All were born in Hawaii,"
00:40:22,00:40:26,"where the local alphabet doesn't actually contain the letters B, C, or D."
00:40:26,00:40:31,"Wow, there's a lot of things to unpick here."
00:40:31,00:40:33,So it's pronounced absody.
00:40:33,00:40:36,"There's actually a couple of pronunciations,"
00:40:36,00:40:38,"but that is one of them, yeah."
00:40:38,00:40:40,"And sometimes pronounced absity,"
00:40:40,00:40:42,which is what I'm going to call my gym.
00:40:42,00:40:50,"Yeah, so this was in an article that sort of erupted in 2018"
00:40:50,00:40:52,"when a girl who was trying to book herself,"
00:40:52,00:40:54,her mom was trying to get her and her daughter
00:40:54,00:40:56,"onto Southwest airplanes,"
00:40:56,00:40:59,"they took a picture and put it online going,"
00:40:59,00:41:00,"""Look at the name of this girl."
00:41:00,00:41:02,"She's her first name is A-B-C-D-E."""
00:41:02,00:41:05,And kind of shamed her and that turned into a national story.
00:41:05,00:41:08,But then people were digging into it and finding out
00:41:08,00:41:11,that this isn't as rare a name as one girl in America.
00:41:11,00:41:15,"It turned out that as of 2017, 373 girls"
00:41:15,00:41:18,"were named A-B-C-D-E, or ""absody""."
00:41:18,00:41:22,And further people have done sort of their little checks
00:41:22,00:41:24,into how far back the name goes.
00:41:24,00:41:28,"And in 1990, five were registered as being given that name."
00:41:28,00:41:30,And all five of them were located in Hawaii.
00:41:30,00:41:34,"And yeah, and it's been growing ever since as a name."
00:41:34,00:41:38,And it doesn't really have an origin as far as I can tell.
00:41:38,00:41:42,"Well, I mean, it does probably, but no one knows it."
00:41:42,00:41:43,"It must have started somewhere,"
00:41:43,00:41:45,it must have met some alphabet teacher
00:41:45,00:41:46,"in primary school going,"
00:41:46,00:41:48,"""Oh, I think that sounds like a nice name."""
00:41:48,00:41:50,"And spread from there, but we'll never know,"
00:41:50,00:41:52,unless someone out there does.
00:41:52,00:41:53,"Yeah, and it's, yeah."
00:41:53,00:41:54,"So, so the Hawaii,"
00:41:54,00:41:57,this is the modern Hawaiian alphabet that doesn't have it.
00:41:57,00:41:59,And I looked up our names.
00:41:59,00:42:03,"James, there's no J in the Hawaiian modern alphabet as well."
00:42:03,00:42:04,So your name is different.
00:42:04,00:42:06,"So Anna, your name,"
00:42:06,00:42:08,"if you were being translated into Hawaiian name,"
00:42:08,00:42:10,"is still Anna with one N, A-N-A."
00:42:10,00:42:14,"James, you are Kimo, K-I-M-O."
00:42:14,00:42:14,Strong.
00:42:14,00:42:17,I am Caniella.
00:42:17,00:42:20,So K-A-N instead of a D.
00:42:20,00:42:23,"And Andy, you are Analu."
00:42:23,00:42:28,"A-N-A-L-U, that's what you are."
00:42:28,00:42:29,"Analu, yeah, yeah."
00:42:29,00:42:31,"Yeah, Analu."
00:42:31,00:42:32,"I like, I like that pronunciation"
00:42:32,00:42:34,and I'm sure it's correct.
00:42:34,00:42:35,I don't know what the pronunciation is.
00:42:35,00:42:37,"It's A-N-A-L-U, yeah."
00:42:37,00:42:38,It sounds like a product.
00:42:38,00:42:41,Are you bored of Anasol?
00:42:41,00:42:42,Then try Analu.
00:42:42,00:42:47,I thought it sounded like a bathroom cleaner.
00:42:47,00:42:49,"It's more like something to sit next to the cow urine, I think."
00:42:49,00:42:52,A sequel to Despicable Me.
00:42:52,00:42:54,Analu.
00:42:54,00:42:58,So baby names.
00:42:58,00:43:04,"Baby names, we only know about baby names"
00:43:04,00:43:07,"due to a guy called Michael Shackleford, who in the..."
00:43:07,00:43:10,"Before him, people just didn't give Baby's names."
00:43:10,00:43:12,"They were like, ""What's this called?"""
00:43:12,00:43:13,No idea.
00:43:13,00:43:13,Just don't know.
00:43:13,00:43:14,"1997, so late."
00:43:14,00:43:16,We need Michael Shackleford here.
00:43:17,00:43:19,He was a guy who...
00:43:19,00:43:20,What are you talking about?
00:43:20,00:43:21,He worked at...
00:43:21,00:43:22,So it's the sort of...
00:43:22,00:43:26,"We only know that there are 373 absities,"
00:43:26,00:43:28,"for example, because of Michael Shackleford."
00:43:28,00:43:31,He worked at the Social Security Administration in Baltimore
00:43:31,00:43:33,and he and his wife were expecting a baby
00:43:33,00:43:36,and he just wanted to know if they were going to have
00:43:36,00:43:37,"a baby with a very common name,"
00:43:37,00:43:38,"because he was called Michael,"
00:43:38,00:43:40,which was a massively common name in America.
00:43:40,00:43:42,"And, you know, wherever you go,"
00:43:42,00:43:43,"three people born in his generation,"
00:43:43,00:43:45,"you know, someone shouts, ""Michael,"
00:43:45,00:43:46,"three people turned around."""
00:43:46,00:43:48,And they didn't want that.
00:43:48,00:43:50,So he thought he'd just program
00:43:50,00:43:51,in a little computer program
00:43:51,00:43:52,and work out the names.
00:43:52,00:43:54,And he thinks he was the first person
00:43:54,00:43:57,to see an accurate nationwide sampling of first names.
00:43:57,00:43:57,Wow.
00:43:57,00:43:59,And that was 1997.
00:43:59,00:44:00,Good old Mike.
00:44:00,00:44:02,A lot of people listening now think that I'm saying...
00:44:02,00:44:09,I read an amazing book called
00:44:09,00:44:11,"Fru Fru Frisbee and Brick,"
00:44:11,00:44:14,The Book of Unfortunate Baby Names by Russel Ash.
00:44:15,00:44:19,"And it's got people such as Mabel Abel, Ruth Booth,"
00:44:19,00:44:23,"Danny Fanny, Hugh Glue, and Nelly Smelly."
00:44:23,00:44:25,These are all people who were around.
00:44:25,00:44:28,There was someone in the 1830s in New York
00:44:28,00:44:30,called Preserved Fish.
00:44:30,00:44:33,His father was called Preserved Fish
00:44:33,00:44:36,and his grandfather was also called Preserved Fish.
00:44:36,00:44:39,"But his father and grandfather were both blacksmiths,"
00:44:39,00:44:41,but he was actually a shipping merchant.
00:44:41,00:44:43,He started off as a whaler
00:44:43,00:44:46,and then started selling fish.
00:44:46,00:44:48,And he was called Preserved Fish.
00:44:48,00:44:49,Amazing.
00:44:49,00:44:50,That's brilliant.
00:44:50,00:44:51,That's pretty much the most...
00:44:51,00:44:54,"It's not a subtle, nominative determinism, is it?"
00:44:54,00:44:54,Yeah.
00:44:54,00:44:55,It's a bit too on the nose.
00:44:55,00:44:57,I like it.
00:44:57,00:45:01,Does it help the name when you add the third to the end of it?
00:45:01,00:45:01,I don't know.
00:45:01,00:45:04,Preserved Fish the Third.
00:45:04,00:45:06,"Yeah, just sort of like, why are you called the..."
00:45:06,00:45:07,"Okay, the third."
00:45:07,00:45:08,I get it.
00:45:08,00:45:10,You've got weird-ass grandparents and parents.
00:45:10,00:45:14,"Eurythroscoggins, Philae leg and posthumous mints."
00:45:14,00:45:14,Just three others.
00:45:14,00:45:16,Philae leg?
00:45:16,00:45:19,"Philae, P-H-E-L-I-A, leg."
00:45:19,00:45:20,Posthumous mints.
00:45:20,00:45:22,Posthumous mints.
00:45:22,00:45:23,I want all my mints to be posthumous.
00:45:23,00:45:28,"Well, I've got some lasagna in my freezer, Anna."
00:45:28,00:45:30,I think you've been very welcome to.
00:45:30,00:45:37,Do you know when Baby sort of naming books took off?
00:45:37,00:45:38,1997.
00:45:40,00:45:41,No one had books before then.
00:45:41,00:45:45,"Well, there were..."
00:45:45,00:45:49,"I mean, they sort of really did take off in the 80s."
00:45:49,00:45:51,"But actually, they do date back way before that,"
00:45:51,00:45:53,sort of names of interesting babies.
00:45:53,00:45:55,"But they used to be in the back of cookbooks,"
00:45:55,00:45:57,because cookbooks used to have all kinds of extra gubbins
00:45:57,00:46:01,"in the later pages just to kind of pad out the recipes, I guess."
00:46:01,00:46:05,"So Mrs. Clark's cookery book in 1883 was subtitled,"
00:46:05,00:46:07,including what to name the baby.
00:46:07,00:46:09,It was kind of general all-purpose household guide.
00:46:09,00:46:12,So you've got that kind of thing in the 19th century.
00:46:12,00:46:15,"It's weird, because you don't want to confuse a recipe"
00:46:15,00:46:17,with a baby name.
00:46:17,00:46:17,I don't know what.
00:46:17,00:46:20,"No, that's how actually preserved fish got his name."
00:46:20,00:46:21,"Posthumous mints, yeah."
00:46:21,00:46:27,Couple of people who do have Hawaiian names that we all know.
00:46:27,00:46:29,So Keanu Reeves.
00:46:29,00:46:31,Keanu is a Hawaiian name.
00:46:31,00:46:35,"And yeah, and it's a lovely unique name in Hollywood,"
00:46:35,00:46:37,and it means cool mountain breeze.
00:46:37,00:46:39,"But when he first started in Hollywood,"
00:46:39,00:46:41,"his agent said, this name's not going to work."
00:46:41,00:46:43,"You need to go away and come back with another name,"
00:46:43,00:46:44,because no one's going to hire you.
00:46:44,00:46:45,It's too weird.
00:46:45,00:46:48,"So he agreed, and he went away, and he came back,"
00:46:48,00:46:50,"and he said, I've got my new name to his agents."
00:46:50,00:46:51,"And they said, OK, what is it?"
00:46:51,00:46:54,"And he said, I want to now be known as Chuck Spadina."
00:46:54,00:46:58,Chuck Spadina.
00:46:58,00:47:01,"So yeah, his agent said, I'm not sure that Chuck Spadina's"
00:47:01,00:47:02,going to work.
00:47:02,00:47:03,"Go away, come back with another one."
00:47:03,00:47:06,"So then Keanu Reeves went away, brainstormed, came back,"
00:47:06,00:47:07,"and said, OK, I've got my new one."
00:47:07,00:47:10,I'll now be known as Templeton Page Taylor.
00:47:10,00:47:11,"And they said, what?"
00:47:11,00:47:13,"Mate, you're not getting this."
00:47:13,00:47:15,"And so they said, just keep Keanu."
00:47:15,00:47:16,And that's the only reason he kept it.
00:47:16,00:47:19,He was so ready to change it to either of those names.
00:47:19,00:47:21,So do you think that he came up with these stupid names
00:47:21,00:47:24,to stop the idea of him having to change it?
00:47:24,00:47:25,It was like a clever thing.
00:47:25,00:47:28,"God, do you think he just is an idiot who doesn't know?"
00:47:28,00:47:29,One all name at a time.
00:47:29,00:47:32,"I think, yeah, I hadn't actually thought that."
00:47:32,00:47:35,So maybe that's exactly what he was doing.
00:47:35,00:47:36,"Yeah, not sure."
00:47:36,00:47:39,"It's sort of, that story reads like you're reading"
00:47:39,00:47:42,"Rumpelstiltskin backwards, doesn't it?"
00:47:42,00:47:45,When you go and try and guess at the name every day.
00:47:45,00:47:45,Yeah.
00:47:45,00:47:50,"In 1900, 91% of all children were given a name"
00:47:50,00:47:53,"from the top 1,000 most popular names."
00:47:53,00:47:54,This is in America.
00:47:54,00:47:59,"But by 2000, only 75% of girls were given a name"
00:47:59,00:48:00,"from the top 1,000."
00:48:00,00:48:02,"And for boys, it was 86%."
00:48:02,00:48:06,So a lot more children have been given unique names
00:48:06,00:48:07,or very unusual names.
00:48:07,00:48:10,And they've looked into this.
00:48:10,00:48:13,So it was a 1995 study and they find it's very common
00:48:13,00:48:15,in African American families.
00:48:15,00:48:18,And they looked at the whole country
00:48:18,00:48:19,over the whole of that century.
00:48:19,00:48:22,"And they found that in Illinois in 1920,"
00:48:22,00:48:27,31% of African American girls and 25% of African American boys
00:48:27,00:48:29,had unique names in the whole country.
00:48:29,00:48:30,"And the reason they think this,"
00:48:31,00:48:33,"there's someone called Sandra L. West,"
00:48:33,00:48:36,who is a co-author of the Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance.
00:48:36,00:48:39,And a couple of scholars called Ayanna F. Brown
00:48:39,00:48:40,and Janice Tuck Lively.
00:48:40,00:48:43,And what they think is basically the surnames
00:48:43,00:48:47,that African American families have are often things
00:48:47,00:48:49,that were given during slavery times.
00:48:49,00:48:52,And they were forced upon them by white people.
00:48:52,00:48:54,Whereas the first name is something that's given to you
00:48:54,00:48:56,"by a loved one, by a family member."
00:48:56,00:49:00,And so people will give names that kind of show
00:49:00,00:49:01,that they're loved by their family.
00:49:01,00:49:06,They can show that by giving them unique sort of special first names
00:49:06,00:49:09,because they're stuck with these old fashioned surnames.
00:49:09,00:49:10,That's interesting.
00:49:10,00:49:14,That we are definitely getting more into our unusual names.
00:49:14,00:49:16,"There have been various studies about why we have,"
00:49:16,00:49:18,"but I mean, it's largely obviously"
00:49:18,00:49:20,"because we're a bunch of individualistic millennials,"
00:49:20,00:49:22,"I suppose, and everyone wants a special name for their kid."
00:49:22,00:49:24,But there's also a really interesting study
00:49:24,00:49:26,which I thought sounded like rubbish.
00:49:26,00:49:30,And then I saw it being written up in a serious and reliable way
00:49:30,00:49:33,about how there's an exact correlation between how recently
00:49:33,00:49:35,a U.S. state joined the union
00:49:35,00:49:38,and how many newborn babies get unusual names.
00:49:38,00:49:42,"And so there's the idea that if you're a frontier settler,"
00:49:42,00:49:45,"so you're going and you're settling a new land,"
00:49:45,00:49:47,you are more sort of bold.
00:49:47,00:49:48,It's more bold society.
00:49:48,00:49:49,It's more individualistic.
00:49:49,00:49:53,"It's more gung-ho, get out and make your own way."
00:49:53,00:49:55,And it's much more likely that you'll be willing to break the mold
00:49:55,00:49:57,and give your kid a weird name.
00:49:57,00:50:00,So there's literally an exact inverse correlation
00:50:00,00:50:03,between common names and how recently a state was settled.
00:50:03,00:50:04,Same with Canada.
00:50:04,00:50:06,"On the east of Canada, which was settled first,"
00:50:06,00:50:08,kids have much more common names.
00:50:08,00:50:11,"But the west of Canada, which was settled more recently,"
00:50:11,00:50:13,"still has that hangover of,"
00:50:13,00:50:16,"""Yeah, when you hear, we'll do what the fuck we want."""
00:50:16,00:50:18,And that correlates.
00:50:18,00:50:19,"Wow, that's a very interesting idea."
00:50:19,00:50:21,"Not many Ivankas, it turns out,"
00:50:21,00:50:25,that people thought that perhaps there might be more Ivankas
00:50:25,00:50:28,because she was a prominent political figure.
00:50:28,00:50:30,Do you know why that might be?
00:50:30,00:50:32,Not many Ivankas.
00:50:32,00:50:35,"Because it sounds Russian-y,"
00:50:35,00:50:38,which might be a bit off-putting to all Americans.
00:50:38,00:50:39,There's something about that.
00:50:39,00:50:42,"Basically, there is not much fashion at the moment"
00:50:42,00:50:45,for any name which contains the letters N and K
00:50:45,00:50:46,next to each other.
00:50:46,00:50:49,"This is according to Laura Wattenberg,"
00:50:49,00:50:51,who wrote the baby name wizard book
00:50:51,00:50:54,and runs babynamewizard.com.
00:50:55,00:50:59,She said that basically NK is very much out of fashion.
00:50:59,00:51:01,"So Frank, for instance, very much out of fashion."
00:51:01,00:51:04,"Frank Ivank, anything like that."
00:51:04,00:51:08,"Yet my son, Wanker, is fucking the trend."
00:51:08,00:51:12,"You can get consultants, can't you?"
00:51:12,00:51:14,"You can get professional advice on this, if you like."
00:51:14,00:51:16,There are various services which do it.
00:51:16,00:51:18,"There's one which I found in America, which is called,"
00:51:18,00:51:21,"I love this, it's called Appalachian Mountain."
00:51:21,00:51:24,"So it's Appalachian as in naming,"
00:51:24,00:51:26,but obviously there are the Appalachian Mountain.
00:51:26,00:51:28,"Thank you, Andy."
00:51:28,00:51:30,"Just in case not everyone knows the Appalachian Mountains,"
00:51:30,00:51:33,"they're not in the top three mountain ranges, I would say."
00:51:33,00:51:36,I reckon I'm more familiar with the mountain range
00:51:36,00:51:40,"than the word to mean to give someone a name, actually."
00:51:40,00:51:42,"Great point, really good point."
00:51:42,00:51:44,"Well, anyway, I've covered the ground,"
00:51:44,00:51:45,I think pretty exhaustively now.
00:51:45,00:51:51,You can pay for the very basics is a 45-minute call
00:51:51,00:51:53,as a kind of urgent assistance thing.
00:51:53,00:51:55,"If you're, I don't know, maybe if you're hanging around"
00:51:55,00:51:57,"outside the baptism office, whatever."
00:51:57,00:52:00,Or you can pay a lot more and get an eight-page report.
00:52:00,00:52:02,"You know, if you need a baby name to work"
00:52:02,00:52:03,"in three different languages, let's say,"
00:52:03,00:52:05,"because the parents are from different places,"
00:52:05,00:52:07,then you can get that and it'll really drill down
00:52:07,00:52:08,into the detail.
00:52:08,00:52:09,"You want to avoid particular syllables,"
00:52:09,00:52:10,that's what you go for.
00:52:10,00:52:13,"Interesting, so they basically kind of go through,"
00:52:13,00:52:16,"you know, like in The Simpsons, when they name Bart,"
00:52:16,00:52:17,they try and work out if there's anything
00:52:17,00:52:20,"that rhymes with it and they go, ""Cart, dart, eart."""
00:52:20,00:52:21,"No, we're fine."
00:52:21,00:52:24,"Does this, for these people, basically do eight pages"
00:52:24,00:52:26,of possible ways that your child could be bullied
00:52:26,00:52:28,in every different country?
00:52:28,00:52:29,"Bullying nicknames, basically, yeah."
00:52:29,00:52:30,I think it's if you want to avoid
00:52:30,00:52:33,"particular abbreviations of the name,"
00:52:33,00:52:34,they can do that too.
00:52:34,00:52:34,Interesting.
00:52:34,00:52:36,I think if you need professional consultation
00:52:36,00:52:38,"over what to name your child,"
00:52:38,00:52:40,you've got to take a really long and hard look
00:52:40,00:52:43,at your capacity to make an independent decision.
00:52:43,00:52:45,"Okay, well, my parents wanted to call me anal you,"
00:52:45,00:52:48,so I'm glad for one that they took that advice.
00:52:51,00:52:52,"Okay, that's it."
00:52:52,00:52:53,That is all of our facts.
00:52:53,00:52:55,Thank you so much for listening.
