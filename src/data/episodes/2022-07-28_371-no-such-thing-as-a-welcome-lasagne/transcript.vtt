00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.240
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.200
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.400
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.960
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.720
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.080
 from the last seven days.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.600
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.800
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.040
 Okay, my fact this week is that the world's best Tetris player is a 13 year old from Texas.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.640
 The world's second best player is his 15 year old brother.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.280
 Are they also the only remaining Tetris players left on the planet?

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.880
 No!

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.480
 Anna, I'll tell you.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.240
 It is hugely popular Anna.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.720
 Yeah, the third best is done by the sounds of it.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.040
 The only other player.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.960
 I just think imagine being in that family like your two year younger brother beats you

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.400
 in the world championships.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.040
 But at least you are, you know, at least you're the second best.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.080
 So the best player is called Dog Playing Tetris.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.880
 I don't think that's his real name.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.960
 He beat his brother whose name is Pixel Andy.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.760
 The surname of these two people is Arteaga.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.000
 And if you go online, you can watch the final.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.400
 It's only one hour and 15 minutes with all the interviews as well,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.600
 which is 13 minutes shorter than the stop on my mum will shoot.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.360
 So it's a good use of your time if you want to.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.640
 But this is an interesting thing, I think,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.120
 which is that all the best Tetris players in the world were people of my age

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.960
 who kind of grew up with it.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.960
 And then very recently, suddenly all these kids have come in

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.520
 and started kicking everyone's ass at Tetris.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.720
 And the reason is that if you think about how I would play Tetris

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.400
 as a kid, I would be like on my Game Boy or whatever playing on my own

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.760
 and wouldn't really talk to anyone else about it and would just have to learn it.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.080
 Whereas these days they learn it all on YouTube

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.200
 and they're all swapping tips and all that kind of stuff.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.680
 And so the standard of Tetris has just gone through the roof in the last few years.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.080
 I mean, just leave it to us.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.840
 Why are they stealing Tetris from us?

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.400
 They've got a billion new fangled, colourful, high pixel games.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.400
 Just let us have Tetris.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.760
 No, it's new Tetrises. They're different games.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.440
 It's not like the same Game Boy.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.360
 That's like saying we shouldn't watch football anymore

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.120
 because the Great Manchester United team of 1990 is no longer together.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.920
 But wait a minute.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.480
 I mean, it's still blocks coming down from the roof.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.680
 And in the World Championships, they are playing pretty much classic Tetris.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.520
 So the basic formula is pretty unchanged.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.560
 This is the same game.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.320
 Yeah. The classic Tetris World Championships only dates from 2010,

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.840
 which I think is a massive swish anyway,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.360
 because it sounds like it's been going for centuries.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.040
 It started as a documentary, the World Tetris Championships.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.040
 There was a few people online arguing about who was the greatest ever player

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.600
 and someone decided, well, let's get all these people together

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.280
 and have them play against each other.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.280
 In that World Championships, the winner was a guy called Jonas Neubauer,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.600
 who unfortunately died earlier this year.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.600
 But one interesting thing about it, what I was saying,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.360
 about how you would kind of learn on your own and now you learn on YouTube,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.200
 there was the fourth place person was a woman called Dana Wilcox.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.240
 There was only two women in this Championships and she came fourth.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.160
 And when she turned up to the Championships,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.960
 that was the first time she learned that you can flip the

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.520
 blocks in two different directions either clockwise or anti-clockwise.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.240
 Oh, no way.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.440
 And she'd become like one of the top 10 players in the whole world

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.960
 without even knowing that.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.000
 How is that possible?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.800
 That's amazing.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.520
 Yeah.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.440
 I'm trying to remember if I knew that.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.680
 No, I don't think I did.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.560
 I don't think I did.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.760
 I lost to history.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.240
 Yes.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.680
 You know that champion you mentioned, James, Jonas Neubauer?

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.320
 Yeah.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.680
 He won eight of the first 10 classic Tetris World Championships

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.120
 and he came second in the other two.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.120
 So he's really very good at Tetris.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.120
 And he wrote an article in 2019 about his life in Tetris, basically,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.920
 which was lovely.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.680
 And he said, "Tetris has helped me to make quick and plentiful decisions

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.880
 in everyday life.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.280
 Have you ever been to a restaurant with a 12-page menu?

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.160
 I can scan the choices and make a decision almost immediately

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.520
 without a shred of regret.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.520
 Even if they bring me the wrong order, I'll make it work."

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.320
 I love that.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.280
 I just think.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.920
 Wow.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.320
 Yeah.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.760
 How does he relate this exactly?

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.480
 Sorry, what's the logic leap between his Tetris champion status

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.160
 and the fact he's fast ordering in restaurants?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.360
 Because you see the options.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.880
 You see the options in front of you.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.040
 You get presented with a range of choices and you think,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.560
 "Bang, I know how to make that work."

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.520
 I see.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.240
 I thought he was just, he was so desperate to get back to his Game Boy

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.880
 that he can't find a funny around choosing meals.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.000
 Do you think he only orders things like fish fingers and sausages

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.920
 that are coming in that kind of blocky shape?

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.840
 Absolutely, absolutely.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.160
 Square potato waffle.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.120
 Yeah.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.760
 That's too funny.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.000
 I actually watched an incredible moment in Tetris history.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.840
 It was Kevin Birrell who became the first ever Western Grandmaster.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.600
 So there's never been a Western Grandmaster outside of Japan.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.120
 And he recorded the video that allowed him to become a Grandmaster.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.480
 And what you need to do in order to get to Grandmaster level

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.400
 is you complete Tetris and you then have to play

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.040
 with invisible blocks over the credits.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.240
 And Kevin Birrell recorded him doing this.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.520
 It's a minute 40 seconds, which is 48 seconds shorter than,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.600
 "Stop on my mum will shoot the trailer on YouTube."

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.200
 So you can save some time there.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.320
 And you watch him going, "Tetris," when he says that,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.960
 and the moment that he wins it and becomes Grandmaster,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.640
 you are just with him.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.440
 It's heaven.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.720
 And he's jumping around the room.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.760
 Yeah.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.280
 Do you think that any Grandmaster,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.560
 I'm going to use inverted commas for that, in Tetris,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.120
 has ever been introduced to a chess Grandmaster

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.360
 and really claimed, looked them in the eye and said,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.640
 "I'm a Grandmaster too."

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.000
 To have a Grandmaster Club

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.880
 where all the Grandmasters of all the different games meet up.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.520
 The chess people aren't letting the Tetris guys in that club.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.080
 Why?

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.320
 They are turning those guys away at the door.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.680
 You're a Grandmaster and Tetris.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.000
 Yeah.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.480
 Yeah, no.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.240
 Your instinctive finger movements are at a level of no other human.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.000
 Chess people take hours to play the game.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.920
 They take single move.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.440
 That's a fair point.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.320
 They're winning on speed.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.120
 True.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.480
 We haven't talked about the origins of it,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.440
 how it was officially owned by the Soviet Union.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.440
 It was this guy, Alexei Pajitnov,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.400
 who worked at the USSR's Academy of Science

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.280
 in their computer lab.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.720
 And he liked making games.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.200
 And he liked geometric games.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.200
 And there was one which involved pentominos.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.760
 Whereas Tetris users, what are they called?

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.680
 They're called tetrominoes, because it's four.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.280
 And he had made this game.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.440
 He didn't really know how to publish it.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.040
 And it was already being pirated overseas

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.480
 because of how popular it was.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.120
 So he gave the rights to the government for 10 years.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.480
 And then the KGB got involved at one point

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.400
 in terms of the rights selling.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.920
 They always did, didn't they?

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.280
 They liked to have a finger in most pies back in the day.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.840
 Yeah.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.640
 He named it after quite odd stuff.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.800
 So Tetris, the Tetris and Tetris, that's just the four.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.440
 But then the isp bit is because his favorite sport was tennis.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.480
 It was mostly more for a man who devotes his life

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.720
 to sitting in front of a computer screen designing games.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.160
 But I suppose you've got to have another hobby.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.920
 So yeah, Tetris and tennis.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.560
 And I quite like the whole ominos thing.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.360
 This grew out of the domino,

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.800
 which was the original domino,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.640
 which is just a piece with two bits.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.040
 And then someone decided in sort of,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.880
 I think the 60s or 70s to make polyominoes a thing.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.120
 So that's one of those shapes

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.360
 with various numbers of squares in them.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.320
 So yeah, you've got dominoes, you've got triominoes,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.680
 you've got pentominoes.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.760
 Did you say there was an original omino?

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.600
 Or is that just the...

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.480
 This is a botched etymology.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.360
 No, that's the stem.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:57.920
 Uh-huh.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.800
 I don't think it is, though,

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.760
 because the dot in domino doesn't mean two.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.600
 No, no, it's not a proper set.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.840
 The dot was domino was a thing.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.120
 And then a person said,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.120
 "Oh, DOS sounds a bit like it could mean two.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.280
 So let's create this whole class of things."

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.400
 It's fraudulent.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.640
 It's a fraudulent etymology, is what I'm saying.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.400
 Domino derives from a word.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.200
 It was originally, we think, a hood that priests...

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.600
 Yes, Dominican monks, isn't it?

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.480
 Yeah, exactly.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.200
 And so the domino was the hood worn by the Dominican monks.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.640
 You know, it doesn't mean anything.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.160
 So what should we call it then?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.960
 I haven't got an alternative etymology just lined up,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.160
 because I'm not a faker.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.440
 I wouldn't do that to you guys.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:36.880
 Okay.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.400
 I mean, you seem quite angry about it.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.360
 You had a few hours.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.640
 I would happily call it a dot domino,

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.760
 because it's four sections,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.360
 and that could be two dominoes together.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.160
 Yeah.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.120
 Yeah.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.320
 Just sounds like you've got stutter.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.240
 Do you know why Tetris is so addictive?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.400
 This is due to something called the zygarnic effect.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.960
 And what it is, is that your brain is hardwired

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.600
 to whenever there's an incomplete task,

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.680
 you really, really want to fix it.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.880
 And so when the Tetris things come down,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.720
 every time you do complete a task

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.040
 and you get rid of one or four of the lines,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.480
 then it always kind of gives you more things to do,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.640
 because there are more holes that you need to fill

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.520
 and stuff like that.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.560
 And this was invented by a woman called Bluma Zygarnic,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.080
 who was Lithuanian,

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.720
 and she worked this out quite early in her career.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.800
 And then she went on to get a job working for the Soviet Union,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.280
 but she carried on as a part-time research scientist,

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.200
 which I quite like because she was all about

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.560
 kind of incomplete tasks,

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.880
 and she decided to carry on working part-time on it.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.640
 And then she won the Lewin Memorial Award,

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.440
 but unfortunately the Soviet Union wouldn't let her collect it,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.960
 and she died before she could collect it.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.000
 So again, that's another incomplete task in her life.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.520
 So she died happy, probably.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.480
 Yeah.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.040
 She died doing what she loved, not completing a task.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:57.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.680
 And then there's the Tetris effect,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.240
 which we will have all suffered from.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.040
 I imagine.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.200
 Yes.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.640
 The Tetris effects.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.800
 I think this is coined by a wire writer in the '90s,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.960
 but basically where you start seeing Tetris blocks wherever you look.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.680
 You start, you know,

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.120
 when everyone played Tetris in the '90s,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.400
 you close your eyes and you just see Tetris blocks falling in front of the greens.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.440
 And you can expand the Tetris effects to lots of other things.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.240
 So it basically means that you're doing something so much

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.920
 to such a stupid extent

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.200
 that everything in it is overlaid on the reality around you.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.000
 So sea legs is another example of the Tetris effects.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.520
 So you get off a boat.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.360
 So you're not at sea anymore,

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.960
 and yet you still feel like you're at sea.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.520
 Yeah, right.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.040
 Your body's too used to it.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.080
 Very nice.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.880
 Did you guys hear about the other study that was done on Tetris

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.440
 about how it can help with traumatic memories?

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.400
 This is amazing.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.560
 It's if you, you've suffered some kind of trauma.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.760
 Okay, so in this incident,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.560
 it was people who'd been in a traumatic car accident.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:00.080
 If you play Tetris for 20 minutes within six hours of the car crash,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.800
 you'll get 62% fewer intrusive memories in the following week.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.160
 It seems to prevent negative memories and flashbacks from even forming.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.680
 Because you think of Tetris instead or no?

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.560
 I don't know.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.800
 It's kind of that within those first hours

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.400
 is when the memories get consolidated for long-term storage, basically.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.960
 So if you just disrupt during that time,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.640
 Tetris seems to be especially good at it,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.040
 although I'm sure there are other things which could do it as well.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.600
 It kind of prevents the memories from forming in the first place,

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.600
 and then you don't get flashbacks later down the line.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.200
 What if the terrible memory that you have is of being a 15-year-old

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.680
 and your younger brother beats you in the well Tetris final?

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.920
 You should play Super Mario.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.600
 Just briefly back to Alexei, the inventor of Tetris.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.880
 I love that the very first version of it,

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.840
 he built on a computer that had no graphics capabilities.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.440
 So he had to make a text version of the game.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.440
 So the blocks were basically brackets put next to each other.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.640
 That was the first version.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.120
 And then Alexei didn't just invent Tetris.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.080
 He sort of quite quickly invented newer versions of the game.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.400
 So did any one of you guys play Hattris?

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.840
 Hats come down with different, like a top hat and the, yeah.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.200
 It's literally that, it's literally that.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.480
 It's Tetris with hats and hats come down and you have to line them up.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.480
 So he invented Hattris and then...

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.480
 I thought it was just playing Tetris three times.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.000
 It sounds a bit like it's called a Hattris.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.600
 That would be a fake etymology, Anna.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.880
 So sorry.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.920
 Yeah. So five hats of identical style had to be stacked.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.080
 And that's how you would remove them.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.960
 And entertainment weekly at the time said,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.520
 there is after all a cure for Tetris addiction.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.480
 It's Hattris habit that's even harder to kick.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.480
 There's word Tris as well, which was another Alexei game.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.720
 So word Tris, I actually think would be really fun.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.640
 The idea is that you had to create blocks of three letters.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.280
 So letters would drop and you'd have to create a word.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.760
 So you could make it, it's basically like a big crossword

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.320
 and you just have to decide where to land a letter,

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.520
 hoping, yeah, the next one, yeah, pretty cool game.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.520
 Do you know, I think that James would have point blank,

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.560
 refused to play Tetris when it first came to the world.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.440
 So it was Andy sort of referenced it earlier,

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.400
 but it was a big deal that it was a Soviet export.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.400
 And it was really, and no one had ever really

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.360
 exported something for financial gains in the Soviet Union before

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.960
 because it was so difficult to do

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.120
 because that just wasn't what they were about, obviously.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.400
 So came out and the West was kind of very excited

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.920
 and it seems like the Soviet Union aspect was a bit of a gimmick.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.880
 So they included the right visuals

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.880
 on the Tetris packaging for the West.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.600
 And so, of course, when you got the Tetris box.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.480
 Oh my God, I know.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.040
 Backwards are, backwards are.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:45.520
 Oh my days.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.880
 I'm afraid it was backwards are.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.360
 Oh my.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.720
 I'm afraid it was spelled with the backwards are.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.600
 Brilliant practice.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.720
 Absolutely furious.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.480
 It's really, I think it's like the Tetris effect

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.680
 that when you learn in Russian

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.320
 and you just see these backwards letters everywhere,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.560
 you can only read them because you're used to doing it.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.160
 You can only read them in the correct way.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.400
 And it just, none of the words make any sense.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.320
 Maybe we're supposed to be pronouncing Tetris that way.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.000
 So how should we be pronouncing it, James?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.800
 It would be like.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:15.440
 But then also there's no I in the Russian language that looks like an I.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.160
 So.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.760
 I'm now picturing how pissed off James

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.400
 must have been going to buy this backward are Tetris

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.320
 as he's walking into Toys R Us to get it.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.480
 Hey, can I give you one last fact?

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.920
 Which is that the link between Tetris and cats.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.760
 Was there a catress them?

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.680
 There wasn't a catress.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.440
 I mean cats, the musical specifically.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.160
 Oh.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:38.800
 Oh.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.320
 Which is that the text theme reached number six

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.640
 in the UK charts in 1992.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.960
 And Andrew Lloyd Webber was the man behind it.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.840
 I bought it.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.640
 I remember.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.520
 Did he really?

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.120
 He had a pseudonym.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.520
 He said he had the pseudonym Dr. Spin.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.760
 So you, James, walking to the shots would have just thought,

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.240
 "Oh, I'm going to get the cool new track by Dr. Spin."

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.520
 It was actually Andrew Lloyd Webber.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.240
 I think we knew at the time that it was Lloyd Webber.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:02.880
 I think.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.240
 I can't really remember it very well.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.680
 But it was like at the time,

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.280
 a lot of video games kind of came out as dance tracks.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.000
 OK.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.960
 Oh, cool.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.840
 Andrew Lloyd Webber composed the tune.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.280
 No, he remixed it, didn't he?

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.760
 Because it's an old, it's a very old, well, it's in Tetris.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.280
 So it sort of existed.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.560
 It's a Russian folksong.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.040
 Yeah.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.680
 Yeah.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.760
 It's by Nikolai Nekrasov.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.760
 And it's the story of a young peddler

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.320
 who seduces a peasant girl in a field of rye.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.040
 And he keeps saying that he'll offer her

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.960
 like some of his goods in return for a kiss slash a shag.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.520
 And then she accepts a ring from him

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.840
 and he goes to sell his wares.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.280
 And he says, "When I get all my money,

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.400
 then we'll kind of get married and stuff."

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.160
 And that's where the song ends.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.680
 But the original poem, he actually gets robbed

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.800
 and killed by a forest ranger when he asks for directions

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.080
 on his way to the market.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.840
 But that's not in the song.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.720
 Game over.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:11.360
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.120
 My fact this week is that the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.720
 has ruled that all government offices must be cleaned

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.000
 with cow urine on pain of death.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.360
 No, it's not death.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.960
 But it is a new ruling.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.720
 So Madhya Pradesh is the second biggest Indian state in size

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.200
 and it's got 72 million people living in it.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.720
 And the government has released an order

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.520
 saying that usually they'll use chemically made fennel,

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.160
 P-H-E-N-Y-L, sort of chemical.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.280
 Oh, right, not there.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.080
 Not the aniseed tasting vegetable.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.240
 Sorry, they're not just rubbing licorice flavour

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.400
 all over the offices, although that would be awesome.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.280
 And they have to use cow urine instead

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.000
 or use sort of an acid extracted from cow urine.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.480
 And the decision was made in a cow cabinet

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.400
 that was held for the last year.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.600
 I think it's kind of quite a similar fennel or fennel

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.440
 that they make from the cow urine, isn't it?

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.520
 It's kind of a very similar thing.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.880
 And is it the insides of the offices

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.080
 or is it like the walls on the outside or what do you know?

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.440
 Oh, I think it's the insides.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.320
 I thought it was sort of like floors and surfaces.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.080
 Yeah, so in place of detergent, right?

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.320
 Yeah, that's what you scrub with.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.800
 And the idea is they want to create demand for cow urine

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.600
 in order that the state sets up loads of cow urine

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.440
 bottling factories and cow urine extraction factories.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.280
 So they think that if they make this ruling

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.560
 that they'll have to set up factories

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.080
 that manufacture cow urine for them.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.760
 Okay, and the idea is that at the moment people keep cows,

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.880
 especially for milking,

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.640
 but then the male cows are often kind of abandoned often.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.880
 And so by creating this demand,

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.360
 it means that if you have a male cow,

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.800
 then you might not abandon it

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.440
 because you can milk it for its urine.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.840
 Ah, that's a purpose.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.240
 I would have thought looking into the amount

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.880
 that cow urine is used in India for various different things,

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.080
 you wouldn't have a need for sort of creating more demand.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.520
 Yeah, well, there's a thing there,

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.920
 which is that there are literally millions and millions

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.880
 and millions of cows on the loose in India,

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.320
 too sacred to be killed to the Hindu religion.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.320
 And so it is a supply and demand situation,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.360
 but unfortunately the supply is so massive compared

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.920
 with a number of people willing to use cow urine for whatever.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.920
 So what else do they use it for, Dan?

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.320
 So, you know, some people drink it there.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.640
 It's seen as a health drink.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.160
 I read particularly about one of Bollywood's biggest actors,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.960
 Akshay Kumar, who drinks it every single day

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.640
 because it's part of his fitness regime.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.240
 So that's one of the things.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.800
 It's used for religious services as well.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.160
 So if a new baby is born

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.560
 and you want to sort of bless your house for good luck,

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.680
 you might, you know, put some cow urine around the house

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.800
 in order to do that.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.160
 In fact, they sell it in London.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.120
 You can buy cow urine in London specifically for that,

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.840
 that I believe is imported sometimes from India,

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.080
 but also they manufacture it in Watford.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.040
 And it's called Gal-Mutra.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.000
 And there was a BBC report where they found it being sold

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.280
 in certain shops sort of on the shelf above the naan bread.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.200
 And there was questions about whether or not

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.360
 you should be doing that because it's...

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.120
 Yeah, we should say this doesn't, it doesn't work.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.160
 It's not good for your health.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.680
 No, it doesn't help anything.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.200
 It doesn't have health properties.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.080
 We know that.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.600
 Do we know that for sure?

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.160
 No, we don't know.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.840
 But I imagine it works no better than placebo

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.920
 and in lots of cases, quite a lot worse than placebo.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.000
 It can contain harmful bacteria and cause diseases

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.200
 such as leptospirosis, whatever that is.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.240
 Oh, right.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.600
 But are they in India where technology, science

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.640
 is such a big thing?

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.120
 Is there a big split between the people

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.960
 who believe that this is useful than the people?

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.280
 Is it kind of like homeopathy over there?

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.520
 It's not seen as part of science.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.240
 It is, but obviously it's incredibly widespread.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.880
 So it's part of the Ayurveda medicine, isn't it?

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.000
 Which 80% of people in India would subscribe to that

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.360
 to some extent, I think.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.640
 But there definitely is a divide.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.320
 So for instance, here with this ruling,

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.960
 there is a rival body that's been set up,

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.040
 which has launched a competition

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.360
 to challenge people to apply the scientific method

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.120
 to all these claims that the government's releasing

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.120
 about the good that cow urine can do

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.400
 and basically prove that it can't do any good.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.880
 Because it's a big push by the government.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.840
 It's huge at the moment.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.920
 So there are cow ministries popping up

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.120
 all over the country and cow ministers in states.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.120
 And it's kind of related a little bit

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.760
 to obviously a bit of Hindu nationalism

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.200
 at the top of government

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.600
 and it promotes that side of things.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.200
 So yeah, there is a divide, but it's really widespread.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:39.760
 Okay.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.400
 Hey, by the way, if you spill your cup of cow urine

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.160
 while you're drinking it in the office,

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.280
 do you just sort of leave it?

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.920
 Because it's what cleans up the office now?

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.040
 Well, okay.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.760
 If you are in the office and you have a glass of water

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.120
 and you spill it, do you just leave that?

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.880
 Well, you've asked the wrong person here.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.560
 But would a normal person clean up?

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.760
 Yes, I imagine they won't.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.160
 Well, yeah, I think you can analogize from that.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.800
 Yeah, it is really good analogy.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.760
 It is really bad.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.680
 Lots of scientists in India have basically

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.120
 been under governmental pressure

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.880
 to make research proposals

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.600
 on the subject of Gomutra, which is cow urine.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.080
 Or the related substance, Pantrigevia,

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.080
 which is a mix of milk, yogurt, butter.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.960
 Lovely so far.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.120
 Then cow urine and cow dung on top of that.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.800
 And basically they're saying

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.920
 they won't get research funding

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.760
 unless they research this stuff.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.160
 So, yeah, it's a problem.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.880
 Pantrigevia means five cow derivatives.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.880
 Just a bit of etymology.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.520
 Oh, that's clever.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.960
 It's just every bit of the cow,

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.440
 apart from the meat, of course, goes into it.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.640
 Arguably, I would say the nicest bit,

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.800
 although that wouldn't get me very far in India

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.640
 because eating cows is so verboten

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.480
 in almost all the country.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.320
 Cow politics in India dates back to the '60s.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.920
 And this was when Indira Gandhi was in charge.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.400
 Indira Gandhi, who was the daughter

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.600
 of the famous politician...

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.760
 I'd say...

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.240
 Nehru!

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.280
 I've completely ruined it.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:05.840
 I'm so sorry.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.920
 I was so excited that I learned that

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.360
 from my Asia and Africa course at university in second year.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.440
 My foot was hovering over the landmine

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.480
 and Anna just stepped in and put a safe mat in.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.000
 I can't believe I did that.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.680
 I apologise to the listeners.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.280
 I apologise to my parents.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.040
 I've been looking forward to that all week.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.160
 I knew he was going to fall for it.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.480
 Yeah, Nehru's daughter, wasn't she?

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.680
 Look, we'll cut that.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.400
 Do it again.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.280
 Right, go.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.080
 I'll say quiet.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.040
 So, in 1966, there was a storm of the Indian parliament.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.080
 They were trying to pressurise Gandhi

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.720
 to criminalise cow slaughter.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.040
 And she refused to kind of count out

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.160
 to what they wanted.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.600
 And she had, like...

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.640
 Well, very funny.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.160
 Oh, yeah, I didn't think that.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:50.720
 Yeah.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.640
 That's one thing that I hadn't been looking forward to all week.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.440
 I know you think that I was.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.520
 And you think that I've been leading up to that.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.120
 And that's the whole point of this fight, but no.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.360
 So then Gandhi negotiated with these protesters.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.240
 And actually, people really started respecting her

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.440
 a lot more after that.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.040
 And her party, Congress, they chose the cow and calf symbol

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.440
 as a result of this.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.440
 And then cow politics kind of became

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.040
 quite a big thing in India.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.320
 But what I like about Indira Gandhi is

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.480
 she started at quite a young age.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.080
 When she was 12 years old, she led a bunch of children

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.080
 in a group called the Monkey Brigade,

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:34.640
 which included 60,000 young revolutionaries.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.640
 And they would like send letters to people.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.920
 They would make flags.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.000
 They would put up notices before the demonstration

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.040
 and stuff like this.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.120
 And even before that, when she was five years old,

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.280
 she burned her own doll because she found out

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.400
 it was made in England.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.520
 Wow.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.040
 Yeah.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.760
 The Monkey Brigade sounds like a deceptively innocuous name

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.960
 for a bunch of revolutionaries.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.120
 It sounds like you're getting you little monkeys

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.800
 as they're burning your house down.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.000
 Yes, correct.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.360
 It's the Lord Rama in the epic Ramayana

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.720
 had an army of monkeys.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.320
 And so they were named after that.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.680
 And so what's the connection of why she has the name Gandhi?

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.160
 Is that through a marriage or is that something to you?

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.680
 She, I think, if memory serves, she was educated in England maybe,

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.760
 but she met someone who was not related to Muhammad Gandhi

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.960
 at university, I think.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.680
 Right.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.800
 It happened to be called Gandhi.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:22.960
 Yeah.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.080
 Wow.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.360
 It's a good name.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.720
 It's a good name to sort of take to the world of politics.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.600
 Like, if I was a politician and I had the chance

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.760
 of changing my surname, I would so look for someone

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.040
 with the surname Obama.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:35.600
 I just would.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.960
 What's your name, Cathy Obama?

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.000
 Absolutely, we're marrying.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.840
 OK, here is another use of cow excrement.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.440
 It can be used as a mobile phone case.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.000
 There's one quite hard line Indian politician called

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.800
 Shankar Lal who says that he has coated his mobile phone

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.200
 with cow dung and he said, if cow dung can treat cancer,

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.920
 why can't it save us from a phone's microwaves?

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.480
 OK, there is a flaw in that logic, isn't there?

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.280
 It's an if and it's a big if cow dung can treat cancer

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.000
 because it can't.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.120
 It absolutely can't do that.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.160
 And this is a man who's speaking with poo down half

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.120
 of the side of his face.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.040
 So, I wouldn't take him seriously, would you?

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:25.040
 OK, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.560
 My fact is that in 2020, a woman in the UK

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.040
 received medical treatment in two different hospitals

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.160
 at the same time.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:32.880
 What?

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.720
 How is that?

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.200
 What?

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:35.840
 I don't get it.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.480
 It's great.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.120
 Hey, what?

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.000
 So exciting.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.920
 So this was a story that was in the news.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.400
 It was about a lady called Jan Ritzen

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:47.280
 and she had a cancerous tumor in her leg.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:52.000
 Now, she needed to have the operation where the shin bone

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.640
 was removed and then treated for the radiation.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:01.200
 But unfortunately, due to COVID, all sorts of cancer

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.360
 operations have been moved to a specific hospital

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.960
 which has been kept clear of COVID patients.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.520
 So procedures have kind of been separated out.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.960
 So the surgeons who were planning the operation

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.720
 realized that they had to take out her shin bone,

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.160
 take it to a different hospital, irradiate it

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.080
 to completely kill any cancerous cells

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.160
 while she was still under anaesthetic,

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.800
 then bring it back and reinstall it in her leg.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.680
 Oh my God.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.240
 Unbelievable.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:28.560
 I know.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:34.080
 I phoned the surgeon who did the operation to ask him about it.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:34.640
 Oh, cool.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.440
 Yeah, he's an orthopedic on a call.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.440
 A psychologist called Ashish Mahendra.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.400
 And we had a whale of a time talking about it

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.880
 because it's just such an interesting kind of miraculous procedure.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.400
 Was he the surgeon who dealt with it at the hospital

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.240
 where she was or where the shin was?

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.840
 Or was he just like the taxi driver?

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.560
 No, no, no.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.880
 OK, so he was where the majority of Ms Ritzen was.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.520
 He was with her, most of her.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.040
 He wasn't with the shin bone.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.920
 I read him one article.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.400
 I don't know if Dr Mahendra said this to you,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.880
 but that she could watch the footage

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.440
 of her shin bone being dealt with from her hospital bed.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.440
 So they filmed it and she could watch it.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.960
 But you said that she was anaesthetized,

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.080
 so I don't know if that's possible.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.520
 Well, why would you want to watch that?

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.240
 Oh, why not?

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:22.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.360
 I mean, what else is on Snooker at the moment?

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:25.920
 I don't know.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.480
 Netflix?

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.200
 You got Netflix.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.120
 Watch Stopping Your Mum or She?

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:29.600
 I don't know.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.480
 Come on.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.480
 You'll watch an hour and 15 minutes of nerds playing Tetris

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.280
 and you won't watch your own shin bone being operated on.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.320
 Well, is it a whole channel?

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.240
 Can I flick over to someone's nose being operated on

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.200
 in a separate hospital?

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.400
 Like, is it just one?

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.440
 I did say, when I spoke to Mr Mahendra,

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.440
 he did say that she was under.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.800
 I'm pretty sure that he said that.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.400
 So I don't know whether she was on.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.520
 It's possible.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.320
 I think maybe she might have watched it afterwards, maybe.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.800
 She might have watched it on plus one or something.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.480
 Yeah.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.480
 But it's such a tricky operation to do this,

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.560
 because when you remove...

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.080
 Most of these tumors happen higher up,

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.840
 maybe the knee or the hip, that's more common.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.760
 And reconstruction is much easier,

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.480
 because you can give someone a hip replacement, can't you?

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.640
 Or you can put some metal in which does the job.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.000
 When it's a shin bone,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.400
 it's much harder to reconstruct after the operation.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.760
 There's not much muscle cover.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.360
 The bone is really near the surface.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.280
 And there are many fewer options for reconstruction afterwards.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.760
 So the bone, the shin bone they had removed,

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.000
 was the best thing to go back in.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.400
 And that's why they needed to do that.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.600
 They irradiated the bone, killed off all the cells.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.080
 But unfortunately, then you've killed off all the cells.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.480
 There's no live matter left in that bone,

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.320
 and there normally is in our bones.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.560
 So they had to use her fibula, which is the next door bone,

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.440
 and kind of use that as a spare

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.160
 to put that right against the now dead shin bone

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.000
 that was being reinstalled.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.640
 And that then helped to bring that bone back to life.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.760
 So amazing what we can do.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.080
 And then did you have to have like an arm bone taken out

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:04.160
 to replace the fibula and then the side bone to replace the arm bone?

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.880
 It's not like rearranging a spice rack where you think,

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.160
 "Oh, well, if I just put that there."

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.000
 The only other thing I asked about was the container they used,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.080
 because it's put in a special sterile container

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.440
 to be driven across the city.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.720
 And he said there's no specific optimum size of the container.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.560
 It depends on the tumor, it depends on the bone.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.040
 So frequently they will have to tailor make

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.280
 a suitable container for the bone that is being moved around.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.480
 I spoke to my sister-in-law, Beth, who used to be a nurse,

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.560
 and she said that she thought probably the reason they don't do it much

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:39.600
 is because of contamination, right?

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.280
 You don't really want to be taking stuff

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.560
 across the other side of the city

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.000
 in case you get some dust on it or a bit of grease or something.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.040
 But then she did tell me that what they used to do

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.400
 to stop that sometimes with...

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.960
 You know, when you had to remove some skull,

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.640
 some of your skull to release some pressure,

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.600
 they would take that bone and then they would put it

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.360
 inside your belly almost, like inside your body,

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.200
 because that's where the perfect sterile place is for human bone.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.040
 Isn't that amazing?

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.600
 Like they would cut you open, cut a little flap,

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.480
 they would put it in there while they let it all the pressure release

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.440
 and then they'd put it back.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.200
 That's incredible.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:15.760
 Isn't that amazing?

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.760
 That's amazing.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.160
 I was talking also to a surgeon.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.720
 So my buddy Harry, Harris Akram, is a brain surgeon in London

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.360
 and he was saying that when he was in India,

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.200
 the hospital that he was staying at,

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.720
 you would be fitted with this frame around your head.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.520
 Imagine like in all those sort of mad scientist movies

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.520
 where they put this giant frame on your head.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.040
 So it's metallic and it's big and it really sits on and clamps on.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.360
 So they would put that on there.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.960
 But at the surgery in India, they didn't have an MRI scanner.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.560
 So they used to send their patients on the bus over to another hospital

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.120
 wearing the frame on their head.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.720
 They would go have the scans done and be prepped

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.840
 and then get the bus back and then have their surgery

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.520
 once the scans have been sent over.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.320
 Yeah. So in India, you would see people with these giant frames on their head

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.280
 who were just transporting themselves to a different hospital.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.640
 Very good for social distancing.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.120
 Because from what you're gesturing here,

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.880
 it looks like you couldn't get that close to them.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.520
 Yeah, it's quite a big item.

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.680
 It sounds like that thing on SOAR that rips people's heads open.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.280
 Like you put them in this contraption

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.520
 and if you don't get the key in time,

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.520
 I'm the only one who's seen that movie, okay never mind.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:32.640
 It's not a reassuring thing to say to the person who's diagnosed on the bus chains

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.880
 on the way to their brain surgery.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:41.040
 I was reading actually a study about a particular brain surgery

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.600
 where the surgeons use stickers to label little bits of the brain.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.920
 So this is kind of just a throwaway comment in this study,

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.800
 but they referred to it as intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.080
 and they were basically trying to work out

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.040
 which bits of their brain are responsible for which things.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.000
 And so what they did was they would have a,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.880
 you know, when patients are awake but you're operating on their brain,

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.240
 the surgeons stimulated different parts of their brain

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.000
 and then looked at what the patient did to see which things it affected.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.800
 So if they prodded one bit, the patient might lose language.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.000
 If they prodded another bit, the patient might start dribbling or something.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.120
 And then they added a little label to each little bit

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:26.320
 saying language bit, dribbling bit, walking bit, playing the violin.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.560
 So I didn't see a picture but I'm imagining a brain covered in post-its.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.760
 That was incredible.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.760
 There was another world world first of surgery which happened last year.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.600
 This was the world's first double penis removal.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.480
 Just from one person.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.080
 From the same person.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.600
 It was a baby boy who was born with three penises.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.640
 One, not two, but three.

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.040
 Yeah.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:55.600
 It's the first recorded ever case of human trifalia which is correct.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.520
 I was going to say tree-ness but that's…

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.000
 That's Alexi's latest game he's working on.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.800
 Anyone for tree-ness?

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.600
 That's incredible.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.920
 Do they keep the middle one or the left one or the right one?

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.480
 Ooh, good call.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.040
 They kept the functional one.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.640
 Which, yeah.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.400
 The other two were more stubs than full-on.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.280
 They would have been able to get erections in but they were built.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.080
 Could they urinate?

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.200
 Could you urinate out of them?

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.000
 You don't know if the chords.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.640
 Yeah, no, fair enough.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.200
 Fair enough.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.560
 Like a sprinkler system though, Dan.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.720
 You think you could stand him in a garden when he's older?

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.520
 You could stand at all three urinals at the same time.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.960
 You could piss on three people's shoes at the same time.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.360
 Do you think you would keep them if that happened to you?

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.480
 Would you ask to keep them because people do that for surgery, don't they?

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.600
 It's a vex question.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.480
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:49.680
 You wouldn't wear the mizirings or anything but you might keep them in a drawer.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.760
 Put them on a mantelpiece or something?

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.800
 I wouldn't know someone who kept her hip bone after it was replaced, yeah.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.400
 Yeah, I was talking to someone we all know, Kase Molaker,

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.680
 who's the curator of the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.880
 Anytime he has surgery that is removed, a bit of his body is removed.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:08.160
 So like gallstones or anything like that,

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.400
 he keeps it in a jar in his home and he's shown me them.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.280
 And all the things to do with his kids when they were born, placentas and so on,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.360
 they're all in formaldehyde sitting in his house.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.800
 I know what you're saying, Dan.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.440
 I love Kase, but he is a bit weird, so it's not...

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:28.000
 Oh, he should turn it into a museum and call it Kases Cases.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.120
 Oh, that's good.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:29.520
 That's wrong.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.560
 Lovely.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.280
 Yeah, tall.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.760
 Yeah, it's weird the whole "do you keep your limbs" stuff.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.760
 I was reading a thing online from someone who used to work in a funeral home

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.360
 and said that they'd been asked to keep a leg in a freezer

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.200
 and it ended up being for over a decade

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.640
 because the person who'd had it amputated

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.000
 wanted to be buried with it in the end.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.560
 Wow, that's nice.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.560
 I think that's a bit cheeky.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:52.880
 Why?

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.840
 Well, it's using someone's freezer space, isn't it?

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.720
 If I said to Andy, "I've made some lasagna and I want to keep it,

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.320
 but I don't have enough room in my freezer,

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.600
 can I keep it in your freezer?"

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.440
 I think, I'd say yes.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.000
 I know, but you would feel like you had to say yes.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.120
 As the years went by, I would slowly grow more lasagna in the freezer.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.600
 I think, "I've got some leftovers, but I can't freeze them

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.040
 because James had bloody lasagna."

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.120
 And you'd probably keep occasionally bringing up lasagna

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.280
 just in case I remembered that, wouldn't you?

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.360
 James, every conversation we had, I would bring up lasagna in some way

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.560
 or freezing or leftovers.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.680
 Yeah, but this lady can't go.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.280
 Any plan on dying soon?

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.720
 That's the only question she can ask.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.200
 Hey, no.

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:35.600
 How's your health?

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.120
 You can come to a rental agreement in the end.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.360
 I imagine that the rental agreement would be the best way for you.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.320
 Really? Okay.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.080
 Where James has to be for 50p a year, you could keep.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.920
 You're going to charge me to pop my lasagnas in your freezer.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.920
 After two years, James, which is my cuss off,

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.200
 but I think that's reasonable, I would insist on some kind of arrangement.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.720
 That carefully, I thought we were friends.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.680
 I don't know if you've got a freezer.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.720
 I'm not getting involved in this.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.880
 49p a year.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.320
 [Laughter]

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.760
 You get briefed on how to care for your limbs if you choose to keep them.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.120
 Do you get told?

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.480
 Because you can be given them in formaldehyde and water.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.400
 For instance, there's one way they get stored.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.720
 And apparently you get a little briefing booklet,

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.080
 which says you need to change the formaldehyde and water every 10 years.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.880
 So just setting alarm every 10 years is like changing the fish tank,

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.800
 which I think is about the same from memory.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.080
 That is a great alarm to go off mid-meeting, isn't it, Eric?

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.440
 [Laughter]

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.320
 Oh, damn, sorry.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.160
 I just got to change the water and formaldehyde of my leg.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.600
 Just lean over behind you and release one spigot.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.400
 Start draining.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.880
 Do you know that people didn't really like wearing surgical gloves

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.840
 when they first came in?

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.600
 Like any technology, I suppose.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.880
 There's always some resistance.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.480
 But there's quite a lot of hesitation with surgical gloves,

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.280
 because people would kind of root around with their hands,

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.680
 and they felt like if they wore gloves,

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.120
 then they wouldn't get the feeling,

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.200
 and they wouldn't be able to do the job quite as well.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.440
 But one of the reasons is because some of the gloves that they used

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.280
 were not exactly good for purpose.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:14.080
 So the first ones were like elbow length cotton or silk gloves,

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.680
 and they would just get covered with blood within about two seconds,

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.440
 and you'd have to keep changing them.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:24.000
 And then there was one surgeon who put wax directly onto his hands,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.040
 and so kind of dunked his hand in some molten wax,

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.360
 and then let it dry, and then would use that.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.760
 And the idea, of course, was to try and make the operation sterile,

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.120
 but a lot of people thought that maybe that's a bit pointless.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.160
 They thought it's impossible to make everything completely sterile,

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.640
 so we should just accept there'll be some contamination,

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.360
 but then try and kill the bacteria afterwards.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:45.920
 Do you know what I mean?

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.960
 So there's like these two kind of sites of what they should do.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.680
 But now they use gloves.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:51.920
 Now they use gloves.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:52.800
 Which did they go with?

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.680
 Yeah, although I'm not sure.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.800
 I think sterilization for operations, largely speaking, is orthodoxy now.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.640
 It's the preferred way.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.200
 Although sometimes you don't have a choice.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:11.760
 There was a case in 1995 when a woman just was getting onto a plane and slipped,

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.520
 and she thought she was okay,

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.600
 but then it turned out that she'd fractured her rib,

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.800
 which had punctured her lung.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.920
 And the plane was already in the air,

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.480
 and so they weren't going to be able to do an emergency landing

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.040
 because the change in pressure might kill her.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.960
 And so they had to do something about it.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.320
 And there's these two doctors called Angus Wallace and Tom Wong.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.120
 And the case was written up in the British Medical Journal,

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.800
 which honestly is such a good read.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.000
 It's an incredible story.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.360
 And they used a, they kind of got a urinary catheter,

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.360
 which was in the first aid kit,

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.120
 but it wasn't good to be used for a chest.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.600
 So they had to use a clothes hanger to stiffen it up.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.880
 They didn't have any sterilization stuff.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.160
 So they used Covoisier cognac to make it sterile.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.640
 They didn't have any surgical clamps.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.120
 So they held the incision open with a knife and fork.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.440
 Sorry, it's the first aid kit that's supposed to be on board.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.680
 Well, since then, since this happened,

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.960
 the medical kits on certainly British airlines,

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.240
 and I think American as well,

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.040
 and probably throughout most of the world have improved a lot,

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.480
 and they've got a lot more stuff now.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.640
 So I read the story too.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.640
 And I love that she had complained about it before the plane took off.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.760
 And she said that she'd had a slip and it was this rib problem.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.800
 So the doctors actually saw her before the plane took off

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.960
 and they went, "Okay, no, you should be fine."

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.120
 And then when it got up to high altitude,

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.720
 it started really hurting.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.360
 And then she came clean that she hadn't just slipped.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.400
 She'd actually been knocked off her motorbike and hit by a car.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.000
 Just before getting on the plane.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.080
 So it was a proper accident.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.120
 Actually, it was 10 minutes, this bit of surgery,

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.040
 and then they put this catheter in

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.520
 and she spent the rest of the flight just watching the movie.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.360
 Yeah, unfortunately, it was top of my mumbled.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.080
 She died of boredom.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:08.560
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.600
 And that is my fact.

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.640
 My fact this week is that in 1990,

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.520
 five children in America were given the first name

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.920
 spelt A-B-C-D-E, or "absody".

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.440
 All were born in Hawaii,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.160
 where the local alphabet doesn't actually contain the letters B, C, or D.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:31.280
 Wow, there's a lot of things to unpick here.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.840
 So it's pronounced absody.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.320
 There's actually a couple of pronunciations,

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.080
 but that is one of them, yeah.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.720
 And sometimes pronounced absity,

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.320
 which is what I'm going to call my gym.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:50.240
 Yeah, so this was in an article that sort of erupted in 2018

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.880
 when a girl who was trying to book herself,

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.800
 her mom was trying to get her and her daughter

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.400
 onto Southwest airplanes,

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.360
 they took a picture and put it online going,

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.400
 "Look at the name of this girl.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.400
 She's her first name is A-B-C-D-E."

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.920
 And kind of shamed her and that turned into a national story.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.080
 But then people were digging into it and finding out

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.520
 that this isn't as rare a name as one girl in America.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.280
 It turned out that as of 2017, 373 girls

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.880
 were named A-B-C-D-E, or "absody".

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.320
 And further people have done sort of their little checks

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.000
 into how far back the name goes.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.320
 And in 1990, five were registered as being given that name.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.640
 And all five of them were located in Hawaii.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.240
 And yeah, and it's been growing ever since as a name.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:38.240
 And it doesn't really have an origin as far as I can tell.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.000
 Well, I mean, it does probably, but no one knows it.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.120
 It must have started somewhere,

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.200
 it must have met some alphabet teacher

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.400
 in primary school going,

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.400
 "Oh, I think that sounds like a nice name."

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.640
 And spread from there, but we'll never know,

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.160
 unless someone out there does.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.760
 Yeah, and it's, yeah.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.880
 So, so the Hawaii,

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.200
 this is the modern Hawaiian alphabet that doesn't have it.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.920
 And I looked up our names.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.440
 James, there's no J in the Hawaiian modern alphabet as well.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.800
 So your name is different.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.160
 So Anna, your name,

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.320
 if you were being translated into Hawaiian name,

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.480
 is still Anna with one N, A-N-A.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.160
 James, you are Kimo, K-I-M-O.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:14.640
 Strong.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.040
 I am Caniella.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.560
 So K-A-N instead of a D.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.280
 And Andy, you are Analu.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.400
 A-N-A-L-U, that's what you are.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.760
 Analu, yeah, yeah.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.200
 Yeah, Analu.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.960
 I like, I like that pronunciation

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.000
 and I'm sure it's correct.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.440
 I don't know what the pronunciation is.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.040
 It's A-N-A-L-U, yeah.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.080
 It sounds like a product.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.840
 Are you bored of Anasol?

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.960
 Then try Analu.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:47.600
 I thought it sounded like a bathroom cleaner.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.840
 It's more like something to sit next to the cow urine, I think.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.560
 A sequel to Despicable Me.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.960
 Analu.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.240
 So baby names.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:04.080
 Baby names, we only know about baby names

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.040
 due to a guy called Michael Shackleford, who in the...

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.720
 Before him, people just didn't give Baby's names.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.320
 They were like, "What's this called?"

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.040
 No idea.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:13.680
 Just don't know.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.800
 1997, so late.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.320
 We need Michael Shackleford here.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.200
 He was a guy who...

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.720
 What are you talking about?

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.440
 He worked at...

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.880
 So it's the sort of...

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.560
 We only know that there are 373 absities,

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.400
 for example, because of Michael Shackleford.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.440
 He worked at the Social Security Administration in Baltimore

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.280
 and he and his wife were expecting a baby

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.080
 and he just wanted to know if they were going to have

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.360
 a baby with a very common name,

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.400
 because he was called Michael,

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.880
 which was a massively common name in America.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.240
 And, you know, wherever you go,

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.920
 three people born in his generation,

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.520
 you know, someone shouts, "Michael,

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.480
 three people turned around."

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.560
 And they didn't want that.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.160
 So he thought he'd just program

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.520
 in a little computer program

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.480
 and work out the names.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.320
 And he thinks he was the first person

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.280
 to see an accurate nationwide sampling of first names.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:57.680
 Wow.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.200
 And that was 1997.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.000
 Good old Mike.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.960
 A lot of people listening now think that I'm saying...

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:09.680
 I read an amazing book called

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.360
 Fru Fru Frisbee and Brick,

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.240
 The Book of Unfortunate Baby Names by Russel Ash.

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:19.440
 And it's got people such as Mabel Abel, Ruth Booth,

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:23.120
 Danny Fanny, Hugh Glue, and Nelly Smelly.

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.200
 These are all people who were around.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.640
 There was someone in the 1830s in New York

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.000
 called Preserved Fish.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.520
 His father was called Preserved Fish

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.080
 and his grandfather was also called Preserved Fish.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.360
 But his father and grandfather were both blacksmiths,

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.840
 but he was actually a shipping merchant.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.440
 He started off as a whaler

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.160
 and then started selling fish.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.160
 And he was called Preserved Fish.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.760
 Amazing.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.640
 That's brilliant.

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.680
 That's pretty much the most...

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.320
 It's not a subtle, nominative determinism, is it?

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:54.720
 Yeah.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.840
 It's a bit too on the nose.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.120
 I like it.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.360
 Does it help the name when you add the third to the end of it?

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:01.920
 I don't know.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.000
 Preserved Fish the Third.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.560
 Yeah, just sort of like, why are you called the...

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.600
 Okay, the third.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.080
 I get it.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.160
 You've got weird-ass grandparents and parents.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.560
 Eurythroscoggins, Philae leg and posthumous mints.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:14.880
 Just three others.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.000
 Philae leg?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.200
 Philae, P-H-E-L-I-A, leg.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.960
 Posthumous mints.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.240
 Posthumous mints.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.920
 I want all my mints to be posthumous.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:28.720
 Well, I've got some lasagna in my freezer, Anna.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.400
 I think you've been very welcome to.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:37.520
 Do you know when Baby sort of naming books took off?

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.240
 1997.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.520
 No one had books before then.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.680
 Well, there were...

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:49.120
 I mean, they sort of really did take off in the 80s.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.600
 But actually, they do date back way before that,

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.200
 sort of names of interesting babies.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.360
 But they used to be in the back of cookbooks,

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.840
 because cookbooks used to have all kinds of extra gubbins

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:01.200
 in the later pages just to kind of pad out the recipes, I guess.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.600
 So Mrs. Clark's cookery book in 1883 was subtitled,

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.520
 including what to name the baby.

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.760
 It was kind of general all-purpose household guide.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.560
 So you've got that kind of thing in the 19th century.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.360
 It's weird, because you don't want to confuse a recipe

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.120
 with a baby name.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:17.600
 I don't know what.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.080
 No, that's how actually preserved fish got his name.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.360
 Posthumous mints, yeah.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:27.760
 Couple of people who do have Hawaiian names that we all know.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.280
 So Keanu Reeves.

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.040
 Keanu is a Hawaiian name.

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:35.520
 And yeah, and it's a lovely unique name in Hollywood,

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.040
 and it means cool mountain breeze.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.600
 But when he first started in Hollywood,

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.600
 his agent said, this name's not going to work.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.600
 You need to go away and come back with another name,

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.880
 because no one's going to hire you.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:45.840
 It's too weird.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.320
 So he agreed, and he went away, and he came back,

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.400
 and he said, I've got my new name to his agents.

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.360
 And they said, OK, what is it?

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.720
 And he said, I want to now be known as Chuck Spadina.

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.240
 Chuck Spadina.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.760
 So yeah, his agent said, I'm not sure that Chuck Spadina's

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.480
 going to work.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.840
 Go away, come back with another one.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.640
 So then Keanu Reeves went away, brainstormed, came back,

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.920
 and said, OK, I've got my new one.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.240
 I'll now be known as Templeton Page Taylor.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.920
 And they said, what?

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.760
 Mate, you're not getting this.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.360
 And so they said, just keep Keanu.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.640
 And that's the only reason he kept it.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.360
 He was so ready to change it to either of those names.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.920
 So do you think that he came up with these stupid names

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.400
 to stop the idea of him having to change it?

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.280
 It was like a clever thing.

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.000
 God, do you think he just is an idiot who doesn't know?

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.120
 One all name at a time.

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.400
 I think, yeah, I hadn't actually thought that.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.920
 So maybe that's exactly what he was doing.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:36.640
 Yeah, not sure.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.840
 It's sort of, that story reads like you're reading

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.000
 Rumpelstiltskin backwards, doesn't it?

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.280
 When you go and try and guess at the name every day.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:45.600
 Yeah.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:50.880
 In 1900, 91% of all children were given a name

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.680
 from the top 1,000 most popular names.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.560
 This is in America.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:59.440
 But by 2000, only 75% of girls were given a name

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.960
 from the top 1,000.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.640
 And for boys, it was 86%.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:06.400
 So a lot more children have been given unique names

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.760
 or very unusual names.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.480
 And they've looked into this.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.600
 So it was a 1995 study and they find it's very common

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.120
 in African American families.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:18.320
 And they looked at the whole country

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.600
 over the whole of that century.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.960
 And they found that in Illinois in 1920,

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:27.040
 31% of African American girls and 25% of African American boys

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.520
 had unique names in the whole country.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.880
 And the reason they think this,

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.360
 there's someone called Sandra L. West,

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:36.400
 who is a co-author of the Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.200
 And a couple of scholars called Ayanna F. Brown

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.800
 and Janice Tuck Lively.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.360
 And what they think is basically the surnames

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:47.040
 that African American families have are often things

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.200
 that were given during slavery times.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.160
 And they were forced upon them by white people.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.320
 Whereas the first name is something that's given to you

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.320
 by a loved one, by a family member.

00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.400
 And so people will give names that kind of show

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.920
 that they're loved by their family.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:06.480
 They can show that by giving them unique sort of special first names

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.760
 because they're stuck with these old fashioned surnames.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.560
 That's interesting.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:14.640
 That we are definitely getting more into our unusual names.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.400
 There have been various studies about why we have,

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.240
 but I mean, it's largely obviously

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.640
 because we're a bunch of individualistic millennials,

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.960
 I suppose, and everyone wants a special name for their kid.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.480
 But there's also a really interesting study

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.080
 which I thought sounded like rubbish.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.000
 And then I saw it being written up in a serious and reliable way

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.120
 about how there's an exact correlation between how recently

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.120
 a U.S. state joined the union

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.960
 and how many newborn babies get unusual names.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:42.640
 And so there's the idea that if you're a frontier settler,

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.280
 so you're going and you're settling a new land,

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.200
 you are more sort of bold.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.320
 It's more bold society.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.440
 It's more individualistic.

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:53.200
 It's more gung-ho, get out and make your own way.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.920
 And it's much more likely that you'll be willing to break the mold

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.760
 and give your kid a weird name.

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.080
 So there's literally an exact inverse correlation

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.280
 between common names and how recently a state was settled.

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.320
 Same with Canada.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.960
 On the east of Canada, which was settled first,

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.880
 kids have much more common names.

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.440
 But the west of Canada, which was settled more recently,

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.280
 still has that hangover of,

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.160
 "Yeah, when you hear, we'll do what the fuck we want."

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.080
 And that correlates.

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.920
 Wow, that's a very interesting idea.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.840
 Not many Ivankas, it turns out,

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.920
 that people thought that perhaps there might be more Ivankas

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.320
 because she was a prominent political figure.

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.720
 Do you know why that might be?

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.000
 Not many Ivankas.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.200
 Because it sounds Russian-y,

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.400
 which might be a bit off-putting to all Americans.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.760
 There's something about that.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:42.720
 Basically, there is not much fashion at the moment

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.920
 for any name which contains the letters N and K

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:46.720
 next to each other.

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.760
 This is according to Laura Wattenberg,

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.760
 who wrote the baby name wizard book

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.880
 and runs babynamewizard.com.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:59.520
 She said that basically NK is very much out of fashion.

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.920
 So Frank, for instance, very much out of fashion.

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.640
 Frank Ivank, anything like that.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:08.480
 Yet my son, Wanker, is fucking the trend.

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:12.480
 You can get consultants, can't you?

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.560
 You can get professional advice on this, if you like.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.400
 There are various services which do it.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.560
 There's one which I found in America, which is called,

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.360
 I love this, it's called Appalachian Mountain.

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:24.240
 So it's Appalachian as in naming,

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.480
 but obviously there are the Appalachian Mountain.

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.320
 Thank you, Andy.

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.720
 Just in case not everyone knows the Appalachian Mountains,

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.120
 they're not in the top three mountain ranges, I would say.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.880
 I reckon I'm more familiar with the mountain range

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:40.240
 than the word to mean to give someone a name, actually.

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.080
 Great point, really good point.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.000
 Well, anyway, I've covered the ground,

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.280
 I think pretty exhaustively now.

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:51.760
 You can pay for the very basics is a 45-minute call

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.360
 as a kind of urgent assistance thing.

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.360
 If you're, I don't know, maybe if you're hanging around

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.200
 outside the baptism office, whatever.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.560
 Or you can pay a lot more and get an eight-page report.

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.400
 You know, if you need a baby name to work

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.680
 in three different languages, let's say,

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.520
 because the parents are from different places,

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.680
 then you can get that and it'll really drill down

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.320
 into the detail.

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.760
 You want to avoid particular syllables,

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.480
 that's what you go for.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.040
 Interesting, so they basically kind of go through,

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:16.240
 you know, like in The Simpsons, when they name Bart,

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.840
 they try and work out if there's anything

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.640
 that rhymes with it and they go, "Cart, dart, eart."

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:21.760
 No, we're fine.

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.400
 Does this, for these people, basically do eight pages

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.960
 of possible ways that your child could be bullied

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.000
 in every different country?

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.760
 Bullying nicknames, basically, yeah.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.880
 I think it's if you want to avoid

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:33.360
 particular abbreviations of the name,

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.480
 they can do that too.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:34.960
 Interesting.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.960
 I think if you need professional consultation

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.640
 over what to name your child,

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.640
 you've got to take a really long and hard look

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.600
 at your capacity to make an independent decision.

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.760
 Okay, well, my parents wanted to call me anal you,

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.480
 so I'm glad for one that they took that advice.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.640
 Okay, that's it.

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.680
 That is all of our facts.

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.120
