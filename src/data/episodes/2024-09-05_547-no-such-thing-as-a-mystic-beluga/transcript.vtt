00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.020
 [MUSIC]

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.020
 >> Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.700
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Edinburgh Fringe.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.260
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.160
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.080
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshyski, Andrew Honesomuri, and James Harkin.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.760
 facts from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.720
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.000
 My fact is, earlier this year, the town of Midgeham was invaded by midges.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.400
 >> [LAUGH]

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.500
 >> Super.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.440
 >> Yeah, so Midgeham is a- >> Midgeham, maybe.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.960
 >> Midgeham.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.960
 >> Maybe, absolutely maybe.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.640
 So yeah, Midgeham is located in West Berkshire.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.460
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.720
 >> This is a tiny town, it's got 350 people who live there.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.480
 And very recently, they were invaded by huge swarms of midges.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.440
 Obviously hilarious, but I should point out, as the article accentuates,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.380
 the population are not laughing because- >> [LAUGH]

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.140
 >> Because the midges will fly into their mouths.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.620
 >> It's annoying, they can't walk out.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.820
 If they open their mouth, they're swallowing big mouthloads of midges.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.740
 That's what they're saying in the news report.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.940
 >> It's not biblical, it is- >> That's what they said.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.300
 >> It's as many midges as pretty much every single Scottish person

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.780
 has dealt with in any place.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.820
 >> No, the people of Berkshire are not used to midges.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.540
 >> Exactly. >> They're not hardy like you.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.500
 They're sensitive souls.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.420
 >> They said you can't even walk without swallowing, okay, a few.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.720
 >> Okay, yeah, you- >> [LAUGH]

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.160
 >> Also, I've just realized, it's the Edinburgh fridge.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.800
 So there'll be more people from Berkshire here than there are from Edinburgh.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.800
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.040
 >> It does sound bad.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.720
 It also did really affect the nearby village of Woolhampton,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.840
 but that doesn't have a funny name.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.520
 So it's got no airtime.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.600
 >> The invasion of sheep there two years ago was hysterical.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.920
 >> Mitchum, I think, having Googled it, is not interesting in any other way.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.360
 >> Wow. >> I'll go on trial, James.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.120
 >> My God.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.080
 >> Here we go.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.980
 >> Strap in.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.060
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.940
 >> Mitchum is Berkshire's least used railway station.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.020
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.060
 >> Interesting.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.100
 >> Yeah, and that's from 2020 to one, although, so

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.940
 you might think it was due to lockdowns and stuff.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.140
 Actually, it was also Berkshire's least popular station in 2019 to 20.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.660
 >> Right.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.820
 >> And also, it's not in Mitchum, Mitchum station, it's just outside Mitchum.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.180
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.460
 >> Woolhampton?

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.100
 >> It used to be called Woolhampton, but then people kept sending it stuff for

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.140
 Woolhampton, which is much bigger and a long way away.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.960
 >> All right.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.320
 >> So they changed it.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.960
 >> Okay.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.800
 >> And okay, so that, yeah, I've got one more thing that has happened in Mitchum ever.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.520
 >> Yeah. >> Please.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.840
 >> Peter Gray, a 72-year-old farmer, saw a giant ice block of frozen human

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.480
 urine smash into his lawn.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.200
 >> Oh, from an airplane?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.040
 >> Yes, from a plane.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.520
 >> [LAUGH]

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.120
 >> No, from the mole people.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.040
 What do you think?

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.280
 >> Pissing aliens.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.500
 >> [LAUGH]

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.060
 >> So Mitchum, I did have a look at if it's been invaded by Mitchum before,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.100
 because I thought, this is the kind of thing that tabloid journalists just

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.980
 desperately hope happens and make happen.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.940
 And there were two other incidents in the last 12 years where it is reported as

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.500
 being invaded by Mitchum.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.580
 And I have to say, we haven't seen any invasion plans or got these stats.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.940
 So maybe that the people of Mitchum are just very wingy.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.820
 >> Out of curiosity, the first time it happened, did they find it funny?

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.580
 >> [LAUGH]

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.360
 >> Is that just jaded Mitchum now?

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.880
 Going, yeah, yeah, yeah, first two times.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.800
 >> I think it is, yeah, it's hysterical, yeah.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.400
 And it was reported on both times as ironic, which is very upsetting.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.880
 >> You've got a big thing about this.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.820
 >> That's true, everyone has a big thing about this ever since.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.920
 Ever since the Larnis Morrissette invented having a big thing about it, then.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.560
 >> Because it's not ironic.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.200
 >> Well, indeed.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.720
 >> Right, has anyone, so who here has experienced Mitchus?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.280
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.360
 >> Who here has been to Mitchum?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.360
 >> Get out.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.680
 >> What is their train station like?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.260
 >> Were you there when Berkshire Life sent a reporter to see just how quiet it really is?

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.680
 >> [LAUGH]

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.500
 >> I arrived before 8 AM on Wednesday and

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.320
 what you presume would be the height of rush hour.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.060
 However, there was no one at the station at all.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.940
 There you go, you weren't there.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.220
 >> [LAUGH]

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.500
 >> Does anyone here use the Mitch forecast?

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.300
 >> So this is the thing, there's a Mitch forecast which some of the people here use.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.760
 >> Is it in Scotland, or UK?

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.620
 >> It is in Scotland, yeah, yeah.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.260
 And the serious level is one to five.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.180
 One is the least serious, which is called no flies on me.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.220
 And number four is great, that's no mist, that's midges, it was really good.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.500
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.620
 >> I think it's entirely sponsored by Smidge,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.020
 which is the UK's number one of, as far as I could tell, two, mid-repellents.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.420
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.220
 >> Yeah, and they, it's a great-

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.300
 >> That's cool, did you check out today's Mitch forecast?

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.100
 >> No, I didn't.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.740
 >> Oh.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.540
 >> Did you? >> The cocky.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.740
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.180
 >> I didn't know it existed until 20 seconds ago.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.220
 >> I actually checked it out, and it's looking pretty good.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.260
 >> Yeah. >> For all this talk of how midges are so

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.420
 bad throughout the summer, and sometimes they have two phases, I think.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.260
 But this year, they reckon they have a third.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.780
 And September, there might be a third hatching.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.700
 It's fine, it's mostly at twos.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.460
 And then I think one spot was at four.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.700
 So stay away from, I think it might have been sterling.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.460
 No, it's Glencoe, Glencoe, there you go.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.260
 >> Right, I'm not sure if I've ever encountered a midge.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.300
 >> No, you weren't.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.980
 >> Yeah, right.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.500
 >> It's pretty bad.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.020
 >> Okay, right, because supposedly, according to Scottish

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:01.020
 midge studies, 40,000 of them can land on a single unprotected arm in one hour.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.700
 There are 37 different species in Scotland.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.700
 It has caused major problems here.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.620
 So there's an estimated 20% of working forestry days in Scotland are lost

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.740
 because of the clouds of biting midges, you have to stop.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.900
 And it can cost up to 268 million pounds a year in lost tourism visits.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.620
 As a result of the reports of them being here.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.260
 >> Really?

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.260
 >> However, what's very exciting is you do make up that money a bit

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.380
 by the 41 million pounds that is brought in annually by visits to the Loch Ness Monster.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.140
 So.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.060
 >> What?

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.540
 >> That's what Nessies bring into the table.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.500
 >> Yeah, but that's nothing to do with what we're talking about.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.940
 >> Completely non-relevant.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.100
 >> The Edinburgh Festival brings in lots of money.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.180
 That would be a more apt thing to say, ironically.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.260
 >> Yeah, but we're talking about animals.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.820
 >> Yeah, some which exist.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.100
 >> And some which are yet to.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.660
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.460
 >> They're symbiotic, Nessie and midges.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.620
 I think that's what you're saying, isn't it?

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.580
 They have a symbiotic relationship, so one can't exist without the other?

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.460
 I'm pretty sure that must be down to the point.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.420
 Otherwise it would be completely.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.660
 >> You've been an insane thing to bring up.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.820
 >> You did say there's lots of species of midge.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.380
 >> Yeah.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.060
 >> They are often named after their penises.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.660
 Because they all have very distinct penises.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.100
 Well, they got all have distinct penises, but many of them do.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.740
 Other people that are named after their penises are Vikings.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.540
 So they're quite a lot.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.100
 We've done a fact in here before where there was a Viking called Small Penis.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.460
 And I just wondered if you guys wanted to have a game of midge or Viking.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.180
 >> [LAUGH]

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.780
 >> Yeah, okay.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.740
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.740
 >> Sure.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.580
 >> Lovely. >> Yes, please.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.300
 >> That's what we're all here for.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.500
 So I'm going to give you the name of a name.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.180
 And it's either the scientific name of a midge, or it's the name of a Viking, okay?

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.140
 >> Okay, okay.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.140
 >> Spiny penis.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.340
 >> A lot of the audience is saying Viking.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.420
 >> I'm going to go midge.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.780
 >> Yeah, I think midge, because they do have spiky penises, don't they?

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.780
 >> I'm going to say Viking.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.540
 I'm going to say Viking.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.820
 >> Some of them do have spiny penises, and indeed this one does, because it's a midge.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.620
 >> Yes.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.420
 >> Nice.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.660
 >> But a penis.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.780
 >> [LAUGH]

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.580
 >> Please, Viking, please.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.100
 >> Always dropping things with this penis.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:02.620
 >> Yeah.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.060
 >> [LAUGH]

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.780
 >> Just use your hands, mate.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.700
 >> Or is it just but a penis?

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.260
 Like, is it used in that?

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.500
 >> Lovely.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.620
 >> We need the spelling.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.780
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.980
 >> The answer is it was a Viking but a penis.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.540
 >> Butter penises.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.620
 What do we know Butter Penises story?

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.620
 >> No, we don't know it.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.260
 It was just in a list of Viking names.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.140
 >> He was friends with Butter Balls, the Viking.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:26.900
 >> Right.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.660
 >> Yeah.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.900
 >> What about curvo penis?

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.740
 >> Curvo?

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.180
 >> Yeah.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.020
 >> Curvo.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:32.740
 >> Curvo.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.620
 Is that just a name, or does it describe the curveness, perhaps?

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.380
 >> I'll say midge.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:38.940
 >> Viking.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:39.740
 >> I'm going Viking.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.460
 This side of the table is going Viking.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.540
 >> No, it was a midge.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.540
 It was discovered in 2011 by a guy called Wang.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.020
 >> Brilliant.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.140
 >> Super.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:50.700
 >> Nice.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.780
 >> And you could have had Barry Penis,

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.020
 Dentopenis, Oxypenis, Convexipenis, and Dibilipenis.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.380
 They're all midges.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.460
 >> Oh, Barry Penis.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.180
 >> [LAUGH]

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.060
 >> Well, here he comes, Barry Penis.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.100
 It's just a good, that's a good nickname.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.740
 >> It's really good.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.700
 You were saying James earlier, because we've got another James H on the tour,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.140
 and you're like, I need a nickname for this tour.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.940
 >> We're not making Barry Penis.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.940
 >> [LAUGH]

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.700
 >> Brilliant.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.220
 >> Hey, here's the thing that the people at Midgham are missing, right?

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.060
 >> Yes.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.460
 >> Because they've got food flying into their mouth.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.420
 >> Free.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.620
 >> You can eat midge.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.300
 >> Midgham.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.780
 >> Exactly.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:38.220
 >> So there's a thing which is, have you guys all heard of cunga cake?

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.860
 >> Yes, African cake.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.940
 >> Yeah, exactly.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.100
 >> Fly cake.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.860
 >> Fly cake, and midges are used in that.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:49.580
 And so what you need to do is you need to turn your issue into a tissue.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.300
 What's the phrase?

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.340
 >> That's good.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.780
 Turn your issue into a tissue.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.780
 >> Turn your issue into a tissue by you go out, and this is what they do when

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.020
 they're making cunga cake.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.580
 You just bring a frying pan outside, and you coated it in the oil or in butter.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.380
 And you just wave it through the swarm, and they stick into it.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.700
 And then you just go home and cook it, and make that into a cake.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.420
 >> I think they squash it, they get loads and squash them down, right?

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:11.780
 >> Yeah.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:16.100
 >> But I think the ones that happen in Africa, I know they have problems in

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.420
 Midgham, but I think the ones in Africa are absolutely insane.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.340
 Like, as in you can hardly walk through them, there's just so many midges.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:22.820
 >> Right.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.460
 >> I think so.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.900
 >> Yeah, I think you're right, because it's sort of, they get more hatchings, and

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.940
 you get like in places like Cameroon, you get a hatching every three weeks.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.460
 >> Yeah.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.140
 >> It's bad if you get what, three in a year.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.020
 >> Yeah, it's actually the warmer the places, the more hatchings they get.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.860
 >> Okay.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.060
 >> The baby midges are these tiny little lavas.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.980
 They look like little caterpillars.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.820
 And in the Goldenrod Goalmage, they have this amazing way of jumping,

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:53.300
 where they get all their internal fluids, push them down to their tail,

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:58.260
 turn themselves into a little sort of circle, and then hold on, hold on,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.300
 release, and then they jump into the air.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.580
 >> Okay, it's an absolutely amazing way to get about.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:10.860
 They can move 28 times more efficiently than a caterpillar can crawl.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.580
 >> Than one of the trams.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.580
 Are they still a joke?

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.260
 No, okay, good.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.580
 >> If a sausage could jump that quickly.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.100
 >> Yes.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.820
 >> Then it could get to the top of the Great Pyramid at Giza in three seconds.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.140
 >> Oh my God.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:24.780
 >> Wow.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.980
 >> That is context.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.620
 >> That's incredible.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.980
 >> Imagine that sausage.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.780
 >> Their eggs are actually sausage shaped.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.420
 Well, their eggs biting midge eggs are either cigar, banana, or sausage shaped.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.140
 Which is a cool range of shapes for an egg.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.700
 >> They're all quite similar shapes.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.380
 >> Cigars and sausages.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.100
 >> Yes, cigar and sausage is a-

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:40.980
 >> I was wondering about the difference.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.500
 I think it must be the ends, right?

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.380
 >> It's the tapering, yeah, yeah.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.020
 >> The tapering.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.700
 >> Very few sausages, which sort of tail off at the end, yeah.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.500
 >> Yes. >> But cigars, loads.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.900
 >> Hey, we're gonna have to move on a sec, by the way.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.140
 >> Can I tell you an audience fact?

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.340
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.380
 >> This is from a Scottish listener.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.540
 So it's Bev Clark, I don't suppose you're in.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.580
 Anyway, she sent in a fantastic fact, right?

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.300
 This is actually about bats, but she submitted it as,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:09.180
 a pipistrel bat has to eat about one-sixth of its own body weight in midges every night to survive.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.020
 That is the equivalent to an average Scottish nine-year-old child having

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:18.940
 to eat 23 tins of baked beans, one bean at a time, whilst flying every night.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.300
 >> [LAUGH]

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.940
 >> Just get back.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:23.700
 >> Yeah, that's brilliant.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:29.980
 [MUSIC]

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.660
 >> We do need to move on to our next fact.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.900
 So it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.220
 >> My fact this week is that there are radar detectors, and

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:44.980
 there are radar detector detectors, and there are radar detector detector detectors.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.380
 >> [LAUGH]

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.500
 >> But as far as we know,

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.980
 there are not yet any radar detectors, detectors, detectors, detectors.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.780
 >> But that's only because we don't have a radar to find it.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.620
 >> How would we know?

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.020
 There's always going to be one more detectors than we know about.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.940
 >> I don't think so, right, because your radar is used by the cops.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.580
 >> So the police one with a traffic gun, that's a radar.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.860
 >> So then the police need to know if you're breaking the law by getting a detector.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.980
 So they have a detector detector detector, but if you get the next level up,

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.660
 you're already breaking the law with your other detector, so they don't need the second one.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.100
 >> They don't need to know, that's a good point, and that is basically what it is.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.140
 So this is from radar that's sent out by speed cameras,

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.700
 bounces off your car a couple of times, and then it sees how fast you're

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.020
 traveling by working out what distance you've traveled in that time.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.980
 >> That's a radar detector.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.820
 >> No, that is just a speed camera.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.940
 >> [LAUGH]

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.060
 >> And then you in your car, because you're a criminal in lots of places,

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.620
 where these things are banned, you might have a device that's a radar detector.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.220
 >> And have you done your driving theory test yet or?

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.260
 >> The theory test?

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.300
 >> Yeah. >> No, no, no.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.980
 >> Well, I hope you're listening to this, because this all will come up.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.340
 >> Yeah, I did slightly blank out, what are we talking about?

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.380
 >> Sorry. >> So I, if I'm driving and I put

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.340
 a radar detector in my car, that's to tell me when there's a speed.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.580
 >> A speed camera. >> Exactly.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.260
 >> Okay, so then the police officer has a radar detector to see,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.300
 if you have a radar detector to see if he has a speeding camera.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.220
 >> So the police officer, well, not the police officer, the speed camera in it

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:20.020
 has a detector that will detect if the driver has a detector.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.500
 >> So that's a detector detector?

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.380
 >> Exactly, because it sends off little vibrations.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.700
 But the way of detecting in the camera is to vibrate a little bit itself.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:32.580
 So some of the radar detectors also have within them detector, detector, detectors.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.540
 And that's the complicated world of radar detectors, basically.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.700
 >> [LAUGH]

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.460
 >> And the thing is, even in your car,

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.700
 you might have a thing where in your sat nav, it tells you where there are speed

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.620
 cameras. >> Yeah.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.580
 >> And that's perfectly legal in most places,

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.020
 but not in all places.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.420
 So if you're driving in America, for instance, and you go into Virginia,

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:55.220
 Mississippi, or Washington DC, technically you have to turn that off in your car.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.140
 Now, fuck knows how you do that.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.860
 But in theory, you would have to do that in order to.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.840
 >> Or you have to prove that you're ignoring it by speeding through every

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.480
 speed camera. >> That's very cool.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.060
 >> Do you know what the fastest ever speeding ticket was?

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.260
 >> I was in like, you were giving it two seconds after.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.660
 >> Sorry.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.620
 >> My god, you pedant.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.820
 >> I'm used to this stuff from James.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.460
 When it comes to Dan, I've got no defenses.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.420
 >> Is it, are we talking in the UK?

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.660
 >> It is in the USA.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.900
 >> Okay, so the word is, would you want to have a guess?

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.340
 >> Well, no cars would go more than 200 miles an hour.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:39.420
 >> Uh-huh, well, there's lots of stuff online saying the fastest ticket ever was

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.380
 a sports car, it was a special sports car, it was in Texas.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:47.220
 It was in a 75 mile an hour zone and it was going at 242 miles an hour.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.220
 There's a lot of stuff on the internet saying that, I didn't find like,

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.740
 the exact initial story behind it.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.100
 I have a theory that the fastest ever speeding ticket was someone who was

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.740
 caught going at eight miles an hour because the speed limit was two miles

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.940
 an hour at the time.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.500
 >> And that just makes them faster.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:09.340
 >> Well, relative to the limit, it's the fastest, I think, ever.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.020
 >> Four times the speed limit, that's crazy.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.900
 You wouldn't drive 120 in a 30, would you?

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.900
 No.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.900
 >> So technically.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.900
 >> Okay, right.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.900
 >> Technically it is.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.420
 >> But that was the first one ever issued.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.420
 >> That's amazing.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:25.420
 >> It was 1896, whoa, that is the exact same year as the first ever speeding

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.100
 ticket that was given over here in the UK.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.100
 >> This was in the UK.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.100
 >> Yeah.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.100
 >> How ironic.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.100
 >> Wait.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.740
 >> He started out talking about the US, but we did them.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.380
 >> It's in Petswood, very nearly used to.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.780
 >> Oh, yeah, God, I got to start listening, man.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.260
 >> That was, we're talking about the same thing here.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.260
 >> Yeah.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.260
 >> Okay.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.260
 >> It was in 1896.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.260
 >> And it was eight miles an hour.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.260
 >> Eight miles an hour.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.260
 >> Yeah.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.260
 >> Wow.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.260
 >> It was, supposedly he was followed by a police officer on a bike for five

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.260
 miles.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:57.820
 >> There was a guy a couple of years ago called Nigel Mills, who was clock

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.500
 speeding 88 miles an hour in his car, which was a.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.500
 >> A delorean.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.500
 >> Oh, brilliant.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.500
 >> A delorean, as the audience got.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:13.060
 He had to go to court, he paid his fine, but in court, he did deny that he was attempting

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.300
 to break the space time continuum.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:21.460
 >> I learned something that I think probably I should have known, this definitely will be

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.780
 in the theory, in fact, the thing that always accompanies speed cameras, which I didn't

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.980
 know about, or the main speed cameras that you get, which as I'm sure you know are the

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:33.340
 Gatso cameras, which are the big yellow boxes, although I think in Scotland, they're yellow

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.220
 and red, diagonal stripes, is that right?

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.820
 But they always are accompanied by lines on the road, which I just never noticed.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:47.580
 >> It's going so fast, it's just a blur, and also you're pissed out of your brain.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:56.140
 >> Yeah, you can't be expected to concentrate on this sort of thing when you're lying down.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.220
 So one way you could fool them is you could cover up the lines on the road before you

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.220
 got to the speed camera.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:05.500
 >> Wait, do I have to park my car a mile back, walk up to it with a black cloth or something?

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.620
 >> With a sheet or something that can cover the lines up, because basically what the lines

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.220
 are doing, speed cameras do two things to make sure that you're speeding or not.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.620
 They send out some radar, and so it's like two pulses of radar, and they work out how

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.660
 far away you are with each pulse of radar, and then they work out how far you've travelled

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.420
 in the time it's sent out, the two pulses, but also they need a backup way of telling

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:29.040
 how far you've travelled, so they also take two photos as you're travelling, and they

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.620
 need to see where you were in the first photo and where you were in the second photo, and

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.540
 then see how long it took you to get from one to the other.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:39.540
 >> I always wonder when I'm going past one of those, if I swerve into another lane, will

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.300
 they not be able to take the second photo?

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.780
 >> They're on every lane, sadly, so that's the white lines.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:49.380
 >> I don't think it's a different car with the same licence plate.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.380
 They can't put a glove on me legally.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.980
 >> I think you might have to go on the verge, and that's a whole nother contravention, but

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.560
 they can only tell you because the lines are on a ruler, so they can tell how far up the

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.560
 ruler you've gone.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.760
 >> Gatso is named after Maurice Gatsonides, who was a racing driver.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.160
 We very briefly mentioned him about nine and a half years ago.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.560
 His first speed gun that he invented was two rubber tyres on the road, and you still see

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.560
 those.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.640
 When you're driving just around and around, there's just two little rubber lines.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.680
 They tell you how many cars are going along so that people can make rules and stuff like

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.380
 that and check out what the speed limit is, but they also tell you the speed.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.900
 >> What do you mean rubber lines?

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.140
 >> It's like two little rubber wires that go across the road.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.140
 >> Tiny cords.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.540
 I always assumed that they were testing whether they should put a speed camera in there, and

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.980
 I would slow down for them because I don't want people to know how fast I normally drive

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.980
 over that bit.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:46.980
 >> That's sensible.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.940
 They are doing that, but they're also checking how many cars go across there.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.940
 >> I've never noticed that.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.100
 Do I never look at the road?

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.220
 >> Oh, my gosh.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.240
 He was a racing driver, and he invented the speed camera to speed himself up because he

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.200
 wanted to know how fast he was going, and he would keep going around the corner loads

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.720
 and loads of times, and his speed camera would say, "You're going at 60 miles an hour, 70

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.600
 miles an hour, 80 miles an hour," and he would try and get as fast as possible.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:16.280
 He invented a charcoal-burning petrol generator during the German occupation of Holland, which

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.400
 kept the country going.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.240
 He was part of the resistance during World War II.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:26.780
 He took up engineering after he was turned down as a pilot for KLM due to a mangled finger,

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.940
 which he got after a bicycle accident as a child.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:29.940
 >> A mangled finger?

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:30.940
 >> Yes.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.940
 >> I don't think that should discount you.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.460
 >> There were more picky in those days.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.460
 >> Right.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.860
 >> I don't know.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.340
 >> You couldn't even do it if you're ... I think they're very picky.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.340
 You can't even do it if you're short-sighted.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.340
 >> Can't you?

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.340
 >> No.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.340
 He certainly couldn't back then.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.340
 >> But I'm short-sighted.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.300
 >> Well, I'm sorry to reign on your parade, Andy, but you're going to have to stick with

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.300
 the podcast.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:55.880
 >> And he also invented his own car, which had a glass dome over the top of it to make

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.800
 you think you were driving an airplane.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.800
 >> Oh, cool.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.200
 >> You know like that one that Homer Simpson makes?

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.200
 >> Yes.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.200
 >> It's quite like that.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.040
 >> I've got another inventor just to bring up.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.240
 This is taking it to radar very quickly.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.200
 Have you guys heard of Dr. Robert Rhine's incredible radar designer?

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.840
 So he sort of innovated the resolution of what radar and sonar images could achieve.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.340
 And the stuff that he did allowed for the Titanic to be found.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:26.380
 It was using his advanced technology to find the wreck of the Titanic, to find the Bismarck.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.380
 Absolutely incredible.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:32.500
 But what he applied using that sonar to most of all was his big passion, multiple expeditions,

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:37.500
 to find the Loch Ness monster.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.700
 He went on like six, seven expeditions.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:46.200
 He found a perfumer to create a scent that would lure Nessie up from the Loch Ness.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.060
 >> The easiest day's work for that perfumer.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.920
 >> He trained dolphins to carry cameras that they could send through the Loch and try and

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.920
 so forth.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.760
 I don't know if he ever actually did that, but that was the attempt.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.760
 And he was amazing.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:03.980
 Outside of sonar, he invented -- he patented a hinge that you could use for chopsticks.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:08.680
 And he tried to invent something that would stop tornadoes from materializing, but it

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.680
 never happened.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.980
 Yeah, one of the great Nessie hunters, local hero.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.980
 Yeah.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:18.480
 >> I was really about radar, and I came across a really fun kind of paper that was written

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.480
 in 1946.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.400
 This was a really short time after radar was basically invented.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.360
 So we only worked out how to use it usefully in the Second World War, and it was for use

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.120
 in aircraft and aircraft detection.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:35.120
 And on boats and on submarines, they kept picking up ghosts or phantoms or something

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.880
 they called them echoes.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.800
 And there's all these sources of people writing, speculating about what it might be.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.000
 So in Germany, there was speculation that it was probably a matter of sharply bounded

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.560
 areas of discontinuity in the atmosphere.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.120
 Now, it turns out, what that's another word for is birds.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.900
 But they just couldn't put two and two together.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.420
 It's bizarre that in 1946, it's written like, actually, we've worked out that it was birds

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.420
 all along.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.960
 >> Is it not true that radar was invented because they were trying to make a death ray?

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.960
 >> I think that's true.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.960
 >> Interesting.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.960
 >> I think so.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.920
 So there was rumours that Germany had been making a death ray by firing radio waves at

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.960
 people and it would just make them disappear.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.520
 And it was taken seriously by the British.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.800
 And they thought, well, we're going to need one of our own.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.920
 And they found this guy called Robert Watts at Watt.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.440
 And they asked him, can you make us a death ray, please?

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.600
 And they offered him if he could zap a sheep from 100 paces away, they'd give him a thousand

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.760
 pounds.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.360
 >> He did his experiments and realised that it was impossible.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.560
 But then he realised also that he could use this radio waves to bounce off things and

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.400
 work out how far things were away.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.200
 >> Wow, that's incredible.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.760
 >> He must have considered trying to blag it by getting his friends to dig a hole near

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.760
 the sheep.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:24:03.380
 >> Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:08.360
 My fact is that in 16th century Wales, there was a financial crisis which meant that lots

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:13.600
 of families could no longer afford to keep a household bard.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.700
 >> Wow, very, huge wow.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.880
 And they, every, every house would have its own bard.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:22.880
 >> And now?

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.880
 >> Or very few.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.880
 >> Yeah?

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:25.880
 >> Very few.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.680
 You got to be pretty loaded in modern Wales to have your own bard.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.240
 Bards were, bards were big, big noise back in the day.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.700
 Bards were multi, they were multitaskers, weren't they?

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.700
 >> Oh, they did it all.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.060
 I mean, they mostly, mostly read poems and played the harp.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.380
 But they probably helped with the washing up, if required.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.100
 >> Actually there was a medieval document called the Triads of Britain, and they say

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:51.900
 that the three principal tasks of a bard is one, to learn and collect sciences.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:57.460
 The second is to teach, and the third is to make peace and put an end to all injury.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:02.400
 >> It's a big ream it, isn't it, as a jaw-bad, who's CB?

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.400
 >> If there is heavy washing up, you will be, it will be really appreciated into a bit.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.920
 It was just an interesting, and it was also, it was a time where around this period the

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:16.080
 Welsh language was kind of being demoted, and English was being promoted, and you know,

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:21.520
 the aristocracy were anglicising, and there were a lot of popular poets at the time who

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.960
 proper classical barads thought were trash, so they were nicknamed the, like the modern

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.700
 poets, were called poets who sing at fares, gross, and some of them didn't even play

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.700
 the harp.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.940
 >> Hang on, sorry, were these like the English-imported poets, or these are both parts?

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.020
 >> I think that, I think that was like a newer, like, >> I would just associate poets with

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.500
 a loot rather than a harp.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.140
 I associate harps with, like, angels and stuff.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.740
 >> I don't know what a loot is, that's my...

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.740
 >> You see this big screen?

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.740
 >> Yes, I do.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.740
 [laughter]

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:50.740
 >> Yes.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:56.800
 >> That was a huge loot, like, I would say like a harp is more like at a wedding, you

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.440
 see, so we're playing a big harp.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.440
 >> Yeah.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.280
 >> Yeah, it was the thing for bars, it wasn't it's a harp, the triple harp in fact, tended

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.280
 to be what they played.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.200
 >> Little handheld, handheld drobbies, or?

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.240
 >> Well, bigger than what...

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.240
 [laughter]

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.600
 >> Do you know what "jobby" means in Scotland?

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.600
 [laughter]

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.600
 >> Absolutely.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.600
 >> Good boy.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.600
 [laughter]

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.600
 >> Yeah.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.600
 >> Sorry.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.600
 >> No offense.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.600
 Balance.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.600
 >> Yeah.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.600
 >> That's cool.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.300
 >> Yeah, yeah, three layers of twang, what are they called strings, Liz?

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:31.860
 >> Is it like when a guitarist has two, you know, those awesome guitars with two necks

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.860
 on it, or they layered on top of each other?

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.540
 >> They're layered on top of each other, and in fact, I was interested to learn that "Deck

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.420
 the Hall with Bows of Holly" was written by a bard, a Welsh bard.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.420
 >> What was it?

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:45.300
 >> Yes, the most famous Welsh bard, John Parry, who was a blind bard as many works, they were

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.420
 thought to have sort of extra sight, which gave him this wisdom to write.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.100
 But basically, we say that the job of the bard, they were pretending to cure all ills

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.920
 or something, but basically, it was to massively kiss the ass of the posh people, wasn't it?

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.920
 >> Yeah.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.920
 >> It was.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.920
 >> That was quite fascinating.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:05.280
 Particularly in Ireland, in fact, which had a huge barding history, you essentially

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.320
 went around touting your wares to posh nobility, praising them, and writing verse about how

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.080
 amazing they were, and how big their houses were, and how beautiful their wives were,

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:20.980
 and how great their penises looked, and whatever it was, and that's how you got your gigs.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.940
 >> Lovely penis barry, just want to say it.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.660
 >> They could be quite dangerous bards, couldn't they?

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.700
 There was an idea that their songs could bring up insurrection and stuff.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.060
 I think the English thought that a lot of the Welsh bards, they were a bit worried about

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.060
 the Welsh bards.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.260
 >> Same with the Irish, in fact, they inspired the nobles to revolt.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.180
 >> I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same with the Scottish, I would say.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.180
 >> No, in those English.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.680
 >> No, the Scottish ones just loved English, actually, throughout history, yeah.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.680
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.500
 But let's try and get out of here alive.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:57.680
 >> Everyone's from Berkshire, it's fine.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:04.200
 >> In 1282, apparently, King Edward of England decided to get rid of all the bards in Wales

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.920
 because he was worried that they might cause insurrection among the Welsh, and apparently

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.640
 he had a massacre of 500 bards.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.540
 How did he lure them all to the same place?

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.300
 Did he have a big, like, loot sale, and then advertised in loot?

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.860
 >> Advertised in loot, brilliant.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.220
 >> That was a good joke about 30 years ago.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.700
 >> That's such a good joke, you don't remember loot, the magazine?

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:31.540
 Then why didn't the four of you laugh?

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.220
 >> It's so weird, though, this thing, right?

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.820
 So apparently, he supposedly massacred these 500 bards.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:41.020
 No one really knows about it in England, no one really knows about it in Wales, but everyone

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.720
 knows about it in Hungary.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.600
 Because there is a song that Hungarian school children memorize, and it's almost like a

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:55.400
 nursery rhyme kind of thing, which is about the massacre of the 500 Welsh bards.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.440
 And so all Hungarian children know it, yeah.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.440
 >> You know, they're dangerous for other reasons as well, as well as possible insurrections.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:07.480
 They also were able to kill a rat by talking to it.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:12.300
 And this was a thing that has been written in multiple plays, Shakespeare references,

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:17.100
 lots of plays reference it, and it was the idea that there was a very famous bard from

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:21.960
 Ireland who came home one day, and some mice had eaten the meal that his wife had prepared

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:27.500
 for him, and so he sort of went, "You fucking assholes," and they died.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.740
 And that became a thing that you would bring a bard over to your house, because you had

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:31.740
 a mice problem.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.740
 >> No.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.180
 >> Yeah, and they would use their words purely to kill it.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.920
 >> That can't have lasted long, because the proof's really in the pudding when you get

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.400
 the rodent guy around.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.720
 >> I don't believe it.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.720
 I just...

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.720
 [laughter]

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.840
 >> Do you know one of the most famous ever bards?

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.240
 It was called YOLO.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.240
 >> No.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.240
 >> Yeah.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.240
 >> I-O-L-O.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:55.000
 His real name was Edward Williams, but he was...

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.240
 He deeply loved Welsh...

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.480
 He became a Welsh bardic scholar, basically, and a lot of what we know or what people thought

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.900
 before they knew about bards in the 18th and 19th centuries is because of him.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.180
 And he also made up a lot of stuff and pretended it was by a 14th-century bard.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.100
 He did a lot of forging works.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:15.820
 But he held the first ever Welsh gorseth, which is the gathering of the bards in...

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.820
 >> Wales.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:21.460
 >> Primrose Hill in North London.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.740
 He wanted to kind of show England and London that this was Welsh bardic culture and how

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.020
 amazing it was, and he was responsible for a lot of England being kind of druid mad for

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.020
 a long time.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.020
 >> He made a lot...

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.400
 Yeah, as you say, he made a lot of it up, and no one knew that at the time.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.720
 It was sort of like in the 20...

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.720
 Who is what?

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.720
 The 18th century?

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:41.320
 They found it in the 20th century through some academics reading into it and finding

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.320
 out.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.720
 And he had all these details about his life that sounded so badass.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:50.600
 He said that he learned to read by watching his dad carve names into gravestones.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.640
 That was where he learned the alphabets, and that's where he learned to read.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.640
 >> Really?

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.640
 >> Is it Mary Shelley or Mary Wollstonecraft who...

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.640
 It's Mary Wollstonecraft, isn't it?

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.640
 >> Oh, Mary Shelley.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.640
 >> Mary Shelley.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.320
 >> She had to write her name by tracing her mother's name on her gravestone.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.320
 >> Oh, yeah.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.240
 And she also lost her virginity on it as well.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.240
 >> Yes, she did.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.240
 >> Yeah, I touched it the other day.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.240
 It was amazing.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.240
 >> Pervert.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.240
 >> Very creepy.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.880
 >> Yeah, it was actually creepy, wasn't it?

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.920
 >> Well, what did you touch it with?

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.440
 >> Every country has their own bards, don't they?

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.360
 Oh, every country has their own storytellers, and I think the reason they exist everywhere

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.980
 is because they're a repository of knowledge for people who can't write or read, which

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:35.080
 is sort of everyone until here and today.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.160
 And so I didn't realize that hula dancers are bards.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.040
 So a hula is not a dance.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:46.280
 It's a way of acting out a story which is being told at the same time, traditionally.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.280
 >> That's cool.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.860
 >> This is in Hawaii.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:53.000
 In Sicily, you have an ancient storytelling method passed down from one person to the

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.920
 next, which is called kanto.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.920
 >> It's savage, Anna.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:01.760
 >> It's just improvised, sung verse and spoken prose.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.760
 The kanto, and there --

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.760
 >> How's it spelled?

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.760
 >> There's the bottom.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.760
 >> Yeah, I see it.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.760
 That's nailed on.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:17.480
 Andy, weren't you looking for a tourniquet name as well?

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.800
 >> Wow.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.920
 >> I'm so sorry to doubt you, Anna.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:23.920
 Absolutely doesn't say that word.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:32.000
 I highly respected the Contistae, of course, who'd tell the stories of the kanto.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 And there are lots of others as well.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.840
 >> Just put an O on the end to keep saying it, you had to stop doing that.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.040
 >> I've never had the courage to say it before.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.640
 I didn't realize this when we wanted to.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.120
 >> The Six Marks brother, who was not allowed on screen.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:51.520
 >> In 16th century France, they had an anagramata royale, whose job was they were with the royal

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:56.040
 family, and whenever a dignitary would come, they would make an anagram of their names.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.640
 >> That's cool, isn't it?

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.120
 >> Anna Tyshinski, could be Zayny Payne Skank.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:08.320
 >> A million miles off.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.240
 >> She's not Zayny.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:18.000
 >> Andrew Hunter Murray, untrue Rwanda Rhymer.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.760
 >> Untrue Rwanda Rhymer.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.760
 >> That's me.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:27.120
 >> And then Daniel Shriver, incredible ass.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:33.320
 >> Wait, did you say "incredible"?

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:39.280
 >> You do have to put the H at the start, otherwise it doesn't work.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.680
 >> Wow, what's James Harkin?

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.680
 >> There are no anagrams of that.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:51.760
 >> So, overseas storytellers, I was reading about the benshi of Japan, I never heard of

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.760
 the benshi before.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.280
 During the 20th century, theaters, movie theaters in Japan, when all the movies were silent,

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:02.280
 would hire these storytellers to come and talk over the movies and explain what was

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.760
 going on or give their own narratives about what was going on.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.760
 So, yeah.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.520
 >> Don't invite a banshi, just have all the way through your film.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.160
 >> What's a banshi?

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.280
 >> It's like a mythical screamer.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.520
 >> I would assume that you would be all over that.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:21.560
 >> Don't give him away into another fucking Loch Ness Monster fact.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:27.480
 We should talk about Scotland's national bard, Robbie Burns, shouldn't we, I guess.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.560
 And he's in tonight.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:35.880
 Some words from Burns' poems, and see if you can guess what they mean.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.880
 Swankies.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.880
 >> Translers.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.800
 >> Not a million miles away, but no.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.800
 Socks.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:49.040
 >> No, it's swaggering, strapping fellows who are in their prime.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.040
 >> Oh, great.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.040
 >> Okay.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.000
 >> We're looking at four of them tonight on stage.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 >> Bickering brattle.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.120
 >> Oh, yes, that's good.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.400
 No, it's the way that a mouse runs along the floor.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.920
 So like this way, that way, this way, that way kind of thing.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.920
 >> Okay.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.920
 >> Trying to get away from the bard.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.080
 >> He's just tracing it.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.080
 >> Canty.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:14.800
 >> It's an Italian, it's a Sicilian form of traditional storytelling.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:20.080
 It's the excess of good spirit at the point of bursting into song.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.080
 And lunt.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.080
 >> Okay, right.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.080
 >> Lunt.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.080
 >> Lunt.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.080
 >> Lunt.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:32.420
 >> It's when you get lint, but in your crotch area.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:37.420
 >> Very annoying.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:38.420
 >> Oh, my God.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.500
 >> Yeah, that's a thing.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.500
 >> That's a thing.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.500
 >> That's a thing.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.340
 >> Yeah, lint gathers on your clothes, isn't it?

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.420
 >> Can I tell you the answer?

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.420
 >> Yeah.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:50.260
 >> If you've got new pants, you'll experience lunt, yeah, no matter what you've got going

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.260
 on down there.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.260
 >> Yeah.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.260
 >> Yeah.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.180
 >> It's to walk away while smoking.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.180
 >> Oh.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.180
 >> Okay.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.180
 >> That's not nearly as good as Anna's one.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.180
 >> Yeah.

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.180
 >> Much prefer Anna's one.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.180
 >> Right.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.180
 >> We've got to move on in a second.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:08.580
 Before we do, this whole fact was about, basically, families not being able to afford things

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.380
 anymore, people not being able to afford things anymore, and you know, some group of people

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.980
 who've really experienced that hard in recent times, and thank you, James, I almost forgot

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:22.060
 to mention, are Nessie hunters because things have got so expensive now in Scotland that

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:26.820
 any of the local areas that rent out the holiday homes, the Airbnb's, the hotels, you can't

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.620
 afford to go and sit by the lock anymore.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.620
 >> That's terrible.

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.620
 >> And so as a result, yeah.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:39.620
 >> But the good news is you have as good a chance of finding it if you just stay at home.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:47.820
 >> Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:53.860
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that some whales communicate by wobbling their melons.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.700
 >> Oi, oi.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:56.700
 >> That's funny.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:03.700
 >> A skill exclusive to them and definitely does not occur with Loch Ness monsters.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.560
 So these are belugas, and there's a picture on the screen.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.560
 >> Beluga.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.860
 The funnest whale to say, I think.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:09.860
 >> Is it?

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.860
 >> Oh, come on.

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.860
 What's funnest?

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:12.860
 Beluga.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:13.860
 Sperm.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:14.860
 >> Okay.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.860
 >> That is a good one.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:16.860
 >> That's a fun one to say.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:23.460
 >> We shouldn't spend the rest of this listing whale to say.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:30.420
 >> So they're white whales, they get the name from the Russian for white.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:37.660
 They have this kind of muscly bit of fat on the top of their head and they can contract

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:42.180
 it and move it around, and we didn't really know why they were doing this, but a recent

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:46.940
 study from the University of Rhode Island has found that they do it 34 times more often

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:50.740
 during social interactions than they do otherwise.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.780
 So we think that they're communicating with each other.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.780
 >> Right.

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:54.780
 >> I think that makes it.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:59.220
 It's like an interior hat they've got that they can kind of tip to a lady, and they've

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.220
 got all these moves.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.660
 They can squish it up, and they can flatten it down, and they can move it round to the

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.660
 side.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:05.660
 >> It's crazy.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.260
 >> They've got five moves, haven't they?

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.260
 >> Which is good.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:10.180
 >> They can ripple it back and forth.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.180
 >> Really?

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.180
 >> It's insane.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.180
 >> Have you seen a video?

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.180
 >> I've seen a video.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.180
 >> Wow, so literally like a wave pool.

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.180
 >> Yeah.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.180
 >> Wow.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.180
 >> It's brilliant.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.180
 What are they saying?

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.180
 >> I don't know.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.180
 >> Nobody knows.

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.700
 >> When they use them most often, and the shake, as in the wobble I guess, seems to be mostly

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.500
 male towards females during courtship.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:33.940
 And I think then two of them, so there's flat lift, press, push, and shake.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:38.340
 I think a couple of them are more playful, and then push is maybe a bit more aggro.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.140
 So it's like having a language with only five words.

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.140
 >> Okay.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.900
 Why haven't we worked out what those five words are then?

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.240
 >> We only just figured out they do it.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.240
 Give them a chance.

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.240
 >> Okay.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.740
 Apologies to the marine biologists.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.580
 They're the only whales that can nod.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.860
 I really like that.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:54.860
 >> Really?

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:55.860
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.860
 All the other whales have got like fused necks, but they can go, uh-huh, to the hat to the

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.860
 leg area.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:01.860
 Yeah.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.580
 >> I couldn't work out if that fused neck thing meant, because we have unfused necks.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.580
 >> Yes.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.860
 I've vertebrae, and mostly they've got bits in between them, meaning we can wiggle our

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:10.860
 neck around.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.860
 >> Yeah.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.060
 I was trying to work out if that meant a beluga could look to one side while you were swimming

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:16.060
 along next to it.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.300
 And I don't know how far they can move their heads.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.980
 >> It's a great question, but I think not.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:19.980
 >> Okay.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.980
 Okay.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.700
 So they are the most, they're the cats of the ocean, basically.

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.500
 They're the most flexible whales there are.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.500
 >> Yeah.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.300
 >> They're also, they're nicknamed sea canaries, which I love.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.300
 >> Oh, yes.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.620
 Because they can make all sorts of noise.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:33.460
 They can whistle and sing and moo and click and squeal and --

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.460
 >> And speak.

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.460
 >> Speak.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.460
 >> Speak human words.

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.460
 >> What do they know?

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.460
 >> Yeah.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:44.980
 So there was a beluga whale called Nosey, and Nosey had been part of like the army was

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:48.020
 kind of training him and stuff like that, because there is a bit of that that goes on

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.700
 with the U.S. and with Russia or the Soviets.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:55.740
 And one time there was a Navy diver and he was underwater and someone said, "Get out!"

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.340
 And he got out and he said, "Who said that?"

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:02.300
 And it turned out none of the humans had said it, but this beluga whale had said it.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.300
 >> Really?

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.020
 >> What are you talking about?

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.020
 >> It's true, honestly.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.020
 And there was --

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.020
 >> You got down's notes.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.020
 >> No.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:14.860
 In 2012, there was a paper called Spontaneous Human Speech Mimicry in a Citation, which

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.300
 was about this particular beluga whale.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:21.140
 And we have actual evidence of it making sounds that are a bit like human voices.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.140
 >> Yeah, right.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.020
 >> So it's a bit like a parrot might copy you, that kind of thing.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.020
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.420
 Do you know where a lot of this studying is going on of these belugas?

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.700
 >> In the water, isn't it?

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:34.140
 >> Yes, in the water, but obviously you need them contained and you need to be studying

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.140
 them, right?

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.140
 So there is --

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.580
 >> It's so suspicious of what you're going to say, Dan.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.420
 >> It's called the Mystic Aquarium.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.700
 >> And where is it?

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:43.900
 >> In a village called Mystic.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:44.900
 >> Okay.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.180
 >> In Connecticut, yeah.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.180
 >> That's brilliant.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.820
 >> So annoying, because I thought that whole thing, that maybe they were looking into telepathy

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.540
 or something like that, but actually it's just -- it's the town called Mystic.

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.700
 >> Well, who named the town?

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:58.700
 >> Oh, it's Summer.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:40:59.700
 >> The whales.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.700
 >> Oh.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.700
 >> No.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.700
 >> Okay.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.300
 >> Don't encourage it, Andy.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.540
 >> They're amazing.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.540
 They're amazing things.

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.540
 >> Yeah.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:09.540
 >> They're really beautiful.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.820
 So they live in the Arctic and then they come down during the summer months and they feed

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.860
 and breed and then they go back up, I think, during the winter months.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:21.300
 And the whole thing about a beluga is that they don't have a dorsal fin on their back,

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:22.300
 right?

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:26.740
 They don't have a poppy-uppy fin that, say, a killer whale does, and killer whales prey

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:27.740
 on belugas.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:32.700
 They love to eat them, and part of the reason that the beluga is able to avoid the killer

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.780
 whale is that they live under the sea ice in the Arctic.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:41.700
 So the sea ice is a really important environment for them, even if it's 96% sea ice and there

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:46.340
 are these tiny cracks in the ice where there's sort of air above it.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.900
 They can approach that crack and they can stick their back up so their blowhole finds

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:50.900
 that crack perfectly.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:51.900
 >> Ah.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.900
 >> They can breathe.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:53.900
 >> Oh, wow.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:54.900
 >> Because they're mammals and they have to breathe there.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:55.900
 >> Exactly.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:00.660
 And so that's how they avoid orcas, because the orcas can't follow, because the orcas

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:04.580
 can't risk getting their fin stuck in sea ice and they can't be under sea ice that long.

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.460
 >> It's kind of like hiding -- I'm trying to work out -- it's like hiding from a really

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:12.580
 tall person in a short -- in a small -- in a low-roofed room, isn't it?

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.140
 And every time the tall person tries to get in, they hit their head.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.140
 I mean, it is like that.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.460
 >> Yeah, but you need to very occasionally pop out of the room for something.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.460
 >> Yeah.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.460
 >> Yeah.

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.460
 Yeah.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:23.460
 You have a snorkel leading up to the attic.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.940
 >> I don't think it needed a terribly complicated --

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.060
 >> Just for anyone who didn't understand.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:36.020
 >> The lack of docile fin means that it's quite hard for them to steady themselves in the water.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.780
 >> To help that, they have love handles.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.700
 So they have bits of fat on their sides, and, again, they're attached to muscles, and they

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:46.300
 can move them along their sides, and it helps them to be steady in the water.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.300
 >> Yeah, that's pretty amazing.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:52.580
 And their skin, as well, they go slowly off every year.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.880
 They just -- their skin goes a bit off yellow, and they just look a bit manky.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:02.300
 And so they have to swim to a bunch of rocks and sort of like grating cheese just grate

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:03.500
 themselves away.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.380
 >> You mean like getting one of those files for your feet?

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.380
 >> Yeah.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.380
 >> A full-body one.

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.380
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:11.380
 >> Pretty cool idea.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.420
 >> 'Cause they go through seasonal malt, but it doesn't just come off, so they have to

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.940
 go down and literally just rub themselves against rocks until --

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.500
 >> It is quite gross, actually.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.660
 >> It's like you rubbing yourself against a gravestone.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.780
 >> God.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:27.220
 >> How do you know that my thing malts?

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:28.220
 >> Oh, God.

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:31.380
 >> God, that's a fucking odd sentence.

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.900
 >> And you call me Barry Penis.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:39.540
 >> No, you're Kanto.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:43.340
 >> I'm Barry Penis.

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:46.940
 >> No, I'm Barry Penis.

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.300
 Fun fact about the film Spartacus.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:55.460
 >> I think we should say that all toothed whales have a melon.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:44:00.860
 It's not -- so belugas have the big one that sticks out that they're famous for, but all

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:04.540
 toothed whales have one, and I think they must be used in communication, 'cause I think

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:09.540
 it's for -- they obviously echolocate, and it's almost for transmitting their cliques.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:15.140
 But sperm whales have one as well, but theirs often gets called the junk.

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.860
 Actually they have -- it's sort of split into two bits, so they've got their junk, and then

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.460
 underneath they've got their sperm-assetti organ.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:24.260
 And I never knew why they were called sperm whales, and why -- so you know this sperm-assetti

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:28.020
 organ is the organ that's kind of in their head -- oh, well, it's an organ in their head

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:33.820
 filled with white liquid, and it's, we believe, for -- yeah, communicating.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.540
 >> And they keep that next to their junk.

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.020
 >> They keep it next to their junk.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.020
 >> What is it for?

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.020
 >> It is like the melon.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:45.140
 It is the melon, so we think it's for basically transmitting echolocation signals and helping

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.020
 to control them as they leave.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:50.500
 >> And it would come back into, like, a chamber where it echoes around, and they can --

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:51.500
 >> Wow, so cool.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.500
 >> That's so cool.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:56.180
 >> But the reason they're called sperm whales and the reason it's called sperm-assetti is

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.540
 just because when they first found it, everyone thought it was their semen.

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:00.540
 >> Really?

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:05.420
 >> So whalers in the 19th century cracked open sperm whale heads when there's white stuff

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.420
 in here.

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.780
 That must be where they keep their sperm.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:15.340
 >> I was reading a thing, an exciting new idea about belugas, and it's a research paper

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.140
 that's been released recently.

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:24.700
 It is the idea that belugas could very well be the Loch Ness monster.

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:28.740
 And it's called, "Could the Loch Ness monster also be the result of Lake River sightings

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:29.820
 of belugas?"

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:30.820
 And so someone has put forward --

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:33.900
 >> That's a very sharp paper when the answer is just, "No."

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:38.620
 >> Well, they're saying there's a lot of stuff that would be very similar.

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:43.500
 The body length is kind of in a similar length, the two-meter length, the dorsal fin is absent.

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:47.620
 That is a big thing that teeth are present, clearly visible, recognizable.

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.620
 The paper has a bit that says problems.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:53.540
 One, geographical location.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.540
 That's an issue.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:59.820
 >> You do get belugas off the fjords that are out to the right of the Ness.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:00.820
 They do get them.

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:01.820
 >> They go up rivers.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:02.820
 >> Exactly.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:03.820
 >> And they've been found in the Thames and so on.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.140
 >> They're slightly salt/freshwater agnostic.

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.140
 >> Exactly.

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.940
 >> So could the beluga whale actually be the Loch Ness monster?

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:10.940
 >> What do you think?

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:11.940
 >> Do you think?

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:12.940
 >> Yeah, totally possible.

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:16.620
 >> Who peer reviews the papers that you find online?

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:21.740
 >> This was published on mysticacquarium.com.

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.060
 That's such a rare four out of four for you.

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.300
 >> We normally don't get that.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.900
 Yeah, it's very -- guys, that's impressive.

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.740
 I heard the booze and that's -- I appreciate that.

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.940
 We are going to have to wrap up fairly soon, guys.

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:36.940
 Any more beluga?

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:42.580
 >> Well, just what does a beluga have in common with a blonde in a joke that's offensive

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.580
 to blonde people?

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:51.300
 >> Do you remember that joke that's like there's a blonde with headphones on all the time?

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:55.220
 I don't approve of this, by the way, if you're blonde, but headphones on all the time and

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:56.540
 everyone's like why are you wearing headphones?

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:57.540
 Why are you wearing headphones?

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.740
 And eventually someone takes the headphones off and she dies.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:02.820
 What was the -- what were the headphones saying?

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.300
 >> It's saying remember to breathe in and out.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:11.740
 >> Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, but beluga whales need the headphones.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:15.020
 In fact, all whales, they need -- breathing is not an unconscious thing.

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:18.020
 They actually need to remember to breathe, not just to go to the top to breathe, which

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:21.280
 they do need to do, but if they don't actually tell themselves to breathe every time they

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.980
 do it, they just stop breathing and die.

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:24.980
 >> What?

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:25.980
 >> Yeah.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.500
 >> But is it genuinely a problem?

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.900
 >> No, sometimes it happens in aquariums where they think they just decide that they've

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.060
 had it and you can just stop breathing.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.060
 >> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.060
 >> It's so good to end on a fun one, isn't it?

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.060
 It's so good to end on a fun one.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:39.420
 >> I think whale suicide is going to be a good punch now.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:43.940
 >> I think whales, like populations, getting a bit better, right, isn't it?

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.220
 The whaling has gotten less and less as the years have gone on.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.580
 We have more whales now than we've had in recent years.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:55.160
 And the thing is, when they're more sort of spread out, they find each other formating

00:47:55.160 --> 00:48:00.760
 by singing, and now that there's more of them, they actually do less singing and they kind

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.920
 of fight each other a lot more.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:09.000
 So that means that whales are whaling less due to less whaling.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.400
 >> Very nice.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.680
 >> Very nice.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:21.420
 >> Guys, I'm going to have to wrap us up.

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:22.420
 That is it.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:23.420
 That is all of our facts.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:24.420

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.700
 >> No, I've been let back on.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:54.200
