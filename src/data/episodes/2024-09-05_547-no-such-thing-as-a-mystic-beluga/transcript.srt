00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,020
 >> Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,700
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Edinburgh Fringe.

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,260
 >> [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,160
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,080
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshyski, Andrew Honesomuri, and James Harkin.

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,760
 facts from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,720
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:54,000
 My fact is, earlier this year, the town of Midgeham was invaded by midges.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,400
 >> [LAUGH]

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,500
 >> Super.

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,440
 >> Yeah, so Midgeham is a- >> Midgeham, maybe.

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,960
 >> Midgeham.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,960
 >> Maybe, absolutely maybe.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,640
 So yeah, Midgeham is located in West Berkshire.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,460
 >> [LAUGH]

18
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,720
 >> This is a tiny town, it's got 350 people who live there.

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,480
 And very recently, they were invaded by huge swarms of midges.

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,440
 Obviously hilarious, but I should point out, as the article accentuates,

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,380
 the population are not laughing because- >> [LAUGH]

22
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,140
 >> Because the midges will fly into their mouths.

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,620
 >> It's annoying, they can't walk out.

24
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,820
 If they open their mouth, they're swallowing big mouthloads of midges.

25
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,740
 That's what they're saying in the news report.

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,940
 >> It's not biblical, it is- >> That's what they said.

27
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,300
 >> It's as many midges as pretty much every single Scottish person

28
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,780
 has dealt with in any place.

29
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,820
 >> No, the people of Berkshire are not used to midges.

30
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,540
 >> Exactly. >> They're not hardy like you.

31
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,500
 They're sensitive souls.

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,420
 >> They said you can't even walk without swallowing, okay, a few.

33
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,720
 >> Okay, yeah, you- >> [LAUGH]

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,160
 >> Also, I've just realized, it's the Edinburgh fridge.

35
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,800
 So there'll be more people from Berkshire here than there are from Edinburgh.

36
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,800
 >> [LAUGH]

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,040
 >> It does sound bad.

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,720
 It also did really affect the nearby village of Woolhampton,

39
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,840
 but that doesn't have a funny name.

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,520
 So it's got no airtime.

41
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,600
 >> The invasion of sheep there two years ago was hysterical.

42
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,920
 >> Mitchum, I think, having Googled it, is not interesting in any other way.

43
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,360
 >> Wow. >> I'll go on trial, James.

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,120
 >> My God.

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,080
 >> Here we go.

46
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,980
 >> Strap in.

47
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,060
 >> [LAUGH]

48
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,940
 >> Mitchum is Berkshire's least used railway station.

49
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,020
 >> [LAUGH]

50
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,060
 >> Interesting.

51
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,100
 >> Yeah, and that's from 2020 to one, although, so

52
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,940
 you might think it was due to lockdowns and stuff.

53
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,140
 Actually, it was also Berkshire's least popular station in 2019 to 20.

54
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,660
 >> Right.

55
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,820
 >> And also, it's not in Mitchum, Mitchum station, it's just outside Mitchum.

56
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,180
 >> [LAUGH]

57
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,460
 >> Woolhampton?

58
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,100
 >> It used to be called Woolhampton, but then people kept sending it stuff for

59
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,140
 Woolhampton, which is much bigger and a long way away.

60
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,960
 >> All right.

61
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,320
 >> So they changed it.

62
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,960
 >> Okay.

63
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,800
 >> And okay, so that, yeah, I've got one more thing that has happened in Mitchum ever.

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,520
 >> Yeah. >> Please.

65
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,840
 >> Peter Gray, a 72-year-old farmer, saw a giant ice block of frozen human

66
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,480
 urine smash into his lawn.

67
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,200
 >> Oh, from an airplane?

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,040
 >> Yes, from a plane.

69
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,520
 >> [LAUGH]

70
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,120
 >> No, from the mole people.

71
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
 What do you think?

72
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,280
 >> Pissing aliens.

73
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,500
 >> [LAUGH]

74
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,060
 >> So Mitchum, I did have a look at if it's been invaded by Mitchum before,

75
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,100
 because I thought, this is the kind of thing that tabloid journalists just

76
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,980
 desperately hope happens and make happen.

77
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,940
 And there were two other incidents in the last 12 years where it is reported as

78
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,500
 being invaded by Mitchum.

79
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,580
 And I have to say, we haven't seen any invasion plans or got these stats.

80
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,940
 So maybe that the people of Mitchum are just very wingy.

81
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,820
 >> Out of curiosity, the first time it happened, did they find it funny?

82
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,580
 >> [LAUGH]

83
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,360
 >> Is that just jaded Mitchum now?

84
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,880
 Going, yeah, yeah, yeah, first two times.

85
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,800
 >> I think it is, yeah, it's hysterical, yeah.

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,400
 And it was reported on both times as ironic, which is very upsetting.

87
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,880
 >> You've got a big thing about this.

88
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,820
 >> That's true, everyone has a big thing about this ever since.

89
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,920
 Ever since the Larnis Morrissette invented having a big thing about it, then.

90
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,560
 >> Because it's not ironic.

91
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,200
 >> Well, indeed.

92
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,720
 >> Right, has anyone, so who here has experienced Mitchus?

93
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,280
 >> [APPLAUSE]

94
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,360
 >> Who here has been to Mitchum?

95
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
 >> Get out.

96
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,680
 >> What is their train station like?

97
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,260
 >> Were you there when Berkshire Life sent a reporter to see just how quiet it really is?

98
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,680
 >> [LAUGH]

99
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,500
 >> I arrived before 8 AM on Wednesday and

100
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,320
 what you presume would be the height of rush hour.

101
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,060
 However, there was no one at the station at all.

102
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,940
 There you go, you weren't there.

103
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,220
 >> [LAUGH]

104
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,500
 >> Does anyone here use the Mitch forecast?

105
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,300
 >> So this is the thing, there's a Mitch forecast which some of the people here use.

106
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,760
 >> Is it in Scotland, or UK?

107
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,620
 >> It is in Scotland, yeah, yeah.

108
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,260
 And the serious level is one to five.

109
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,180
 One is the least serious, which is called no flies on me.

110
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,220
 And number four is great, that's no mist, that's midges, it was really good.

111
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,500
 >> [LAUGH]

112
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,620
 >> I think it's entirely sponsored by Smidge,

113
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,020
 which is the UK's number one of, as far as I could tell, two, mid-repellents.

114
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,420
 >> [LAUGH]

115
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,220
 >> Yeah, and they, it's a great-

116
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,300
 >> That's cool, did you check out today's Mitch forecast?

117
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,100
 >> No, I didn't.

118
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,740
 >> Oh.

119
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,540
 >> Did you? >> The cocky.

120
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,740
 >> [LAUGH]

121
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,180
 >> I didn't know it existed until 20 seconds ago.

122
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,220
 >> I actually checked it out, and it's looking pretty good.

123
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,260
 >> Yeah. >> For all this talk of how midges are so

124
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,420
 bad throughout the summer, and sometimes they have two phases, I think.

125
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,260
 But this year, they reckon they have a third.

126
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,780
 And September, there might be a third hatching.

127
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,700
 It's fine, it's mostly at twos.

128
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,460
 And then I think one spot was at four.

129
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,700
 So stay away from, I think it might have been sterling.

130
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,460
 No, it's Glencoe, Glencoe, there you go.

131
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,260
 >> Right, I'm not sure if I've ever encountered a midge.

132
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,300
 >> No, you weren't.

133
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:49,980
 >> Yeah, right.

134
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,500
 >> It's pretty bad.

135
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,020
 >> Okay, right, because supposedly, according to Scottish

136
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:01,020
 midge studies, 40,000 of them can land on a single unprotected arm in one hour.

137
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,700
 There are 37 different species in Scotland.

138
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,700
 It has caused major problems here.

139
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,620
 So there's an estimated 20% of working forestry days in Scotland are lost

140
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,740
 because of the clouds of biting midges, you have to stop.

141
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,900
 And it can cost up to 268 million pounds a year in lost tourism visits.

142
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,620
 As a result of the reports of them being here.

143
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,260
 >> Really?

144
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,260
 >> However, what's very exciting is you do make up that money a bit

145
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,380
 by the 41 million pounds that is brought in annually by visits to the Loch Ness Monster.

146
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,140
 So.

147
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,060
 >> What?

148
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,540
 >> That's what Nessies bring into the table.

149
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,500
 >> Yeah, but that's nothing to do with what we're talking about.

150
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,940
 >> Completely non-relevant.

151
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,100
 >> The Edinburgh Festival brings in lots of money.

152
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,180
 That would be a more apt thing to say, ironically.

153
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,260
 >> Yeah, but we're talking about animals.

154
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,820
 >> Yeah, some which exist.

155
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,100
 >> And some which are yet to.

156
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,660
 >> Yeah, yeah.

157
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,460
 >> They're symbiotic, Nessie and midges.

158
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,620
 I think that's what you're saying, isn't it?

159
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,580
 They have a symbiotic relationship, so one can't exist without the other?

160
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,460
 I'm pretty sure that must be down to the point.

161
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,420
 Otherwise it would be completely.

162
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,660
 >> You've been an insane thing to bring up.

163
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,820
 >> You did say there's lots of species of midge.

164
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,380
 >> Yeah.

165
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,060
 >> They are often named after their penises.

166
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,660
 Because they all have very distinct penises.

167
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,100
 Well, they got all have distinct penises, but many of them do.

168
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,740
 Other people that are named after their penises are Vikings.

169
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,540
 So they're quite a lot.

170
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,100
 We've done a fact in here before where there was a Viking called Small Penis.

171
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,460
 And I just wondered if you guys wanted to have a game of midge or Viking.

172
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,180
 >> [LAUGH]

173
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,780
 >> Yeah, okay.

174
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,740
 >> [APPLAUSE]

175
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,740
 >> Sure.

176
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,580
 >> Lovely. >> Yes, please.

177
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,300
 >> That's what we're all here for.

178
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,500
 So I'm going to give you the name of a name.

179
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,180
 And it's either the scientific name of a midge, or it's the name of a Viking, okay?

180
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,140
 >> Okay, okay.

181
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,140
 >> Spiny penis.

182
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,340
 >> A lot of the audience is saying Viking.

183
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,420
 >> I'm going to go midge.

184
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,780
 >> Yeah, I think midge, because they do have spiky penises, don't they?

185
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
 >> I'm going to say Viking.

186
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,540
 I'm going to say Viking.

187
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,820
 >> Some of them do have spiny penises, and indeed this one does, because it's a midge.

188
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,620
 >> Yes.

189
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,420
 >> Nice.

190
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,660
 >> But a penis.

191
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,780
 >> [LAUGH]

192
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,580
 >> Please, Viking, please.

193
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,100
 >> Always dropping things with this penis.

194
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,620
 >> Yeah.

195
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,060
 >> [LAUGH]

196
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,780
 >> Just use your hands, mate.

197
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,700
 >> Or is it just but a penis?

198
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,260
 Like, is it used in that?

199
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,500
 >> Lovely.

200
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,620
 >> We need the spelling.

201
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,780
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

202
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,980
 >> The answer is it was a Viking but a penis.

203
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,540
 >> Butter penises.

204
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,620
 What do we know Butter Penises story?

205
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,620
 >> No, we don't know it.

206
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,260
 It was just in a list of Viking names.

207
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,140
 >> He was friends with Butter Balls, the Viking.

208
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,900
 >> Right.

209
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,660
 >> Yeah.

210
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,900
 >> What about curvo penis?

211
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,740
 >> Curvo?

212
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,180
 >> Yeah.

213
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,020
 >> Curvo.

214
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,740
 >> Curvo.

215
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,620
 Is that just a name, or does it describe the curveness, perhaps?

216
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,380
 >> I'll say midge.

217
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:38,940
 >> Viking.

218
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,740
 >> I'm going Viking.

219
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,460
 This side of the table is going Viking.

220
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,540
 >> No, it was a midge.

221
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,540
 It was discovered in 2011 by a guy called Wang.

222
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,020
 >> Brilliant.

223
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,140
 >> Super.

224
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,700
 >> Nice.

225
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,780
 >> And you could have had Barry Penis,

226
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,020
 Dentopenis, Oxypenis, Convexipenis, and Dibilipenis.

227
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,380
 They're all midges.

228
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,460
 >> Oh, Barry Penis.

229
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,180
 >> [LAUGH]

230
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,060
 >> Well, here he comes, Barry Penis.

231
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,100
 It's just a good, that's a good nickname.

232
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,740
 >> It's really good.

233
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,700
 You were saying James earlier, because we've got another James H on the tour,

234
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,140
 and you're like, I need a nickname for this tour.

235
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,940
 >> We're not making Barry Penis.

236
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,940
 >> [LAUGH]

237
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,700
 >> Brilliant.

238
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,220
 >> Hey, here's the thing that the people at Midgham are missing, right?

239
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,060
 >> Yes.

240
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,460
 >> Because they've got food flying into their mouth.

241
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,420
 >> Free.

242
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,620
 >> You can eat midge.

243
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,300
 >> Midgham.

244
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,780
 >> Exactly.

245
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:38,220
 >> So there's a thing which is, have you guys all heard of cunga cake?

246
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,860
 >> Yes, African cake.

247
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,940
 >> Yeah, exactly.

248
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,100
 >> Fly cake.

249
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,860
 >> Fly cake, and midges are used in that.

250
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,580
 And so what you need to do is you need to turn your issue into a tissue.

251
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,300
 What's the phrase?

252
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,340
 >> That's good.

253
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,780
 Turn your issue into a tissue.

254
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,780
 >> Turn your issue into a tissue by you go out, and this is what they do when

255
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,020
 they're making cunga cake.

256
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,580
 You just bring a frying pan outside, and you coated it in the oil or in butter.

257
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,380
 And you just wave it through the swarm, and they stick into it.

258
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,700
 And then you just go home and cook it, and make that into a cake.

259
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,420
 >> I think they squash it, they get loads and squash them down, right?

260
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:11,780
 >> Yeah.

261
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,100
 >> But I think the ones that happen in Africa, I know they have problems in

262
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,420
 Midgham, but I think the ones in Africa are absolutely insane.

263
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,340
 Like, as in you can hardly walk through them, there's just so many midges.

264
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,820
 >> Right.

265
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,460
 >> I think so.

266
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,900
 >> Yeah, I think you're right, because it's sort of, they get more hatchings, and

267
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,940
 you get like in places like Cameroon, you get a hatching every three weeks.

268
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,460
 >> Yeah.

269
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,140
 >> It's bad if you get what, three in a year.

270
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,020
 >> Yeah, it's actually the warmer the places, the more hatchings they get.

271
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,860
 >> Okay.

272
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,060
 >> The baby midges are these tiny little lavas.

273
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,980
 They look like little caterpillars.

274
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,820
 And in the Goldenrod Goalmage, they have this amazing way of jumping,

275
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,300
 where they get all their internal fluids, push them down to their tail,

276
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,260
 turn themselves into a little sort of circle, and then hold on, hold on,

277
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,300
 release, and then they jump into the air.

278
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,580
 >> Okay, it's an absolutely amazing way to get about.

279
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:10,860
 They can move 28 times more efficiently than a caterpillar can crawl.

280
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,580
 >> Than one of the trams.

281
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,580
 Are they still a joke?

282
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,260
 No, okay, good.

283
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,580
 >> If a sausage could jump that quickly.

284
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,100
 >> Yes.

285
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,820
 >> Then it could get to the top of the Great Pyramid at Giza in three seconds.

286
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,140
 >> Oh my God.

287
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,780
 >> Wow.

288
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,980
 >> That is context.

289
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,620
 >> That's incredible.

290
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,980
 >> Imagine that sausage.

291
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,780
 >> Their eggs are actually sausage shaped.

292
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,420
 Well, their eggs biting midge eggs are either cigar, banana, or sausage shaped.

293
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,140
 Which is a cool range of shapes for an egg.

294
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,700
 >> They're all quite similar shapes.

295
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,380
 >> Cigars and sausages.

296
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,100
 >> Yes, cigar and sausage is a-

297
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,980
 >> I was wondering about the difference.

298
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,500
 I think it must be the ends, right?

299
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,380
 >> It's the tapering, yeah, yeah.

300
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,020
 >> The tapering.

301
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,700
 >> Very few sausages, which sort of tail off at the end, yeah.

302
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,500
 >> Yes. >> But cigars, loads.

303
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,900
 >> Hey, we're gonna have to move on a sec, by the way.

304
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,140
 >> Can I tell you an audience fact?

305
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,340
 >> Yeah, yeah.

306
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,380
 >> This is from a Scottish listener.

307
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,540
 So it's Bev Clark, I don't suppose you're in.

308
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,580
 Anyway, she sent in a fantastic fact, right?

309
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,300
 This is actually about bats, but she submitted it as,

310
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:09,180
 a pipistrel bat has to eat about one-sixth of its own body weight in midges every night to survive.

311
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,020
 That is the equivalent to an average Scottish nine-year-old child having

312
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:18,940
 to eat 23 tins of baked beans, one bean at a time, whilst flying every night.

313
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,300
 >> [LAUGH]

314
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,940
 >> Just get back.

315
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,700
 >> Yeah, that's brilliant.

316
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,980
 [MUSIC]

317
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,660
 >> We do need to move on to our next fact.

318
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,900
 So it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

319
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,220
 >> My fact this week is that there are radar detectors, and

320
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:44,980
 there are radar detector detectors, and there are radar detector detector detectors.

321
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,380
 >> [LAUGH]

322
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,500
 >> But as far as we know,

323
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,980
 there are not yet any radar detectors, detectors, detectors, detectors.

324
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,780
 >> But that's only because we don't have a radar to find it.

325
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,620
 >> How would we know?

326
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,020
 There's always going to be one more detectors than we know about.

327
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,940
 >> I don't think so, right, because your radar is used by the cops.

328
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,580
 >> So the police one with a traffic gun, that's a radar.

329
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,860
 >> So then the police need to know if you're breaking the law by getting a detector.

330
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,980
 So they have a detector detector detector, but if you get the next level up,

331
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,660
 you're already breaking the law with your other detector, so they don't need the second one.

332
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,100
 >> They don't need to know, that's a good point, and that is basically what it is.

333
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,140
 So this is from radar that's sent out by speed cameras,

334
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,700
 bounces off your car a couple of times, and then it sees how fast you're

335
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,020
 traveling by working out what distance you've traveled in that time.

336
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,980
 >> That's a radar detector.

337
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,820
 >> No, that is just a speed camera.

338
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,940
 >> [LAUGH]

339
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,060
 >> And then you in your car, because you're a criminal in lots of places,

340
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,620
 where these things are banned, you might have a device that's a radar detector.

341
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,220
 >> And have you done your driving theory test yet or?

342
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,260
 >> The theory test?

343
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,300
 >> Yeah. >> No, no, no.

344
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,980
 >> Well, I hope you're listening to this, because this all will come up.

345
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,340
 >> Yeah, I did slightly blank out, what are we talking about?

346
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,380
 >> Sorry. >> So I, if I'm driving and I put

347
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,340
 a radar detector in my car, that's to tell me when there's a speed.

348
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,580
 >> A speed camera. >> Exactly.

349
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,260
 >> Okay, so then the police officer has a radar detector to see,

350
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,300
 if you have a radar detector to see if he has a speeding camera.

351
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,220
 >> So the police officer, well, not the police officer, the speed camera in it

352
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:20,020
 has a detector that will detect if the driver has a detector.

353
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,500
 >> So that's a detector detector?

354
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,380
 >> Exactly, because it sends off little vibrations.

355
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,700
 But the way of detecting in the camera is to vibrate a little bit itself.

356
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,580
 So some of the radar detectors also have within them detector, detector, detectors.

357
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,540
 And that's the complicated world of radar detectors, basically.

358
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,700
 >> [LAUGH]

359
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,460
 >> And the thing is, even in your car,

360
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,700
 you might have a thing where in your sat nav, it tells you where there are speed

361
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,620
 cameras. >> Yeah.

362
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,580
 >> And that's perfectly legal in most places,

363
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,020
 but not in all places.

364
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,420
 So if you're driving in America, for instance, and you go into Virginia,

365
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,220
 Mississippi, or Washington DC, technically you have to turn that off in your car.

366
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,140
 Now, fuck knows how you do that.

367
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,860
 But in theory, you would have to do that in order to.

368
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,840
 >> Or you have to prove that you're ignoring it by speeding through every

369
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,480
 speed camera. >> That's very cool.

370
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,060
 >> Do you know what the fastest ever speeding ticket was?

371
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,260
 >> I was in like, you were giving it two seconds after.

372
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,660
 >> Sorry.

373
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,620
 >> My god, you pedant.

374
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,820
 >> I'm used to this stuff from James.

375
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,460
 When it comes to Dan, I've got no defenses.

376
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,420
 >> Is it, are we talking in the UK?

377
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,660
 >> It is in the USA.

378
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,900
 >> Okay, so the word is, would you want to have a guess?

379
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,340
 >> Well, no cars would go more than 200 miles an hour.

380
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,420
 >> Uh-huh, well, there's lots of stuff online saying the fastest ticket ever was

381
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,380
 a sports car, it was a special sports car, it was in Texas.

382
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,220
 It was in a 75 mile an hour zone and it was going at 242 miles an hour.

383
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,220
 There's a lot of stuff on the internet saying that, I didn't find like,

384
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,740
 the exact initial story behind it.

385
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,100
 I have a theory that the fastest ever speeding ticket was someone who was

386
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,740
 caught going at eight miles an hour because the speed limit was two miles

387
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,940
 an hour at the time.

388
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,500
 >> And that just makes them faster.

389
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,340
 >> Well, relative to the limit, it's the fastest, I think, ever.

390
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,020
 >> Four times the speed limit, that's crazy.

391
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,900
 You wouldn't drive 120 in a 30, would you?

392
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,900
 No.

393
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,900
 >> So technically.

394
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,900
 >> Okay, right.

395
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
 >> Technically it is.

396
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,420
 >> But that was the first one ever issued.

397
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,420
 >> That's amazing.

398
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:25,420
 >> It was 1896, whoa, that is the exact same year as the first ever speeding

399
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,100
 ticket that was given over here in the UK.

400
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,100
 >> This was in the UK.

401
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
 >> Yeah.

402
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,100
 >> How ironic.

403
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,100
 >> Wait.

404
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,740
 >> He started out talking about the US, but we did them.

405
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,380
 >> It's in Petswood, very nearly used to.

406
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,780
 >> Oh, yeah, God, I got to start listening, man.

407
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,260
 >> That was, we're talking about the same thing here.

408
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,260
 >> Yeah.

409
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,260
 >> Okay.

410
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,260
 >> It was in 1896.

411
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,260
 >> And it was eight miles an hour.

412
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,260
 >> Eight miles an hour.

413
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,260
 >> Yeah.

414
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,260
 >> Wow.

415
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,260
 >> It was, supposedly he was followed by a police officer on a bike for five

416
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,260
 miles.

417
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,820
 >> There was a guy a couple of years ago called Nigel Mills, who was clock

418
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,500
 speeding 88 miles an hour in his car, which was a.

419
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
 >> A delorean.

420
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
 >> Oh, brilliant.

421
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,500
 >> A delorean, as the audience got.

422
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,060
 He had to go to court, he paid his fine, but in court, he did deny that he was attempting

423
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,300
 to break the space time continuum.

424
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:21,460
 >> I learned something that I think probably I should have known, this definitely will be

425
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,780
 in the theory, in fact, the thing that always accompanies speed cameras, which I didn't

426
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,980
 know about, or the main speed cameras that you get, which as I'm sure you know are the

427
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,340
 Gatso cameras, which are the big yellow boxes, although I think in Scotland, they're yellow

428
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,220
 and red, diagonal stripes, is that right?

429
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,820
 But they always are accompanied by lines on the road, which I just never noticed.

430
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:47,580
 >> It's going so fast, it's just a blur, and also you're pissed out of your brain.

431
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:56,140
 >> Yeah, you can't be expected to concentrate on this sort of thing when you're lying down.

432
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,220
 So one way you could fool them is you could cover up the lines on the road before you

433
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,220
 got to the speed camera.

434
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:05,500
 >> Wait, do I have to park my car a mile back, walk up to it with a black cloth or something?

435
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,620
 >> With a sheet or something that can cover the lines up, because basically what the lines

436
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,220
 are doing, speed cameras do two things to make sure that you're speeding or not.

437
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,620
 They send out some radar, and so it's like two pulses of radar, and they work out how

438
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,660
 far away you are with each pulse of radar, and then they work out how far you've travelled

439
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,420
 in the time it's sent out, the two pulses, but also they need a backup way of telling

440
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,040
 how far you've travelled, so they also take two photos as you're travelling, and they

441
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,620
 need to see where you were in the first photo and where you were in the second photo, and

442
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,540
 then see how long it took you to get from one to the other.

443
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,540
 >> I always wonder when I'm going past one of those, if I swerve into another lane, will

444
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,300
 they not be able to take the second photo?

445
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,780
 >> They're on every lane, sadly, so that's the white lines.

446
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,380
 >> I don't think it's a different car with the same licence plate.

447
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,380
 They can't put a glove on me legally.

448
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,980
 >> I think you might have to go on the verge, and that's a whole nother contravention, but

449
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,560
 they can only tell you because the lines are on a ruler, so they can tell how far up the

450
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
 ruler you've gone.

451
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,760
 >> Gatso is named after Maurice Gatsonides, who was a racing driver.

452
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,160
 We very briefly mentioned him about nine and a half years ago.

453
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,560
 His first speed gun that he invented was two rubber tyres on the road, and you still see

454
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,560
 those.

455
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,640
 When you're driving just around and around, there's just two little rubber lines.

456
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,680
 They tell you how many cars are going along so that people can make rules and stuff like

457
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,380
 that and check out what the speed limit is, but they also tell you the speed.

458
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,900
 >> What do you mean rubber lines?

459
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,140
 >> It's like two little rubber wires that go across the road.

460
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,140
 >> Tiny cords.

461
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,540
 I always assumed that they were testing whether they should put a speed camera in there, and

462
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,980
 I would slow down for them because I don't want people to know how fast I normally drive

463
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,980
 over that bit.

464
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,980
 >> That's sensible.

465
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,940
 They are doing that, but they're also checking how many cars go across there.

466
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,940
 >> I've never noticed that.

467
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,100
 Do I never look at the road?

468
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,220
 >> Oh, my gosh.

469
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,240
 He was a racing driver, and he invented the speed camera to speed himself up because he

470
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,200
 wanted to know how fast he was going, and he would keep going around the corner loads

471
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,720
 and loads of times, and his speed camera would say, "You're going at 60 miles an hour, 70

472
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,600
 miles an hour, 80 miles an hour," and he would try and get as fast as possible.

473
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,280
 He invented a charcoal-burning petrol generator during the German occupation of Holland, which

474
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,400
 kept the country going.

475
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,240
 He was part of the resistance during World War II.

476
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,780
 He took up engineering after he was turned down as a pilot for KLM due to a mangled finger,

477
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,940
 which he got after a bicycle accident as a child.

478
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
 >> A mangled finger?

479
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,940
 >> Yes.

480
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,940
 >> I don't think that should discount you.

481
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,460
 >> There were more picky in those days.

482
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,460
 >> Right.

483
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,860
 >> I don't know.

484
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,340
 >> You couldn't even do it if you're ... I think they're very picky.

485
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,340
 You can't even do it if you're short-sighted.

486
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,340
 >> Can't you?

487
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,340
 >> No.

488
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,340
 He certainly couldn't back then.

489
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,340
 >> But I'm short-sighted.

490
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,300
 >> Well, I'm sorry to reign on your parade, Andy, but you're going to have to stick with

491
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,300
 the podcast.

492
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:55,880
 >> And he also invented his own car, which had a glass dome over the top of it to make

493
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,800
 you think you were driving an airplane.

494
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
 >> Oh, cool.

495
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,200
 >> You know like that one that Homer Simpson makes?

496
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
 >> Yes.

497
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
 >> It's quite like that.

498
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,040
 >> I've got another inventor just to bring up.

499
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,240
 This is taking it to radar very quickly.

500
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,200
 Have you guys heard of Dr. Robert Rhine's incredible radar designer?

501
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,840
 So he sort of innovated the resolution of what radar and sonar images could achieve.

502
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,340
 And the stuff that he did allowed for the Titanic to be found.

503
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:26,380
 It was using his advanced technology to find the wreck of the Titanic, to find the Bismarck.

504
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,380
 Absolutely incredible.

505
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,500
 But what he applied using that sonar to most of all was his big passion, multiple expeditions,

506
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,500
 to find the Loch Ness monster.

507
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,700
 He went on like six, seven expeditions.

508
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,200
 He found a perfumer to create a scent that would lure Nessie up from the Loch Ness.

509
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,060
 >> The easiest day's work for that perfumer.

510
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,920
 >> He trained dolphins to carry cameras that they could send through the Loch and try and

511
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
 so forth.

512
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,760
 I don't know if he ever actually did that, but that was the attempt.

513
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
 And he was amazing.

514
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,980
 Outside of sonar, he invented -- he patented a hinge that you could use for chopsticks.

515
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,680
 And he tried to invent something that would stop tornadoes from materializing, but it

516
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
 never happened.

517
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,980
 Yeah, one of the great Nessie hunters, local hero.

518
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,980
 Yeah.

519
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:18,480
 >> I was really about radar, and I came across a really fun kind of paper that was written

520
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
 in 1946.

521
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,400
 This was a really short time after radar was basically invented.

522
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,360
 So we only worked out how to use it usefully in the Second World War, and it was for use

523
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,120
 in aircraft and aircraft detection.

524
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,120
 And on boats and on submarines, they kept picking up ghosts or phantoms or something

525
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,880
 they called them echoes.

526
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,800
 And there's all these sources of people writing, speculating about what it might be.

527
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,000
 So in Germany, there was speculation that it was probably a matter of sharply bounded

528
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,560
 areas of discontinuity in the atmosphere.

529
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,120
 Now, it turns out, what that's another word for is birds.

530
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,900
 But they just couldn't put two and two together.

531
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,420
 It's bizarre that in 1946, it's written like, actually, we've worked out that it was birds

532
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
 all along.

533
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,960
 >> Is it not true that radar was invented because they were trying to make a death ray?

534
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
 >> I think that's true.

535
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
 >> Interesting.

536
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
 >> I think so.

537
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,920
 So there was rumours that Germany had been making a death ray by firing radio waves at

538
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,960
 people and it would just make them disappear.

539
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,520
 And it was taken seriously by the British.

540
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,800
 And they thought, well, we're going to need one of our own.

541
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,920
 And they found this guy called Robert Watts at Watt.

542
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,440
 And they asked him, can you make us a death ray, please?

543
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,600
 And they offered him if he could zap a sheep from 100 paces away, they'd give him a thousand

544
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,760
 pounds.

545
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,360
 >> He did his experiments and realised that it was impossible.

546
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,560
 But then he realised also that he could use this radio waves to bounce off things and

547
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,400
 work out how far things were away.

548
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,200
 >> Wow, that's incredible.

549
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,760
 >> He must have considered trying to blag it by getting his friends to dig a hole near

550
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,760
 the sheep.

551
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:03,380
 >> Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

552
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,360
 My fact is that in 16th century Wales, there was a financial crisis which meant that lots

553
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,600
 of families could no longer afford to keep a household bard.

554
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,700
 >> Wow, very, huge wow.

555
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,880
 And they, every, every house would have its own bard.

556
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
 >> And now?

557
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
 >> Or very few.

558
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
 >> Yeah?

559
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
 >> Very few.

560
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,680
 You got to be pretty loaded in modern Wales to have your own bard.

561
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,240
 Bards were, bards were big, big noise back in the day.

562
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,700
 Bards were multi, they were multitaskers, weren't they?

563
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,700
 >> Oh, they did it all.

564
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,060
 I mean, they mostly, mostly read poems and played the harp.

565
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,380
 But they probably helped with the washing up, if required.

566
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,100
 >> Actually there was a medieval document called the Triads of Britain, and they say

567
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,900
 that the three principal tasks of a bard is one, to learn and collect sciences.

568
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,460
 The second is to teach, and the third is to make peace and put an end to all injury.

569
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,400
 >> It's a big ream it, isn't it, as a jaw-bad, who's CB?

570
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,400
 >> If there is heavy washing up, you will be, it will be really appreciated into a bit.

571
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,920
 It was just an interesting, and it was also, it was a time where around this period the

572
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,080
 Welsh language was kind of being demoted, and English was being promoted, and you know,

573
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,520
 the aristocracy were anglicising, and there were a lot of popular poets at the time who

574
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,960
 proper classical barads thought were trash, so they were nicknamed the, like the modern

575
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,700
 poets, were called poets who sing at fares, gross, and some of them didn't even play

576
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,700
 the harp.

577
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,940
 >> Hang on, sorry, were these like the English-imported poets, or these are both parts?

578
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,020
 >> I think that, I think that was like a newer, like, >> I would just associate poets with

579
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,500
 a loot rather than a harp.

580
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,140
 I associate harps with, like, angels and stuff.

581
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,740
 >> I don't know what a loot is, that's my...

582
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,740
 >> You see this big screen?

583
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,740
 >> Yes, I do.

584
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,740
 [laughter]

585
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
 >> Yes.

586
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:56,800
 >> That was a huge loot, like, I would say like a harp is more like at a wedding, you

587
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,440
 see, so we're playing a big harp.

588
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
 >> Yeah.

589
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,280
 >> Yeah, it was the thing for bars, it wasn't it's a harp, the triple harp in fact, tended

590
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
 to be what they played.

591
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,200
 >> Little handheld, handheld drobbies, or?

592
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,240
 >> Well, bigger than what...

593
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
 [laughter]

594
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,600
 >> Do you know what "jobby" means in Scotland?

595
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
 [laughter]

596
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
 >> Absolutely.

597
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
 >> Good boy.

598
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
 [laughter]

599
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
 >> Yeah.

600
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
 >> Sorry.

601
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
 >> No offense.

602
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
 Balance.

603
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
 >> Yeah.

604
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
 >> That's cool.

605
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,300
 >> Yeah, yeah, three layers of twang, what are they called strings, Liz?

606
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,860
 >> Is it like when a guitarist has two, you know, those awesome guitars with two necks

607
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,860
 on it, or they layered on top of each other?

608
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,540
 >> They're layered on top of each other, and in fact, I was interested to learn that "Deck

609
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,420
 the Hall with Bows of Holly" was written by a bard, a Welsh bard.

610
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,420
 >> What was it?

611
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,300
 >> Yes, the most famous Welsh bard, John Parry, who was a blind bard as many works, they were

612
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,420
 thought to have sort of extra sight, which gave him this wisdom to write.

613
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:53,100
 But basically, we say that the job of the bard, they were pretending to cure all ills

614
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,920
 or something, but basically, it was to massively kiss the ass of the posh people, wasn't it?

615
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
 >> Yeah.

616
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
 >> It was.

617
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
 >> That was quite fascinating.

618
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,280
 Particularly in Ireland, in fact, which had a huge barding history, you essentially

619
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,320
 went around touting your wares to posh nobility, praising them, and writing verse about how

620
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,080
 amazing they were, and how big their houses were, and how beautiful their wives were,

621
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,980
 and how great their penises looked, and whatever it was, and that's how you got your gigs.

622
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,940
 >> Lovely penis barry, just want to say it.

623
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,660
 >> They could be quite dangerous bards, couldn't they?

624
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,700
 There was an idea that their songs could bring up insurrection and stuff.

625
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,060
 I think the English thought that a lot of the Welsh bards, they were a bit worried about

626
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,060
 the Welsh bards.

627
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,260
 >> Same with the Irish, in fact, they inspired the nobles to revolt.

628
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,180
 >> I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same with the Scottish, I would say.

629
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,180
 >> No, in those English.

630
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,680
 >> No, the Scottish ones just loved English, actually, throughout history, yeah.

631
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
 >> Yeah, yeah.

632
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,500
 But let's try and get out of here alive.

633
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,680
 >> Everyone's from Berkshire, it's fine.

634
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:04,200
 >> In 1282, apparently, King Edward of England decided to get rid of all the bards in Wales

635
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,920
 because he was worried that they might cause insurrection among the Welsh, and apparently

636
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,640
 he had a massacre of 500 bards.

637
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,540
 How did he lure them all to the same place?

638
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,300
 Did he have a big, like, loot sale, and then advertised in loot?

639
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,860
 >> Advertised in loot, brilliant.

640
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,220
 >> That was a good joke about 30 years ago.

641
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,700
 >> That's such a good joke, you don't remember loot, the magazine?

642
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,540
 Then why didn't the four of you laugh?

643
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,220
 >> It's so weird, though, this thing, right?

644
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,820
 So apparently, he supposedly massacred these 500 bards.

645
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,020
 No one really knows about it in England, no one really knows about it in Wales, but everyone

646
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,720
 knows about it in Hungary.

647
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,600
 Because there is a song that Hungarian school children memorize, and it's almost like a

648
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,400
 nursery rhyme kind of thing, which is about the massacre of the 500 Welsh bards.

649
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,440
 And so all Hungarian children know it, yeah.

650
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,440
 >> You know, they're dangerous for other reasons as well, as well as possible insurrections.

651
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,480
 They also were able to kill a rat by talking to it.

652
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,300
 And this was a thing that has been written in multiple plays, Shakespeare references,

653
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,100
 lots of plays reference it, and it was the idea that there was a very famous bard from

654
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,960
 Ireland who came home one day, and some mice had eaten the meal that his wife had prepared

655
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,500
 for him, and so he sort of went, "You fucking assholes," and they died.

656
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,740
 And that became a thing that you would bring a bard over to your house, because you had

657
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,740
 a mice problem.

658
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
 >> No.

659
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,180
 >> Yeah, and they would use their words purely to kill it.

660
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,920
 >> That can't have lasted long, because the proof's really in the pudding when you get

661
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,400
 the rodent guy around.

662
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,720
 >> I don't believe it.

663
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
 I just...

664
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
 [laughter]

665
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,840
 >> Do you know one of the most famous ever bards?

666
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,240
 It was called YOLO.

667
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
 >> No.

668
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
 >> Yeah.

669
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
 >> I-O-L-O.

670
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,000
 His real name was Edward Williams, but he was...

671
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,240
 He deeply loved Welsh...

672
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,480
 He became a Welsh bardic scholar, basically, and a lot of what we know or what people thought

673
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,900
 before they knew about bards in the 18th and 19th centuries is because of him.

674
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,180
 And he also made up a lot of stuff and pretended it was by a 14th-century bard.

675
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,100
 He did a lot of forging works.

676
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,820
 But he held the first ever Welsh gorseth, which is the gathering of the bards in...

677
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,820
 >> Wales.

678
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,460
 >> Primrose Hill in North London.

679
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,740
 He wanted to kind of show England and London that this was Welsh bardic culture and how

680
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,020
 amazing it was, and he was responsible for a lot of England being kind of druid mad for

681
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,020
 a long time.

682
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,020
 >> He made a lot...

683
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,400
 Yeah, as you say, he made a lot of it up, and no one knew that at the time.

684
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,720
 It was sort of like in the 20...

685
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
 Who is what?

686
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
 The 18th century?

687
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,320
 They found it in the 20th century through some academics reading into it and finding

688
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
 out.

689
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,720
 And he had all these details about his life that sounded so badass.

690
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,600
 He said that he learned to read by watching his dad carve names into gravestones.

691
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,640
 That was where he learned the alphabets, and that's where he learned to read.

692
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
 >> Really?

693
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,640
 Yeah, yeah.

694
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
 >> Is it Mary Shelley or Mary Wollstonecraft who...

695
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
 It's Mary Wollstonecraft, isn't it?

696
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,640
 >> Oh, Mary Shelley.

697
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
 >> Mary Shelley.

698
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,320
 >> She had to write her name by tracing her mother's name on her gravestone.

699
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
 >> Oh, yeah.

700
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,240
 And she also lost her virginity on it as well.

701
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
 >> Yes, she did.

702
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
 >> Yeah, I touched it the other day.

703
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
 It was amazing.

704
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,240
 >> Pervert.

705
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
 >> Very creepy.

706
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,880
 >> Yeah, it was actually creepy, wasn't it?

707
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,920
 >> Well, what did you touch it with?

708
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,440
 >> Every country has their own bards, don't they?

709
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,360
 Oh, every country has their own storytellers, and I think the reason they exist everywhere

710
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,980
 is because they're a repository of knowledge for people who can't write or read, which

711
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,080
 is sort of everyone until here and today.

712
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,160
 And so I didn't realize that hula dancers are bards.

713
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,040
 So a hula is not a dance.

714
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,280
 It's a way of acting out a story which is being told at the same time, traditionally.

715
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
 >> That's cool.

716
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,860
 >> This is in Hawaii.

717
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,000
 In Sicily, you have an ancient storytelling method passed down from one person to the

718
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,920
 next, which is called kanto.

719
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,920
 >> It's savage, Anna.

720
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,760
 >> It's just improvised, sung verse and spoken prose.

721
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
 The kanto, and there --

722
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,760
 >> How's it spelled?

723
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
 >> There's the bottom.

724
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760
 >> Yeah, I see it.

725
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
 That's nailed on.

726
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:17,480
 Andy, weren't you looking for a tourniquet name as well?

727
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,800
 >> Wow.

728
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,920
 >> I'm so sorry to doubt you, Anna.

729
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
 Absolutely doesn't say that word.

730
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:32,000
 I highly respected the Contistae, of course, who'd tell the stories of the kanto.

731
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 And there are lots of others as well.

732
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,840
 >> Just put an O on the end to keep saying it, you had to stop doing that.

733
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,040
 >> I've never had the courage to say it before.

734
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,640
 I didn't realize this when we wanted to.

735
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,120
 >> The Six Marks brother, who was not allowed on screen.

736
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:51,520
 >> In 16th century France, they had an anagramata royale, whose job was they were with the royal

737
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,040
 family, and whenever a dignitary would come, they would make an anagram of their names.

738
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,640
 >> That's cool, isn't it?

739
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,120
 >> Anna Tyshinski, could be Zayny Payne Skank.

740
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,320
 >> A million miles off.

741
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,240
 >> She's not Zayny.

742
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,000
 >> Andrew Hunter Murray, untrue Rwanda Rhymer.

743
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,760
 >> Untrue Rwanda Rhymer.

744
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
 >> That's me.

745
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:27,120
 >> And then Daniel Shriver, incredible ass.

746
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,320
 >> Wait, did you say "incredible"?

747
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:39,280
 >> You do have to put the H at the start, otherwise it doesn't work.

748
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,680
 >> Wow, what's James Harkin?

749
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,680
 >> There are no anagrams of that.

750
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:51,760
 >> So, overseas storytellers, I was reading about the benshi of Japan, I never heard of

751
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
 the benshi before.

752
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,280
 During the 20th century, theaters, movie theaters in Japan, when all the movies were silent,

753
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:02,280
 would hire these storytellers to come and talk over the movies and explain what was

754
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,760
 going on or give their own narratives about what was going on.

755
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
 So, yeah.

756
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,520
 >> Don't invite a banshi, just have all the way through your film.

757
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,160
 >> What's a banshi?

758
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,280
 >> It's like a mythical screamer.

759
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,520
 >> I would assume that you would be all over that.

760
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,560
 >> Don't give him away into another fucking Loch Ness Monster fact.

761
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:27,480
 We should talk about Scotland's national bard, Robbie Burns, shouldn't we, I guess.

762
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,560
 And he's in tonight.

763
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,880
 Some words from Burns' poems, and see if you can guess what they mean.

764
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
 Swankies.

765
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
 >> Translers.

766
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,800
 >> Not a million miles away, but no.

767
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
 Socks.

768
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,040
 >> No, it's swaggering, strapping fellows who are in their prime.

769
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
 >> Oh, great.

770
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
 >> Okay.

771
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,000
 >> We're looking at four of them tonight on stage.

772
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 >> Bickering brattle.

773
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,120
 >> Oh, yes, that's good.

774
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,400
 No, it's the way that a mouse runs along the floor.

775
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,920
 So like this way, that way, this way, that way kind of thing.

776
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
 >> Okay.

777
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
 >> Trying to get away from the bard.

778
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,080
 >> He's just tracing it.

779
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,080
 >> Canty.

780
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,800
 >> It's an Italian, it's a Sicilian form of traditional storytelling.

781
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,080
 It's the excess of good spirit at the point of bursting into song.

782
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,080
 And lunt.

783
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,080
 >> Okay, right.

784
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
 >> Lunt.

785
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,080
 >> Lunt.

786
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
 >> Lunt.

787
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:32,420
 >> It's when you get lint, but in your crotch area.

788
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:37,420
 >> Very annoying.

789
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,420
 >> Oh, my God.

790
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,500
 >> Yeah, that's a thing.

791
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
 >> That's a thing.

792
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
 >> That's a thing.

793
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,340
 >> Yeah, lint gathers on your clothes, isn't it?

794
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,420
 >> Can I tell you the answer?

795
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,420
 >> Yeah.

796
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,260
 >> If you've got new pants, you'll experience lunt, yeah, no matter what you've got going

797
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,260
 on down there.

798
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,260
 >> Yeah.

799
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,260
 >> Yeah.

800
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,180
 >> It's to walk away while smoking.

801
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,180
 >> Oh.

802
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,180
 >> Okay.

803
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,180
 >> That's not nearly as good as Anna's one.

804
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,180
 >> Yeah.

805
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
 >> Much prefer Anna's one.

806
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,180
 >> Right.

807
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,180
 >> We've got to move on in a second.

808
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,580
 Before we do, this whole fact was about, basically, families not being able to afford things

809
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,380
 anymore, people not being able to afford things anymore, and you know, some group of people

810
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,980
 who've really experienced that hard in recent times, and thank you, James, I almost forgot

811
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:22,060
 to mention, are Nessie hunters because things have got so expensive now in Scotland that

812
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,820
 any of the local areas that rent out the holiday homes, the Airbnb's, the hotels, you can't

813
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,620
 afford to go and sit by the lock anymore.

814
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,620
 >> That's terrible.

815
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,620
 >> And so as a result, yeah.

816
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:39,620
 >> But the good news is you have as good a chance of finding it if you just stay at home.

817
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:47,820
 >> Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

818
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:53,860
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that some whales communicate by wobbling their melons.

819
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,700
 >> Oi, oi.

820
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
 >> That's funny.

821
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:03,700
 >> A skill exclusive to them and definitely does not occur with Loch Ness monsters.

822
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,560
 So these are belugas, and there's a picture on the screen.

823
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,560
 >> Beluga.

824
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,860
 The funnest whale to say, I think.

825
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,860
 >> Is it?

826
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,860
 >> Oh, come on.

827
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,860
 What's funnest?

828
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
 Beluga.

829
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,860
 Sperm.

830
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,860
 >> Okay.

831
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,860
 >> That is a good one.

832
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,860
 >> That's a fun one to say.

833
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:23,460
 >> We shouldn't spend the rest of this listing whale to say.

834
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:30,420
 >> So they're white whales, they get the name from the Russian for white.

835
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:37,660
 They have this kind of muscly bit of fat on the top of their head and they can contract

836
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:42,180
 it and move it around, and we didn't really know why they were doing this, but a recent

837
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:46,940
 study from the University of Rhode Island has found that they do it 34 times more often

838
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,740
 during social interactions than they do otherwise.

839
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,780
 So we think that they're communicating with each other.

840
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,780
 >> Right.

841
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,780
 >> I think that makes it.

842
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,220
 It's like an interior hat they've got that they can kind of tip to a lady, and they've

843
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,220
 got all these moves.

844
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,660
 They can squish it up, and they can flatten it down, and they can move it round to the

845
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,660
 side.

846
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,660
 >> It's crazy.

847
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,260
 >> They've got five moves, haven't they?

848
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,260
 >> Which is good.

849
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,180
 >> They can ripple it back and forth.

850
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,180
 >> Really?

851
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,180
 >> It's insane.

852
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,180
 >> Have you seen a video?

853
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,180
 >> I've seen a video.

854
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,180
 >> Wow, so literally like a wave pool.

855
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,180
 >> Yeah.

856
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,180
 >> Wow.

857
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,180
 >> It's brilliant.

858
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,180
 What are they saying?

859
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,180
 >> I don't know.

860
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,180
 >> Nobody knows.

861
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,700
 >> When they use them most often, and the shake, as in the wobble I guess, seems to be mostly

862
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,500
 male towards females during courtship.

863
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,940
 And I think then two of them, so there's flat lift, press, push, and shake.

864
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,340
 I think a couple of them are more playful, and then push is maybe a bit more aggro.

865
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,140
 So it's like having a language with only five words.

866
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,140
 >> Okay.

867
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,900
 Why haven't we worked out what those five words are then?

868
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,240
 >> We only just figured out they do it.

869
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
 Give them a chance.

870
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
 >> Okay.

871
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,740
 Apologies to the marine biologists.

872
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,580
 They're the only whales that can nod.

873
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,860
 I really like that.

874
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,860
 >> Really?

875
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,860
 >> Yeah, yeah.

876
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,860
 All the other whales have got like fused necks, but they can go, uh-huh, to the hat to the

877
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,860
 leg area.

878
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,860
 Yeah.

879
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,580
 >> I couldn't work out if that fused neck thing meant, because we have unfused necks.

880
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,580
 >> Yes.

881
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,860
 I've vertebrae, and mostly they've got bits in between them, meaning we can wiggle our

882
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,860
 neck around.

883
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,860
 >> Yeah.

884
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,060
 I was trying to work out if that meant a beluga could look to one side while you were swimming

885
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,060
 along next to it.

886
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,300
 And I don't know how far they can move their heads.

887
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,980
 >> It's a great question, but I think not.

888
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,980
 >> Okay.

889
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,980
 Okay.

890
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,700
 So they are the most, they're the cats of the ocean, basically.

891
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,500
 They're the most flexible whales there are.

892
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,500
 >> Yeah.

893
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,300
 >> They're also, they're nicknamed sea canaries, which I love.

894
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,300
 >> Oh, yes.

895
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,620
 Because they can make all sorts of noise.

896
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:33,460
 They can whistle and sing and moo and click and squeal and --

897
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,460
 >> And speak.

898
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,460
 >> Speak.

899
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,460
 >> Speak human words.

900
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
 >> What do they know?

901
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,460
 >> Yeah.

902
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:44,980
 So there was a beluga whale called Nosey, and Nosey had been part of like the army was

903
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,020
 kind of training him and stuff like that, because there is a bit of that that goes on

904
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,700
 with the U.S. and with Russia or the Soviets.

905
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,740
 And one time there was a Navy diver and he was underwater and someone said, "Get out!"

906
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,340
 And he got out and he said, "Who said that?"

907
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:02,300
 And it turned out none of the humans had said it, but this beluga whale had said it.

908
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,300
 >> Really?

909
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,020
 >> What are you talking about?

910
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,020
 >> It's true, honestly.

911
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,020
 And there was --

912
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,020
 >> You got down's notes.

913
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,020
 >> No.

914
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,860
 In 2012, there was a paper called Spontaneous Human Speech Mimicry in a Citation, which

915
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,300
 was about this particular beluga whale.

916
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,140
 And we have actual evidence of it making sounds that are a bit like human voices.

917
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,140
 >> Yeah, right.

918
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,020
 >> So it's a bit like a parrot might copy you, that kind of thing.

919
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,020
 >> Yeah, yeah.

920
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,420
 Do you know where a lot of this studying is going on of these belugas?

921
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,700
 >> In the water, isn't it?

922
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,140
 >> Yes, in the water, but obviously you need them contained and you need to be studying

923
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,140
 them, right?

924
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,140
 So there is --

925
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,580
 >> It's so suspicious of what you're going to say, Dan.

926
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,420
 >> It's called the Mystic Aquarium.

927
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,700
 >> And where is it?

928
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,900
 >> In a village called Mystic.

929
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,900
 >> Okay.

930
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,180
 >> In Connecticut, yeah.

931
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,180
 >> That's brilliant.

932
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,820
 >> So annoying, because I thought that whole thing, that maybe they were looking into telepathy

933
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,540
 or something like that, but actually it's just -- it's the town called Mystic.

934
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,700
 >> Well, who named the town?

935
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,700
 >> Oh, it's Summer.

936
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,700
 >> The whales.

937
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,700
 >> Oh.

938
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,700
 >> No.

939
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,700
 >> Okay.

940
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,300
 >> Don't encourage it, Andy.

941
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,540
 >> They're amazing.

942
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,540
 They're amazing things.

943
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,540
 >> Yeah.

944
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,540
 >> They're really beautiful.

945
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,820
 So they live in the Arctic and then they come down during the summer months and they feed

946
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,860
 and breed and then they go back up, I think, during the winter months.

947
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,300
 And the whole thing about a beluga is that they don't have a dorsal fin on their back,

948
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,300
 right?

949
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,740
 They don't have a poppy-uppy fin that, say, a killer whale does, and killer whales prey

950
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,740
 on belugas.

951
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:32,700
 They love to eat them, and part of the reason that the beluga is able to avoid the killer

952
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,780
 whale is that they live under the sea ice in the Arctic.

953
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:41,700
 So the sea ice is a really important environment for them, even if it's 96% sea ice and there

954
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,340
 are these tiny cracks in the ice where there's sort of air above it.

955
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,900
 They can approach that crack and they can stick their back up so their blowhole finds

956
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,900
 that crack perfectly.

957
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,900
 >> Ah.

958
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,900
 >> They can breathe.

959
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,900
 >> Oh, wow.

960
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,900
 >> Because they're mammals and they have to breathe there.

961
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,900
 >> Exactly.

962
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,660
 And so that's how they avoid orcas, because the orcas can't follow, because the orcas

963
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,580
 can't risk getting their fin stuck in sea ice and they can't be under sea ice that long.

964
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,460
 >> It's kind of like hiding -- I'm trying to work out -- it's like hiding from a really

965
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:12,580
 tall person in a short -- in a small -- in a low-roofed room, isn't it?

966
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,140
 And every time the tall person tries to get in, they hit their head.

967
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,140
 I mean, it is like that.

968
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,460
 >> Yeah, but you need to very occasionally pop out of the room for something.

969
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,460
 >> Yeah.

970
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,460
 >> Yeah.

971
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,460
 Yeah.

972
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,460
 You have a snorkel leading up to the attic.

973
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,940
 >> I don't think it needed a terribly complicated --

974
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,060
 >> Just for anyone who didn't understand.

975
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:36,020
 >> The lack of docile fin means that it's quite hard for them to steady themselves in the water.

976
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,780
 >> To help that, they have love handles.

977
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,700
 So they have bits of fat on their sides, and, again, they're attached to muscles, and they

978
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,300
 can move them along their sides, and it helps them to be steady in the water.

979
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,300
 >> Yeah, that's pretty amazing.

980
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:52,580
 And their skin, as well, they go slowly off every year.

981
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,880
 They just -- their skin goes a bit off yellow, and they just look a bit manky.

982
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:02,300
 And so they have to swim to a bunch of rocks and sort of like grating cheese just grate

983
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,500
 themselves away.

984
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,380
 >> You mean like getting one of those files for your feet?

985
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,380
 >> Yeah.

986
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,380
 >> A full-body one.

987
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,380
 >> Yeah, yeah.

988
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,380
 >> Pretty cool idea.

989
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,420
 >> 'Cause they go through seasonal malt, but it doesn't just come off, so they have to

990
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,940
 go down and literally just rub themselves against rocks until --

991
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,500
 >> It is quite gross, actually.

992
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,660
 >> It's like you rubbing yourself against a gravestone.

993
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,780
 >> God.

994
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:27,220
 >> How do you know that my thing malts?

995
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,220
 >> Oh, God.

996
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,380
 >> God, that's a fucking odd sentence.

997
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,900
 >> And you call me Barry Penis.

998
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,540
 >> No, you're Kanto.

999
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,340
 >> I'm Barry Penis.

1000
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,940
 >> No, I'm Barry Penis.

1001
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,300
 Fun fact about the film Spartacus.

1002
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:55,460
 >> I think we should say that all toothed whales have a melon.

1003
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:00,860
 It's not -- so belugas have the big one that sticks out that they're famous for, but all

1004
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:04,540
 toothed whales have one, and I think they must be used in communication, 'cause I think

1005
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:09,540
 it's for -- they obviously echolocate, and it's almost for transmitting their cliques.

1006
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:15,140
 But sperm whales have one as well, but theirs often gets called the junk.

1007
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,860
 Actually they have -- it's sort of split into two bits, so they've got their junk, and then

1008
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,460
 underneath they've got their sperm-assetti organ.

1009
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:24,260
 And I never knew why they were called sperm whales, and why -- so you know this sperm-assetti

1010
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,020
 organ is the organ that's kind of in their head -- oh, well, it's an organ in their head

1011
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:33,820
 filled with white liquid, and it's, we believe, for -- yeah, communicating.

1012
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,540
 >> And they keep that next to their junk.

1013
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,020
 >> They keep it next to their junk.

1014
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,020
 >> What is it for?

1015
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,020
 >> It is like the melon.

1016
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:45,140
 It is the melon, so we think it's for basically transmitting echolocation signals and helping

1017
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,020
 to control them as they leave.

1018
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,500
 >> And it would come back into, like, a chamber where it echoes around, and they can --

1019
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,500
 >> Wow, so cool.

1020
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,500
 >> That's so cool.

1021
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,180
 >> But the reason they're called sperm whales and the reason it's called sperm-assetti is

1022
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,540
 just because when they first found it, everyone thought it was their semen.

1023
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,540
 >> Really?

1024
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:05,420
 >> So whalers in the 19th century cracked open sperm whale heads when there's white stuff

1025
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,420
 in here.

1026
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,780
 That must be where they keep their sperm.

1027
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:15,340
 >> I was reading a thing, an exciting new idea about belugas, and it's a research paper

1028
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,140
 that's been released recently.

1029
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:24,700
 It is the idea that belugas could very well be the Loch Ness monster.

1030
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,740
 And it's called, "Could the Loch Ness monster also be the result of Lake River sightings

1031
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,820
 of belugas?"

1032
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,820
 And so someone has put forward --

1033
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,900
 >> That's a very sharp paper when the answer is just, "No."

1034
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,620
 >> Well, they're saying there's a lot of stuff that would be very similar.

1035
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:43,500
 The body length is kind of in a similar length, the two-meter length, the dorsal fin is absent.

1036
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,620
 That is a big thing that teeth are present, clearly visible, recognizable.

1037
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,620
 The paper has a bit that says problems.

1038
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,540
 One, geographical location.

1039
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,540
 That's an issue.

1040
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:59,820
 >> You do get belugas off the fjords that are out to the right of the Ness.

1041
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:00,820
 They do get them.

1042
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,820
 >> They go up rivers.

1043
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:02,820
 >> Exactly.

1044
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,820
 >> And they've been found in the Thames and so on.

1045
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,140
 >> They're slightly salt/freshwater agnostic.

1046
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,140
 >> Exactly.

1047
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,940
 >> So could the beluga whale actually be the Loch Ness monster?

1048
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,940
 >> What do you think?

1049
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,940
 >> Do you think?

1050
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:12,940
 >> Yeah, totally possible.

1051
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,620
 >> Who peer reviews the papers that you find online?

1052
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:21,740
 >> This was published on mysticacquarium.com.

1053
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,060
 That's such a rare four out of four for you.

1054
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,300
 >> We normally don't get that.

1055
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,900
 Yeah, it's very -- guys, that's impressive.

1056
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,740
 I heard the booze and that's -- I appreciate that.

1057
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,940
 We are going to have to wrap up fairly soon, guys.

1058
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,940
 Any more beluga?

1059
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:42,580
 >> Well, just what does a beluga have in common with a blonde in a joke that's offensive

1060
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,580
 to blonde people?

1061
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:51,300
 >> Do you remember that joke that's like there's a blonde with headphones on all the time?

1062
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,220
 I don't approve of this, by the way, if you're blonde, but headphones on all the time and

1063
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,540
 everyone's like why are you wearing headphones?

1064
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,540
 Why are you wearing headphones?

1065
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,740
 And eventually someone takes the headphones off and she dies.

1066
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,820
 What was the -- what were the headphones saying?

1067
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,300
 >> It's saying remember to breathe in and out.

1068
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:11,740
 >> Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, but beluga whales need the headphones.

1069
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:15,020
 In fact, all whales, they need -- breathing is not an unconscious thing.

1070
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,020
 They actually need to remember to breathe, not just to go to the top to breathe, which

1071
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,280
 they do need to do, but if they don't actually tell themselves to breathe every time they

1072
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,980
 do it, they just stop breathing and die.

1073
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,980
 >> What?

1074
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:25,980
 >> Yeah.

1075
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,500
 >> But is it genuinely a problem?

1076
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,900
 >> No, sometimes it happens in aquariums where they think they just decide that they've

1077
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,060
 had it and you can just stop breathing.

1078
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,060
 >> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1079
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,060
 >> It's so good to end on a fun one, isn't it?

1080
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,060
 It's so good to end on a fun one.

1081
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,420
 >> I think whale suicide is going to be a good punch now.

1082
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,940
 >> I think whales, like populations, getting a bit better, right, isn't it?

1083
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,220
 The whaling has gotten less and less as the years have gone on.

1084
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,580
 We have more whales now than we've had in recent years.

1085
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:55,160
 And the thing is, when they're more sort of spread out, they find each other formating

1086
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:00,760
 by singing, and now that there's more of them, they actually do less singing and they kind

1087
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,920
 of fight each other a lot more.

1088
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,000
 So that means that whales are whaling less due to less whaling.

1089
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,400
 >> Very nice.

1090
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,680
 >> Very nice.

1091
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:21,420
 >> Guys, I'm going to have to wrap us up.

1092
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,420
 That is it.

1093
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,420
 That is all of our facts.

1094
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,420
 Thank you so much for listening.

 >> I'm not saying Mike.

1102
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:45,420
 >> You've actually been banned recently, haven't you?

1103
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,700
 >> No, I've been let back on.

1104
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:54,200
 >> And @Ada, where can they get to us as a group?

1105
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:59,260
 >> You can go to Twitter, no such thing, or no such things as a fish on Instagram, or

1106
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,260
 you can email podcast.qi.com.

1107
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,540
 >> Or you can go to our website, no such thing as a fish.com.

1108

 All of our previous episodes are there.

1109
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,580
 We have a club called Club Fish.
