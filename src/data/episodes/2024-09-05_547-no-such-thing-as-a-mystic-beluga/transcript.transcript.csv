00:00:14,00:00:19,">> Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:19,00:00:23,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Edinburgh Fringe.
00:00:23,00:00:29,>> [APPLAUSE]
00:00:29,00:00:31,>> My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:31,00:00:36,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshyski, Andrew Honesomuri, and James Harkin."
00:00:36,00:00:40,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:40,00:00:44,"facts from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:44,00:00:47,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact."
00:00:47,00:00:54,"My fact is, earlier this year, the town of Midgeham was invaded by midges."
00:00:54,00:00:55,>> [LAUGH]
00:00:55,00:00:56,>> Super.
00:00:56,00:01:00,">> Yeah, so Midgeham is a- >> Midgeham, maybe."
00:01:00,00:01:01,>> Midgeham.
00:01:01,00:01:04,">> Maybe, absolutely maybe."
00:01:04,00:01:09,"So yeah, Midgeham is located in West Berkshire."
00:01:09,00:01:12,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:12,00:01:15,">> This is a tiny town, it's got 350 people who live there."
00:01:15,00:01:20,"And very recently, they were invaded by huge swarms of midges."
00:01:20,00:01:26,"Obviously hilarious, but I should point out, as the article accentuates,"
00:01:26,00:01:29,the population are not laughing because- >> [LAUGH]
00:01:29,00:01:31,>> Because the midges will fly into their mouths.
00:01:31,00:01:32,">> It's annoying, they can't walk out."
00:01:32,00:01:35,"If they open their mouth, they're swallowing big mouthloads of midges."
00:01:35,00:01:37,That's what they're saying in the news report.
00:01:37,00:01:40,">> It's not biblical, it is- >> That's what they said."
00:01:40,00:01:44,>> It's as many midges as pretty much every single Scottish person
00:01:44,00:01:45,has dealt with in any place.
00:01:45,00:01:49,">> No, the people of Berkshire are not used to midges."
00:01:49,00:01:52,>> Exactly. >> They're not hardy like you.
00:01:52,00:01:53,They're sensitive souls.
00:01:53,00:01:56,">> They said you can't even walk without swallowing, okay, a few."
00:01:56,00:01:58,">> Okay, yeah, you- >> [LAUGH]"
00:01:58,00:02:00,">> Also, I've just realized, it's the Edinburgh fridge."
00:02:00,00:02:02,So there'll be more people from Berkshire here than there are from Edinburgh.
00:02:02,00:02:05,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:05,00:02:08,>> It does sound bad.
00:02:08,00:02:10,"It also did really affect the nearby village of Woolhampton,"
00:02:10,00:02:11,but that doesn't have a funny name.
00:02:11,00:02:13,So it's got no airtime.
00:02:13,00:02:16,>> The invasion of sheep there two years ago was hysterical.
00:02:16,00:02:21,">> Mitchum, I think, having Googled it, is not interesting in any other way."
00:02:21,00:02:23,">> Wow. >> I'll go on trial, James."
00:02:23,00:02:24,>> My God.
00:02:24,00:02:25,>> Here we go.
00:02:25,00:02:25,>> Strap in.
00:02:25,00:02:28,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:28,00:02:30,>> Mitchum is Berkshire's least used railway station.
00:02:30,00:02:33,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:33,00:02:34,>> Interesting.
00:02:34,00:02:37,">> Yeah, and that's from 2020 to one, although, so"
00:02:37,00:02:38,you might think it was due to lockdowns and stuff.
00:02:38,00:02:42,"Actually, it was also Berkshire's least popular station in 2019 to 20."
00:02:42,00:02:43,>> Right.
00:02:43,00:02:46,">> And also, it's not in Mitchum, Mitchum station, it's just outside Mitchum."
00:02:46,00:02:48,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:48,00:02:49,>> Woolhampton?
00:02:49,00:02:52,">> It used to be called Woolhampton, but then people kept sending it stuff for"
00:02:52,00:02:54,"Woolhampton, which is much bigger and a long way away."
00:02:54,00:02:54,>> All right.
00:02:54,00:02:56,>> So they changed it.
00:02:56,00:02:56,>> Okay.
00:02:56,00:03:02,">> And okay, so that, yeah, I've got one more thing that has happened in Mitchum ever."
00:03:02,00:03:04,>> Yeah. >> Please.
00:03:04,00:03:08,">> Peter Gray, a 72-year-old farmer, saw a giant ice block of frozen human"
00:03:08,00:03:10,urine smash into his lawn.
00:03:10,00:03:12,">> Oh, from an airplane?"
00:03:12,00:03:13,">> Yes, from a plane."
00:03:13,00:03:16,>> [LAUGH]
00:03:16,00:03:19,">> No, from the mole people."
00:03:19,00:03:21,What do you think?
00:03:21,00:03:22,>> Pissing aliens.
00:03:22,00:03:24,>> [LAUGH]
00:03:24,00:03:28,">> So Mitchum, I did have a look at if it's been invaded by Mitchum before,"
00:03:28,00:03:31,"because I thought, this is the kind of thing that tabloid journalists just"
00:03:31,00:03:32,desperately hope happens and make happen.
00:03:32,00:03:36,And there were two other incidents in the last 12 years where it is reported as
00:03:36,00:03:38,being invaded by Mitchum.
00:03:38,00:03:43,"And I have to say, we haven't seen any invasion plans or got these stats."
00:03:43,00:03:45,So maybe that the people of Mitchum are just very wingy.
00:03:45,00:03:48,">> Out of curiosity, the first time it happened, did they find it funny?"
00:03:48,00:03:51,>> [LAUGH]
00:03:51,00:03:53,>> Is that just jaded Mitchum now?
00:03:53,00:03:54,"Going, yeah, yeah, yeah, first two times."
00:03:54,00:03:56,">> I think it is, yeah, it's hysterical, yeah."
00:03:56,00:04:00,"And it was reported on both times as ironic, which is very upsetting."
00:04:00,00:04:01,>> You've got a big thing about this.
00:04:01,00:04:04,">> That's true, everyone has a big thing about this ever since."
00:04:04,00:04:07,"Ever since the Larnis Morrissette invented having a big thing about it, then."
00:04:07,00:04:09,>> Because it's not ironic.
00:04:09,00:04:10,">> Well, indeed."
00:04:10,00:04:14,">> Right, has anyone, so who here has experienced Mitchus?"
00:04:14,00:04:17,>> [APPLAUSE]
00:04:17,00:04:18,>> Who here has been to Mitchum?
00:04:18,00:04:20,>> Get out.
00:04:20,00:04:23,>> What is their train station like?
00:04:23,00:04:29,>> Were you there when Berkshire Life sent a reporter to see just how quiet it really is?
00:04:29,00:04:32,>> [LAUGH]
00:04:32,00:04:34,>> I arrived before 8 AM on Wednesday and
00:04:34,00:04:36,what you presume would be the height of rush hour.
00:04:36,00:04:38,"However, there was no one at the station at all."
00:04:38,00:04:38,"There you go, you weren't there."
00:04:38,00:04:42,>> [LAUGH]
00:04:42,00:04:44,>> Does anyone here use the Mitch forecast?
00:04:44,00:04:49,">> So this is the thing, there's a Mitch forecast which some of the people here use."
00:04:49,00:04:50,">> Is it in Scotland, or UK?"
00:04:50,00:04:52,">> It is in Scotland, yeah, yeah."
00:04:52,00:04:55,And the serious level is one to five.
00:04:55,00:04:58,"One is the least serious, which is called no flies on me."
00:04:58,00:05:03,"And number four is great, that's no mist, that's midges, it was really good."
00:05:03,00:05:04,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:04,00:05:06,">> I think it's entirely sponsored by Smidge,"
00:05:06,00:05:10,"which is the UK's number one of, as far as I could tell, two, mid-repellents."
00:05:10,00:05:11,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:11,00:05:13,">> Yeah, and they, it's a great-"
00:05:13,00:05:15,">> That's cool, did you check out today's Mitch forecast?"
00:05:15,00:05:16,">> No, I didn't."
00:05:16,00:05:16,>> Oh.
00:05:16,00:05:17,>> Did you? >> The cocky.
00:05:17,00:05:18,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:18,00:05:21,>> I didn't know it existed until 20 seconds ago.
00:05:21,00:05:23,">> I actually checked it out, and it's looking pretty good."
00:05:23,00:05:26,>> Yeah. >> For all this talk of how midges are so
00:05:26,00:05:29,"bad throughout the summer, and sometimes they have two phases, I think."
00:05:29,00:05:31,"But this year, they reckon they have a third."
00:05:31,00:05:33,"And September, there might be a third hatching."
00:05:33,00:05:35,"It's fine, it's mostly at twos."
00:05:35,00:05:39,And then I think one spot was at four.
00:05:39,00:05:42,"So stay away from, I think it might have been sterling."
00:05:42,00:05:45,"No, it's Glencoe, Glencoe, there you go."
00:05:45,00:05:48,">> Right, I'm not sure if I've ever encountered a midge."
00:05:48,00:05:49,">> No, you weren't."
00:05:49,00:05:49,">> Yeah, right."
00:05:49,00:05:50,>> It's pretty bad.
00:05:50,00:05:54,">> Okay, right, because supposedly, according to Scottish"
00:05:54,00:06:01,"midge studies, 40,000 of them can land on a single unprotected arm in one hour."
00:06:01,00:06:03,There are 37 different species in Scotland.
00:06:03,00:06:05,It has caused major problems here.
00:06:05,00:06:09,So there's an estimated 20% of working forestry days in Scotland are lost
00:06:09,00:06:12,"because of the clouds of biting midges, you have to stop."
00:06:12,00:06:17,And it can cost up to 268 million pounds a year in lost tourism visits.
00:06:17,00:06:19,As a result of the reports of them being here.
00:06:19,00:06:20,>> Really?
00:06:20,00:06:24,">> However, what's very exciting is you do make up that money a bit"
00:06:24,00:06:29,by the 41 million pounds that is brought in annually by visits to the Loch Ness Monster.
00:06:29,00:06:30,So.
00:06:30,00:06:31,>> What?
00:06:31,00:06:32,>> That's what Nessies bring into the table.
00:06:32,00:06:34,">> Yeah, but that's nothing to do with what we're talking about."
00:06:34,00:06:35,>> Completely non-relevant.
00:06:35,00:06:38,>> The Edinburgh Festival brings in lots of money.
00:06:38,00:06:40,"That would be a more apt thing to say, ironically."
00:06:40,00:06:45,">> Yeah, but we're talking about animals."
00:06:45,00:06:46,">> Yeah, some which exist."
00:06:46,00:06:48,>> And some which are yet to.
00:06:48,00:06:48,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:06:48,00:06:50,">> They're symbiotic, Nessie and midges."
00:06:50,00:06:51,"I think that's what you're saying, isn't it?"
00:06:51,00:06:54,"They have a symbiotic relationship, so one can't exist without the other?"
00:06:54,00:06:56,I'm pretty sure that must be down to the point.
00:06:56,00:06:57,Otherwise it would be completely.
00:06:57,00:06:58,>> You've been an insane thing to bring up.
00:06:58,00:07:00,>> You did say there's lots of species of midge.
00:07:00,00:07:01,>> Yeah.
00:07:01,00:07:04,>> They are often named after their penises.
00:07:04,00:07:05,Because they all have very distinct penises.
00:07:05,00:07:08,"Well, they got all have distinct penises, but many of them do."
00:07:08,00:07:12,Other people that are named after their penises are Vikings.
00:07:12,00:07:13,So they're quite a lot.
00:07:13,00:07:18,We've done a fact in here before where there was a Viking called Small Penis.
00:07:18,00:07:21,And I just wondered if you guys wanted to have a game of midge or Viking.
00:07:21,00:07:24,>> [LAUGH]
00:07:24,00:07:24,">> Yeah, okay."
00:07:24,00:07:26,>> [APPLAUSE]
00:07:26,00:07:27,>> Sure.
00:07:27,00:07:28,">> Lovely. >> Yes, please."
00:07:28,00:07:30,>> That's what we're all here for.
00:07:30,00:07:33,So I'm going to give you the name of a name.
00:07:33,00:07:38,"And it's either the scientific name of a midge, or it's the name of a Viking, okay?"
00:07:38,00:07:39,">> Okay, okay."
00:07:39,00:07:40,>> Spiny penis.
00:07:40,00:07:43,>> A lot of the audience is saying Viking.
00:07:43,00:07:44,>> I'm going to go midge.
00:07:44,00:07:46,">> Yeah, I think midge, because they do have spiky penises, don't they?"
00:07:46,00:07:47,>> I'm going to say Viking.
00:07:47,00:07:48,I'm going to say Viking.
00:07:48,00:07:52,">> Some of them do have spiny penises, and indeed this one does, because it's a midge."
00:07:52,00:07:53,>> Yes.
00:07:53,00:07:54,>> Nice.
00:07:54,00:07:55,>> But a penis.
00:07:55,00:07:57,>> [LAUGH]
00:07:57,00:08:00,">> Please, Viking, please."
00:08:00,00:08:02,>> Always dropping things with this penis.
00:08:02,00:08:02,>> Yeah.
00:08:02,00:08:05,>> [LAUGH]
00:08:05,00:08:07,">> Just use your hands, mate."
00:08:07,00:08:09,>> Or is it just but a penis?
00:08:09,00:08:11,"Like, is it used in that?"
00:08:11,00:08:13,>> Lovely.
00:08:13,00:08:14,>> We need the spelling.
00:08:14,00:08:15,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:15,00:08:17,>> The answer is it was a Viking but a penis.
00:08:17,00:08:19,>> Butter penises.
00:08:19,00:08:21,What do we know Butter Penises story?
00:08:21,00:08:22,">> No, we don't know it."
00:08:22,00:08:24,It was just in a list of Viking names.
00:08:24,00:08:26,">> He was friends with Butter Balls, the Viking."
00:08:26,00:08:26,>> Right.
00:08:26,00:08:27,>> Yeah.
00:08:27,00:08:29,>> What about curvo penis?
00:08:29,00:08:30,>> Curvo?
00:08:30,00:08:31,>> Yeah.
00:08:31,00:08:32,>> Curvo.
00:08:32,00:08:32,>> Curvo.
00:08:32,00:08:36,"Is that just a name, or does it describe the curveness, perhaps?"
00:08:36,00:08:38,>> I'll say midge.
00:08:38,00:08:38,>> Viking.
00:08:38,00:08:39,>> I'm going Viking.
00:08:39,00:08:41,This side of the table is going Viking.
00:08:41,00:08:42,">> No, it was a midge."
00:08:42,00:08:46,It was discovered in 2011 by a guy called Wang.
00:08:46,00:08:48,>> Brilliant.
00:08:48,00:08:50,>> Super.
00:08:50,00:08:50,>> Nice.
00:08:50,00:08:53,">> And you could have had Barry Penis,"
00:08:53,00:08:58,"Dentopenis, Oxypenis, Convexipenis, and Dibilipenis."
00:08:58,00:08:59,They're all midges.
00:08:59,00:09:01,">> Oh, Barry Penis."
00:09:01,00:09:03,>> [LAUGH]
00:09:03,00:09:05,">> Well, here he comes, Barry Penis."
00:09:05,00:09:07,"It's just a good, that's a good nickname."
00:09:07,00:09:09,>> It's really good.
00:09:09,00:09:12,"You were saying James earlier, because we've got another James H on the tour,"
00:09:12,00:09:15,"and you're like, I need a nickname for this tour."
00:09:15,00:09:16,>> We're not making Barry Penis.
00:09:16,00:09:18,>> [LAUGH]
00:09:18,00:09:19,>> Brilliant.
00:09:19,00:09:23,">> Hey, here's the thing that the people at Midgham are missing, right?"
00:09:23,00:09:24,>> Yes.
00:09:24,00:09:27,>> Because they've got food flying into their mouth.
00:09:27,00:09:28,>> Free.
00:09:28,00:09:30,>> You can eat midge.
00:09:30,00:09:31,>> Midgham.
00:09:31,00:09:32,>> Exactly.
00:09:32,00:09:38,">> So there's a thing which is, have you guys all heard of cunga cake?"
00:09:38,00:09:39,">> Yes, African cake."
00:09:39,00:09:40,">> Yeah, exactly."
00:09:40,00:09:42,>> Fly cake.
00:09:42,00:09:43,">> Fly cake, and midges are used in that."
00:09:43,00:09:49,And so what you need to do is you need to turn your issue into a tissue.
00:09:49,00:09:50,What's the phrase?
00:09:50,00:09:51,>> That's good.
00:09:51,00:09:52,Turn your issue into a tissue.
00:09:52,00:09:56,">> Turn your issue into a tissue by you go out, and this is what they do when"
00:09:56,00:09:58,they're making cunga cake.
00:09:58,00:10:02,"You just bring a frying pan outside, and you coated it in the oil or in butter."
00:10:02,00:10:06,"And you just wave it through the swarm, and they stick into it."
00:10:06,00:10:08,"And then you just go home and cook it, and make that into a cake."
00:10:08,00:10:11,">> I think they squash it, they get loads and squash them down, right?"
00:10:11,00:10:11,>> Yeah.
00:10:11,00:10:16,">> But I think the ones that happen in Africa, I know they have problems in"
00:10:16,00:10:19,"Midgham, but I think the ones in Africa are absolutely insane."
00:10:19,00:10:22,"Like, as in you can hardly walk through them, there's just so many midges."
00:10:22,00:10:22,>> Right.
00:10:22,00:10:23,>> I think so.
00:10:23,00:10:26,">> Yeah, I think you're right, because it's sort of, they get more hatchings, and"
00:10:26,00:10:29,"you get like in places like Cameroon, you get a hatching every three weeks."
00:10:29,00:10:30,>> Yeah.
00:10:30,00:10:32,">> It's bad if you get what, three in a year."
00:10:32,00:10:36,">> Yeah, it's actually the warmer the places, the more hatchings they get."
00:10:36,00:10:37,>> Okay.
00:10:37,00:10:41,>> The baby midges are these tiny little lavas.
00:10:41,00:10:42,They look like little caterpillars.
00:10:42,00:10:47,"And in the Goldenrod Goalmage, they have this amazing way of jumping,"
00:10:47,00:10:53,"where they get all their internal fluids, push them down to their tail,"
00:10:53,00:10:58,"turn themselves into a little sort of circle, and then hold on, hold on,"
00:10:58,00:11:01,"release, and then they jump into the air."
00:11:01,00:11:04,">> Okay, it's an absolutely amazing way to get about."
00:11:04,00:11:10,They can move 28 times more efficiently than a caterpillar can crawl.
00:11:10,00:11:12,>> Than one of the trams.
00:11:12,00:11:13,Are they still a joke?
00:11:13,00:11:14,"No, okay, good."
00:11:14,00:11:18,>> If a sausage could jump that quickly.
00:11:18,00:11:19,>> Yes.
00:11:19,00:11:22,>> Then it could get to the top of the Great Pyramid at Giza in three seconds.
00:11:22,00:11:24,>> Oh my God.
00:11:24,00:11:24,>> Wow.
00:11:24,00:11:25,>> That is context.
00:11:25,00:11:26,>> That's incredible.
00:11:26,00:11:27,>> Imagine that sausage.
00:11:27,00:11:29,>> Their eggs are actually sausage shaped.
00:11:29,00:11:34,"Well, their eggs biting midge eggs are either cigar, banana, or sausage shaped."
00:11:34,00:11:36,Which is a cool range of shapes for an egg.
00:11:36,00:11:37,>> They're all quite similar shapes.
00:11:37,00:11:38,>> Cigars and sausages.
00:11:38,00:11:40,">> Yes, cigar and sausage is a-"
00:11:40,00:11:40,>> I was wondering about the difference.
00:11:40,00:11:42,"I think it must be the ends, right?"
00:11:42,00:11:43,">> It's the tapering, yeah, yeah."
00:11:43,00:11:44,>> The tapering.
00:11:44,00:11:47,">> Very few sausages, which sort of tail off at the end, yeah."
00:11:47,00:11:49,">> Yes. >> But cigars, loads."
00:11:49,00:11:50,">> Hey, we're gonna have to move on a sec, by the way."
00:11:50,00:11:52,>> Can I tell you an audience fact?
00:11:52,00:11:53,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:11:53,00:11:55,>> This is from a Scottish listener.
00:11:55,00:11:57,"So it's Bev Clark, I don't suppose you're in."
00:11:57,00:12:00,"Anyway, she sent in a fantastic fact, right?"
00:12:00,00:12:03,"This is actually about bats, but she submitted it as,"
00:12:03,00:12:09,a pipistrel bat has to eat about one-sixth of its own body weight in midges every night to survive.
00:12:09,00:12:13,That is the equivalent to an average Scottish nine-year-old child having
00:12:13,00:12:18,"to eat 23 tins of baked beans, one bean at a time, whilst flying every night."
00:12:18,00:12:21,>> [LAUGH]
00:12:21,00:12:22,>> Just get back.
00:12:22,00:12:23,">> Yeah, that's brilliant."
00:12:23,00:12:29,[MUSIC]
00:12:29,00:12:31,>> We do need to move on to our next fact.
00:12:31,00:12:34,"So it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:12:34,00:12:38,">> My fact this week is that there are radar detectors, and"
00:12:38,00:12:44,"there are radar detector detectors, and there are radar detector detector detectors."
00:12:44,00:12:46,>> [LAUGH]
00:12:46,00:12:50,">> But as far as we know,"
00:12:50,00:12:53,"there are not yet any radar detectors, detectors, detectors, detectors."
00:12:53,00:12:58,>> But that's only because we don't have a radar to find it.
00:12:58,00:12:59,>> How would we know?
00:12:59,00:13:03,There's always going to be one more detectors than we know about.
00:13:03,00:13:07,">> I don't think so, right, because your radar is used by the cops."
00:13:07,00:13:10,">> So the police one with a traffic gun, that's a radar."
00:13:10,00:13:14,>> So then the police need to know if you're breaking the law by getting a detector.
00:13:14,00:13:18,"So they have a detector detector detector, but if you get the next level up,"
00:13:18,00:13:22,"you're already breaking the law with your other detector, so they don't need the second one."
00:13:22,00:13:26,">> They don't need to know, that's a good point, and that is basically what it is."
00:13:26,00:13:29,"So this is from radar that's sent out by speed cameras,"
00:13:29,00:13:31,"bounces off your car a couple of times, and then it sees how fast you're"
00:13:31,00:13:34,traveling by working out what distance you've traveled in that time.
00:13:34,00:13:34,>> That's a radar detector.
00:13:34,00:13:36,">> No, that is just a speed camera."
00:13:36,00:13:38,>> [LAUGH]
00:13:38,00:13:43,">> And then you in your car, because you're a criminal in lots of places,"
00:13:43,00:13:46,"where these things are banned, you might have a device that's a radar detector."
00:13:46,00:13:50,>> And have you done your driving theory test yet or?
00:13:50,00:13:51,>> The theory test?
00:13:51,00:13:53,">> Yeah. >> No, no, no."
00:13:53,00:13:55,">> Well, I hope you're listening to this, because this all will come up."
00:13:55,00:13:58,">> Yeah, I did slightly blank out, what are we talking about?"
00:13:58,00:14:01,">> Sorry. >> So I, if I'm driving and I put"
00:14:01,00:14:04,"a radar detector in my car, that's to tell me when there's a speed."
00:14:04,00:14:05,>> A speed camera. >> Exactly.
00:14:05,00:14:08,">> Okay, so then the police officer has a radar detector to see,"
00:14:08,00:14:11,if you have a radar detector to see if he has a speeding camera.
00:14:11,00:14:15,">> So the police officer, well, not the police officer, the speed camera in it"
00:14:15,00:14:20,has a detector that will detect if the driver has a detector.
00:14:20,00:14:21,>> So that's a detector detector?
00:14:21,00:14:23,">> Exactly, because it sends off little vibrations."
00:14:23,00:14:27,But the way of detecting in the camera is to vibrate a little bit itself.
00:14:27,00:14:32,"So some of the radar detectors also have within them detector, detector, detectors."
00:14:32,00:14:35,"And that's the complicated world of radar detectors, basically."
00:14:35,00:14:36,>> [LAUGH]
00:14:36,00:14:38,">> And the thing is, even in your car,"
00:14:38,00:14:41,"you might have a thing where in your sat nav, it tells you where there are speed"
00:14:41,00:14:42,cameras. >> Yeah.
00:14:42,00:14:44,">> And that's perfectly legal in most places,"
00:14:44,00:14:46,but not in all places.
00:14:46,00:14:50,"So if you're driving in America, for instance, and you go into Virginia,"
00:14:50,00:14:55,"Mississippi, or Washington DC, technically you have to turn that off in your car."
00:14:55,00:14:57,"Now, fuck knows how you do that."
00:14:57,00:14:59,"But in theory, you would have to do that in order to."
00:14:59,00:15:02,>> Or you have to prove that you're ignoring it by speeding through every
00:15:02,00:15:06,speed camera. >> That's very cool.
00:15:06,00:15:11,>> Do you know what the fastest ever speeding ticket was?
00:15:11,00:15:15,">> I was in like, you were giving it two seconds after."
00:15:15,00:15:16,>> Sorry.
00:15:16,00:15:17,">> My god, you pedant."
00:15:17,00:15:20,>> I'm used to this stuff from James.
00:15:20,00:15:23,"When it comes to Dan, I've got no defenses."
00:15:23,00:15:26,">> Is it, are we talking in the UK?"
00:15:26,00:15:27,>> It is in the USA.
00:15:27,00:15:30,">> Okay, so the word is, would you want to have a guess?"
00:15:30,00:15:34,">> Well, no cars would go more than 200 miles an hour."
00:15:34,00:15:39,">> Uh-huh, well, there's lots of stuff online saying the fastest ticket ever was"
00:15:39,00:15:42,"a sports car, it was a special sports car, it was in Texas."
00:15:42,00:15:47,It was in a 75 mile an hour zone and it was going at 242 miles an hour.
00:15:47,00:15:50,"There's a lot of stuff on the internet saying that, I didn't find like,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,the exact initial story behind it.
00:15:52,00:15:57,I have a theory that the fastest ever speeding ticket was someone who was
00:15:57,00:16:01,caught going at eight miles an hour because the speed limit was two miles
00:16:01,00:16:02,an hour at the time.
00:16:02,00:16:04,>> And that just makes them faster.
00:16:04,00:16:09,">> Well, relative to the limit, it's the fastest, I think, ever."
00:16:09,00:16:11,">> Four times the speed limit, that's crazy."
00:16:11,00:16:12,"You wouldn't drive 120 in a 30, would you?"
00:16:12,00:16:13,No.
00:16:13,00:16:14,>> So technically.
00:16:14,00:16:15,">> Okay, right."
00:16:15,00:16:16,>> Technically it is.
00:16:16,00:16:18,>> But that was the first one ever issued.
00:16:18,00:16:19,>> That's amazing.
00:16:19,00:16:25,">> It was 1896, whoa, that is the exact same year as the first ever speeding"
00:16:25,00:16:28,ticket that was given over here in the UK.
00:16:28,00:16:29,>> This was in the UK.
00:16:29,00:16:30,>> Yeah.
00:16:30,00:16:31,>> How ironic.
00:16:31,00:16:32,>> Wait.
00:16:32,00:16:36,">> He started out talking about the US, but we did them."
00:16:36,00:16:38,">> It's in Petswood, very nearly used to."
00:16:38,00:16:40,">> Oh, yeah, God, I got to start listening, man."
00:16:40,00:16:43,">> That was, we're talking about the same thing here."
00:16:43,00:16:44,>> Yeah.
00:16:44,00:16:45,>> Okay.
00:16:45,00:16:46,>> It was in 1896.
00:16:46,00:16:47,>> And it was eight miles an hour.
00:16:47,00:16:48,>> Eight miles an hour.
00:16:48,00:16:49,>> Yeah.
00:16:49,00:16:50,>> Wow.
00:16:50,00:16:51,">> It was, supposedly he was followed by a police officer on a bike for five"
00:16:51,00:16:52,miles.
00:16:52,00:16:57,">> There was a guy a couple of years ago called Nigel Mills, who was clock"
00:16:57,00:17:01,"speeding 88 miles an hour in his car, which was a."
00:17:01,00:17:02,>> A delorean.
00:17:02,00:17:03,">> Oh, brilliant."
00:17:03,00:17:07,">> A delorean, as the audience got."
00:17:07,00:17:13,"He had to go to court, he paid his fine, but in court, he did deny that he was attempting"
00:17:13,00:17:15,to break the space time continuum.
00:17:15,00:17:21,">> I learned something that I think probably I should have known, this definitely will be"
00:17:21,00:17:24,"in the theory, in fact, the thing that always accompanies speed cameras, which I didn't"
00:17:24,00:17:27,"know about, or the main speed cameras that you get, which as I'm sure you know are the"
00:17:27,00:17:33,"Gatso cameras, which are the big yellow boxes, although I think in Scotland, they're yellow"
00:17:33,00:17:37,"and red, diagonal stripes, is that right?"
00:17:37,00:17:40,"But they always are accompanied by lines on the road, which I just never noticed."
00:17:40,00:17:47,">> It's going so fast, it's just a blur, and also you're pissed out of your brain."
00:17:47,00:17:56,">> Yeah, you can't be expected to concentrate on this sort of thing when you're lying down."
00:17:56,00:17:59,So one way you could fool them is you could cover up the lines on the road before you
00:17:59,00:18:00,got to the speed camera.
00:18:00,00:18:05,">> Wait, do I have to park my car a mile back, walk up to it with a black cloth or something?"
00:18:05,00:18:08,">> With a sheet or something that can cover the lines up, because basically what the lines"
00:18:08,00:18:12,"are doing, speed cameras do two things to make sure that you're speeding or not."
00:18:12,00:18:16,"They send out some radar, and so it's like two pulses of radar, and they work out how"
00:18:16,00:18:20,"far away you are with each pulse of radar, and then they work out how far you've travelled"
00:18:20,00:18:24,"in the time it's sent out, the two pulses, but also they need a backup way of telling"
00:18:24,00:18:29,"how far you've travelled, so they also take two photos as you're travelling, and they"
00:18:29,00:18:32,"need to see where you were in the first photo and where you were in the second photo, and"
00:18:32,00:18:34,then see how long it took you to get from one to the other.
00:18:34,00:18:39,">> I always wonder when I'm going past one of those, if I swerve into another lane, will"
00:18:39,00:18:41,they not be able to take the second photo?
00:18:41,00:18:44,">> They're on every lane, sadly, so that's the white lines."
00:18:44,00:18:49,>> I don't think it's a different car with the same licence plate.
00:18:49,00:18:53,They can't put a glove on me legally.
00:18:53,00:18:57,">> I think you might have to go on the verge, and that's a whole nother contravention, but"
00:18:57,00:19:01,"they can only tell you because the lines are on a ruler, so they can tell how far up the"
00:19:01,00:19:02,ruler you've gone.
00:19:02,00:19:07,">> Gatso is named after Maurice Gatsonides, who was a racing driver."
00:19:07,00:19:12,We very briefly mentioned him about nine and a half years ago.
00:19:12,00:19:17,"His first speed gun that he invented was two rubber tyres on the road, and you still see"
00:19:17,00:19:18,those.
00:19:18,00:19:23,"When you're driving just around and around, there's just two little rubber lines."
00:19:23,00:19:27,They tell you how many cars are going along so that people can make rules and stuff like
00:19:27,00:19:30,"that and check out what the speed limit is, but they also tell you the speed."
00:19:30,00:19:31,>> What do you mean rubber lines?
00:19:31,00:19:36,>> It's like two little rubber wires that go across the road.
00:19:36,00:19:37,>> Tiny cords.
00:19:37,00:19:40,"I always assumed that they were testing whether they should put a speed camera in there, and"
00:19:40,00:19:44,I would slow down for them because I don't want people to know how fast I normally drive
00:19:44,00:19:45,over that bit.
00:19:45,00:19:46,>> That's sensible.
00:19:46,00:19:49,"They are doing that, but they're also checking how many cars go across there."
00:19:49,00:19:50,>> I've never noticed that.
00:19:50,00:19:53,Do I never look at the road?
00:19:53,00:19:55,">> Oh, my gosh."
00:19:55,00:19:59,"He was a racing driver, and he invented the speed camera to speed himself up because he"
00:19:59,00:20:03,"wanted to know how fast he was going, and he would keep going around the corner loads"
00:20:03,00:20:06,"and loads of times, and his speed camera would say, ""You're going at 60 miles an hour, 70"
00:20:06,00:20:10,"miles an hour, 80 miles an hour,"" and he would try and get as fast as possible."
00:20:10,00:20:16,"He invented a charcoal-burning petrol generator during the German occupation of Holland, which"
00:20:16,00:20:18,kept the country going.
00:20:18,00:20:22,He was part of the resistance during World War II.
00:20:22,00:20:26,"He took up engineering after he was turned down as a pilot for KLM due to a mangled finger,"
00:20:26,00:20:28,which he got after a bicycle accident as a child.
00:20:28,00:20:29,>> A mangled finger?
00:20:29,00:20:30,>> Yes.
00:20:30,00:20:31,>> I don't think that should discount you.
00:20:31,00:20:33,>> There were more picky in those days.
00:20:33,00:20:34,>> Right.
00:20:34,00:20:35,>> I don't know.
00:20:35,00:20:38,>> You couldn't even do it if you're ... I think they're very picky.
00:20:38,00:20:39,You can't even do it if you're short-sighted.
00:20:39,00:20:40,>> Can't you?
00:20:40,00:20:41,>> No.
00:20:41,00:20:42,He certainly couldn't back then.
00:20:42,00:20:43,>> But I'm short-sighted.
00:20:43,00:20:47,">> Well, I'm sorry to reign on your parade, Andy, but you're going to have to stick with"
00:20:47,00:20:48,the podcast.
00:20:48,00:20:55,">> And he also invented his own car, which had a glass dome over the top of it to make"
00:20:55,00:20:57,you think you were driving an airplane.
00:20:57,00:20:58,">> Oh, cool."
00:20:58,00:21:01,>> You know like that one that Homer Simpson makes?
00:21:01,00:21:02,>> Yes.
00:21:02,00:21:03,>> It's quite like that.
00:21:03,00:21:05,>> I've got another inventor just to bring up.
00:21:05,00:21:07,This is taking it to radar very quickly.
00:21:07,00:21:11,Have you guys heard of Dr. Robert Rhine's incredible radar designer?
00:21:11,00:21:16,So he sort of innovated the resolution of what radar and sonar images could achieve.
00:21:16,00:21:21,And the stuff that he did allowed for the Titanic to be found.
00:21:21,00:21:26,"It was using his advanced technology to find the wreck of the Titanic, to find the Bismarck."
00:21:26,00:21:27,Absolutely incredible.
00:21:27,00:21:32,"But what he applied using that sonar to most of all was his big passion, multiple expeditions,"
00:21:32,00:21:37,to find the Loch Ness monster.
00:21:37,00:21:40,"He went on like six, seven expeditions."
00:21:40,00:21:46,He found a perfumer to create a scent that would lure Nessie up from the Loch Ness.
00:21:46,00:21:50,>> The easiest day's work for that perfumer.
00:21:50,00:21:53,>> He trained dolphins to carry cameras that they could send through the Loch and try and
00:21:53,00:21:54,so forth.
00:21:54,00:21:57,"I don't know if he ever actually did that, but that was the attempt."
00:21:57,00:21:58,And he was amazing.
00:21:58,00:22:03,"Outside of sonar, he invented -- he patented a hinge that you could use for chopsticks."
00:22:03,00:22:08,"And he tried to invent something that would stop tornadoes from materializing, but it"
00:22:08,00:22:09,never happened.
00:22:09,00:22:11,"Yeah, one of the great Nessie hunters, local hero."
00:22:11,00:22:12,Yeah.
00:22:12,00:22:18,">> I was really about radar, and I came across a really fun kind of paper that was written"
00:22:18,00:22:19,in 1946.
00:22:19,00:22:22,This was a really short time after radar was basically invented.
00:22:22,00:22:27,"So we only worked out how to use it usefully in the Second World War, and it was for use"
00:22:27,00:22:30,in aircraft and aircraft detection.
00:22:30,00:22:35,"And on boats and on submarines, they kept picking up ghosts or phantoms or something"
00:22:35,00:22:36,they called them echoes.
00:22:36,00:22:40,"And there's all these sources of people writing, speculating about what it might be."
00:22:40,00:22:45,"So in Germany, there was speculation that it was probably a matter of sharply bounded"
00:22:45,00:22:47,areas of discontinuity in the atmosphere.
00:22:47,00:22:51,"Now, it turns out, what that's another word for is birds."
00:22:51,00:22:55,But they just couldn't put two and two together.
00:22:55,00:23:00,"It's bizarre that in 1946, it's written like, actually, we've worked out that it was birds"
00:23:00,00:23:01,all along.
00:23:01,00:23:04,>> Is it not true that radar was invented because they were trying to make a death ray?
00:23:04,00:23:05,>> I think that's true.
00:23:05,00:23:06,>> Interesting.
00:23:06,00:23:07,>> I think so.
00:23:07,00:23:12,So there was rumours that Germany had been making a death ray by firing radio waves at
00:23:12,00:23:14,people and it would just make them disappear.
00:23:14,00:23:17,And it was taken seriously by the British.
00:23:17,00:23:20,"And they thought, well, we're going to need one of our own."
00:23:20,00:23:22,And they found this guy called Robert Watts at Watt.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"And they asked him, can you make us a death ray, please?"
00:23:25,00:23:29,"And they offered him if he could zap a sheep from 100 paces away, they'd give him a thousand"
00:23:29,00:23:35,pounds.
00:23:35,00:23:38,>> He did his experiments and realised that it was impossible.
00:23:38,00:23:42,But then he realised also that he could use this radio waves to bounce off things and
00:23:42,00:23:44,work out how far things were away.
00:23:44,00:23:46,">> Wow, that's incredible."
00:23:46,00:23:50,>> He must have considered trying to blag it by getting his friends to dig a hole near
00:23:50,00:23:53,the sheep.
00:23:53,00:24:03,">> Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:24:03,00:24:08,"My fact is that in 16th century Wales, there was a financial crisis which meant that lots"
00:24:08,00:24:13,of families could no longer afford to keep a household bard.
00:24:13,00:24:18,">> Wow, very, huge wow."
00:24:18,00:24:21,"And they, every, every house would have its own bard."
00:24:21,00:24:22,>> And now?
00:24:22,00:24:23,>> Or very few.
00:24:23,00:24:24,>> Yeah?
00:24:24,00:24:25,>> Very few.
00:24:25,00:24:28,You got to be pretty loaded in modern Wales to have your own bard.
00:24:28,00:24:31,"Bards were, bards were big, big noise back in the day."
00:24:31,00:24:33,"Bards were multi, they were multitaskers, weren't they?"
00:24:33,00:24:34,">> Oh, they did it all."
00:24:34,00:24:38,"I mean, they mostly, mostly read poems and played the harp."
00:24:38,00:24:42,"But they probably helped with the washing up, if required."
00:24:42,00:24:46,">> Actually there was a medieval document called the Triads of Britain, and they say"
00:24:46,00:24:51,"that the three principal tasks of a bard is one, to learn and collect sciences."
00:24:51,00:24:57,"The second is to teach, and the third is to make peace and put an end to all injury."
00:24:57,00:25:02,">> It's a big ream it, isn't it, as a jaw-bad, who's CB?"
00:25:02,00:25:07,">> If there is heavy washing up, you will be, it will be really appreciated into a bit."
00:25:07,00:25:10,"It was just an interesting, and it was also, it was a time where around this period the"
00:25:10,00:25:16,"Welsh language was kind of being demoted, and English was being promoted, and you know,"
00:25:16,00:25:21,"the aristocracy were anglicising, and there were a lot of popular poets at the time who"
00:25:21,00:25:25,"proper classical barads thought were trash, so they were nicknamed the, like the modern"
00:25:25,00:25:30,"poets, were called poets who sing at fares, gross, and some of them didn't even play"
00:25:30,00:25:31,the harp.
00:25:31,00:25:35,">> Hang on, sorry, were these like the English-imported poets, or these are both parts?"
00:25:35,00:25:40,">> I think that, I think that was like a newer, like, >> I would just associate poets with"
00:25:40,00:25:42,a loot rather than a harp.
00:25:42,00:25:45,"I associate harps with, like, angels and stuff."
00:25:45,00:25:46,">> I don't know what a loot is, that's my..."
00:25:46,00:25:47,>> You see this big screen?
00:25:47,00:25:48,">> Yes, I do."
00:25:48,00:25:49,[laughter]
00:25:49,00:25:50,>> Yes.
00:25:50,00:25:56,">> That was a huge loot, like, I would say like a harp is more like at a wedding, you"
00:25:56,00:25:58,"see, so we're playing a big harp."
00:25:58,00:25:59,>> Yeah.
00:25:59,00:26:03,">> Yeah, it was the thing for bars, it wasn't it's a harp, the triple harp in fact, tended"
00:26:03,00:26:04,to be what they played.
00:26:04,00:26:06,">> Little handheld, handheld drobbies, or?"
00:26:06,00:26:08,">> Well, bigger than what..."
00:26:08,00:26:09,[laughter]
00:26:09,00:26:11,">> Do you know what ""jobby"" means in Scotland?"
00:26:11,00:26:12,[laughter]
00:26:12,00:26:13,>> Absolutely.
00:26:13,00:26:14,>> Good boy.
00:26:14,00:26:15,[laughter]
00:26:15,00:26:16,>> Yeah.
00:26:16,00:26:17,>> Sorry.
00:26:17,00:26:18,>> No offense.
00:26:18,00:26:19,Balance.
00:26:19,00:26:20,>> Yeah.
00:26:20,00:26:21,>> That's cool.
00:26:21,00:26:26,">> Yeah, yeah, three layers of twang, what are they called strings, Liz?"
00:26:26,00:26:31,">> Is it like when a guitarist has two, you know, those awesome guitars with two necks"
00:26:31,00:26:33,"on it, or they layered on top of each other?"
00:26:33,00:26:37,">> They're layered on top of each other, and in fact, I was interested to learn that ""Deck"
00:26:37,00:26:40,"the Hall with Bows of Holly"" was written by a bard, a Welsh bard."
00:26:40,00:26:41,>> What was it?
00:26:41,00:26:45,">> Yes, the most famous Welsh bard, John Parry, who was a blind bard as many works, they were"
00:26:45,00:26:48,"thought to have sort of extra sight, which gave him this wisdom to write."
00:26:48,00:26:53,"But basically, we say that the job of the bard, they were pretending to cure all ills"
00:26:53,00:26:56,"or something, but basically, it was to massively kiss the ass of the posh people, wasn't it?"
00:26:56,00:26:57,>> Yeah.
00:26:57,00:26:58,>> It was.
00:26:58,00:26:59,>> That was quite fascinating.
00:26:59,00:27:05,"Particularly in Ireland, in fact, which had a huge barding history, you essentially"
00:27:05,00:27:10,"went around touting your wares to posh nobility, praising them, and writing verse about how"
00:27:10,00:27:15,"amazing they were, and how big their houses were, and how beautiful their wives were,"
00:27:15,00:27:20,"and how great their penises looked, and whatever it was, and that's how you got your gigs."
00:27:20,00:27:24,">> Lovely penis barry, just want to say it."
00:27:24,00:27:28,">> They could be quite dangerous bards, couldn't they?"
00:27:28,00:27:32,There was an idea that their songs could bring up insurrection and stuff.
00:27:32,00:27:36,"I think the English thought that a lot of the Welsh bards, they were a bit worried about"
00:27:36,00:27:37,the Welsh bards.
00:27:37,00:27:40,">> Same with the Irish, in fact, they inspired the nobles to revolt."
00:27:40,00:27:44,">> I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same with the Scottish, I would say."
00:27:44,00:27:45,">> No, in those English."
00:27:45,00:27:49,">> No, the Scottish ones just loved English, actually, throughout history, yeah."
00:27:49,00:27:50,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:27:50,00:27:53,But let's try and get out of here alive.
00:27:53,00:27:57,">> Everyone's from Berkshire, it's fine."
00:27:57,00:28:04,">> In 1282, apparently, King Edward of England decided to get rid of all the bards in Wales"
00:28:04,00:28:08,"because he was worried that they might cause insurrection among the Welsh, and apparently"
00:28:08,00:28:12,he had a massacre of 500 bards.
00:28:12,00:28:14,How did he lure them all to the same place?
00:28:14,00:28:19,"Did he have a big, like, loot sale, and then advertised in loot?"
00:28:19,00:28:20,">> Advertised in loot, brilliant."
00:28:20,00:28:23,>> That was a good joke about 30 years ago.
00:28:23,00:28:26,">> That's such a good joke, you don't remember loot, the magazine?"
00:28:26,00:28:31,Then why didn't the four of you laugh?
00:28:31,00:28:33,">> It's so weird, though, this thing, right?"
00:28:33,00:28:36,"So apparently, he supposedly massacred these 500 bards."
00:28:36,00:28:41,"No one really knows about it in England, no one really knows about it in Wales, but everyone"
00:28:41,00:28:44,knows about it in Hungary.
00:28:44,00:28:49,"Because there is a song that Hungarian school children memorize, and it's almost like a"
00:28:49,00:28:55,"nursery rhyme kind of thing, which is about the massacre of the 500 Welsh bards."
00:28:55,00:28:58,"And so all Hungarian children know it, yeah."
00:28:58,00:29:02,">> You know, they're dangerous for other reasons as well, as well as possible insurrections."
00:29:02,00:29:07,They also were able to kill a rat by talking to it.
00:29:07,00:29:12,"And this was a thing that has been written in multiple plays, Shakespeare references,"
00:29:12,00:29:17,"lots of plays reference it, and it was the idea that there was a very famous bard from"
00:29:17,00:29:21,"Ireland who came home one day, and some mice had eaten the meal that his wife had prepared"
00:29:21,00:29:27,"for him, and so he sort of went, ""You fucking assholes,"" and they died."
00:29:27,00:29:30,"And that became a thing that you would bring a bard over to your house, because you had"
00:29:30,00:29:31,a mice problem.
00:29:31,00:29:32,>> No.
00:29:32,00:29:35,">> Yeah, and they would use their words purely to kill it."
00:29:35,00:29:37,">> That can't have lasted long, because the proof's really in the pudding when you get"
00:29:37,00:29:39,the rodent guy around.
00:29:39,00:29:40,>> I don't believe it.
00:29:40,00:29:41,I just...
00:29:41,00:29:42,[laughter]
00:29:42,00:29:45,>> Do you know one of the most famous ever bards?
00:29:45,00:29:47,It was called YOLO.
00:29:47,00:29:48,>> No.
00:29:48,00:29:49,>> Yeah.
00:29:49,00:29:50,>> I-O-L-O.
00:29:50,00:29:55,"His real name was Edward Williams, but he was..."
00:29:55,00:29:57,He deeply loved Welsh...
00:29:57,00:30:01,"He became a Welsh bardic scholar, basically, and a lot of what we know or what people thought"
00:30:01,00:30:05,before they knew about bards in the 18th and 19th centuries is because of him.
00:30:05,00:30:09,And he also made up a lot of stuff and pretended it was by a 14th-century bard.
00:30:09,00:30:11,He did a lot of forging works.
00:30:11,00:30:15,"But he held the first ever Welsh gorseth, which is the gathering of the bards in..."
00:30:15,00:30:16,>> Wales.
00:30:16,00:30:21,>> Primrose Hill in North London.
00:30:21,00:30:25,He wanted to kind of show England and London that this was Welsh bardic culture and how
00:30:25,00:30:30,"amazing it was, and he was responsible for a lot of England being kind of druid mad for"
00:30:30,00:30:31,a long time.
00:30:31,00:30:32,>> He made a lot...
00:30:32,00:30:34,"Yeah, as you say, he made a lot of it up, and no one knew that at the time."
00:30:34,00:30:35,It was sort of like in the 20...
00:30:35,00:30:36,Who is what?
00:30:36,00:30:37,The 18th century?
00:30:37,00:30:41,They found it in the 20th century through some academics reading into it and finding
00:30:41,00:30:42,out.
00:30:42,00:30:44,And he had all these details about his life that sounded so badass.
00:30:44,00:30:50,He said that he learned to read by watching his dad carve names into gravestones.
00:30:50,00:30:53,"That was where he learned the alphabets, and that's where he learned to read."
00:30:53,00:30:54,>> Really?
00:30:54,00:30:55,"Yeah, yeah."
00:30:55,00:30:56,>> Is it Mary Shelley or Mary Wollstonecraft who...
00:30:56,00:30:57,"It's Mary Wollstonecraft, isn't it?"
00:30:57,00:30:58,">> Oh, Mary Shelley."
00:30:58,00:30:59,>> Mary Shelley.
00:30:59,00:31:03,>> She had to write her name by tracing her mother's name on her gravestone.
00:31:03,00:31:04,">> Oh, yeah."
00:31:04,00:31:06,And she also lost her virginity on it as well.
00:31:06,00:31:07,">> Yes, she did."
00:31:07,00:31:08,">> Yeah, I touched it the other day."
00:31:08,00:31:09,It was amazing.
00:31:09,00:31:10,>> Pervert.
00:31:10,00:31:11,>> Very creepy.
00:31:11,00:31:13,">> Yeah, it was actually creepy, wasn't it?"
00:31:13,00:31:17,">> Well, what did you touch it with?"
00:31:17,00:31:23,">> Every country has their own bards, don't they?"
00:31:23,00:31:28,"Oh, every country has their own storytellers, and I think the reason they exist everywhere"
00:31:28,00:31:30,"is because they're a repository of knowledge for people who can't write or read, which"
00:31:30,00:31:35,is sort of everyone until here and today.
00:31:35,00:31:39,And so I didn't realize that hula dancers are bards.
00:31:39,00:31:42,So a hula is not a dance.
00:31:42,00:31:46,"It's a way of acting out a story which is being told at the same time, traditionally."
00:31:46,00:31:47,>> That's cool.
00:31:47,00:31:48,>> This is in Hawaii.
00:31:48,00:31:53,"In Sicily, you have an ancient storytelling method passed down from one person to the"
00:31:53,00:31:54,"next, which is called kanto."
00:31:54,00:31:56,">> It's savage, Anna."
00:31:56,00:32:01,">> It's just improvised, sung verse and spoken prose."
00:32:01,00:32:02,"The kanto, and there --"
00:32:02,00:32:03,>> How's it spelled?
00:32:03,00:32:04,>> There's the bottom.
00:32:04,00:32:05,">> Yeah, I see it."
00:32:05,00:32:06,That's nailed on.
00:32:06,00:32:17,"Andy, weren't you looking for a tourniquet name as well?"
00:32:17,00:32:18,>> Wow.
00:32:18,00:32:22,">> I'm so sorry to doubt you, Anna."
00:32:22,00:32:23,Absolutely doesn't say that word.
00:32:23,00:32:32,"I highly respected the Contistae, of course, who'd tell the stories of the kanto."
00:32:32,00:32:33,And there are lots of others as well.
00:32:33,00:32:35,">> Just put an O on the end to keep saying it, you had to stop doing that."
00:32:35,00:32:38,>> I've never had the courage to say it before.
00:32:38,00:32:39,I didn't realize this when we wanted to.
00:32:39,00:32:44,">> The Six Marks brother, who was not allowed on screen."
00:32:44,00:32:51,">> In 16th century France, they had an anagramata royale, whose job was they were with the royal"
00:32:51,00:32:56,"family, and whenever a dignitary would come, they would make an anagram of their names."
00:32:56,00:32:58,">> That's cool, isn't it?"
00:32:58,00:33:03,">> Anna Tyshinski, could be Zayny Payne Skank."
00:33:03,00:33:08,>> A million miles off.
00:33:08,00:33:12,>> She's not Zayny.
00:33:12,00:33:18,">> Andrew Hunter Murray, untrue Rwanda Rhymer."
00:33:18,00:33:19,>> Untrue Rwanda Rhymer.
00:33:19,00:33:20,>> That's me.
00:33:20,00:33:27,">> And then Daniel Shriver, incredible ass."
00:33:27,00:33:33,">> Wait, did you say ""incredible""?"
00:33:33,00:33:39,">> You do have to put the H at the start, otherwise it doesn't work."
00:33:39,00:33:41,">> Wow, what's James Harkin?"
00:33:41,00:33:44,>> There are no anagrams of that.
00:33:44,00:33:51,">> So, overseas storytellers, I was reading about the benshi of Japan, I never heard of"
00:33:51,00:33:52,the benshi before.
00:33:52,00:33:57,"During the 20th century, theaters, movie theaters in Japan, when all the movies were silent,"
00:33:57,00:34:02,would hire these storytellers to come and talk over the movies and explain what was
00:34:02,00:34:05,going on or give their own narratives about what was going on.
00:34:05,00:34:06,"So, yeah."
00:34:06,00:34:10,">> Don't invite a banshi, just have all the way through your film."
00:34:10,00:34:12,>> What's a banshi?
00:34:12,00:34:14,>> It's like a mythical screamer.
00:34:14,00:34:16,>> I would assume that you would be all over that.
00:34:16,00:34:21,>> Don't give him away into another fucking Loch Ness Monster fact.
00:34:21,00:34:27,"We should talk about Scotland's national bard, Robbie Burns, shouldn't we, I guess."
00:34:27,00:34:30,And he's in tonight.
00:34:30,00:34:35,"Some words from Burns' poems, and see if you can guess what they mean."
00:34:35,00:34:36,Swankies.
00:34:36,00:34:37,>> Translers.
00:34:37,00:34:42,">> Not a million miles away, but no."
00:34:42,00:34:43,Socks.
00:34:43,00:34:49,">> No, it's swaggering, strapping fellows who are in their prime."
00:34:49,00:34:50,">> Oh, great."
00:34:50,00:34:51,>> Okay.
00:34:51,00:34:54,>> We're looking at four of them tonight on stage.
00:34:54,00:34:56,>> Bickering brattle.
00:34:56,00:34:58,">> Oh, yes, that's good."
00:34:58,00:35:01,"No, it's the way that a mouse runs along the floor."
00:35:01,00:35:03,"So like this way, that way, this way, that way kind of thing."
00:35:03,00:35:04,>> Okay.
00:35:04,00:35:05,>> Trying to get away from the bard.
00:35:05,00:35:08,>> He's just tracing it.
00:35:08,00:35:09,>> Canty.
00:35:09,00:35:14,">> It's an Italian, it's a Sicilian form of traditional storytelling."
00:35:14,00:35:20,It's the excess of good spirit at the point of bursting into song.
00:35:20,00:35:21,And lunt.
00:35:21,00:35:22,">> Okay, right."
00:35:22,00:35:23,>> Lunt.
00:35:23,00:35:24,>> Lunt.
00:35:24,00:35:25,>> Lunt.
00:35:25,00:35:32,">> It's when you get lint, but in your crotch area."
00:35:32,00:35:37,>> Very annoying.
00:35:37,00:35:38,">> Oh, my God."
00:35:38,00:35:39,">> Yeah, that's a thing."
00:35:39,00:35:40,>> That's a thing.
00:35:40,00:35:41,>> That's a thing.
00:35:41,00:35:43,">> Yeah, lint gathers on your clothes, isn't it?"
00:35:43,00:35:44,>> Can I tell you the answer?
00:35:44,00:35:45,>> Yeah.
00:35:45,00:35:50,">> If you've got new pants, you'll experience lunt, yeah, no matter what you've got going"
00:35:50,00:35:51,on down there.
00:35:51,00:35:52,>> Yeah.
00:35:52,00:35:53,>> Yeah.
00:35:53,00:35:55,>> It's to walk away while smoking.
00:35:55,00:35:56,>> Oh.
00:35:56,00:35:57,>> Okay.
00:35:57,00:36:00,>> That's not nearly as good as Anna's one.
00:36:00,00:36:01,>> Yeah.
00:36:01,00:36:02,>> Much prefer Anna's one.
00:36:02,00:36:03,>> Right.
00:36:03,00:36:04,>> We've got to move on in a second.
00:36:04,00:36:08,"Before we do, this whole fact was about, basically, families not being able to afford things"
00:36:08,00:36:12,"anymore, people not being able to afford things anymore, and you know, some group of people"
00:36:12,00:36:15,"who've really experienced that hard in recent times, and thank you, James, I almost forgot"
00:36:15,00:36:22,"to mention, are Nessie hunters because things have got so expensive now in Scotland that"
00:36:22,00:36:26,"any of the local areas that rent out the holiday homes, the Airbnb's, the hotels, you can't"
00:36:26,00:36:29,afford to go and sit by the lock anymore.
00:36:29,00:36:30,>> That's terrible.
00:36:30,00:36:31,">> And so as a result, yeah."
00:36:31,00:36:39,>> But the good news is you have as good a chance of finding it if you just stay at home.
00:36:39,00:36:47,">> Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:36:47,00:36:53,">> Okay, my fact this week is that some whales communicate by wobbling their melons."
00:36:53,00:36:55,">> Oi, oi."
00:36:55,00:36:56,>> That's funny.
00:36:56,00:37:03,>> A skill exclusive to them and definitely does not occur with Loch Ness monsters.
00:37:03,00:37:06,"So these are belugas, and there's a picture on the screen."
00:37:06,00:37:07,>> Beluga.
00:37:07,00:37:08,"The funnest whale to say, I think."
00:37:08,00:37:09,>> Is it?
00:37:09,00:37:10,">> Oh, come on."
00:37:10,00:37:11,What's funnest?
00:37:11,00:37:12,Beluga.
00:37:12,00:37:13,Sperm.
00:37:13,00:37:14,>> Okay.
00:37:14,00:37:15,>> That is a good one.
00:37:15,00:37:16,>> That's a fun one to say.
00:37:16,00:37:23,>> We shouldn't spend the rest of this listing whale to say.
00:37:23,00:37:30,">> So they're white whales, they get the name from the Russian for white."
00:37:30,00:37:37,They have this kind of muscly bit of fat on the top of their head and they can contract
00:37:37,00:37:42,"it and move it around, and we didn't really know why they were doing this, but a recent"
00:37:42,00:37:46,study from the University of Rhode Island has found that they do it 34 times more often
00:37:46,00:37:50,during social interactions than they do otherwise.
00:37:50,00:37:52,So we think that they're communicating with each other.
00:37:52,00:37:53,>> Right.
00:37:53,00:37:54,>> I think that makes it.
00:37:54,00:37:59,"It's like an interior hat they've got that they can kind of tip to a lady, and they've"
00:37:59,00:38:00,got all these moves.
00:38:00,00:38:03,"They can squish it up, and they can flatten it down, and they can move it round to the"
00:38:03,00:38:04,side.
00:38:04,00:38:05,>> It's crazy.
00:38:05,00:38:07,">> They've got five moves, haven't they?"
00:38:07,00:38:08,>> Which is good.
00:38:08,00:38:10,>> They can ripple it back and forth.
00:38:10,00:38:11,>> Really?
00:38:11,00:38:12,>> It's insane.
00:38:12,00:38:13,>> Have you seen a video?
00:38:13,00:38:14,>> I've seen a video.
00:38:14,00:38:15,">> Wow, so literally like a wave pool."
00:38:15,00:38:16,>> Yeah.
00:38:16,00:38:17,>> Wow.
00:38:17,00:38:18,>> It's brilliant.
00:38:18,00:38:19,What are they saying?
00:38:19,00:38:20,>> I don't know.
00:38:20,00:38:21,>> Nobody knows.
00:38:21,00:38:25,">> When they use them most often, and the shake, as in the wobble I guess, seems to be mostly"
00:38:25,00:38:28,male towards females during courtship.
00:38:28,00:38:33,"And I think then two of them, so there's flat lift, press, push, and shake."
00:38:33,00:38:38,"I think a couple of them are more playful, and then push is maybe a bit more aggro."
00:38:38,00:38:41,So it's like having a language with only five words.
00:38:41,00:38:42,>> Okay.
00:38:42,00:38:43,Why haven't we worked out what those five words are then?
00:38:43,00:38:46,>> We only just figured out they do it.
00:38:46,00:38:47,Give them a chance.
00:38:47,00:38:48,>> Okay.
00:38:48,00:38:49,Apologies to the marine biologists.
00:38:49,00:38:52,They're the only whales that can nod.
00:38:52,00:38:53,I really like that.
00:38:53,00:38:54,>> Really?
00:38:54,00:38:55,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:38:55,00:38:59,"All the other whales have got like fused necks, but they can go, uh-huh, to the hat to the"
00:38:59,00:39:00,leg area.
00:39:00,00:39:01,Yeah.
00:39:01,00:39:05,">> I couldn't work out if that fused neck thing meant, because we have unfused necks."
00:39:05,00:39:06,>> Yes.
00:39:06,00:39:09,"I've vertebrae, and mostly they've got bits in between them, meaning we can wiggle our"
00:39:09,00:39:10,neck around.
00:39:10,00:39:11,>> Yeah.
00:39:11,00:39:15,I was trying to work out if that meant a beluga could look to one side while you were swimming
00:39:15,00:39:16,along next to it.
00:39:16,00:39:17,And I don't know how far they can move their heads.
00:39:17,00:39:18,">> It's a great question, but I think not."
00:39:18,00:39:19,>> Okay.
00:39:19,00:39:20,Okay.
00:39:20,00:39:22,"So they are the most, they're the cats of the ocean, basically."
00:39:22,00:39:24,They're the most flexible whales there are.
00:39:24,00:39:25,>> Yeah.
00:39:25,00:39:27,">> They're also, they're nicknamed sea canaries, which I love."
00:39:27,00:39:28,">> Oh, yes."
00:39:28,00:39:29,Because they can make all sorts of noise.
00:39:29,00:39:33,They can whistle and sing and moo and click and squeal and --
00:39:33,00:39:34,>> And speak.
00:39:34,00:39:35,>> Speak.
00:39:35,00:39:36,>> Speak human words.
00:39:36,00:39:37,>> What do they know?
00:39:37,00:39:38,>> Yeah.
00:39:38,00:39:44,"So there was a beluga whale called Nosey, and Nosey had been part of like the army was"
00:39:44,00:39:48,"kind of training him and stuff like that, because there is a bit of that that goes on"
00:39:48,00:39:50,with the U.S. and with Russia or the Soviets.
00:39:50,00:39:55,"And one time there was a Navy diver and he was underwater and someone said, ""Get out!"""
00:39:55,00:39:58,"And he got out and he said, ""Who said that?"""
00:39:58,00:40:02,"And it turned out none of the humans had said it, but this beluga whale had said it."
00:40:02,00:40:03,>> Really?
00:40:03,00:40:05,>> What are you talking about?
00:40:05,00:40:07,">> It's true, honestly."
00:40:07,00:40:08,And there was --
00:40:08,00:40:09,>> You got down's notes.
00:40:09,00:40:10,>> No.
00:40:10,00:40:14,"In 2012, there was a paper called Spontaneous Human Speech Mimicry in a Citation, which"
00:40:14,00:40:17,was about this particular beluga whale.
00:40:17,00:40:21,And we have actual evidence of it making sounds that are a bit like human voices.
00:40:21,00:40:22,">> Yeah, right."
00:40:22,00:40:24,">> So it's a bit like a parrot might copy you, that kind of thing."
00:40:24,00:40:25,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:40:25,00:40:27,Do you know where a lot of this studying is going on of these belugas?
00:40:27,00:40:29,">> In the water, isn't it?"
00:40:29,00:40:34,">> Yes, in the water, but obviously you need them contained and you need to be studying"
00:40:34,00:40:35,"them, right?"
00:40:35,00:40:36,So there is --
00:40:36,00:40:37,">> It's so suspicious of what you're going to say, Dan."
00:40:37,00:40:40,>> It's called the Mystic Aquarium.
00:40:40,00:40:42,>> And where is it?
00:40:42,00:40:43,>> In a village called Mystic.
00:40:43,00:40:44,>> Okay.
00:40:44,00:40:47,">> In Connecticut, yeah."
00:40:47,00:40:48,>> That's brilliant.
00:40:48,00:40:51,">> So annoying, because I thought that whole thing, that maybe they were looking into telepathy"
00:40:51,00:40:55,"or something like that, but actually it's just -- it's the town called Mystic."
00:40:55,00:40:57,">> Well, who named the town?"
00:40:57,00:40:58,">> Oh, it's Summer."
00:40:58,00:40:59,>> The whales.
00:40:59,00:41:00,>> Oh.
00:41:00,00:41:01,>> No.
00:41:01,00:41:02,>> Okay.
00:41:02,00:41:05,">> Don't encourage it, Andy."
00:41:05,00:41:06,>> They're amazing.
00:41:06,00:41:07,They're amazing things.
00:41:07,00:41:08,>> Yeah.
00:41:08,00:41:09,>> They're really beautiful.
00:41:09,00:41:13,So they live in the Arctic and then they come down during the summer months and they feed
00:41:13,00:41:16,"and breed and then they go back up, I think, during the winter months."
00:41:16,00:41:21,"And the whole thing about a beluga is that they don't have a dorsal fin on their back,"
00:41:21,00:41:22,right?
00:41:22,00:41:26,"They don't have a poppy-uppy fin that, say, a killer whale does, and killer whales prey"
00:41:26,00:41:27,on belugas.
00:41:27,00:41:32,"They love to eat them, and part of the reason that the beluga is able to avoid the killer"
00:41:32,00:41:35,whale is that they live under the sea ice in the Arctic.
00:41:35,00:41:41,"So the sea ice is a really important environment for them, even if it's 96% sea ice and there"
00:41:41,00:41:46,are these tiny cracks in the ice where there's sort of air above it.
00:41:46,00:41:49,They can approach that crack and they can stick their back up so their blowhole finds
00:41:49,00:41:50,that crack perfectly.
00:41:50,00:41:51,>> Ah.
00:41:51,00:41:52,>> They can breathe.
00:41:52,00:41:53,">> Oh, wow."
00:41:53,00:41:54,>> Because they're mammals and they have to breathe there.
00:41:54,00:41:55,>> Exactly.
00:41:55,00:42:00,"And so that's how they avoid orcas, because the orcas can't follow, because the orcas"
00:42:00,00:42:04,can't risk getting their fin stuck in sea ice and they can't be under sea ice that long.
00:42:04,00:42:07,>> It's kind of like hiding -- I'm trying to work out -- it's like hiding from a really
00:42:07,00:42:12,"tall person in a short -- in a small -- in a low-roofed room, isn't it?"
00:42:12,00:42:15,"And every time the tall person tries to get in, they hit their head."
00:42:15,00:42:16,"I mean, it is like that."
00:42:16,00:42:19,">> Yeah, but you need to very occasionally pop out of the room for something."
00:42:19,00:42:20,>> Yeah.
00:42:20,00:42:21,>> Yeah.
00:42:21,00:42:22,Yeah.
00:42:22,00:42:23,You have a snorkel leading up to the attic.
00:42:23,00:42:25,>> I don't think it needed a terribly complicated --
00:42:25,00:42:29,>> Just for anyone who didn't understand.
00:42:29,00:42:36,>> The lack of docile fin means that it's quite hard for them to steady themselves in the water.
00:42:36,00:42:38,">> To help that, they have love handles."
00:42:38,00:42:42,"So they have bits of fat on their sides, and, again, they're attached to muscles, and they"
00:42:42,00:42:46,"can move them along their sides, and it helps them to be steady in the water."
00:42:46,00:42:47,">> Yeah, that's pretty amazing."
00:42:47,00:42:52,"And their skin, as well, they go slowly off every year."
00:42:52,00:42:55,"They just -- their skin goes a bit off yellow, and they just look a bit manky."
00:42:55,00:43:02,And so they have to swim to a bunch of rocks and sort of like grating cheese just grate
00:43:02,00:43:03,themselves away.
00:43:03,00:43:07,>> You mean like getting one of those files for your feet?
00:43:07,00:43:08,>> Yeah.
00:43:08,00:43:09,>> A full-body one.
00:43:09,00:43:10,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:43:10,00:43:11,>> Pretty cool idea.
00:43:11,00:43:13,">> 'Cause they go through seasonal malt, but it doesn't just come off, so they have to"
00:43:13,00:43:16,go down and literally just rub themselves against rocks until --
00:43:16,00:43:18,">> It is quite gross, actually."
00:43:18,00:43:21,>> It's like you rubbing yourself against a gravestone.
00:43:21,00:43:22,>> God.
00:43:22,00:43:27,>> How do you know that my thing malts?
00:43:27,00:43:28,">> Oh, God."
00:43:28,00:43:31,">> God, that's a fucking odd sentence."
00:43:31,00:43:34,>> And you call me Barry Penis.
00:43:34,00:43:39,">> No, you're Kanto."
00:43:39,00:43:43,>> I'm Barry Penis.
00:43:43,00:43:46,">> No, I'm Barry Penis."
00:43:46,00:43:49,Fun fact about the film Spartacus.
00:43:49,00:43:55,>> I think we should say that all toothed whales have a melon.
00:43:55,00:44:00,"It's not -- so belugas have the big one that sticks out that they're famous for, but all"
00:44:00,00:44:04,"toothed whales have one, and I think they must be used in communication, 'cause I think"
00:44:04,00:44:09,"it's for -- they obviously echolocate, and it's almost for transmitting their cliques."
00:44:09,00:44:15,"But sperm whales have one as well, but theirs often gets called the junk."
00:44:15,00:44:17,"Actually they have -- it's sort of split into two bits, so they've got their junk, and then"
00:44:17,00:44:20,underneath they've got their sperm-assetti organ.
00:44:20,00:44:24,"And I never knew why they were called sperm whales, and why -- so you know this sperm-assetti"
00:44:24,00:44:28,"organ is the organ that's kind of in their head -- oh, well, it's an organ in their head"
00:44:28,00:44:33,"filled with white liquid, and it's, we believe, for -- yeah, communicating."
00:44:33,00:44:35,>> And they keep that next to their junk.
00:44:35,00:44:37,>> They keep it next to their junk.
00:44:37,00:44:39,>> What is it for?
00:44:39,00:44:40,>> It is like the melon.
00:44:40,00:44:45,"It is the melon, so we think it's for basically transmitting echolocation signals and helping"
00:44:45,00:44:47,to control them as they leave.
00:44:47,00:44:50,">> And it would come back into, like, a chamber where it echoes around, and they can --"
00:44:50,00:44:51,">> Wow, so cool."
00:44:51,00:44:52,>> That's so cool.
00:44:52,00:44:56,>> But the reason they're called sperm whales and the reason it's called sperm-assetti is
00:44:56,00:44:59,"just because when they first found it, everyone thought it was their semen."
00:44:59,00:45:00,>> Really?
00:45:00,00:45:05,>> So whalers in the 19th century cracked open sperm whale heads when there's white stuff
00:45:05,00:45:06,in here.
00:45:06,00:45:09,That must be where they keep their sperm.
00:45:09,00:45:15,">> I was reading a thing, an exciting new idea about belugas, and it's a research paper"
00:45:15,00:45:17,that's been released recently.
00:45:17,00:45:24,It is the idea that belugas could very well be the Loch Ness monster.
00:45:24,00:45:28,"And it's called, ""Could the Loch Ness monster also be the result of Lake River sightings"
00:45:28,00:45:29,"of belugas?"""
00:45:29,00:45:30,And so someone has put forward --
00:45:30,00:45:33,">> That's a very sharp paper when the answer is just, ""No."""
00:45:33,00:45:38,">> Well, they're saying there's a lot of stuff that would be very similar."
00:45:38,00:45:43,"The body length is kind of in a similar length, the two-meter length, the dorsal fin is absent."
00:45:43,00:45:47,"That is a big thing that teeth are present, clearly visible, recognizable."
00:45:47,00:45:49,The paper has a bit that says problems.
00:45:49,00:45:53,"One, geographical location."
00:45:53,00:45:54,That's an issue.
00:45:54,00:45:59,>> You do get belugas off the fjords that are out to the right of the Ness.
00:45:59,00:46:00,They do get them.
00:46:00,00:46:01,>> They go up rivers.
00:46:01,00:46:02,>> Exactly.
00:46:02,00:46:03,>> And they've been found in the Thames and so on.
00:46:03,00:46:06,>> They're slightly salt/freshwater agnostic.
00:46:06,00:46:07,>> Exactly.
00:46:07,00:46:09,>> So could the beluga whale actually be the Loch Ness monster?
00:46:09,00:46:10,>> What do you think?
00:46:10,00:46:11,>> Do you think?
00:46:11,00:46:12,">> Yeah, totally possible."
00:46:12,00:46:16,>> Who peer reviews the papers that you find online?
00:46:16,00:46:21,>> This was published on mysticacquarium.com.
00:46:21,00:46:24,That's such a rare four out of four for you.
00:46:24,00:46:26,>> We normally don't get that.
00:46:26,00:46:29,"Yeah, it's very -- guys, that's impressive."
00:46:29,00:46:33,I heard the booze and that's -- I appreciate that.
00:46:33,00:46:35,"We are going to have to wrap up fairly soon, guys."
00:46:35,00:46:36,Any more beluga?
00:46:36,00:46:42,">> Well, just what does a beluga have in common with a blonde in a joke that's offensive"
00:46:42,00:46:44,to blonde people?
00:46:44,00:46:51,>> Do you remember that joke that's like there's a blonde with headphones on all the time?
00:46:51,00:46:55,"I don't approve of this, by the way, if you're blonde, but headphones on all the time and"
00:46:55,00:46:56,everyone's like why are you wearing headphones?
00:46:56,00:46:57,Why are you wearing headphones?
00:46:57,00:47:00,And eventually someone takes the headphones off and she dies.
00:47:00,00:47:02,What was the -- what were the headphones saying?
00:47:02,00:47:05,>> It's saying remember to breathe in and out.
00:47:05,00:47:11,">> Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, but beluga whales need the headphones."
00:47:11,00:47:15,"In fact, all whales, they need -- breathing is not an unconscious thing."
00:47:15,00:47:18,"They actually need to remember to breathe, not just to go to the top to breathe, which"
00:47:18,00:47:21,"they do need to do, but if they don't actually tell themselves to breathe every time they"
00:47:21,00:47:23,"do it, they just stop breathing and die."
00:47:23,00:47:24,>> What?
00:47:24,00:47:25,>> Yeah.
00:47:25,00:47:27,>> But is it genuinely a problem?
00:47:27,00:47:30,">> No, sometimes it happens in aquariums where they think they just decide that they've"
00:47:30,00:47:33,had it and you can just stop breathing.
00:47:33,00:47:34,">> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:34,00:47:36,">> It's so good to end on a fun one, isn't it?"
00:47:36,00:47:37,It's so good to end on a fun one.
00:47:37,00:47:39,>> I think whale suicide is going to be a good punch now.
00:47:39,00:47:43,">> I think whales, like populations, getting a bit better, right, isn't it?"
00:47:43,00:47:47,The whaling has gotten less and less as the years have gone on.
00:47:47,00:47:50,We have more whales now than we've had in recent years.
00:47:50,00:47:55,"And the thing is, when they're more sort of spread out, they find each other formating"
00:47:55,00:48:00,"by singing, and now that there's more of them, they actually do less singing and they kind"
00:48:00,00:48:03,of fight each other a lot more.
00:48:03,00:48:09,So that means that whales are whaling less due to less whaling.
00:48:09,00:48:11,>> Very nice.
00:48:11,00:48:14,>> Very nice.
00:48:14,00:48:21,">> Guys, I'm going to have to wrap us up."
00:48:21,00:48:22,That is it.
