00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 - Hello, welcome to another episode of Drop As A Line, the bit of clubfish where we hear

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 from you with your questions, concerns, comments, corrections, jokes we didn't think of in the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.780
 main version of the show, a couple of those coming up. Right, I want to introduce a new

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.060
 section actually this time to Drop As A Line. It's called Get Yourself Off The Hook and

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.120
 it's on the fish-based pun where if there's a correction or something then you have a

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.480
 chance to get yourself off the hook. - You could call it goth, get off the hook and then

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.400
 we can dress up in emo costumes. - Yeah, perfect.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.400
 - Are we dressing up as goths just for the segment and then there's a costume change

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.520
 for the rest of the show? - That's what I'm thinking.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.800
 - I like it, I'm in. - Okay, actually this is another new bit I'm introducing.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.280
 - Hang on. - Jesus Christ. So Andy, is this going to be any substance or all format this

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.880
 show? - It's going to be pure format, 100% procedural.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.440
 - Right, come on then Andy. - Okay, come on.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.720
 - We've got some really good stuff. So number one, this is a potential correction, Get Yourself

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.940
 Off The Hook. This is from someone called Doug Slokum. I've just listened to your latest

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.180
 podcast, great as always, but I did notice two factual errors in the episode. Okay, one

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.540
 of them I think is mine. First, you joke that Lassie, as the name implies, is female. In

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.440
 fact, all nine dogs to play the character were male.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.500
 - Okay, and the character herself was? - Female.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.400
 - Right, so that's us right off the hook. - Well I assume, I might be wrong, but I also

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.680
 assume that the character was female, but she was played by males because that's what

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.120
 Hollywood was like in those days. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.660
 - Every film before the 1970s actually, all the women played by men.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.160
 - Catherine Hepburn was an incredible man. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, okay, well we're

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.840
 off the hook immediately on that one. This next one is going to be a little bit harder

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.360
 to wriggle, I think. Secondly, you joked that Fred from Scooby-Doo, if you remember this

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.240
 bit, I'm looking at you, James, had a red Ascot scarf and would therefore be signalling

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.560
 that he was into fisting in the handkerchief code of late '70s, '80s gay culture. Fred's

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.720
 Ascot was actually orange, so he would be into anything goes.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.780
 - All right, you see this? This is the problem that I came up with, is that I'm actually

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.660
 colour blind? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, okay, so here's another thing. Right, we did an

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.660
 audience facts section, which has been a complete disaster in terms of fact checking. We have

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.780
 had a lot of corrections on other people's facts.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.500
 - Should we not bring all those people in here for addressing down?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.260
 - There honestly isn't room in this room, which would fit about 30 people in it for all the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.000
 corrections we've had. Huge amount of correspondence about Thomas the Testicle.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 - Yes.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 - Like massive match-ups.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.440
 - Yeah, my DMs have been going nuts with Thomas the Testicle chat.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.240
 - So just to quickly recap, we said that--

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.640
 - That was cartoon, was it?

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.840
 - Jesus had a disciple called Thomas the Testicle because of his name. So I'm just going to

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.320
 read out one of the messages we've got, because there are dozens, and this is from Anand Viswanthanan,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.360
 who's a surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, and expressed it in the pithiest way. So just

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.300
 a quick note if you are listening, if you do want to send in a correction, express it

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.260
 pithily in case more than one person has made the correction. So here we go. Your informant

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:30.400
 is referring to Thomas Didimus, aka doubting Thomas. Didimus here means "twin", although

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.780
 it's also an archaic word for "testis". The plums are twins after all, in a way, and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.220
 the epididimus is still a respectable part of human anatomy. However, this etymology

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.720
 for the disciple is a bit of a stretch, and quite a painful one. There we go. It's actually

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.940
 Thomas the Twin, maybe because he looked like Jesus, maybe something else, but it's not

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.940
 Thomas the Testicle.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.040
 - But he would have been bullied at school with that name, which actually technically

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.560
 also can mean "pair of testicles", as well as twins, right?

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.640
 - Is that what it means? Does epididimus mean "pair of testicles"?

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.240
 - No, the epidimus is a pipe that links one thing to the other inside.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.160
 - So the guy who messaged me, if you remember on the night, it was a DM that I got, and he

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.100
 said "more to come", if you want, and I said "yes please", so we went on stage at 7.30,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.980
 I wasn't able to check my messages again. Poor guy had messaged me with a full explanation

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.060
 by 8pm while we were on stage, yeah. So he messaged saying "thanks for using my fact",

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.500
 but also, you know, cheers for making me sound like a weirdo, and a lot of people came to

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.500
 his defence.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.900
 - Yeah, because poor him, I think we said on stage on the day, "that's definitely not

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.640
 true, sounds like absolute rubbish", and this guy has sent, well no, because he sent a big

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.420
 explanation in. We just haven't read it. Who's this on?

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.980
 - I think Dan's friend, perhaps, shouldn't have just sent a message with a headline with

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.900
 some clickbait, he should have sent the whole fact.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.860
 - There we go, yeah, exactly. In future, send me the full thing, just in case I'm on stage.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.900
 - You're not going to read it, Dan, are you? That's to be honest. You never read more than

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.900
 a headline in anything.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.300
 - Exactly, that's true.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.860
 - I think no blame for that one.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.420
 - Okay, well, some blame, because I've received seven emails about Thomas the Testicle.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.340
 - John Pertwee, no, not the former Doctor Who.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.340
 - Oh, oh.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.060
 - If you thought he was genuinely getting in touch, I can't believe your reaction wasn't

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.800
 more than, huh, all right.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:28.920
 - So, John Pertwee died in 1996, so it's almost certainly not him. Hang on, he's a time lord.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.280
 John Pertwee, so possibly that one after all, says, "I can't believe you repeated the Urban

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.300
 Legend about flushing toilets after 10 p.m. here in Switzerland."

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.300
 - How interesting.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.140
 - Which I think we quote an audience member who sent the fact saying it's illegal. "There

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.540
 is no such law. I've been living here in Valle for 20 years. I promise you, if the law existed,

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.280
 I'd have been arrested many times."

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.200
 - Yeah, because actually the week afterwards, I went to Switzerland and inadvertently flushed

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.040
 the toilet after 10 o'clock, and as soon as I did it, I shit myself, because I'm like,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.540
 "Oh, no, that is illegal."

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.380
 - And then you have to flush it again.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.960
 - But then I thought, well, no one's gonna know, 'cause we're in like a little kind

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.220
 of chalet which wasn't near other places, but then I thought, what if they have sensors

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.220
 in the sewers?

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.220
 - They must do.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.460
 - 'Cause that's possible, right?

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.460
 - Yeah.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.060
 - They have sensors in the sewers, and whenever someone flushes, they might be able to tell

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.060
 where it comes from.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.500
 - Of course they'll be able to, 'cause they'll have DNA evidence linking you to--

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.580
 - How high do you think Swiss people's taxes are? They're paying for sensors in everyone's

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.580
 tax person.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.260
 - They're very high. It's a very big government kind of place.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.260
 - Yeah.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.660
 - Okay, well, it's all going towards these special flush sensors.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.660
 - Yeah.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.860
 - Well, anyway, I was worried about that, and in the end, no policeman knocked on my door.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.980
 - I'd love if they collected it and just returned it to you.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.700
 I believe this is yours.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.700
 - Please.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.420
 - This was flushed at 10 o' one.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:56.780
 - Maybe you can wait until 6 a.m. before you flush that again, 'cause it'd be so obvious

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:04.260
 in the underground cathedral vault space of the sewers. You'd see one solitary poop floating

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.660
 towards the processing center.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.500
 - Little Union Jack in it. This is one of those tourists.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.220
 - That's weird, 'cause they were Swiss, weren't they, that person?

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.620
 - Yeah, that person was there. And also, when I was in Switzerland, I was told by the owner

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.580
 of the Airbnb that after 10 o'clock, I wasn't allowed to make any extraneous noise.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.580
 - Oh.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.580
 - Are you really?

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.820
 - Yeah. Genuinely, they said that's the rules.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.820
 - Wow.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.900
 - I guess it just doesn't qualify as extraneous noise.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.740
 - Was she one of the people that we invited onto stage? I think she won, almost. I feel

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.020
 like I want to say she won. We're gonna have to revoke.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.020
 - Very troubling.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.020
 - After a step of pride.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:48.900
 - If you're listening, please send back the comically tiny trophy that we gave you.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.340
 - We've got a good... Just to give us a break for all the corrections, so I'm afraid there

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.460
 are a few more of those to come. We've got a "You were right."

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.060
 thing. And this was about an audience...

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.660
 - What? We can't do "You were right" facts.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:07.460
 - Well, no, it's because... So this got sent to us as a fact, right? And we had pointed

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.740
 out that this had been denied by one of the people involved in it. But actually, this

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.780
 is someone getting in touch to say, "No, the denial is wrong. You were right." I'll explain.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.140
 So this is sent by Patrick from Morrison's. Okay?

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.300
 - Works in Morrison's. Sorry. Oh, he sent an email while he was in Morrison's.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.420
 - Works in Morrison's. I was just listening to the podcast.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.580
 As one does. I like that. And when Morrison's "Turning off the beeps in store following

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:36.500
 the Queen's death was discussed, I was astonished to hear they denied it, particularly as I

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.540
 work in a Morrison's." And that's precisely what happened. So we said... Oh, we've been

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.020
 told that Morrison's turned off the beeps all the checkouts, but Morrison's have said

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.420
 they didn't. They just turned them down.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.980
 - Yeah, absolutely. Well, they said that they just turned them down, yeah.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:55.180
 - It made me angrier than I know how to rationally explain, as I despise working there.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.780
 But they turned off music, beeps on checkouts, self-scanner otherwise, and likewise not only

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.640
 banned the use of the Tanoi system, but unplugged it and kept it in the manager's office, lest

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.460
 anyone was tempted to put out a rogue Tanoi calling Queen Elizabeth to check out, I suppose.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.460
 - That's awesome. More of that.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.460
 - More of that.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.340
 - What's Morrison's playing at? Oh, we didn't do it. We did. Just come out and admit it.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.340
 It's not that big a deal.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.340
 - Just own it.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.340
 - Yeah.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.580
 - I'm not sure where legally we stand now in relation to Morrison's.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.900
 - Well, I'd just like to say that all supermarkets are terrible. Does that balance it?

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.180
 - I think that does that, correct.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Joke we missed.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.500
 - Oh, yeah.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.500
 - Great.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.940
 - I've been meaning to write for a while that I loved the pez and pedant segment from several

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:42.380
 weeks ago. This is from Amusing Fool, by the way. But what finally got me to write was

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.620
 Proust rubbing a chicken? Do you remember we said that Proust woke up a violinist in the

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.620
 middle of the night?

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.620
 - Yeah, four, in fact.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.620
 - And he was called Poulet, the violinist.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.620
 - Yeah.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.620
 - Yeah.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.620
 - Did we not meant to... Okay.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.620
 - No, I don't think we made the connection between rubbing a chicken, which we refer to

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.340
 a lot in that podcast, and Proust.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.340
 - That's a Poulet.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.620
 - I did it in my head, I must say, but just decided not to say it on the day.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.020
 - I think I did it in my head, but couldn't think of anything to say that was remotely

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.020
 clever or funny.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.860
 - Dan, did you think of it in your head, but also just not make the joke at the time?

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.060
 - No, I don't even get the joke that's being made right now. I thought you were referencing

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.060
 that you...

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.060
 - Poulet is French for chicken.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.060
 - Cool.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.900
 - Proust was kind of rubbing a chicken.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.300
 - I should also say that quite regularly when people message us saying you forgot this joke,

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.340
 one of us did make it and I decided to cut it out. That does happen quite often.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.340
 - Yes.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:34.100
 - If James didn't say it, it will not be in the show, or it will, and he hasn't said

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.100
 it.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.060
 - We've been pinnino'd on one thing.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.060
 - Oh, yeah.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.740
 - Episode 371. This is actually a typographical correction rather, I think we said.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.260
 - 371, we're up to 460 something at the moment, right?

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.460
 - Yes, this is a mere two years ago.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:54.660
 - I do feel like maybe we should have a statute of limitations for these corrections.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:11:02.180
 - Episode 371, no such thing as a welcome lasagne. I fully expected the fact to be that there

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.580
 is no such thing as a welcome lasagne because it is grammatically incorrect. This is from

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.780
 Chiara, by the way, who I think might know a way around the Italian language.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.420
 - I was just going to say though, did we say that there is a such thing as that, or did

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.900
 we say there's no such thing as that?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.660
 - I think we said no such thing as that.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.660
 - That's fine then.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.100
 - But not for the reason she identifies.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.620
 - I don't like this new segment. I don't like Off the Hook.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:28.980
 - LaSagne is the plural of LaSagne, yeah. I was especially surprised that James Pinino

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:33.660
 Harkin would have overlooked this, Chiara says. She follows up with some kind words about

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.980
 the show, but I think the damage is done.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.220
 - Yeah, it means nothing at that stage.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:42.020
 - It is a mystery, someone pointed out to me. James Pinino Harkin, I've got a new nickname

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.020
 on my Wikipedia.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.020
 - Oh, have you?

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.620
 - And I don't know where it's come from.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:51.340
 - Well, I remember, do you remember on Wikipedia, you were the face of comedy for a while?

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.340
 - I was, yeah.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.100
 - And I think a few jokes were made about people changing people's Wikipedia's, and I wonder

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.020
 if people took those a bit too seriously and did actual changes.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.780
 - Possibly, but usually there's a reference to something that we can grab on to. Here's

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.780
 my new nickname. I am now Daniel Gary Schreiber.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:07.780
 - Oh, okay.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.780
 - I don't remember that.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.580
 - Gary come from, it's not presented as a middle name, it's just in nickname otherwise

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.980
 known as, I used to be Daniel, Dan Schreiber.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.300
 - I have a vague, someone listening to this will know, but I have a vague memory of us

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:26.740
 doing the, the ats at the end of the show and you saying, I'm at Gary.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.740
 - Oh really?

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:32.980
 - Maybe you were talking about the Queen being called Gary by her, by William when he was

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.980
 a kid.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:39.420
 - No, it's coming back to me. It was an experiment and they changed the name of someone in the

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:44.220
 experiment and I said that we should change the name again so that no one would know it

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.700
 and you said, and I'm going to change my name and I'm going to change it to Gary.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.700
 - Brilliant.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.700
 - I can't remember what, yeah.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.700
 - That was within the last two months.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.700
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.700
 - I was like watching Sherlock.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.700
 - That was incredible.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.700
 - That was like being at a sale for me. I'm sensing something's coming.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.620
 - The ghost of John Pertwee is telling me something.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.620
 - James sat forward, his fingers were on his temples, he was waving them about.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.620
 - That was really exciting.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.620
 - That was good.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:13.060
 - The other new procedural point I mentioned quite a while ago now is the "I'm actually

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.300
 of the week" and this is actually just good extra info, so it's not a correction.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.860
 - Okay, that's what we like best.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.020
 - This actually, James makes a good point, that is what we like best. Please do keep those

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.780
 coming in. They don't have to be petty even.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.380
 So this is from Hannah Pilgrim and this is great. It is from something that went out

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.460
 in September 2019, but still, it's brilliant.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:38.180
 - Okay, so Hannah says, she's been listening to old episodes. She made it back to 2019

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:43.660
 and this is no such thing as giving birth up a climbing wall. Episode 285. The question

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.700
 is in reference to the fact that some baseball players will piss on their hands to help them

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.860
 get a better grip on the bat or prevent calluses.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:50.860
 - Yeah.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.300
 - I actually know why this is a thing, Hannah says. It's not to moisturize as was theorized

00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:01.460
 by you all. The uric acid found in urine in it actually breaks down hardened skin cells

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:06.140
 and doing that regularly will prevent calluses from forming. She says, I'm an esthetician

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:11.460
 and nail tech and when people have particularly tough calluses on their feet, no.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.460
 - She pisses on them.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.460
 - No.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.460
 - Oh my God.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.260
 - She's a callus softening spray that contains uric acid and encouraged clients to buy

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.860
 foot creams that contain it as an ingredient. We don't however recommend pissing on your

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.260
 feet to make them softer.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.260
 - But if you did.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:29.020
 - Is she not recommending it because it will put her out of business if this one quick hack

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.020
 was done by everyone?

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.020
 - Yeah.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.780
 - Well, she says, I'm sure getting some on them when you're peeing in the shower wouldn't

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.780
 hurt.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:35.780
 - When you're peeing in the shower?

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:36.780
 - What?

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:37.780
 - What's this person called?

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:38.780
 - Hannah.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:42.220
 - I want full name. What a name and shame. Hannah, who pees in the shower after the age

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.220
 of 10?

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.220
 - Who doesn't pee in the shower?

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.220
 - Wow.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:50.660
 - Well, after a long day of work at Lurrisons, the shower was on at the time.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.660
 - No.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:52.660
 - Yeah.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.660
 - No, no, no, no.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.660
 - It is.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.660
 - Oh my God.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.660
 - I don't think so.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.660
 - Who doesn't pee in the shower? Dan. Dan's keeping very quiet.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:04.360
 - I think that's actually quite gross. I'm always surprised when you go to swimming pools

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.580
 and they have signs up saying, "Please don't we in our showers."

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.500
 - It's not reminded gross. It's slightly easier for a man to pee in the shower.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.740
 - Than what? Than peeing in the loo?

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.780
 - Well, because it goes forwards. Because it goes forwards rather than down your leg.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.540
 - You know you're supposed to take your trousers down when you pee, and that frees up the genitals.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.700
 - I didn't take my trousers down when I do anything. I wear them in the shower, and

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.620
 that'll have a poo in the sink. I'll go back to reception.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.100
 - What do you do in the B-day?

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:38.260
 - I throw up in the B-day. Oh, it's great. I'm banned from David Lloyd, nationwide.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.580
 - I'm B and Q.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.620
 - That's a great hack though, if true.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.620
 - Yeah.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:49.180
 - Dan, I'm sure there's an Aussie saying, "He's the kind of guy who would step out of

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.780
 the shower to take a whiz." Isn't that a...

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.420
 - And it means like, oh, something's a bit soft, you know? A bit prissy.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.420
 - Right.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.220
 - Oh, I'm going to step out of the shower, dry myself, put my trousers on, undo the

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:06.500
 fly, take my pants off, have a pee, get back in the shower.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.500
 - I've never heard that.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.500
 - Really?

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.660
 - The only Aussie friend of mine that has a quirk like that is he'll always have a shower

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.380
 after a poo. Always.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.380
 - Always?

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.380
 - Always.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.380
 - No, impossible.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.380
 - Impossible.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.380
 - But sometimes you can't...

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.380
 - He controls.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.500
 - But he just douches his bum. He can't take all of his clothes out, climb into the shower.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.500
 - Yeah, he has a...

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.500
 - Climb out.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.900
 - If he knows he's going to have a poo, he'll have a shower after this.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.860
 - Do you mean he waits until there's a shower available to him before he'll even have a

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.860
 poo?

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.860
 - Yes, yeah.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:32.860
 - Gosh.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.060
 - Pretty bad for you, holding it in that long.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.060
 - Wow, he's alive.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:40.460
 - Well, quite often your bathroom would have both a toilet and a shower in, so you're likely

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.460
 to be in the same...

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:45.820
 - No, you're likely, but sometimes you won't. Sometimes you're in a cubicle somewhere and

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.820
 there's no shower available.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.820
 - Yeah, public loo.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.820
 - Does he just dip himself in the sink?

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:53.140
 - I go for poos in public loo. I've asked him all the questions. Yeah, I've done this.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.140
 - Wow.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.100
 - Can I ask, did you say she was an esthetist or something?

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.100
 - Esthetician.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.100
 - Esthetician, which I have never heard before.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.140
 - It sounds like someone who goes to sleep in the summer.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.820
 - It's just someone who's into it, who deals with your aesthetic...

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.820
 - It's a skin beautification person.

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:08.820
 - There you go.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:09.820
 - And he deals with all of that.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.820
 - By weeing on you. And it wouldn't put her out of business.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.060
 - It's kind of like... And it says she doesn't... No one's being weed on here.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.060
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.060
 - Well, I think they should stop.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.060
 - You see, it doesn't grow to me else as much as maybe other people.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.900
 But you know, when you're learning guitar in the early days, the calluses you get on

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.660
 your fingers from the strings are so great. If you just had a mug of piss next to you

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.620
 and you just get your fingers in, but it sounds like that would work.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.220
 That sounds like that's a good thing.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.220
 - Don't leave it lying around the house, though.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.580
 Other housemates get pissed off about accidentally drinking for that kind of thing.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.580
 - Very true.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.260
 - Well, thank you, Hannah, for that, which has prompted a lot of debate.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.780
 - Do you pee every time you're in the shower?

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.780
 - No. No, no, not every time. - Okay. Special occasions.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.780
 - If you need a pee, you're in the shower?

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.780
 - Yeah.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.780
 - Wow, I'm being treated like a pariah here.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.780
 - No, exciting revelation. You rarely tell anything personal about your life.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.780
 And then you've come out with that.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.780
 - Anyway, if anyone is, I'm texting someone's Wikipedia.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.780
 - Andy, pee's in the shower.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.780
 - I'm to Murray.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.780
 - Yeah, I'm happy we're Gary, actually.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.780
 - Thank you.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.780
 - Oh, dear.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.780
 - Have we got any more?

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.780
 - Well, there's one more. Let's get one more.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.780
 - There's one more.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.780
 - A great guy called Jeremy Carracken.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.780
 - Carracken?

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:18.780
 - Cool name.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.780
 - Yeah.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.780
 - Who has, we were joking about the non-existence of a particular film,

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.780
 and this guy actually has written that film.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.780
 - Oh.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.780
 - Do you remember when we had Jamie Morton from My Dad Rated Porno on the podcast?

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.780
 - Yeah, and I wasn't there.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.780
 - Hannah, you weren't on this one.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.780
 - No.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.780
 - James, you had a fact that no films tagged on IMDb with certain names had won a Oscar?

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.780
 - Yeah, Double D.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.780
 - So it's breast implants, zombies, and food fights.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.780
 - Food fights, yeah.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.780
 - What was your movie called again?

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.780
 - The Undead Custard Brawl.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.780
 - That's right.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.780
 - OK, Jeremy writes, "Great work as always.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.780
 "My writing partner and I did once write a screenplay about zombies

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.780
 "caused by breast implants taken from corpses."

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.780
 - Oh, really? Interesting.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.780
 - We didn't win an Oscar, he writes, unnecessarily, I would say,

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.780
 but we did win the Hamptons Film Festival screenwriting conference.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.780
 It's a ridiculous piece of nonsense and probably the best thing we ever wrote.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:08.780
 - Wow.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.780
 - There's no food fight in it, though.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:15.780
 So that could be something that could even elevate it to natural award-winning status.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.780
 - And then you're looking at the Oscar.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.780
 So thank you, Jeremy.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.780
 - They haven't made it, have they? They've just written.

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.780
 - He doesn't say whether or not it was made.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.780
 Maybe it's in development.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.780
 - Yeah, possibly.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.780
 - You know what hasn't happened for a while?

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:29.780
 Like a British comedy group making a really lame zombie movie.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.780
 - Yes.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.780
 - That used to happen all the time.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.780
 All I'm saying is we are a UK comedy troupe.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.780
 - When I'm away, guys, please let this be the thing that you do.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.780
 [laughter]

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.780

 and the people in it.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:21.780
