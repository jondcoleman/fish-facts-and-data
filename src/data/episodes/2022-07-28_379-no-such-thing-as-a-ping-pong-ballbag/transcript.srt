00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,800
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,640
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,600
 Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:38,480
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,640
 with fact number one and that's my fact. My fact this week is that firefighters use ping pong balls

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,080
 to put out wildfires. Wow. Do they fire the ping pong balls from enormous ping pong bats?

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,000
 You're thinking here perhaps that the ping pong balls are also enormous are you Andy? Oh yes.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,360
 Or are you thinking that the wind from waving the bat might put out the fire?

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,120
 Well I was thinking of one massive one per wildfire and you just load it up with water

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,520
 and then you drop it on. Oh yeah. Yeah are they filled with water? They're not and I should just

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,360
 clarify for the listener Andy is wrong as well that is not how they do it. What this is in fact is

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,680
 these are little ping pong balls. They call them ping pong balls I couldn't officially find if they

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,880
 were you know taken from a ping pong ball bag but they look exactly the same and they are carried.

15
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,000
 What's a ping pong ball bag? You were laughing at ball bag James I saw it. I wasn't I was laughing

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,120
 at the idea that someone might have invented a specific bag to carry ping pong balls in.

17
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,120
 And that according to Dan's definition nothing is a ping pong ball unless it has been taken

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,400
 out of a ping pong ball bag. You know you're going to your mates he's got a table you've got

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,920
 your bat you've got your balls you've got to bring your balls in a bag so you've got a ball bag for

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,040
 your ping pong balls right? I wouldn't usually bring my own balls. No I've only ever arrived at the

21
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,560
 table and they've been there. I've never I would assume yeah that my friend has got his own balls

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,000
 and basically you have to be such a pro that you think bringing your own balls is going to improve

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 your game by that much. There's different colour balls you're allowed to use different colour

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,960
 balls if your eyes are better for orange balls let's say then the white ball you don't want

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,760
 him getting an advantage. But like James says that does imply you are taking it quite seriously

26
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,880
 it's like bringing your own pool cue to a pub and then if you lose you risk looking like the biggest

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,600
 idiot that's ever walked into that room. I do know Dan that a lot of people have blue green colour

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,520
 blindness do you think a lot of people struggle to see the colour white but can't see the colour

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,000
 orange? Is that not a thing I always thought I had an advantage at ping pong when I brought my

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,320
 orange balls with me. Only if you're playing in the snow. Okay myth dispelled excellent start to the

31
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,640
 show. So when I tell you about the actual fact which is that this is used by wildfire firefighters

32
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,920
 and they fly up in helicopters and the idea is that if there's a massive fire you want to contain

33
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,600
 the fire by fighting the fire with fire and this is a classic thing that firefighters do on the ground

34
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,440
 they have blow torches. The idea is that you burn any surrounding wood brush whatever it is on the

35
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,240
 ground and it means nothing can feed the fire that's trying to escape further out so you contain it.

36
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,360
 So they worked out that if you put ping pong balls up into a helicopter and you injected it with

37
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,520
 different chemicals and you effectively created a bomb in the sky by mixing these chemicals live up

38
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,640
 there you drop them down and by the time they hit the ground they burst into flames and put themselves

39
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,360
 out very quickly so it's a really effective thing. So these chemicals are potassium permanganate and

40
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,880
 glycol and it's basically you put these two chemicals together and they create fire and it's

41
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,800
 a bit like how rocket engines work they have two chemicals and then they go together and they turn

42
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,120
 into flame but potassium permanganate which is the main one in these ping pong balls it's also used

43
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,440
 to kill fungi on your skin so you put it on your skin and it creates oxygen which kills the fungi

44
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,960
 or germs it's used to treat water it's used to keep bananas for longer it's used to age

45
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:18,240
 props in movie sets and it's used to purify cocaine all those different things this one chemical.

46
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,400
 Wow multi-purpose isn't it cool that is very cool it doesn't mean bananas are extremely flammable

47
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,320
 presumably or is it is it washed off or like will you get a banana and it's covered in this stuff

48
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,520
 that if I just hold it the wrong way it will spontaneously combust. It's a slightly different

49
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,320
 thing so it's the oxidization so bananas create ethylene which makes them ripen and actually

50
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,040
 that's why if you put a banana with other fruits it'll make them all ripen really quickly but this

51
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,040
 potassium permanganate will oxidize the ethylene and remove it and so it won't ripen quite as

52
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,960
 quickly. Okay it's really cool in these helicopters they have a ball machine that all the balls are

53
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,640
 sitting in and they already have the potassium permanganate sitting inside it and when they're

54
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,040
 getting ready for release they they head down the ball machine to the end where they're all

55
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,200
 individually injected with the glycol just before they're dropped so it's live bomb making basically.

56
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,960
 Yeah did you guys see the previous method by which they used to do this because there was

57
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,680
 the heli torch which is a helicopter with a hose attached to the bottom of it attached to a 50

58
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,840
 gallon drum of fuel it feels a bit less precise than using the ping pong balls to be honest

59
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,720
 but you do get to be called the burn boss if you are the one flying the helicopter.

60
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,440
 Alright so I'm still slightly confused you drop the balls but then they don't ignite so they ignite

61
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,600
 on impact how come they don't just explode the helicopter? Because it's the chemical reaction

62
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,040
 takes about 20 seconds for it to ignite within the ball so. Oh so you really have to send them

63
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,040
 out really quickly it's like holding a grenade that's been lit. Exactly that's exactly what it

64
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,120
 is it's pulling a pin on a grenade and then you lob them out of the helicopter so they can actually

65
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,000
 go in flames before they've made impact but they fly at such a height that the idea is that once

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,840
 they've landed that's about 20 seconds and then they can light up on the floor. Wow so cool.

67
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,040
 So ping pong balls used to be incredibly flammable anyway there was a change in 2014

68
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,960
 and they were made of celluloids we've talked about celluloid before because it was used in all

69
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,240
 the old cinemas and it was why cinemas kept on setting on fire in the 20s but same with ping

70
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,600
 pong balls and if you go online it says everywhere that back in the olden days ping pong balls used

71
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,560
 to just explode into flame mid-match because of the heat of the friction and everywhere says this

72
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,280
 and it is possible if you get it hot enough because it is very very flammable and I haven't

73
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,240
 found a single piece of evidence of a single table tennis match where any ball is exploded into flames.

74
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,960
 You'd have to hit it pretty hard. I didn't know about this thing they used to have in ping pong

75
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,440
 which has now been banned speed glue. Had you guys heard of this? Speed glue no. No speed glue is a

76
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,480
 special glue that you use on your paddle you glue the rubber on with a special glue about half an

77
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,560
 hour before the match begins and that soaks into the layer of sponge between the rubber and the

78
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,480
 blade and what it does is it makes the racket way more elastic than it normally is because the

79
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,320
 rubber cells expand in contact with this glue and it stretches out so it's like a trampoline for the

80
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,760
 ping pong ball every single shot you play and it is incredibly effective at making you much

81
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,960
 much better at table tennis and it's been banned by the Olympics. 2008 was the last time speed glue

82
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,880
 was allowed and they now have to have official paddle controllers at the Olympics to to check if

83
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,720
 anyone's doped their paddle. Yeah that's really interesting. It's weird because you'd think the

84
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,960
 opposite if you put glue on your bat you'd think it would be like one of those velcro and ball games

85
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,040
 you play at the beach where it would just stick to your bat a few times. If you put it on the wrong

86
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,280
 side yeah it's very easy to detect stupid speed glue dopers if they get the side wrong. Have you

87
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,120
 guys passed? There's a place in Holborn I remember walking past it once and I was just looking at the

88
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,280
 wall and London is full of blue plaques which tell you about its history and up there on the wall it

89
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:13,440
 says that this is where ping pong was invented and patented in I believe 1901. Yeah it's where there's

90
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,760
 there's a table tennis club there now isn't there called bounce I think it's on that.

91
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,760
 Yeah so like where it supposedly was invented is still where you go to play it but I couldn't

92
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,640
 I just couldn't find anything online to verify that including bounce's own website which seems to

93
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,680
 have no interest in this remarkable bit of history that has got connected to it. To be

94
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,560
 fair to bounce it's not a museum its aim isn't to tell you the history of ping pong it's really a

95
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,320
 place you go to play fun games it's you don't go to a you know a bowling alley and expect the

96
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,960
 history of bowling do you? But if it was the home of bowling if it was the site of Neolithic bowling

97
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,800
 it would be remiss of them not to use that as part of their publicity materials apart from

98
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,000
 anything else. Yeah you're right that's why they should employ us for all of their PR. This is a

99
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,040
 global game there should be a mecca of a location for I saw a book that was called Everything You

100
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,600
 Know Is Pong and it was claiming that ping pong is the most widespread of all the sports the most

101
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,400
 important sport that we have. I mean you know the guy was biased he was trying to sell a book on

102
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,400
 ping pong obviously he went for that line but I don't know it's you know historically an amazing

103
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,440
 location. Yeah. Just me okay well that's why I have a ball bag and you guys don't.

104
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,280
 So I was reading about 30s table tennis and there used to be a thing allowed called finger spin

105
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,360
 which is basically you could as it sounds spin the ball with your finger that was allowed. Was

106
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,400
 that before the rally started or you couldn't like catch the ball and then spin it could you?

107
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,280
 No as you were serving you could spin the ball and it basically meant you could have an impossible

108
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:56,160
 to return serve and the game became pointless and they had to universally ban that in 1937

109
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,480
 but then there are other changes as well so for example this is from Britannica

110
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,640
 they report that slow or defensive play used to be hugely popular in the field of ping pong

111
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,400
 and really you're just sitting back waiting for your opponent to make a mistake but I'm quoting

112
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:16,000
 directly here slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that at the 1936 world

113
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,520
 championships in Prague an hour was needed to decide a single point. Imagine being in the

114
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,320
 audience for that match. Imagine the neckache of looking one side then the other then the other.

115
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,760
 Do you know how many hits it was Andy because a couple of weeks ago we mentioned the longest

116
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,000
 tennis rally of all time which was I don't know how many hits it was but I think the longest

117
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,520
 tennis rally was about half an hour wasn't it? It was in 29 minutes was it? Yeah so this is twice

118
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,440
 as long and table tennis is a fast sport so I think this might smash that record. Well it sounds

119
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,440
 like in this case maybe not it may have been only 10 hits they just put it really really high.

120
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,520
 It just got stuck in the rafters at one stage so it'll come down eventually.

121
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,240
 That was that match where the glue went on the wrong side of the paddles wasn't it?

122
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:11,120
 Okay it is time for fact number two and that is Andy. My fact is that it takes eight people to

123
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:21,120
 do an ultrasound on a python. Which one's that? Is it Erich Eider? So this is a story that happened

124
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,680
 at Chester Zoo in 2012 and it was on an extremely big python so maybe with some smaller pythons

125
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,160
 it'll take fewer people maybe with some especially wriggly ones it'll take more but this is a good

126
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,120
 kind of rule of thumb for how long it takes. It was a snake called barley a python reticulated

127
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,080
 python which is I think the longest kind in the world and barley at the time was reputed to

128
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:48,400
 be the biggest snake in Europe so pretty exciting. Needed a health check up and she was 6.6 meters

129
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,400
 long and as a result they needed eight handlers to move her because she weighed 90 kilos and

130
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:01,040
 has the capacity for aggression unsurprisingly and there are these great photos of them moving

131
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,680
 the snake all in a big conga line I guess and they've got her head in a tube it's very funny

132
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,560
 it's um to keep the snake calm you just put the head in a big old tube and then that stops it.

133
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,520
 I also saw another one in Chester Zoo there was another snake called JF and they instead

134
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,480
 of putting the head in a tube they covered their eyes with someone's hands so one of the in this

135
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,000
 case it was 10 people one of them covered their eyes with the hand eight of them held the snake on

136
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,200
 the table and there was a little hole in the bottom of the table and the 10th person was hiding under

137
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,240
 the table with the ultrasound and they kind of shoved it up the hole so you could see on the

138
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,080
 inside of the snake. Did they need to hold the snake down while they're doing it? It's not just

139
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,000
 for carrying them. Yeah most of the people are there to stop it from wriggling away. Wow because

140
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,720
 they're strong aren't they they're basically just muscle. They are strong I would not want that gig

141
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,520
 holding my hand in front of the eyes of a snake that close with your hand right out next to its

142
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,520
 mouth is madness it would bite you. No reticulated pythons they're not venomous it's the person

143
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,800
 who's going to get squeezed who's in trouble. But it is maybe worth it because you are obviously

144
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:14,080
 the eight coolest people in the zoo. Oh okay cool as a snake what's is that the ultrasound guys.

145
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,320
 I don't think any of us was with you there. No I reckon how many listeners will we have at this

146
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,360
 episode of million people. I reckon of the million people who listened to this episode possibly

147
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,280
 up 12 would have got that joke. Yeah yeah right in if you got the ultrasound joke because

148
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,520
 we are confident enough that we won't have a bulging post bay resulting from that gig.

149
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,080
 I reckon there was more people with me saying cool as a snake and that's not even a thing.

150
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:50,000
 So many scientists have done bizarre experiments to try and work out the secrets of snake anatomy

151
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,320
 because they are very confusing animals. So boa constrictors which are the squeezers they're the

152
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,240
 ones who wrap themselves around their prey. Scientists wanted to work out how long they

153
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,600
 squeeze for and why to work out their behavior in the wild and they did this by such a grisly

154
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,480
 experiment. They put fake beating hearts into dead rats but dead rats that were still warm

155
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,360
 so that the boa constrictor would think oh prey and they measured how long the boa constrictor

156
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,840
 squeezed for so they normally squeeze for 20 minutes which is quite long very long time actually

157
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,160
 and but when the scientists shut off the fake hearts after 10 minutes they stopped squeezing

158
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,760
 soon after that they thought oh it's safe so that's how we know that boas are measuring the heart rate

159
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,280
 of their prey as they squeeze. Interesting so they don't kill you by squeezing all the air out of

160
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,680
 you they kill you by giving you a heart attack is that right? Yeah yeah yeah rough. I read a

161
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,520
 really interesting thing about snakes that I didn't know which is that they effectively

162
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,600
 wear contact lenses nature's contact lenses not prescription and we know this because obviously

163
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,560
 we've studied snakes but a really interesting thing happens to all snakes as a result of this

164
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,200
 little cap that sits over their eye it's a sort of they don't have eyelids so it's a sort of protective

165
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:15,680
 cap translucent most snakes in the wild are brown eyed yellow eyed a few are blue eyed but at some

166
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,680
 point all snakes go blue eyed and it's part of the shedding process when the snake is shedding its

167
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,560
 skin it goes through different phases and there's a phase that's known as the blue phase and the blue

168
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,840
 phase is when milky fluid builds up underneath the old skin to allow it to slip off and as the

169
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,520
 eyes are a part of that the eyes have scales so these ocular scales that sit there they fill up

170
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:44,160
 with this milky blue and suddenly every snake at one point just has these crazy completely blue eyes

171
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,360
 so if you see a snake with completely blue eyes it's about to shed all of its skin that's the

172
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,560
 stage just before it all comes off. That's really interesting because I did the white workshop on

173
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,520
 radio two with Zoe Boll last week I think with Alex Bell and he was talking about this as well

174
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,600
 just by coincidence and he said that they like they get these milky eyes but also the skin just

175
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,040
 starts to feel loose around them so if you can imagine like suddenly all your clothes got 10%

176
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,320
 bigger or something you just kind of feel like you're in the wrong kind of skin and that's how

177
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,120
 you know it's time to slither out and you slither out of it Alex was saying it's like if you have

178
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,720
 a sock on and you wiggle your foot until the sock comes off and you drag your fuck backwards out of

179
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,040
 it I usually just pull them off with my hands I suppose they didn't have that luxury well snake

180
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,560
 well that's very insensitive to say to a snake because they don't have that option.

181
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,760
 Pythons which this this fact was about they eat a giant prey as we've discussed before and their

182
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:48,080
 metabolisms do extraordinary things to digest it but they have a very special way to avoid choking

183
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,920
 because the danger is that when you're eating something massive it'll just block your windpipe

184
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,160
 so some pythons just blob their trachea out of the corner of their mouth they vomit up their

185
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,720
 windpipe essentially and it hangs out of the corner of their mouth so that they can eat oh my god

186
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,680
 so and they can carry on breathing yeah because their breath height is outside of their body

187
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:14,320
 exactly very sensible so nothing ever goes down the wrong way basically if you can do that yeah

188
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,640
 yeah just don't leave it on a peanut that's lying on the floor or something yeah exactly

189
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,360
 like a worm could crawl up there or something right that's true I guess that's one good reason

190
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,200
 why we have it in our throats nothing else can get there that we haven't put in our mouths that's a

191
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,720
 really good point you'd feel like such an idiot python wouldn't you if you were halfway through

192
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,800
 swallowing a deer and you accidentally choke because of the worm crawling into your external

193
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:41,600
 windpipe that's so cool have you heard of the african egg eating snake I love this one okay

194
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,360
 where where is that from and what's it eat okay here we go um it's from africa and it eats eggs

195
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,240
 but it eats eggs that are way wider than its head and it's um but you know how you see snakes with

196
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,760
 a big lump inside of its prey it's so funny because it's perfectly egg-shaped obviously the lump

197
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,800
 inside but it has to break the eggs somehow but it breaks them after it's eaten them that's the

198
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,880
 weird thing and it does so because it has lumps on the inside of its spine and that's what it uses

199
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,760
 to break the shell so it has to smash its food against the inside of its own backbone in order to

200
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,720
 eat it right hey I found a really wimpy snake that I totally relate to called the hognose snake

201
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,000
 have you guys heard of the hognose snake hognose snake is a snake that when it's threatened most

202
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,240
 snakes are badass aren't they they rise and they scare you and they're ready for a fight the hognose

203
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:41,120
 snake is terrified and basically when it feels it's under threat from a predator it fakes its own

204
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,280
 death in front of the predator so it starts just kind of like oh god you got me kind of thing it

205
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,480
 starts rolling on the ground on its back going upside down its mouth wide open as if it's sort

206
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:59,280
 of choking on poison it poos itself um it lays belly up and it's a kind of like secretion that

207
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,480
 smells really bad like poo and and then it just lays there with its mouth open dead and just

208
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,800
 waits for the predator to walk away because a lot of predators want to eat something that's alive

209
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,200
 and also it's a bit awkward if someone's just shit themselves in front of you you are just

210
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,240
 going to walk away slightly embarrassed aren't you I mean yeah Dan after after we did the Richard

211
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,320
 Herring show the other night we did have an altercation with an extremely angry extremely drunk

212
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,480
 man and I was wondering where you had got those moves from and no I know just because you've been

213
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,680
 reading about the hognose snake and I apologize about the smell of the humour on the way back

214
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:41,200
 but it was necessary saved our lives have you guys heard of Grace Olive Wiley no okay this is

215
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,960
 an amazing kind of her pathologist and snake expert from history she was the first person

216
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,520
 to successfully breed diamondback rattle snakes in captivity but she started off her love of

217
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,280
 snakes when she worked at Minneapolis library and she kept snakes in the library but she

218
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,600
 liked them so much didn't like them to be caged up so they just kind of slithered around

219
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,800
 in her office and stuff like that basically her colleagues didn't like this at all and forced

220
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,640
 her to leave the library and then so she went to Brookfield Zoo and decided to work there and she

221
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,400
 just let them out and go wherever they wanted and at one stage 19 snakes escaped went off into the

222
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,080
 entire town and the whole town shut down and so then she got fired from the zoo but then she

223
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,880
 went to California and she became a snake expert and she was a snake trainer for the jungle buck

224
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,640
 and all the Tarzan movies a snake train for the jungle book because I've seen both jungle books

225
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,720
 at night of them involve training any snakes what was she doing training the drawings

226
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:50,160
 I haven't seen this I must say but now that you've said that I do see she was a snake trainer

227
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,760
 and reptile consultant so perhaps she trained the snakes for some of them as she consulted

228
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:05,600
 for the animated ones she she confirmed they do sing and then unfortunately in 1948 she was famous

229
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,960
 at this stage there was a photographer came to take a photo of her and they took a photo with a

230
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,880
 flash while she was holding a snake the snake got spooked it bit her and there was only one vial of

231
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,640
 the correct anti-venom in the local hospital and it had been accidentally broken and she couldn't

232
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,080
 be saved and she died oh my word you know well I mean I don't want to sound intensive but she had

233
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,560
 it coming she thought she genuinely thought that people shouldn't be afraid of skate snakes and

234
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,960
 they can't really hurt you unless they're really really scared and I think that is kind of borne

235
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,240
 out you know it was only because of this massive flash that she died sort of although 125,000 people

236
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,480
 a year are killed by snakes so let's be a bit afraid of them. That's so interesting because

237
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,840
 the stat I guess most of us are told is that no one in Australia where all of the most venomous

238
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,840
 snakes in the world are has died in the last 50 years or whatever but of course there are so many

239
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,560
 countries that yeah. Although apparently if we're scared of snakes we're not actually scared of snakes

240
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,640
 we're just scared of triangles this is a theory based on some of the latest research you have

241
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,960
 diamond-backed rattle snakes and stuff like that they've got those kind of triangular shapes

242
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,000
 or zigzag shapes on their bodies quite often and you'll get snakes that have triangular heads you

243
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 know like cobras sort of have their heads playing out and there was a study that showed children

244
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,080
 pictures of like snakes with zigzags on them and then snakes without and then snakes with

245
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,880
 triangular heads and snakes with rounded heads and then various other shapes and then they asked the

246
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,320
 kids are these mean or nice and whenever there was a triangle in it or something triangular they said

247
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,920
 it was mean and we think that the snakes have actually evolved these triangular shapes on them

248
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,880
 to match our fear to scare us away because we have an understandable fear of sharp stuff

249
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,080
 like a tooth or a knife or something that could kill us so we're afraid of sharp things so the

250
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,160
 snakes gradually were like okay I'll put sharp looking stuff all over my body. That's really

251
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:04,480
 interesting is that why I shit myself whenever I see a Toblerone? Yeah and that's why that Toblerone

252
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,440
 in the office was ruined tasting absolutely foul. I read a paper about something similar which was

253
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,280
 that they wired people up with something to tell how much sweat you're producing and also what your

254
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,400
 heart rate is and they showed them pictures of snakes but they didn't tell them which ones were

255
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,360
 venomous and which ones were not venomous and people's heart rate and stuff went up when they

256
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,720
 saw the venomous ones and not when they saw the non-venomous ones so you kind of naturally know

257
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,800
 and they didn't have any previous knowledge of these snakes they just naturally seem to know

258
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,960
 which ones were dangerous. But what about the squeezy boys? Sorry the constrictors as in

259
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,040
 do you not naturally because if you naturally know which ones are venomous that's very useful

260
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,720
 unless you're in an area which has lots of constrictor snakes and you think oh no he won't

261
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,320
 harm you look at that I'm not naturally scared. I think they generally they don't go for humans

262
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,240
 do they the constrictors very much? Not very much but I think it does happen sometimes. Well not

263
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,640
 according to the snake expert consultant on the jungle book who advised car to constantly be squeezing

264
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:11,760
 I don't buy this triangle thing by the way why are we not scared of triangles then just in nature

265
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,920
 why have we why are we scared of things that look like triangles that aren't triangles? That's a

266
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,880
 flaw in the study I guess we so know that if you draw a triangle on a piece of paper that it's

267
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,840
 not dangerous but maybe we are maybe if you look at a triangle your heart rate goes a little bit

268
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,200
 higher than if you look at a circle I guess they haven't done the study yet. Did you not find that

269
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,000
 your children when they had those like blocks that you had to put them in like the triangular block

270
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,360
 they weren't scared of it or were they just confused because you were trying to put it in a square hole?

271
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,120
 Yes I was trying to I was going get back kids get back! They never got to have a turn and I put a

272
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:53,120
 cup over the triangle blocks and I put a sheet of paper underneath and I throw them in the garden

273
00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:02,960
 Okay it is time for fact number three and that is Anna. My fact this week is that one of the

274
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:11,520
 hardest gemstones to find is called Hidenite but that is not why it's called that. Very pleasing yeah

275
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,520
 It is! This is something that I'd never heard of but I think unless you're a gemstone fanatic

276
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,080
 it's not very well known it's a type of spodumene and I'm sure you know what that is

277
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,680
 which is a mineral which contains lithium which is often sought after because people

278
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,040
 look for it for things like phones you know use lithium in phones and things like that

279
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:36,720
 so it's a type of that and it's the rarest type so it's only found or it's only been found so far

280
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,600
 in America where it's first found in North Carolina just there and then in Madagascar,

281
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,160
 Brazil and maybe Afghanistan and China but only little little bits and yeah it's called Hidenite

282
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,360
 Why is it called Hidenite then? Yeah I thought that might be a follow-up question and the reason

283
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,040
 it's called Hidenite is because it was discovered by a geologist called William Earl Hiden or it

284
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,680
 was discovered by someone who gave it to him and he said oh that looks weird and so he sent it to

285
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:12,880
 some experts who identified it and he was actually there in North Carolina in 1879 looking for Platinum

286
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,040
 and he'd been sent by Thomas Edison who wanted to do some some ship with Platinum

287
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,720
 and he didn't find any but he did find Hidenite and he bought a plot of land

288
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,440
 set up in mine made a whole bunch of money. He also found another thing that he called Edisonite

289
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,880
 and another one called Mackintoshite. Was that the waterproof diamond? Yes well it was

290
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,960
 named after a guy called JB Mackintosh who he'd worked with so he was pretty good at finding

291
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,280
 new stuff and naming it after his mates. He was. It is amazing the number of mineral names that are

292
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,440
 bizarre is enormous because there are so many minerals and they all have to be named after

293
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,600
 something and a lot of them are named after places that's very common as a Yukonite or

294
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,800
 whatever it might be. There is a mineral called Taconite which I love which is named after the

295
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,040
 Taconic Mountains in New York but then one that I think we've mentioned on QI the TV show is

296
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:13,040
 Welshite or Welshite which is named after Wilfred Welsh. There is actually a place called Taconite

297
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:20,320
 which is named after a mine which finds this which contains this Taconite mineral and I went on to

298
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,000
 it's really hard to tell what's there on Google Maps because there's no street view on it for some

299
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,160
 reason but I went to a website called Manta.com which is a listing service for small businesses

300
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:37,600
 and apparently there is a restaurant there called Taconite by Tacos apparently. If anyone lives in

301
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,720
 Taconite then do let us know if that's true. Where every night is Taconite that's what you must have

302
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,240
 that as the slogan that's so good. I've discovered my favorite mineral in the course of this research

303
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,520
 and it is a mineral called Olivine and Olivine is a remarkable mineral. It makes up to 60 to 80%

304
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,680
 of Earth's upper mantle so we have so much of it and the amazing thing about it is that when

305
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:07,840
 it's ground up it can absorb its own mass of carbon dioxide so there are a lot of scientists

306
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:14,240
 out there who are trying to use it to help with global warming. Why are we not using it? Because

307
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,000
 it's so useful and we have so much of it. So there is a group that are called Project Vesta

308
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,360
 who have this idea where they want to grind it down and basically give us green colored sandy

309
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,440
 beaches all over the world because we can be soaking up the carbon dioxide there and supposedly

310
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,240
 wave action coming in on the sand actually speeds up the process because it's not as fast as other

311
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,040
 things like trees and seaweed and so on for absorbing carbon dioxide. However there is so

312
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,600
 much area of land where we don't have those things so why not chuck this stuff on there to help us

313
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,280
 do that and it also deacidifies the ocean in the process when the waves are coming in. So it's

314
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:57,040
 this incredibly useful mineral. Well get out your buckets and spades people. We can all contribute

315
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:03,200
 to the fight against climate change. So there's another spodiumene which Hidonises spodiumene.

316
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:09,280
 There's another one which kind of caught my eye called Kuntzite which was named after George Frederick

317
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:16,800
 Kuntz who was the chief jeweler of Tiffany and Co and he went around the world collecting minerals

318
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,400
 and his collection was the beginning of the US Natural History Museum stone collection.

319
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:28,080
 That wasn't it? George Kuntz yeah and there's a few amazing things that he did. There was a big

320
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,400
 argument in the mineral world about whether there was any jade in Europe. So there were some ancient

321
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:40,800
 peoples who kind of had loads of jade ornaments but no one could find any jade in Europe. So

322
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:47,360
 what that suggested for archaeologists is maybe there was some weird unknown prehistoric jade

323
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:54,400
 trading system that we were getting it in from China or something. Now people have been looking for

324
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,440
 decades and decades for jade but they'd never found any and one problem is that unless you polish it

325
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,440
 it just looks like green rock like greenish rock so it's really hard to find. Anyway Kuntz went to

326
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,400
 Germany and decided he would have a look and on his first day of looking he found a lump of jade

327
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:19,200
 that was 2.5 tons which was more in that single piece of jade than anyone had found of all the

328
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,120
 jade that anyone had found in the whole of history before that day. It's absolutely amazing and he

329
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,720
 later wrote like with complete glee that he had ruined the career of more than one German scholar

330
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,000
 by just finding this one bit of jade because they're all these experts in this jade trading that

331
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,440
 must have happened and he was like no I've just proved it's not true. Wow he's talked about with

332
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,960
 such reverence in the gemstone community. It's the greatest gemfinder ever and I ended up reading

333
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,480
 quite a large tract of one of the books he wrote which is called Shakespeare and Precious Stones

334
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,840
 and it covers every single reference to a precious stone or gem or crystal in all of Shakespeare's

335
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:05,600
 works plus comments about the context so to the extent of like in Venus and Adonis the sonnet

336
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:12,000
 he writes Honey Tongue Shakespeare writes of a ruby colored portal there you go he got a ruby

337
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,760
 mention. Richard II involves fair and crystal sky but you know the other cool thing about him James

338
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,840
 do you see who he married? I didn't see who he married no no I didn't. He married a gemstone

339
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,680
 someone called Opal. Oh wow that's cool. Not only that we've mentioned Opal Cunn's before

340
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:35,360
 in fact you mentioned a lot back. Was it the same one? Yeah the aviator. Yeah the first female aviator

341
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,000
 to race against men in the 1920s she's this huge propeller female flying who we've mentioned

342
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,960
 they were married. In our Amelia Earhart episode. I can't believe I didn't notice that that is

343
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,520
 amazing. Isn't that cool? I love it yeah power couple. Amazing. That's awesome. But a lot of

344
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:58,720
 minerals are named after people so there have been 5493 minerals that have been named

345
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:05,200
 in the world half of them are named after people so what's that about 2,700 something like that

346
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:13,440
 2,750 how many do you think are named after women? I'm gonna say 50. I'm just gonna more than half

347
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:25,120
 surprises. It's all of them. It's amazing. It's 112. Okay. Named after 96 different women so a few

348
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:32,160
 people a few women have got two named after them but 112 out of 5493 is not it's not great is it?

349
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,600
 One of the world's largest emeralds ever is called Patricia. So yeah it's not a glamorous enough name

350
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,760
 for an emerald it needs to be called Tallulah. Well they're such fabulous yeah the biggest emeralds

351
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,640
 in the world have very like a very mixed ability field of names so there's one called the Duke

352
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:53,040
 of Devonshire there's one called 1492 there's one called the Emerald Unguentarium which is a nearly

353
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:58,880
 3,000 carat vase carved from a single block of emerald so and then there's one called Patricia

354
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,520
 which it does feel like is the the poor cousin. Do we know if it's named after anyone or did the

355
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:10,400
 person just like the name? It is named after the daughter of the man who owned the mine in which

356
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:17,440
 Patricia was discovered. Yeah that's quite good fathering. There's a mineral called Amalcolite

357
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:24,720
 which was discovered on the moon Amalcolite. Do you know where the name came from? When what year

358
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,440
 are we talking? Is it post-moon landings? It was found in 1969. Apollo 11 year. The year of the

359
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:39,600
 moon landing here we go. Buzz Aldrin. It's an arm related to Armstrong. Arm, Al, Armstrong and Aldrin.

360
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:46,880
 Al Collins. Strong Aldrin Collins. Yes it's named after three people all men but named after three

361
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,440
 people which is quite cool isn't it? Amalcolite. Yeah that's really cool. There is a commission

362
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,360
 on mineral naming that's how Amalcolite and all the other minerals will have had their names approved.

363
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,040
 There is a commission on new minerals and mineral names because there are these 5000 and whoever

364
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,320
 Manny James said and every year they get about 80 applications for a new mineral and then it tests

365
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,600
 them and it rejects quite a few of the applicants because they're just they're an existing chemical

366
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:21,280
 formula and yeah a new form of an old mineral and so they're not allowed to be named but that

367
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,000
 sounds like a fun committee to sit on I guess. Yeah how many people are really suggesting names? I

368
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,320
 guess it's just the people who found them right? I think they get very few applications for names

369
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,360
 from people who haven't found a new mineral. A lot of us are bored in lockdown.

370
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:47,520
 Okay it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James. Okay my fact this week is that the

371
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:55,360
 world record for crushing watermelons with your thighs is three in 7.5 seconds. The new record

372
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:01,760
 holder Courtney Olson teaches an eight week course on how to crush watermelons with your thighs.

373
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:10,400
 Eight weeks. Eight weeks. I imagine a lot of that is the preparatory strength building because if

374
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,720
 not there's a lot of padding in an eight week course for a seven second record. I suppose like

375
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,360
 you have to explain the history of the watermelon. Probably that's the first six weeks. Get the blue

376
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,960
 plaque up. Let's see if we can do it in a little bit less than eight weeks on this podcast. Okay so

377
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,840
 let me paint the picture of what actually happens in these videos. So she sits on the floor, she's

378
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:37,440
 got some watermelons by her side, she puts her legs out in front of her and she crosses her ankles

379
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,640
 and then she grabs a watermelon, puts it between her legs and squeezes until it explodes and then

380
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,280
 gets the next one and then gets the next one and there are people with stopwatches and you can see

381
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,000
 that it has taken her just seven and a half seconds to do that and she's beaten the previous record

382
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,840
 which was held by a man called Rohala Doshmanziari. He was a bodybuilder who did it in 2017 and he did

383
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:07,600
 it in 10.88 seconds and the previous record for women was 14.65 seconds by a Ukrainian strong

384
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:13,120
 woman called Olga Liashchuk. It's a real Fosbury flop moment for the watermelon crushing sport

385
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,960
 isn't it because it's so much faster than the previous women's record and immense. It is. It

386
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:24,320
 takes a lot of force to do that. I think it's about 26 stone worth of force, about 364 pounds of force.

387
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:32,240
 So that is like what, three quite light people or two quite heavy people or one very heavy person

388
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,040
 sitting on it. So it's pretty bloody impressive that she can do it but it's still not quite enough

389
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,440
 in case you're wondering to crush somebody's skull. So if you do come across her and you cross her,

390
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,920
 she can't crush your skull with her thighs. That takes about 520 pounds worth of force.

391
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,400
 But if you are walking home with your watermelon and you're excited for the dessert it's going to

392
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,480
 provide for your dinner party, she can ruin that. So yeah, she is a danger. Watermelons used to be

393
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,240
 a lot easier to crush with your thighs because they used to be about two inches across. Really

394
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,280
 early watermelons were tiny. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When? What period? I mean a long time ago.

395
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,000
 Well they come from Africa and we started cultivating them really early like thousands of years ago.

396
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,840
 Yeah, we have depictions in Tutankhamun's tomb don't we of watermelons. And those but those are

397
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,920
 big though. That's why I'm that's sorry that's why I was asking Andy. I don't know when they were

398
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,040
 tiny. So I think basically there are lots of species of watermelons. The ones that you get

399
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,800
 in Africa mostly grown in the wild now are quite small. Not quite small as Andy said but pretty

400
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,760
 small. But then you would get the domesticated ones as well that were bigger. They have been

401
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:46,400
 around for at least 3,500 years because they found some watermelon leaves in Egyptian tomb

402
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,680
 and they took a tiny little bit of one of them from Kew Gardens and checked its genes and it had

403
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,440
 two special genes. One of them that makes them have a red flesh and one of them that gets rid of

404
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,400
 the kind of bitter taste that these smaller ones in Africa have so that we do know that this one

405
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:12,320
 that was in a tomb in 3,500 years ago was kind of red and very succulent and not bitter. It was

406
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,480
 actually sweet tasting which is yeah. And yeah Dan's right is the drawing of the one on an Egyptian

407
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,360
 tomb. It might be the one on King Tut's looks like our standard watermelons stripes and everything

408
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:28,480
 doesn't it? It's kind of amazing. The reason we started breeding them so early apparently is

409
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,000
 because they were basically used as water bottles which makes sense they're full of water but we

410
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,520
 think that it was a source of water so for instance when Livingston went to Africa then he said that

411
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,800
 the interior of watermelon supplied the place of water for many months of the year in the interior

412
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,520
 of Africa in the middle of Africa when he was traveling there so they used that instead of water

413
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,120
 and in a similar way we think that they put them on tombs maybe people speculate because it was

414
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,440
 like a drink to help you into the afterlife quite a long trek into the afterlife apparently you

415
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,560
 need some water and yeah there's someone as an anthropologist who wrote that they had a unique

416
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:11,440
 role as a natural canteen like a natural carton for fresh water. So are you putting water in there

417
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,280
 or you're using the natural waters of the watermelon? Using the water yeah don't empty the watermelon

418
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,640
 out of water and then refill it with water that's pointless. Well because especially there was a study

419
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,240
 at the University of Naples quite recently that thinks that it's better to hydrate with watermelon

420
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,920
 juice than it is to hydrate with water and that's because they are almost completely water something

421
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,560
 like well over 90% water but the extra bits are like sugars and essential salts which help you to

422
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:47,840
 rehydrate and basically it's a bit more similar to your body's composition than actual water and

423
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:53,200
 the closer a liquid is to the body's composition the easier it is for it to get it into your cells

424
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,880
 that's clever according to this study. It is the most extraordinary texture when you I was

425
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,920
 genuinely before this fact was sent in I had a watermelon about two weeks ago and when I was

426
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,560
 biting into it I just thought there was nothing like this there is nothing else that I've ever put

427
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,240
 my put into my mouth that has this kind of texture it's it's so bizarre and I guess it's because

428
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:20,080
 it's 92 to 94% water that it's yeah I don't know I mean pretty much everything is up there in the

429
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:25,040
 90s I mean watermelon just has it in the net yeah fruits and veg spinach is 94 spinach is more than

430
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,320
 watermelon it's not as juicy don't know where that water's been hidden but yeah like aubergine

431
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,720
 courgette they're all up in the 90s aren't they I don't know how why are we bother eating any of

432
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,560
 them okay well maybe it's not that but there's something about watermelon texture which is

433
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:46,160
 it's very alien to the rest of food it's almost like it's like a warm ice cube but not quite as

434
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,280
 hard isn't it yeah it's like a it's like when you crush ice into tiny bits and it's almost like a

435
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,880
 weird yeah what are we doing we're podcast of facts people don't know we're not a podcast it

436
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,760
 describes in great detail a fruit that everyone I just love that it's like just two weeks ago I

437
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,120
 had watermelon it's like literally I had it about two minutes before we came on the show today

438
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:18,000
 I have a watermelon controversy which is about watermelon knockers and these are people who

439
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,160
 test the ripeness of their watermelons in chops by tapping or knocking or slapping on them that

440
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,680
 wasn't the first use of the word knockers I was thinking of when you said that no this is all

441
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:38,480
 staying above the um the neck look whatever um the national watermelon promotion board which is a

442
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,640
 very austere and important body devoted to the promotion of watermelons in every form

443
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,800
 officially advises against knocking on watermelon to test its ripeness they advise instead obviously

444
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,800
 the look lift turn method which is where you look at it you lift it up test it if it's heavy if it's

445
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,320
 heavy that's good and then you turn and you observe the field spot okay so this is where the watermelon

446
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:05,440
 was sitting on on the ground when it was growing and an ideal watermelon the field spot should be

447
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,600
 a soft buttery yellow if it's white it's it's too unripe it's not ready yet if it's gone crazy canary

448
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,800
 yellow then it's overripe but a perfectly nice soft buttery yellow uh you should have a good

449
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,600
 watermelon on the inside very good to know isn't that great that it lets you know I had so two weeks

450
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,880
 ago I had a banana and it was what was this a fruit salad that you were having then because you had

451
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,320
 a watermelon about two weeks ago as well pretty healthy two weeks ago you had and I was on the

452
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,160
 brink of opening it and I stopped because it was a bit too green and I thought how nice the banana

453
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,360
 has let me know that it's not ready yet on the outside on the outside it's telling me no and

454
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,240
 same I didn't know that watermelons had that so I will you know I will look very thoughtful fruit

455
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,800
 yeah um alternatively you can just sit in the fruit stand and crush it between your thighs

456
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,400
 okay that's it that is all of our facts thank you so much for listening if you
