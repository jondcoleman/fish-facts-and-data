00:00:14,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:20,00:00:26,"from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna"
00:00:26,00:00:31,"Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:38,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting
00:00:38,00:00:44,with fact number one and that's my fact. My fact this week is that firefighters use ping pong balls
00:00:44,00:00:52,to put out wildfires. Wow. Do they fire the ping pong balls from enormous ping pong bats?
00:00:53,00:00:58,You're thinking here perhaps that the ping pong balls are also enormous are you Andy? Oh yes.
00:00:58,00:01:03,Or are you thinking that the wind from waving the bat might put out the fire?
00:01:03,00:01:09,Well I was thinking of one massive one per wildfire and you just load it up with water
00:01:09,00:01:13,and then you drop it on. Oh yeah. Yeah are they filled with water? They're not and I should just
00:01:13,00:01:19,clarify for the listener Andy is wrong as well that is not how they do it. What this is in fact is
00:01:19,00:01:23,these are little ping pong balls. They call them ping pong balls I couldn't officially find if they
00:01:23,00:01:28,were you know taken from a ping pong ball bag but they look exactly the same and they are carried.
00:01:28,00:01:34,What's a ping pong ball bag? You were laughing at ball bag James I saw it. I wasn't I was laughing
00:01:34,00:01:39,at the idea that someone might have invented a specific bag to carry ping pong balls in.
00:01:39,00:01:43,And that according to Dan's definition nothing is a ping pong ball unless it has been taken
00:01:43,00:01:48,out of a ping pong ball bag. You know you're going to your mates he's got a table you've got
00:01:48,00:01:51,your bat you've got your balls you've got to bring your balls in a bag so you've got a ball bag for
00:01:51,00:01:57,your ping pong balls right? I wouldn't usually bring my own balls. No I've only ever arrived at the
00:01:57,00:02:02,table and they've been there. I've never I would assume yeah that my friend has got his own balls
00:02:02,00:02:08,and basically you have to be such a pro that you think bringing your own balls is going to improve
00:02:08,00:02:12,your game by that much. There's different colour balls you're allowed to use different colour
00:02:12,00:02:16,balls if your eyes are better for orange balls let's say then the white ball you don't want
00:02:16,00:02:21,him getting an advantage. But like James says that does imply you are taking it quite seriously
00:02:21,00:02:26,it's like bringing your own pool cue to a pub and then if you lose you risk looking like the biggest
00:02:26,00:02:31,idiot that's ever walked into that room. I do know Dan that a lot of people have blue green colour
00:02:31,00:02:35,blindness do you think a lot of people struggle to see the colour white but can't see the colour
00:02:35,00:02:40,orange? Is that not a thing I always thought I had an advantage at ping pong when I brought my
00:02:40,00:02:48,orange balls with me. Only if you're playing in the snow. Okay myth dispelled excellent start to the
00:02:48,00:02:54,show. So when I tell you about the actual fact which is that this is used by wildfire firefighters
00:02:54,00:02:59,and they fly up in helicopters and the idea is that if there's a massive fire you want to contain
00:02:59,00:03:05,the fire by fighting the fire with fire and this is a classic thing that firefighters do on the ground
00:03:05,00:03:11,they have blow torches. The idea is that you burn any surrounding wood brush whatever it is on the
00:03:11,00:03:16,ground and it means nothing can feed the fire that's trying to escape further out so you contain it.
00:03:16,00:03:21,So they worked out that if you put ping pong balls up into a helicopter and you injected it with
00:03:21,00:03:27,different chemicals and you effectively created a bomb in the sky by mixing these chemicals live up
00:03:27,00:03:32,there you drop them down and by the time they hit the ground they burst into flames and put themselves
00:03:32,00:03:39,out very quickly so it's a really effective thing. So these chemicals are potassium permanganate and
00:03:39,00:03:44,glycol and it's basically you put these two chemicals together and they create fire and it's
00:03:44,00:03:50,a bit like how rocket engines work they have two chemicals and then they go together and they turn
00:03:50,00:03:57,into flame but potassium permanganate which is the main one in these ping pong balls it's also used
00:03:57,00:04:03,to kill fungi on your skin so you put it on your skin and it creates oxygen which kills the fungi
00:04:03,00:04:10,or germs it's used to treat water it's used to keep bananas for longer it's used to age
00:04:10,00:04:18,props in movie sets and it's used to purify cocaine all those different things this one chemical.
00:04:18,00:04:24,Wow multi-purpose isn't it cool that is very cool it doesn't mean bananas are extremely flammable
00:04:24,00:04:30,presumably or is it is it washed off or like will you get a banana and it's covered in this stuff
00:04:30,00:04:35,that if I just hold it the wrong way it will spontaneously combust. It's a slightly different
00:04:35,00:04:42,thing so it's the oxidization so bananas create ethylene which makes them ripen and actually
00:04:42,00:04:47,that's why if you put a banana with other fruits it'll make them all ripen really quickly but this
00:04:47,00:04:53,potassium permanganate will oxidize the ethylene and remove it and so it won't ripen quite as
00:04:53,00:04:58,quickly. Okay it's really cool in these helicopters they have a ball machine that all the balls are
00:04:58,00:05:04,sitting in and they already have the potassium permanganate sitting inside it and when they're
00:05:04,00:05:09,getting ready for release they they head down the ball machine to the end where they're all
00:05:09,00:05:15,individually injected with the glycol just before they're dropped so it's live bomb making basically.
00:05:15,00:05:20,Yeah did you guys see the previous method by which they used to do this because there was
00:05:20,00:05:25,the heli torch which is a helicopter with a hose attached to the bottom of it attached to a 50
00:05:25,00:05:29,gallon drum of fuel it feels a bit less precise than using the ping pong balls to be honest
00:05:29,00:05:34,but you do get to be called the burn boss if you are the one flying the helicopter.
00:05:34,00:05:39,Alright so I'm still slightly confused you drop the balls but then they don't ignite so they ignite
00:05:39,00:05:43,on impact how come they don't just explode the helicopter? Because it's the chemical reaction
00:05:43,00:05:49,takes about 20 seconds for it to ignite within the ball so. Oh so you really have to send them
00:05:49,00:05:53,out really quickly it's like holding a grenade that's been lit. Exactly that's exactly what it
00:05:53,00:05:57,is it's pulling a pin on a grenade and then you lob them out of the helicopter so they can actually
00:05:57,00:06:02,go in flames before they've made impact but they fly at such a height that the idea is that once
00:06:02,00:06:07,they've landed that's about 20 seconds and then they can light up on the floor. Wow so cool.
00:06:07,00:06:13,So ping pong balls used to be incredibly flammable anyway there was a change in 2014
00:06:13,00:06:16,and they were made of celluloids we've talked about celluloid before because it was used in all
00:06:16,00:06:22,the old cinemas and it was why cinemas kept on setting on fire in the 20s but same with ping
00:06:22,00:06:27,pong balls and if you go online it says everywhere that back in the olden days ping pong balls used
00:06:27,00:06:34,to just explode into flame mid-match because of the heat of the friction and everywhere says this
00:06:34,00:06:39,and it is possible if you get it hot enough because it is very very flammable and I haven't
00:06:39,00:06:44,found a single piece of evidence of a single table tennis match where any ball is exploded into flames.
00:06:45,00:06:50,You'd have to hit it pretty hard. I didn't know about this thing they used to have in ping pong
00:06:50,00:06:57,which has now been banned speed glue. Had you guys heard of this? Speed glue no. No speed glue is a
00:06:57,00:07:04,special glue that you use on your paddle you glue the rubber on with a special glue about half an
00:07:04,00:07:08,hour before the match begins and that soaks into the layer of sponge between the rubber and the
00:07:08,00:07:12,blade and what it does is it makes the racket way more elastic than it normally is because the
00:07:12,00:07:18,rubber cells expand in contact with this glue and it stretches out so it's like a trampoline for the
00:07:18,00:07:23,ping pong ball every single shot you play and it is incredibly effective at making you much
00:07:23,00:07:28,much better at table tennis and it's been banned by the Olympics. 2008 was the last time speed glue
00:07:28,00:07:34,was allowed and they now have to have official paddle controllers at the Olympics to to check if
00:07:34,00:07:40,anyone's doped their paddle. Yeah that's really interesting. It's weird because you'd think the
00:07:40,00:07:44,opposite if you put glue on your bat you'd think it would be like one of those velcro and ball games
00:07:44,00:07:49,you play at the beach where it would just stick to your bat a few times. If you put it on the wrong
00:07:49,00:07:55,side yeah it's very easy to detect stupid speed glue dopers if they get the side wrong. Have you
00:07:55,00:08:01,guys passed? There's a place in Holborn I remember walking past it once and I was just looking at the
00:08:01,00:08:05,wall and London is full of blue plaques which tell you about its history and up there on the wall it
00:08:05,00:08:13,says that this is where ping pong was invented and patented in I believe 1901. Yeah it's where there's
00:08:13,00:08:17,there's a table tennis club there now isn't there called bounce I think it's on that.
00:08:17,00:08:23,Yeah so like where it supposedly was invented is still where you go to play it but I couldn't
00:08:23,00:08:28,I just couldn't find anything online to verify that including bounce's own website which seems to
00:08:28,00:08:33,have no interest in this remarkable bit of history that has got connected to it. To be
00:08:33,00:08:38,fair to bounce it's not a museum its aim isn't to tell you the history of ping pong it's really a
00:08:38,00:08:44,place you go to play fun games it's you don't go to a you know a bowling alley and expect the
00:08:44,00:08:48,history of bowling do you? But if it was the home of bowling if it was the site of Neolithic bowling
00:08:48,00:08:52,it would be remiss of them not to use that as part of their publicity materials apart from
00:08:52,00:08:58,anything else. Yeah you're right that's why they should employ us for all of their PR. This is a
00:08:58,00:09:03,global game there should be a mecca of a location for I saw a book that was called Everything You
00:09:03,00:09:09,Know Is Pong and it was claiming that ping pong is the most widespread of all the sports the most
00:09:09,00:09:14,important sport that we have. I mean you know the guy was biased he was trying to sell a book on
00:09:14,00:09:20,ping pong obviously he went for that line but I don't know it's you know historically an amazing
00:09:20,00:09:25,location. Yeah. Just me okay well that's why I have a ball bag and you guys don't.
00:09:27,00:09:33,So I was reading about 30s table tennis and there used to be a thing allowed called finger spin
00:09:33,00:09:39,which is basically you could as it sounds spin the ball with your finger that was allowed. Was
00:09:39,00:09:44,that before the rally started or you couldn't like catch the ball and then spin it could you?
00:09:44,00:09:49,No as you were serving you could spin the ball and it basically meant you could have an impossible
00:09:49,00:09:56,to return serve and the game became pointless and they had to universally ban that in 1937
00:09:56,00:10:00,but then there are other changes as well so for example this is from Britannica
00:10:00,00:10:06,they report that slow or defensive play used to be hugely popular in the field of ping pong
00:10:06,00:10:10,and really you're just sitting back waiting for your opponent to make a mistake but I'm quoting
00:10:10,00:10:16,directly here slow or defensive play at one time was so dominant that at the 1936 world
00:10:16,00:10:23,championships in Prague an hour was needed to decide a single point. Imagine being in the
00:10:23,00:10:28,audience for that match. Imagine the neckache of looking one side then the other then the other.
00:10:28,00:10:31,Do you know how many hits it was Andy because a couple of weeks ago we mentioned the longest
00:10:31,00:10:36,tennis rally of all time which was I don't know how many hits it was but I think the longest
00:10:36,00:10:41,tennis rally was about half an hour wasn't it? It was in 29 minutes was it? Yeah so this is twice
00:10:41,00:10:45,as long and table tennis is a fast sport so I think this might smash that record. Well it sounds
00:10:45,00:10:49,like in this case maybe not it may have been only 10 hits they just put it really really high.
00:10:50,00:10:55,It just got stuck in the rafters at one stage so it'll come down eventually.
00:10:55,00:10:58,That was that match where the glue went on the wrong side of the paddles wasn't it?
00:10:58,00:11:11,Okay it is time for fact number two and that is Andy. My fact is that it takes eight people to
00:11:11,00:11:21,do an ultrasound on a python. Which one's that? Is it Erich Eider? So this is a story that happened
00:11:21,00:11:27,at Chester Zoo in 2012 and it was on an extremely big python so maybe with some smaller pythons
00:11:27,00:11:32,it'll take fewer people maybe with some especially wriggly ones it'll take more but this is a good
00:11:32,00:11:37,kind of rule of thumb for how long it takes. It was a snake called barley a python reticulated
00:11:37,00:11:42,python which is I think the longest kind in the world and barley at the time was reputed to
00:11:42,00:11:48,be the biggest snake in Europe so pretty exciting. Needed a health check up and she was 6.6 meters
00:11:48,00:11:54,long and as a result they needed eight handlers to move her because she weighed 90 kilos and
00:11:54,00:12:01,has the capacity for aggression unsurprisingly and there are these great photos of them moving
00:12:01,00:12:07,the snake all in a big conga line I guess and they've got her head in a tube it's very funny
00:12:07,00:12:12,it's um to keep the snake calm you just put the head in a big old tube and then that stops it.
00:12:12,00:12:17,I also saw another one in Chester Zoo there was another snake called JF and they instead
00:12:17,00:12:22,of putting the head in a tube they covered their eyes with someone's hands so one of the in this
00:12:22,00:12:28,case it was 10 people one of them covered their eyes with the hand eight of them held the snake on
00:12:28,00:12:33,the table and there was a little hole in the bottom of the table and the 10th person was hiding under
00:12:33,00:12:38,the table with the ultrasound and they kind of shoved it up the hole so you could see on the
00:12:38,00:12:42,inside of the snake. Did they need to hold the snake down while they're doing it? It's not just
00:12:42,00:12:46,for carrying them. Yeah most of the people are there to stop it from wriggling away. Wow because
00:12:46,00:12:50,they're strong aren't they they're basically just muscle. They are strong I would not want that gig
00:12:50,00:12:55,holding my hand in front of the eyes of a snake that close with your hand right out next to its
00:12:55,00:13:01,mouth is madness it would bite you. No reticulated pythons they're not venomous it's the person
00:13:01,00:13:06,who's going to get squeezed who's in trouble. But it is maybe worth it because you are obviously
00:13:06,00:13:14,the eight coolest people in the zoo. Oh okay cool as a snake what's is that the ultrasound guys.
00:13:14,00:13:20,I don't think any of us was with you there. No I reckon how many listeners will we have at this
00:13:20,00:13:25,episode of million people. I reckon of the million people who listened to this episode possibly
00:13:26,00:13:31,up 12 would have got that joke. Yeah yeah right in if you got the ultrasound joke because
00:13:31,00:13:35,we are confident enough that we won't have a bulging post bay resulting from that gig.
00:13:35,00:13:40,I reckon there was more people with me saying cool as a snake and that's not even a thing.
00:13:40,00:13:50,So many scientists have done bizarre experiments to try and work out the secrets of snake anatomy
00:13:50,00:13:56,because they are very confusing animals. So boa constrictors which are the squeezers they're the
00:13:56,00:14:02,ones who wrap themselves around their prey. Scientists wanted to work out how long they
00:14:02,00:14:09,squeeze for and why to work out their behavior in the wild and they did this by such a grisly
00:14:09,00:14:16,experiment. They put fake beating hearts into dead rats but dead rats that were still warm
00:14:16,00:14:21,so that the boa constrictor would think oh prey and they measured how long the boa constrictor
00:14:21,00:14:27,squeezed for so they normally squeeze for 20 minutes which is quite long very long time actually
00:14:27,00:14:32,and but when the scientists shut off the fake hearts after 10 minutes they stopped squeezing
00:14:32,00:14:37,soon after that they thought oh it's safe so that's how we know that boas are measuring the heart rate
00:14:37,00:14:43,of their prey as they squeeze. Interesting so they don't kill you by squeezing all the air out of
00:14:43,00:14:49,you they kill you by giving you a heart attack is that right? Yeah yeah yeah rough. I read a
00:14:49,00:14:53,really interesting thing about snakes that I didn't know which is that they effectively
00:14:53,00:14:59,wear contact lenses nature's contact lenses not prescription and we know this because obviously
00:14:59,00:15:04,we've studied snakes but a really interesting thing happens to all snakes as a result of this
00:15:04,00:15:09,little cap that sits over their eye it's a sort of they don't have eyelids so it's a sort of protective
00:15:09,00:15:15,cap translucent most snakes in the wild are brown eyed yellow eyed a few are blue eyed but at some
00:15:15,00:15:21,point all snakes go blue eyed and it's part of the shedding process when the snake is shedding its
00:15:21,00:15:26,skin it goes through different phases and there's a phase that's known as the blue phase and the blue
00:15:26,00:15:31,phase is when milky fluid builds up underneath the old skin to allow it to slip off and as the
00:15:31,00:15:37,eyes are a part of that the eyes have scales so these ocular scales that sit there they fill up
00:15:37,00:15:44,with this milky blue and suddenly every snake at one point just has these crazy completely blue eyes
00:15:44,00:15:49,so if you see a snake with completely blue eyes it's about to shed all of its skin that's the
00:15:49,00:15:54,stage just before it all comes off. That's really interesting because I did the white workshop on
00:15:54,00:15:59,radio two with Zoe Boll last week I think with Alex Bell and he was talking about this as well
00:15:59,00:16:05,just by coincidence and he said that they like they get these milky eyes but also the skin just
00:16:05,00:16:11,starts to feel loose around them so if you can imagine like suddenly all your clothes got 10%
00:16:11,00:16:16,bigger or something you just kind of feel like you're in the wrong kind of skin and that's how
00:16:16,00:16:21,you know it's time to slither out and you slither out of it Alex was saying it's like if you have
00:16:21,00:16:26,a sock on and you wiggle your foot until the sock comes off and you drag your fuck backwards out of
00:16:26,00:16:31,it I usually just pull them off with my hands I suppose they didn't have that luxury well snake
00:16:31,00:16:34,well that's very insensitive to say to a snake because they don't have that option.
00:16:34,00:16:41,Pythons which this this fact was about they eat a giant prey as we've discussed before and their
00:16:41,00:16:48,metabolisms do extraordinary things to digest it but they have a very special way to avoid choking
00:16:48,00:16:51,because the danger is that when you're eating something massive it'll just block your windpipe
00:16:51,00:16:58,so some pythons just blob their trachea out of the corner of their mouth they vomit up their
00:16:58,00:17:02,windpipe essentially and it hangs out of the corner of their mouth so that they can eat oh my god
00:17:02,00:17:07,so and they can carry on breathing yeah because their breath height is outside of their body
00:17:07,00:17:14,exactly very sensible so nothing ever goes down the wrong way basically if you can do that yeah
00:17:14,00:17:18,yeah just don't leave it on a peanut that's lying on the floor or something yeah exactly
00:17:18,00:17:23,like a worm could crawl up there or something right that's true I guess that's one good reason
00:17:23,00:17:27,why we have it in our throats nothing else can get there that we haven't put in our mouths that's a
00:17:27,00:17:30,really good point you'd feel like such an idiot python wouldn't you if you were halfway through
00:17:30,00:17:34,swallowing a deer and you accidentally choke because of the worm crawling into your external
00:17:34,00:17:41,windpipe that's so cool have you heard of the african egg eating snake I love this one okay
00:17:41,00:17:47,where where is that from and what's it eat okay here we go um it's from africa and it eats eggs
00:17:47,00:17:52,but it eats eggs that are way wider than its head and it's um but you know how you see snakes with
00:17:52,00:17:57,a big lump inside of its prey it's so funny because it's perfectly egg-shaped obviously the lump
00:17:57,00:18:04,inside but it has to break the eggs somehow but it breaks them after it's eaten them that's the
00:18:04,00:18:10,weird thing and it does so because it has lumps on the inside of its spine and that's what it uses
00:18:10,00:18:15,to break the shell so it has to smash its food against the inside of its own backbone in order to
00:18:15,00:18:22,eat it right hey I found a really wimpy snake that I totally relate to called the hognose snake
00:18:22,00:18:28,have you guys heard of the hognose snake hognose snake is a snake that when it's threatened most
00:18:28,00:18:34,snakes are badass aren't they they rise and they scare you and they're ready for a fight the hognose
00:18:34,00:18:41,snake is terrified and basically when it feels it's under threat from a predator it fakes its own
00:18:41,00:18:47,death in front of the predator so it starts just kind of like oh god you got me kind of thing it
00:18:47,00:18:52,starts rolling on the ground on its back going upside down its mouth wide open as if it's sort
00:18:52,00:18:59,of choking on poison it poos itself um it lays belly up and it's a kind of like secretion that
00:18:59,00:19:04,smells really bad like poo and and then it just lays there with its mouth open dead and just
00:19:04,00:19:08,waits for the predator to walk away because a lot of predators want to eat something that's alive
00:19:08,00:19:13,and also it's a bit awkward if someone's just shit themselves in front of you you are just
00:19:13,00:19:18,going to walk away slightly embarrassed aren't you I mean yeah Dan after after we did the Richard
00:19:18,00:19:22,Herring show the other night we did have an altercation with an extremely angry extremely drunk
00:19:22,00:19:26,man and I was wondering where you had got those moves from and no I know just because you've been
00:19:26,00:19:31,reading about the hognose snake and I apologize about the smell of the humour on the way back
00:19:31,00:19:41,but it was necessary saved our lives have you guys heard of Grace Olive Wiley no okay this is
00:19:41,00:19:46,an amazing kind of her pathologist and snake expert from history she was the first person
00:19:46,00:19:53,to successfully breed diamondback rattle snakes in captivity but she started off her love of
00:19:53,00:19:59,snakes when she worked at Minneapolis library and she kept snakes in the library but she
00:19:59,00:20:03,liked them so much didn't like them to be caged up so they just kind of slithered around
00:20:03,00:20:08,in her office and stuff like that basically her colleagues didn't like this at all and forced
00:20:08,00:20:14,her to leave the library and then so she went to Brookfield Zoo and decided to work there and she
00:20:14,00:20:20,just let them out and go wherever they wanted and at one stage 19 snakes escaped went off into the
00:20:20,00:20:26,entire town and the whole town shut down and so then she got fired from the zoo but then she
00:20:26,00:20:30,went to California and she became a snake expert and she was a snake trainer for the jungle buck
00:20:30,00:20:36,and all the Tarzan movies a snake train for the jungle book because I've seen both jungle books
00:20:36,00:20:42,at night of them involve training any snakes what was she doing training the drawings
00:20:42,00:20:50,I haven't seen this I must say but now that you've said that I do see she was a snake trainer
00:20:50,00:20:55,and reptile consultant so perhaps she trained the snakes for some of them as she consulted
00:20:55,00:21:05,for the animated ones she she confirmed they do sing and then unfortunately in 1948 she was famous
00:21:05,00:21:10,at this stage there was a photographer came to take a photo of her and they took a photo with a
00:21:10,00:21:16,flash while she was holding a snake the snake got spooked it bit her and there was only one vial of
00:21:16,00:21:22,the correct anti-venom in the local hospital and it had been accidentally broken and she couldn't
00:21:22,00:21:28,be saved and she died oh my word you know well I mean I don't want to sound intensive but she had
00:21:28,00:21:34,it coming she thought she genuinely thought that people shouldn't be afraid of skate snakes and
00:21:34,00:21:38,they can't really hurt you unless they're really really scared and I think that is kind of borne
00:21:38,00:21:44,"out you know it was only because of this massive flash that she died sort of although 125,000 people"
00:21:44,00:21:48,a year are killed by snakes so let's be a bit afraid of them. That's so interesting because
00:21:48,00:21:53,the stat I guess most of us are told is that no one in Australia where all of the most venomous
00:21:53,00:21:57,snakes in the world are has died in the last 50 years or whatever but of course there are so many
00:21:57,00:22:02,countries that yeah. Although apparently if we're scared of snakes we're not actually scared of snakes
00:22:02,00:22:08,we're just scared of triangles this is a theory based on some of the latest research you have
00:22:08,00:22:12,diamond-backed rattle snakes and stuff like that they've got those kind of triangular shapes
00:22:12,00:22:18,or zigzag shapes on their bodies quite often and you'll get snakes that have triangular heads you
00:22:18,00:22:24,know like cobras sort of have their heads playing out and there was a study that showed children
00:22:24,00:22:28,pictures of like snakes with zigzags on them and then snakes without and then snakes with
00:22:28,00:22:32,triangular heads and snakes with rounded heads and then various other shapes and then they asked the
00:22:32,00:22:38,kids are these mean or nice and whenever there was a triangle in it or something triangular they said
00:22:38,00:22:43,it was mean and we think that the snakes have actually evolved these triangular shapes on them
00:22:43,00:22:48,to match our fear to scare us away because we have an understandable fear of sharp stuff
00:22:48,00:22:54,like a tooth or a knife or something that could kill us so we're afraid of sharp things so the
00:22:54,00:22:58,snakes gradually were like okay I'll put sharp looking stuff all over my body. That's really
00:22:58,00:23:04,interesting is that why I shit myself whenever I see a Toblerone? Yeah and that's why that Toblerone
00:23:04,00:23:11,in the office was ruined tasting absolutely foul. I read a paper about something similar which was
00:23:11,00:23:17,that they wired people up with something to tell how much sweat you're producing and also what your
00:23:17,00:23:22,heart rate is and they showed them pictures of snakes but they didn't tell them which ones were
00:23:22,00:23:27,venomous and which ones were not venomous and people's heart rate and stuff went up when they
00:23:27,00:23:32,saw the venomous ones and not when they saw the non-venomous ones so you kind of naturally know
00:23:32,00:23:36,and they didn't have any previous knowledge of these snakes they just naturally seem to know
00:23:36,00:23:42,which ones were dangerous. But what about the squeezy boys? Sorry the constrictors as in
00:23:42,00:23:47,do you not naturally because if you naturally know which ones are venomous that's very useful
00:23:47,00:23:50,unless you're in an area which has lots of constrictor snakes and you think oh no he won't
00:23:50,00:23:54,harm you look at that I'm not naturally scared. I think they generally they don't go for humans
00:23:54,00:23:58,do they the constrictors very much? Not very much but I think it does happen sometimes. Well not
00:23:58,00:24:04,according to the snake expert consultant on the jungle book who advised car to constantly be squeezing
00:24:04,00:24:11,I don't buy this triangle thing by the way why are we not scared of triangles then just in nature
00:24:11,00:24:15,why have we why are we scared of things that look like triangles that aren't triangles? That's a
00:24:15,00:24:20,flaw in the study I guess we so know that if you draw a triangle on a piece of paper that it's
00:24:20,00:24:25,not dangerous but maybe we are maybe if you look at a triangle your heart rate goes a little bit
00:24:25,00:24:29,higher than if you look at a circle I guess they haven't done the study yet. Did you not find that
00:24:29,00:24:34,your children when they had those like blocks that you had to put them in like the triangular block
00:24:34,00:24:39,they weren't scared of it or were they just confused because you were trying to put it in a square hole?
00:24:39,00:24:45,Yes I was trying to I was going get back kids get back! They never got to have a turn and I put a
00:24:45,00:24:53,cup over the triangle blocks and I put a sheet of paper underneath and I throw them in the garden
00:24:53,00:25:02,Okay it is time for fact number three and that is Anna. My fact this week is that one of the
00:25:02,00:25:11,hardest gemstones to find is called Hidenite but that is not why it's called that. Very pleasing yeah
00:25:12,00:25:17,It is! This is something that I'd never heard of but I think unless you're a gemstone fanatic
00:25:17,00:25:22,it's not very well known it's a type of spodumene and I'm sure you know what that is
00:25:22,00:25:27,which is a mineral which contains lithium which is often sought after because people
00:25:27,00:25:31,look for it for things like phones you know use lithium in phones and things like that
00:25:31,00:25:36,so it's a type of that and it's the rarest type so it's only found or it's only been found so far
00:25:36,00:25:41,"in America where it's first found in North Carolina just there and then in Madagascar,"
00:25:41,00:25:48,Brazil and maybe Afghanistan and China but only little little bits and yeah it's called Hidenite
00:25:48,00:25:53,Why is it called Hidenite then? Yeah I thought that might be a follow-up question and the reason
00:25:53,00:25:59,it's called Hidenite is because it was discovered by a geologist called William Earl Hiden or it
00:25:59,00:26:05,was discovered by someone who gave it to him and he said oh that looks weird and so he sent it to
00:26:05,00:26:12,some experts who identified it and he was actually there in North Carolina in 1879 looking for Platinum
00:26:12,00:26:17,and he'd been sent by Thomas Edison who wanted to do some some ship with Platinum
00:26:17,00:26:20,and he didn't find any but he did find Hidenite and he bought a plot of land
00:26:20,00:26:25,set up in mine made a whole bunch of money. He also found another thing that he called Edisonite
00:26:25,00:26:32,and another one called Mackintoshite. Was that the waterproof diamond? Yes well it was
00:26:32,00:26:38,named after a guy called JB Mackintosh who he'd worked with so he was pretty good at finding
00:26:38,00:26:45,new stuff and naming it after his mates. He was. It is amazing the number of mineral names that are
00:26:45,00:26:49,bizarre is enormous because there are so many minerals and they all have to be named after
00:26:49,00:26:53,something and a lot of them are named after places that's very common as a Yukonite or
00:26:53,00:26:58,whatever it might be. There is a mineral called Taconite which I love which is named after the
00:26:58,00:27:05,Taconic Mountains in New York but then one that I think we've mentioned on QI the TV show is
00:27:05,00:27:13,Welshite or Welshite which is named after Wilfred Welsh. There is actually a place called Taconite
00:27:13,00:27:20,which is named after a mine which finds this which contains this Taconite mineral and I went on to
00:27:20,00:27:24,it's really hard to tell what's there on Google Maps because there's no street view on it for some
00:27:24,00:27:30,reason but I went to a website called Manta.com which is a listing service for small businesses
00:27:30,00:27:37,and apparently there is a restaurant there called Taconite by Tacos apparently. If anyone lives in
00:27:37,00:27:42,Taconite then do let us know if that's true. Where every night is Taconite that's what you must have
00:27:42,00:27:48,that as the slogan that's so good. I've discovered my favorite mineral in the course of this research
00:27:48,00:27:55,and it is a mineral called Olivine and Olivine is a remarkable mineral. It makes up to 60 to 80%
00:27:55,00:28:01,of Earth's upper mantle so we have so much of it and the amazing thing about it is that when
00:28:01,00:28:07,it's ground up it can absorb its own mass of carbon dioxide so there are a lot of scientists
00:28:07,00:28:14,out there who are trying to use it to help with global warming. Why are we not using it? Because
00:28:14,00:28:20,it's so useful and we have so much of it. So there is a group that are called Project Vesta
00:28:20,00:28:25,who have this idea where they want to grind it down and basically give us green colored sandy
00:28:25,00:28:31,beaches all over the world because we can be soaking up the carbon dioxide there and supposedly
00:28:31,00:28:36,wave action coming in on the sand actually speeds up the process because it's not as fast as other
00:28:36,00:28:41,things like trees and seaweed and so on for absorbing carbon dioxide. However there is so
00:28:41,00:28:45,much area of land where we don't have those things so why not chuck this stuff on there to help us
00:28:45,00:28:51,do that and it also deacidifies the ocean in the process when the waves are coming in. So it's
00:28:51,00:28:57,this incredibly useful mineral. Well get out your buckets and spades people. We can all contribute
00:28:57,00:29:03,to the fight against climate change. So there's another spodiumene which Hidonises spodiumene.
00:29:03,00:29:09,There's another one which kind of caught my eye called Kuntzite which was named after George Frederick
00:29:09,00:29:16,Kuntz who was the chief jeweler of Tiffany and Co and he went around the world collecting minerals
00:29:16,00:29:22,and his collection was the beginning of the US Natural History Museum stone collection.
00:29:22,00:29:28,That wasn't it? George Kuntz yeah and there's a few amazing things that he did. There was a big
00:29:28,00:29:34,argument in the mineral world about whether there was any jade in Europe. So there were some ancient
00:29:34,00:29:40,peoples who kind of had loads of jade ornaments but no one could find any jade in Europe. So
00:29:40,00:29:47,what that suggested for archaeologists is maybe there was some weird unknown prehistoric jade
00:29:47,00:29:54,trading system that we were getting it in from China or something. Now people have been looking for
00:29:54,00:29:59,decades and decades for jade but they'd never found any and one problem is that unless you polish it
00:29:59,00:30:05,it just looks like green rock like greenish rock so it's really hard to find. Anyway Kuntz went to
00:30:05,00:30:12,Germany and decided he would have a look and on his first day of looking he found a lump of jade
00:30:12,00:30:19,that was 2.5 tons which was more in that single piece of jade than anyone had found of all the
00:30:19,00:30:25,jade that anyone had found in the whole of history before that day. It's absolutely amazing and he
00:30:25,00:30:30,later wrote like with complete glee that he had ruined the career of more than one German scholar
00:30:30,00:30:36,by just finding this one bit of jade because they're all these experts in this jade trading that
00:30:36,00:30:41,must have happened and he was like no I've just proved it's not true. Wow he's talked about with
00:30:41,00:30:46,such reverence in the gemstone community. It's the greatest gemfinder ever and I ended up reading
00:30:46,00:30:52,quite a large tract of one of the books he wrote which is called Shakespeare and Precious Stones
00:30:52,00:30:57,and it covers every single reference to a precious stone or gem or crystal in all of Shakespeare's
00:30:57,00:31:05,works plus comments about the context so to the extent of like in Venus and Adonis the sonnet
00:31:05,00:31:12,he writes Honey Tongue Shakespeare writes of a ruby colored portal there you go he got a ruby
00:31:12,00:31:17,mention. Richard II involves fair and crystal sky but you know the other cool thing about him James
00:31:17,00:31:23,do you see who he married? I didn't see who he married no no I didn't. He married a gemstone
00:31:23,00:31:29,someone called Opal. Oh wow that's cool. Not only that we've mentioned Opal Cunn's before
00:31:29,00:31:35,in fact you mentioned a lot back. Was it the same one? Yeah the aviator. Yeah the first female aviator
00:31:35,00:31:40,to race against men in the 1920s she's this huge propeller female flying who we've mentioned
00:31:40,00:31:44,they were married. In our Amelia Earhart episode. I can't believe I didn't notice that that is
00:31:44,00:31:51,amazing. Isn't that cool? I love it yeah power couple. Amazing. That's awesome. But a lot of
00:31:51,00:31:58,minerals are named after people so there have been 5493 minerals that have been named
00:31:58,00:32:05,"in the world half of them are named after people so what's that about 2,700 something like that"
00:32:05,00:32:13,"2,750 how many do you think are named after women? I'm gonna say 50. I'm just gonna more than half"
00:32:13,00:32:25,surprises. It's all of them. It's amazing. It's 112. Okay. Named after 96 different women so a few
00:32:25,00:32:32,people a few women have got two named after them but 112 out of 5493 is not it's not great is it?
00:32:32,00:32:37,One of the world's largest emeralds ever is called Patricia. So yeah it's not a glamorous enough name
00:32:37,00:32:41,for an emerald it needs to be called Tallulah. Well they're such fabulous yeah the biggest emeralds
00:32:41,00:32:46,in the world have very like a very mixed ability field of names so there's one called the Duke
00:32:46,00:32:53,of Devonshire there's one called 1492 there's one called the Emerald Unguentarium which is a nearly
00:32:53,00:32:58,"3,000 carat vase carved from a single block of emerald so and then there's one called Patricia"
00:32:58,00:33:03,which it does feel like is the the poor cousin. Do we know if it's named after anyone or did the
00:33:03,00:33:10,person just like the name? It is named after the daughter of the man who owned the mine in which
00:33:10,00:33:17,Patricia was discovered. Yeah that's quite good fathering. There's a mineral called Amalcolite
00:33:17,00:33:24,which was discovered on the moon Amalcolite. Do you know where the name came from? When what year
00:33:24,00:33:31,are we talking? Is it post-moon landings? It was found in 1969. Apollo 11 year. The year of the
00:33:31,00:33:39,"moon landing here we go. Buzz Aldrin. It's an arm related to Armstrong. Arm, Al, Armstrong and Aldrin."
00:33:39,00:33:46,Al Collins. Strong Aldrin Collins. Yes it's named after three people all men but named after three
00:33:46,00:33:53,people which is quite cool isn't it? Amalcolite. Yeah that's really cool. There is a commission
00:33:53,00:33:59,on mineral naming that's how Amalcolite and all the other minerals will have had their names approved.
00:33:59,00:34:05,There is a commission on new minerals and mineral names because there are these 5000 and whoever
00:34:05,00:34:10,Manny James said and every year they get about 80 applications for a new mineral and then it tests
00:34:10,00:34:15,them and it rejects quite a few of the applicants because they're just they're an existing chemical
00:34:15,00:34:21,formula and yeah a new form of an old mineral and so they're not allowed to be named but that
00:34:21,00:34:26,sounds like a fun committee to sit on I guess. Yeah how many people are really suggesting names? I
00:34:26,00:34:30,guess it's just the people who found them right? I think they get very few applications for names
00:34:30,00:34:35,from people who haven't found a new mineral. A lot of us are bored in lockdown.
00:34:35,00:34:47,Okay it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James. Okay my fact this week is that the
00:34:47,00:34:55,world record for crushing watermelons with your thighs is three in 7.5 seconds. The new record
00:34:55,00:35:01,holder Courtney Olson teaches an eight week course on how to crush watermelons with your thighs.
00:35:01,00:35:10,Eight weeks. Eight weeks. I imagine a lot of that is the preparatory strength building because if
00:35:10,00:35:14,not there's a lot of padding in an eight week course for a seven second record. I suppose like
00:35:14,00:35:21,you have to explain the history of the watermelon. Probably that's the first six weeks. Get the blue
00:35:21,00:35:26,plaque up. Let's see if we can do it in a little bit less than eight weeks on this podcast. Okay so
00:35:26,00:35:31,"let me paint the picture of what actually happens in these videos. So she sits on the floor, she's"
00:35:31,00:35:37,"got some watermelons by her side, she puts her legs out in front of her and she crosses her ankles"
00:35:37,00:35:42,"and then she grabs a watermelon, puts it between her legs and squeezes until it explodes and then"
00:35:42,00:35:47,gets the next one and then gets the next one and there are people with stopwatches and you can see
00:35:47,00:35:52,that it has taken her just seven and a half seconds to do that and she's beaten the previous record
00:35:52,00:35:59,which was held by a man called Rohala Doshmanziari. He was a bodybuilder who did it in 2017 and he did
00:35:59,00:36:07,it in 10.88 seconds and the previous record for women was 14.65 seconds by a Ukrainian strong
00:36:07,00:36:13,woman called Olga Liashchuk. It's a real Fosbury flop moment for the watermelon crushing sport
00:36:13,00:36:16,isn't it because it's so much faster than the previous women's record and immense. It is. It
00:36:16,00:36:24,"takes a lot of force to do that. I think it's about 26 stone worth of force, about 364 pounds of force."
00:36:24,00:36:32,"So that is like what, three quite light people or two quite heavy people or one very heavy person"
00:36:32,00:36:37,sitting on it. So it's pretty bloody impressive that she can do it but it's still not quite enough
00:36:37,00:36:43,"in case you're wondering to crush somebody's skull. So if you do come across her and you cross her,"
00:36:43,00:36:47,she can't crush your skull with her thighs. That takes about 520 pounds worth of force.
00:36:47,00:36:52,But if you are walking home with your watermelon and you're excited for the dessert it's going to
00:36:52,00:36:58,"provide for your dinner party, she can ruin that. So yeah, she is a danger. Watermelons used to be"
00:36:58,00:37:04,a lot easier to crush with your thighs because they used to be about two inches across. Really
00:37:04,00:37:09,"early watermelons were tiny. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When? What period? I mean a long time ago."
00:37:09,00:37:14,Well they come from Africa and we started cultivating them really early like thousands of years ago.
00:37:14,00:37:19,"Yeah, we have depictions in Tutankhamun's tomb don't we of watermelons. And those but those are"
00:37:19,00:37:23,big though. That's why I'm that's sorry that's why I was asking Andy. I don't know when they were
00:37:23,00:37:29,tiny. So I think basically there are lots of species of watermelons. The ones that you get
00:37:29,00:37:34,in Africa mostly grown in the wild now are quite small. Not quite small as Andy said but pretty
00:37:34,00:37:39,small. But then you would get the domesticated ones as well that were bigger. They have been
00:37:39,00:37:46,"around for at least 3,500 years because they found some watermelon leaves in Egyptian tomb"
00:37:46,00:37:53,and they took a tiny little bit of one of them from Kew Gardens and checked its genes and it had
00:37:53,00:37:59,two special genes. One of them that makes them have a red flesh and one of them that gets rid of
00:37:59,00:38:04,the kind of bitter taste that these smaller ones in Africa have so that we do know that this one
00:38:04,00:38:12,"that was in a tomb in 3,500 years ago was kind of red and very succulent and not bitter. It was"
00:38:12,00:38:18,actually sweet tasting which is yeah. And yeah Dan's right is the drawing of the one on an Egyptian
00:38:18,00:38:23,tomb. It might be the one on King Tut's looks like our standard watermelons stripes and everything
00:38:23,00:38:28,doesn't it? It's kind of amazing. The reason we started breeding them so early apparently is
00:38:28,00:38:34,because they were basically used as water bottles which makes sense they're full of water but we
00:38:34,00:38:39,think that it was a source of water so for instance when Livingston went to Africa then he said that
00:38:39,00:38:44,the interior of watermelon supplied the place of water for many months of the year in the interior
00:38:44,00:38:49,of Africa in the middle of Africa when he was traveling there so they used that instead of water
00:38:49,00:38:55,and in a similar way we think that they put them on tombs maybe people speculate because it was
00:38:55,00:38:59,like a drink to help you into the afterlife quite a long trek into the afterlife apparently you
00:38:59,00:39:04,need some water and yeah there's someone as an anthropologist who wrote that they had a unique
00:39:04,00:39:11,role as a natural canteen like a natural carton for fresh water. So are you putting water in there
00:39:11,00:39:17,or you're using the natural waters of the watermelon? Using the water yeah don't empty the watermelon
00:39:17,00:39:22,out of water and then refill it with water that's pointless. Well because especially there was a study
00:39:22,00:39:28,at the University of Naples quite recently that thinks that it's better to hydrate with watermelon
00:39:28,00:39:33,juice than it is to hydrate with water and that's because they are almost completely water something
00:39:33,00:39:40,like well over 90% water but the extra bits are like sugars and essential salts which help you to
00:39:40,00:39:47,rehydrate and basically it's a bit more similar to your body's composition than actual water and
00:39:47,00:39:53,the closer a liquid is to the body's composition the easier it is for it to get it into your cells
00:39:53,00:39:58,that's clever according to this study. It is the most extraordinary texture when you I was
00:39:58,00:40:03,genuinely before this fact was sent in I had a watermelon about two weeks ago and when I was
00:40:03,00:40:08,biting into it I just thought there was nothing like this there is nothing else that I've ever put
00:40:08,00:40:14,my put into my mouth that has this kind of texture it's it's so bizarre and I guess it's because
00:40:14,00:40:20,it's 92 to 94% water that it's yeah I don't know I mean pretty much everything is up there in the
00:40:20,00:40:25,90s I mean watermelon just has it in the net yeah fruits and veg spinach is 94 spinach is more than
00:40:25,00:40:30,watermelon it's not as juicy don't know where that water's been hidden but yeah like aubergine
00:40:30,00:40:34,courgette they're all up in the 90s aren't they I don't know how why are we bother eating any of
00:40:34,00:40:38,them okay well maybe it's not that but there's something about watermelon texture which is
00:40:38,00:40:46,it's very alien to the rest of food it's almost like it's like a warm ice cube but not quite as
00:40:46,00:40:51,hard isn't it yeah it's like a it's like when you crush ice into tiny bits and it's almost like a
00:40:51,00:40:56,weird yeah what are we doing we're podcast of facts people don't know we're not a podcast it
00:40:56,00:41:03,describes in great detail a fruit that everyone I just love that it's like just two weeks ago I
00:41:03,00:41:09,had watermelon it's like literally I had it about two minutes before we came on the show today
00:41:11,00:41:18,I have a watermelon controversy which is about watermelon knockers and these are people who
00:41:18,00:41:24,test the ripeness of their watermelons in chops by tapping or knocking or slapping on them that
00:41:24,00:41:29,wasn't the first use of the word knockers I was thinking of when you said that no this is all
00:41:29,00:41:38,staying above the um the neck look whatever um the national watermelon promotion board which is a
00:41:38,00:41:42,very austere and important body devoted to the promotion of watermelons in every form
00:41:42,00:41:48,officially advises against knocking on watermelon to test its ripeness they advise instead obviously
00:41:48,00:41:54,the look lift turn method which is where you look at it you lift it up test it if it's heavy if it's
00:41:54,00:42:00,heavy that's good and then you turn and you observe the field spot okay so this is where the watermelon
00:42:00,00:42:05,was sitting on on the ground when it was growing and an ideal watermelon the field spot should be
00:42:05,00:42:11,a soft buttery yellow if it's white it's it's too unripe it's not ready yet if it's gone crazy canary
00:42:11,00:42:16,yellow then it's overripe but a perfectly nice soft buttery yellow uh you should have a good
00:42:16,00:42:21,watermelon on the inside very good to know isn't that great that it lets you know I had so two weeks
00:42:21,00:42:26,ago I had a banana and it was what was this a fruit salad that you were having then because you had
00:42:26,00:42:32,a watermelon about two weeks ago as well pretty healthy two weeks ago you had and I was on the
00:42:32,00:42:36,brink of opening it and I stopped because it was a bit too green and I thought how nice the banana
00:42:36,00:42:41,has let me know that it's not ready yet on the outside on the outside it's telling me no and
00:42:41,00:42:46,same I didn't know that watermelons had that so I will you know I will look very thoughtful fruit
00:42:46,00:42:50,yeah um alternatively you can just sit in the fruit stand and crush it between your thighs
00:42:58,00:43:02,okay that's it that is all of our facts thank you so much for listening if you
