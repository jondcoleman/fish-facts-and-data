00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:20,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:00:20,00:00:24,this week coming to you live from Amsterdam.
00:00:24,00:00:27,(audience cheering)
00:00:28,00:00:30,"My name is Dan Schriver, I am sitting here"
00:00:30,00:00:33,"with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:33,00:00:34,"and James Harkin, and once again,"
00:00:34,00:00:36,we have gathered 'round the microphones
00:00:36,00:00:39,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:39,00:00:42,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:44,"Starting with fact number one,"
00:00:44,00:00:45,and that is my fact this week.
00:00:45,00:00:50,"My fact is, in 2015, 86 inmates at the Exeter prison"
00:00:50,00:00:54,"wrote an angry letter to their local newspaper,"
00:00:54,00:00:57,complaining that the weekly Sudoku puzzle
00:00:57,00:00:59,was too hard to complete.
00:00:59,00:01:01,(audience laughing)
00:01:01,00:01:02,Yeah.
00:01:02,00:01:04,- You dogs.
00:01:04,00:01:05,(audience laughing)
00:01:05,00:01:08,- I don't think they're gonna be in here tonight.
00:01:08,00:01:11,- So this was 86 inmates.
00:01:11,00:01:12,They found it completely impossible.
00:01:12,00:01:15,It was an unfinished puzzle that they ended up sending in
00:01:15,00:01:18,to the editor of a local newspaper.
00:01:18,00:01:19,"- Wasn't impossible, right?"
00:01:19,00:01:20,"- No, it wasn't impossible."
00:01:20,00:01:23,- The newspaper replied and said actually it is possible.
00:01:23,00:01:25,"Sorry, sorry, sorry, but it was possible."
00:01:25,00:01:28,"Well, they discovered that basically the inmates"
00:01:28,00:01:29,"had got some of the numbers wrong in the middle,"
00:01:29,00:01:31,"and once you do that in Sudoku,"
00:01:31,00:01:33,"it's impossible to fix it,"
00:01:33,00:01:35,if you're trying to just continue on.
00:01:35,00:01:37,But how were 86 inmates trying to solve
00:01:37,00:01:39,the same Sudoku puzzle?
00:01:39,00:01:41,"- Because they don't get many newspapers in there,"
00:01:41,00:01:44,so they all join in and take turns and leave.
00:01:44,00:01:45,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:01:45,00:01:46,- Is there a queue?
00:01:46,00:01:48,"You queue up, you do one number, the next person goes."
00:01:48,00:01:50,'Cause you can't get heads all around.
00:01:50,00:01:53,"- Like, is there 81 cells in a thing?"
00:01:53,00:01:54,They could have one cell each.
00:01:54,00:01:55,"- Holy, yeah."
00:01:55,00:01:57,- And then five people to just check it over.
00:01:57,00:01:57,- Right shout.
00:01:57,00:01:58,- That's nice.
00:01:58,00:01:59,- Yeah. - That's a good system.
00:01:59,00:02:00,"- Yeah, so they wrote this letter"
00:02:00,00:02:02,"and it turned out that they were wrong,"
00:02:02,00:02:04,and that is a problem because they get access
00:02:04,00:02:05,"to Thursday's newspaper,"
00:02:05,00:02:07,"but the answers are on a Monday and they don't get that,"
00:02:07,00:02:09,"so they couldn't even check it,"
00:02:09,00:02:11,"so they were so frustrated, that's annoying."
00:02:11,00:02:13,That's why they wrote in.
00:02:13,00:02:15,"- But with Sudoku, you know when you've got it right,"
00:02:15,00:02:17,"really, you don't need to check."
00:02:17,00:02:19,"Like, you know either you've got it wrong or right, right?"
00:02:19,00:02:22,I would argue you don't need the Monday's paper.
00:02:22,00:02:23,"You know you fucked up,"
00:02:23,00:02:26,"now get back to the word search where you belong, clearly."
00:02:26,00:02:28,(audience laughing)
00:02:28,00:02:29,"- Can I just say, honestly,"
00:02:29,00:02:32,you don't always know when you've got it right.
00:02:32,00:02:36,"So for example, at the 2011 World Sudoku Championship,"
00:02:36,00:02:39,"one of the contenders called Weihua Huang,"
00:02:39,00:02:40,"he jumped up in the final,"
00:02:40,00:02:42,"he started high-fiving his friends in the audience,"
00:02:42,00:02:44,"he'd won, and a judge had to point out"
00:02:44,00:02:47,"he'd included the same number twice on the top row,"
00:02:47,00:02:49,and then he hadn't won.
00:02:49,00:02:49,That's a moment.
00:02:49,00:02:51,"- That's unbelievably,"
00:02:51,00:02:52,but it's embarrassing enough to be attending
00:02:52,00:02:55,the World Sudoku Championships with Ben.
00:02:55,00:02:57,"- Sudoku is, I mean, it took over the world."
00:02:57,00:02:59,"I don't know if you remember, 2006,"
00:02:59,00:03:02,"the world became obsessed with Sudoku,"
00:03:02,00:03:04,and it was basically down to a New Zealander
00:03:04,00:03:05,"called Wayne Gould, who--"
00:03:05,00:03:07,"- Are we gonna, I'm so sorry,"
00:03:07,00:03:08,but I just know that there'll be 10% of the audience
00:03:08,00:03:09,that is driving mad.
00:03:09,00:03:12,Are we gonna address your pronunciation of Sudoku?
00:03:12,00:03:12,- Thank you.
00:03:12,00:03:13,(audience laughing)
00:03:13,00:03:14,So how are you saying it?
00:03:14,00:03:15,- I'm just saying it how it's pronounced.
00:03:15,00:03:16,- And how am I saying it?
00:03:16,00:03:18,- You're saying it Sudoku.
00:03:18,00:03:19,- And it's--
00:03:19,00:03:20,- Sudoku.
00:03:20,00:03:22,- Sudoku is what I was saying before.
00:03:22,00:03:23,- Yes.
00:03:23,00:03:23,- Yeah.
00:03:23,00:03:24,- Right.
00:03:24,00:03:25,- So don't do that.
00:03:25,00:03:26,- Okay.
00:03:26,00:03:29,So Sudoku is a--
00:03:29,00:03:30,- Tell us about Wayne Gould.
00:03:30,00:03:33,"- So Wayne Gould,"
00:03:33,00:03:36,"Wayne Gould was from New Zealand,"
00:03:36,00:03:39,and he basically bumped into it in a newspaper
00:03:39,00:03:40,"when he was in Hong Kong,"
00:03:40,00:03:41,and he thought this was really interesting.
00:03:41,00:03:42,"And then when he was in England,"
00:03:42,00:03:45,"he basically, he sold it effectively"
00:03:45,00:03:46,like a door-to-door salesman.
00:03:46,00:03:48,"He went to the doors of,"
00:03:48,00:03:51,I think it was the Telegraph newspaper at times.
00:03:51,00:03:52,That's how I pronounce times.
00:03:52,00:03:55,(audience laughing)
00:03:55,00:03:58,"He went to the Times newspaper,"
00:03:58,00:03:59,"and he said, ""Check this out."""
00:03:59,00:04:01,"And they liked it, and they started using it."
00:04:01,00:04:05,And he patented this idea of a computer
00:04:05,00:04:07,"generating all of the numbers,"
00:04:07,00:04:10,so it could just generate multiple different Sudokas.
00:04:10,00:04:13,- Did you read the account by the features editor
00:04:13,00:04:15,"of The Times, this guy called Mike Harvey?"
00:04:15,00:04:17,And it genuinely was like a door-to-door thing.
00:04:17,00:04:19,"So he got a phone call, Mike Harvey,"
00:04:19,00:04:21,"saying, ""There's a man who has a puzzle to show you."""
00:04:21,00:04:23,"And so he thought, ""Great."""
00:04:23,00:04:24,(audience laughing)
00:04:24,00:04:26,"And he said afterwards, Harvey said,"
00:04:26,00:04:28,"""I asked one of my staff to get rid of him,"
00:04:28,00:04:29,"""but he said he was too busy,"
00:04:29,00:04:31,"""so I went down myself, trying to get rid of him."""
00:04:31,00:04:33,But Wayne Gould had had a mock-up
00:04:33,00:04:35,"of the back page of The Times made,"
00:04:35,00:04:37,"which included a Sudoku on it,"
00:04:37,00:04:39,and they ran it the following month.
00:04:39,00:04:40,"And as a result of that,"
00:04:40,00:04:41,Wayne Gould was named one of the world's
00:04:41,00:04:45,most influential people of 2006 by Time Magazine.
00:04:45,00:04:46,(audience laughing)
00:04:46,00:04:46,That's how big it was.
00:04:46,00:04:47,"- It was a quite year, wasn't it?"
00:04:47,00:04:49,(audience laughing)
00:04:49,00:04:52,"But what happened was that The Times decided to run this,"
00:04:52,00:04:54,"but the word got out really quickly,"
00:04:54,00:04:55,"and so all the other newspapers went,"
00:04:55,00:04:58,"""Oh, we're gonna get that in our newspapers as well,"" right?"
00:04:58,00:05:01,And it was just after the 2005 election.
00:05:01,00:05:03,"And so kind of, there wasn't much stories left"
00:05:03,00:05:04,in the newspaper.
00:05:04,00:05:05,"They had lots of inches to fill,"
00:05:05,00:05:09,"so they thought, ""Let's just bang a load of Sudoku in there."""
00:05:09,00:05:10,"And like The Sun, for instance,"
00:05:10,00:05:12,"made a version called Sundoku,"
00:05:12,00:05:14,which featured topless women.
00:05:14,00:05:15,(audience laughing)
00:05:15,00:05:19,- How did you get a nine by nine grid of numbers?
00:05:19,00:05:22,"- Lots of eights and zeros, I don't know."
00:05:22,00:05:24,"Sixes and nines, I don't know."
00:05:24,00:05:27,"But one newspaper editor said they were so popular,"
00:05:27,00:05:30,they called them Viagra for newspaper circulation.
00:05:30,00:05:31,- Wow.
00:05:31,00:05:32,"- And the editor of The Observer said,"
00:05:32,00:05:33,"""I'd put one on every page"
00:05:33,00:05:36,"if I thought it would increase circulation."""
00:05:36,00:05:37,"- Well, that was the thing."
00:05:37,00:05:38,"When it exploded in America,"
00:05:38,00:05:39,"certain newspapers carried it,"
00:05:39,00:05:41,"and the other ones didn't in the early days,"
00:05:41,00:05:44,and people who were lifelong readers of newspapers
00:05:44,00:05:47,changed allegiance just for the Sudoku.
00:05:47,00:05:49,"They suddenly were like, ""Okay, I'm gonna read"
00:05:49,00:05:50,the right-wing thing or the left-wing thing
00:05:50,00:05:51,"that I never read before."""
00:05:51,00:05:52,"- Shit, is that why Brexit happened?"
00:05:52,00:05:54,"It's just 'cause 10 years earlier,"
00:05:54,00:05:58,all these Guardian readers preferred the telegraph Sudoku.
00:05:58,00:05:59,"- I can't believe this fact,"
00:05:59,00:06:00,but I'm gonna say it anyway.
00:06:00,00:06:02,This was a report in the Daily Mail
00:06:02,00:06:07,that said that global pencil sales increased by 700% in 2005.
00:06:07,00:06:09,- I 100% believe that.
00:06:09,00:06:11,You would never have a pencil before that.
00:06:11,00:06:12,I would never have a pencil.
00:06:12,00:06:13,Why would you?
00:06:13,00:06:15,"You're a pen, you're not a child."
00:06:15,00:06:16,You've got to write those little digits up
00:06:16,00:06:18,"in the top corner then when you get the fill-up,"
00:06:18,00:06:19,then you've got to erase it.
00:06:19,00:06:20,- Got it.
00:06:20,00:06:23,"- There are just a few more things about the craze,"
00:06:23,00:06:25,which was all 2005.
00:06:25,00:06:27,Radio 4 apparently did an audio version of Sudoku.
00:06:27,00:06:29,I have no idea how that worked.
00:06:29,00:06:30,I have no idea.
00:06:30,00:06:33,"- They just read out the numbers, didn't they?"
00:06:33,00:06:38,"They went gap, gap, gap, gap, gap, seven, gap, gap, gap."
00:06:38,00:06:40,"- Maybe, yeah."
00:06:40,00:06:41,"- Yeah, that's probably it."
00:06:41,00:06:42,- Did they?
00:06:42,00:06:43,- It seems they.
00:06:43,00:06:47,- Sky One commissioned a 275-square-foot Sudoku
00:06:47,00:06:50,in a chalk hill at Chipping Sodbury.
00:06:50,00:06:52,"- Yeah, but do you know the thing about that?"
00:06:52,00:06:53,- No.
00:06:53,00:06:54,- It was wrong.
00:06:54,00:06:55,- What?
00:06:55,00:07:00,- So it was on the bath exit or near the bath exit of the M4
00:07:00,00:07:02,and it was specifically put in a place
00:07:02,00:07:04,where there was a 40-mile-an-hour speed limit introduced
00:07:04,00:07:06,because otherwise it would be dangerous and distracting.
00:07:06,00:07:09,"- Yes, I always try to solve my Sudoku"
00:07:09,00:07:11,below 40 miles an hour when driving.
00:07:11,00:07:14,- I keep it to the built-up areas.
00:07:14,00:07:16,- The responsible way to do it.
00:07:16,00:07:18,"But they offered 5,000 pounds for the first person"
00:07:18,00:07:20,"to solve this, particularly fiendish Sudoku,"
00:07:20,00:07:22,and it was revealed later that it actually had
00:07:22,00:07:25,"1,905 correct solutions."
00:07:25,00:07:26,"- Wow, wow, yeah."
00:07:26,00:07:28,"- That's the one thing that people hate, isn't it?"
00:07:28,00:07:30,There's more than one solution.
00:07:30,00:07:32,This was in the very early days.
00:07:32,00:07:35,The mail in the telegraph really rushed out the Sudokus
00:07:35,00:07:38,"and the telegraph's compiler called Michael Mepham,"
00:07:38,00:07:40,he made some puzzles that had more than one solution
00:07:40,00:07:43,"and he said, ""My golly, I did get some mail."""
00:07:43,00:07:46,(laughing)
00:07:46,00:07:47,- What's the problem with it?
00:07:47,00:07:49,- It's just because it's unsatisfying
00:07:49,00:07:51,if there's lots of different answers.
00:07:51,00:07:53,- There should only be one right answer.
00:07:53,00:07:55,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:07:55,00:07:56,"- Part of the craze thing,"
00:07:56,00:07:58,"one thing that happened in Sydney, Australia,"
00:07:58,00:08:01,there was a court case that was going on for three months.
00:08:01,00:08:03,They had 105 witnesses
00:08:03,00:08:05,"and while someone was giving evidence,"
00:08:05,00:08:07,they looked up and they sort of noticed
00:08:07,00:08:09,that the jurors were looking a bit distracted
00:08:09,00:08:12,and it turned out that they were secretly doing Sudokus
00:08:12,00:08:14,underneath their desk
00:08:14,00:08:17,and then it turned out that four of them were in cahoots
00:08:17,00:08:19,and what they were doing were printing out Sudoku
00:08:19,00:08:22,on photocopiers and sharing them around
00:08:22,00:08:23,and while the trial was going on
00:08:23,00:08:25,"and witnesses were talking,"
00:08:25,00:08:25,they were doing it underneath
00:08:25,00:08:27,and then comparing notes in the breaks
00:08:27,00:08:28,and seeing how far they got.
00:08:28,00:08:31,"Yeah, so that cost a million dollars,"
00:08:31,00:08:33,that trial up until that point
00:08:33,00:08:34,and it had to be thrown out
00:08:34,00:08:36,because it turned out the jurors weren't listening.
00:08:36,00:08:38,"- Oh my God, what was it, oh, drug trial?"
00:08:38,00:08:40,"- No, it was for conspiracy"
00:08:40,00:08:43,to manufacture a commercial quantity of amphetamines.
00:08:43,00:08:45,"- Sounds like a drug trial to me, yeah."
00:08:45,00:08:47,(audience laughing)
00:08:47,00:08:50,"But it wasn't, it was a conspiracy trial."
00:08:50,00:08:51,(audience laughing)
00:08:51,00:08:54,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:54,00:08:55,- I was reading an article
00:08:55,00:08:57,about the world championships in 2009.
00:08:57,00:08:59,So what they often do in the world championships
00:08:59,00:09:01,is they'll have normal Sudokus
00:09:01,00:09:02,"and then when you get to the final,"
00:09:02,00:09:04,they'll give you some kind of crazy Sudokus
00:09:04,00:09:05,"that are a little bit different,"
00:09:05,00:09:08,"like they might be jigsaws that have to come together,"
00:09:08,00:09:10,"might be bigger, and in this case,"
00:09:10,00:09:14,the final variants were so different to normal Sudokus
00:09:14,00:09:16,"that the winner from the previous two years,"
00:09:16,00:09:18,"who's a guy called Thomas Snyder,"
00:09:18,00:09:19,says it was like playing the final
00:09:19,00:09:23,of a basketball championships with a different size ball.
00:09:23,00:09:25,The hoops are higher up than normal
00:09:25,00:09:27,and everyone has trampolines in their shoes.
00:09:27,00:09:28,- Cool.
00:09:28,00:09:29,"- That was the difference, that's how different it was."
00:09:29,00:09:33,"There was a second puzzle hidden underneath the first puzzle,"
00:09:33,00:09:35,"but then for two of the competitors,"
00:09:35,00:09:37,"the first puzzle accidentally fell down halfway through,"
00:09:37,00:09:39,so that gave away the surprise.
00:09:39,00:09:41,"This was all in an article in the Irish press,"
00:09:41,00:09:44,"so they were quite interested in how the Irish team got on,"
00:09:44,00:09:46,"and they said that the Irish team came second to last,"
00:09:46,00:09:48,and three of the four Irish players were beaten
00:09:48,00:09:51,"by Tiang Xiong, a 10-year-old boy."
00:09:51,00:09:52,- Aw.
00:09:52,00:09:55,"- The only guy from the Irish team who beat them,"
00:09:55,00:09:56,"a guy called Bernard Sellers,"
00:09:56,00:09:57,"he said, ""I must make it clear"
00:09:57,00:10:00,"""that this is due to incompetence, not lack of effort."""
00:10:00,00:10:02,(audience laughing)
00:10:02,00:10:05,"He said, ""He has beaten us at Sudoku,"
00:10:05,00:10:07,"""but let's see him after a few beers."""
00:10:07,00:10:10,(audience laughing)
00:10:10,00:10:11,"- We need to move on, guys."
00:10:11,00:10:12,We need to get to our next facts.
00:10:12,00:10:13,"- Okay, let's do it."
00:10:13,00:10:16,"- Let's do it, okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:10:16,00:10:17,and that is Andy.
00:10:17,00:10:19,"- My fact is that in 1913,"
00:10:19,00:10:21,it was claimed that French farmers
00:10:21,00:10:23,"were raising automotive chickens,"
00:10:23,00:10:25,which were bred specifically
00:10:25,00:10:28,to throw themselves under passing cars
00:10:28,00:10:30,so the farmer could claim compensation.
00:10:30,00:10:32,(audience laughing)
00:10:32,00:10:32,- Wow.
00:10:32,00:10:34,- Should we now know the answer to why did the chicken
00:10:34,00:10:35,cross the road?
00:10:35,00:10:37,"- Absolutely, it was on a mission."
00:10:37,00:10:39,- Do we think this is true?
00:10:39,00:10:39,- I don't.
00:10:39,00:10:41,(audience laughing)
00:10:41,00:10:42,"Everyone else has been to think what they like,"
00:10:42,00:10:44,I think it's hooey.
00:10:44,00:10:47,"But it was printed in a newspaper called Le Figaro,"
00:10:47,00:10:48,"from a famous French paper,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,"and, yeah, farmers were breeding this chicken"
00:10:50,00:10:53,so that the owner could claim five francs
00:10:53,00:10:55,"or whatever of damages from a driver,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,and I just find it hilarious that--
00:10:57,00:11:00,- I did find one guy called William K. Vanderbilt.
00:11:00,00:11:01,He was known as a scorcher.
00:11:01,00:11:03,"He was American, not French,"
00:11:03,00:11:06,but he was well known that he would pay compensation
00:11:06,00:11:08,if he ever hit your animals.
00:11:08,00:11:09,And so there was newspaper articles
00:11:09,00:11:12,that people would deliberately push livestock into his way.
00:11:12,00:11:13,- Yeah.
00:11:13,00:11:15,"- So it was kind of some of it happening, wasn't it?"
00:11:15,00:11:16,- Poor sucker.
00:11:16,00:11:18,I wonder how many times he had a chicken suddenly appear
00:11:18,00:11:20,in front of his car before he started to suspect.
00:11:20,00:11:22,It was like the 12th time that day.
00:11:22,00:11:23,It's just like another cow.
00:11:23,00:11:24,- Yeah.
00:11:24,00:11:25,"- Come on, guys."
00:11:25,00:11:26,- Some people said it was horses
00:11:26,00:11:27,that got pushed in the way of his car.
00:11:27,00:11:28,- Really?
00:11:28,00:11:29,- You think he must have been quite a bad driver
00:11:29,00:11:30,if you can't see a horse.
00:11:30,00:11:31,- He should be.
00:11:31,00:11:31,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:31,00:11:33,"- How could you get a chicken to do that, by the way?"
00:11:33,00:11:34,How could you?
00:11:34,00:11:35,- You couldn't.
00:11:35,00:11:36,It's not a thing.
00:11:36,00:11:38,"- No, but if he was paying compensation all the time."
00:11:38,00:11:39,- You could throw it.
00:11:39,00:11:40,- You can chuck it.
00:11:40,00:11:41,- You could throw it.
00:11:41,00:11:41,"- Wait a minute, you can."
00:11:41,00:11:42,- You could get a chicken to do that.
00:11:42,00:11:44,- You can get a chicken to do that.
00:11:44,00:11:45,- Someone in the audience has just claimed
00:11:45,00:11:46,I could get a chicken to do that.
00:11:46,00:11:48,"- For one second, I forgot we were in Devon."
00:11:48,00:11:51,(audience laughing)
00:11:51,00:11:54,- I'll do that.
00:11:54,00:11:59,"- I think if you were to draw a white line on the ground,"
00:11:59,00:12:01,"sometimes chickens will just follow that white line,"
00:12:01,00:12:02,wouldn't they?
00:12:02,00:12:03,- That's true.
00:12:03,00:12:04,- I think that's a thing.
00:12:04,00:12:05,"- That guy, Vanderbilt, William Vanderbilt,"
00:12:05,00:12:07,he was like a squillionaire.
00:12:07,00:12:10,"And this fact came from a great article,"
00:12:10,00:12:12,"I think in Littub, the website,"
00:12:12,00:12:15,and it mentioned that he had these crazy adventures.
00:12:15,00:12:17,He may have been the inspiration for Mr. Toad
00:12:17,00:12:18,in The Wind and the Willows.
00:12:18,00:12:19,"You know, he's always got his car,"
00:12:19,00:12:22,"and he's going poop-poop, and all of this."
00:12:22,00:12:23,And...
00:12:23,00:12:24,(audience laughing)
00:12:24,00:12:25,- That's a good impersonation.
00:12:25,00:12:26,- Poop-poop.
00:12:26,00:12:27,"- You know, get out of our way."
00:12:27,00:12:28,He's Mr. Toad.
00:12:28,00:12:29,"- Sure, anyway."
00:12:29,00:12:32,"Okay, but he did have a lot of crazy adventures,"
00:12:32,00:12:34,which were even more exciting than Mr. Toad's adventures.
00:12:34,00:12:37,"So in 1899, visiting France,"
00:12:37,00:12:38,"he had to kill two dogs,"
00:12:38,00:12:39,"which were trying to bite his tires,"
00:12:39,00:12:41,and then flee from a mop.
00:12:41,00:12:43,- He had to kill two dogs.
00:12:43,00:12:45,- Circumstances forced him to shoot.
00:12:45,00:12:46,He did a lot.
00:12:46,00:12:48,He had a gun a lot of the time.
00:12:48,00:12:51,"He traveled with a gun, like Mr. Toad."
00:12:51,00:12:53,"You know, crowds with whips and rocks"
00:12:53,00:12:54,were trying to attack him
00:12:54,00:12:55,"because he was just such a reckless driver,"
00:12:55,00:12:57,and he'd shoot in the air and shoot over their heads
00:12:57,00:12:59,"and then drive off saying ""poop-poop."""
00:12:59,00:13:01,(audience laughing)
00:13:01,00:13:03,"- They weren't, people were just generally terrified"
00:13:03,00:13:04,"about the car for a long time as well,"
00:13:04,00:13:07,"and angry and farmers especially,"
00:13:07,00:13:09,"but around the same time in Pennsylvania,"
00:13:09,00:13:11,the legislature passed a law
00:13:11,00:13:13,that all cars traveling on country roads at night
00:13:13,00:13:15,had to send up a rocket every mile
00:13:15,00:13:17,to let everyone know that they were coming.
00:13:17,00:13:18,"- Sorry, God."
00:13:18,00:13:20,"- It's just, you know, big on firework."
00:13:20,00:13:22,"- I think suggested the law rather than passed it, though."
00:13:22,00:13:24,"- No, they passed, the legislature passed the law"
00:13:24,00:13:26,and then it was rejected by the governor.
00:13:26,00:13:28,"So the legislature said, ""Pass this law,"""
00:13:28,00:13:30,"and then they had to send a rocket up every mile,"
00:13:30,00:13:33,"explode it, then wait for 10 minutes for the road to clear,"
00:13:33,00:13:35,"and then the driver had to proceed with caution,"
00:13:35,00:13:37,blowing his horn and shooting off Roman candles
00:13:37,00:13:39,as before. - What the hell?
00:13:39,00:13:40,Wow.
00:13:40,00:13:42,"- So if you were on your horse,"
00:13:42,00:13:45,you'd have to judge was that a mile or two miles
00:13:45,00:13:46,"that the rocket went up, right?"
00:13:46,00:13:47,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:13:47,00:13:48,"- Do you think there was like, you know,"
00:13:48,00:13:50,when a thunderstorm's coming and you count the seconds?
00:13:50,00:13:51,Was it like that?
00:13:51,00:13:52,"- Yeah, between the light and the sound."
00:13:52,00:13:53,"- Yeah, yeah, that would work."
00:13:53,00:13:58,"- Patent number 1,122,742 in America."
00:13:58,00:14:01,"- Don't tell me, don't tell me, I know this one."
00:14:01,00:14:03,"- I'm so annoyed, I know the one before."
00:14:03,00:14:06,"- Yes, it was a huge knife that you attached"
00:14:06,00:14:08,to the front of your car.
00:14:08,00:14:11,"Can you guess, can you guess why you might do that?"
00:14:11,00:14:11,- Cababs.
00:14:11,00:14:12,"Chicken, chicken, cabab."
00:14:12,00:14:15,(all laughing)
00:14:15,00:14:18,- Just to make everyone get the fuck off the road.
00:14:18,00:14:19,- Kind of.
00:14:19,00:14:22,"So like Hannah said, people were really scared of cars,"
00:14:22,00:14:23,but they also hated them.
00:14:23,00:14:25,And there was a thing where people put ropes
00:14:25,00:14:29,"across the road to try and stop you from going too fast,"
00:14:29,00:14:30,"'cause then it would like, you know,"
00:14:30,00:14:32,like a barrier would stop you.
00:14:32,00:14:35,And so this thing was invented to kind of cut those ropes.
00:14:35,00:14:36,- Wow.
00:14:36,00:14:37,- Nice.
00:14:37,00:14:39,"- It's crazy, what do you read about it?"
00:14:39,00:14:41,Because it sounds like it was just hectic
00:14:41,00:14:43,to drive a car in those early days.
00:14:43,00:14:45,There were accounts of where sort of like farmers
00:14:45,00:14:47,and locals would sort of sprinkle nails
00:14:47,00:14:48,and broken glass on the road.
00:14:48,00:14:51,"They would, as you say, tie ropes across."
00:14:51,00:14:53,They would dig holes in the ground.
00:14:53,00:14:55,"So they would just, you know, fall into it."
00:14:55,00:14:58,"There was a story that near Sacramento in California,"
00:14:58,00:15:00,13 cars were captured.
00:15:00,00:15:03,"You know, like captured is the word they use in the article."
00:15:03,00:15:04,Yeah.
00:15:04,00:15:06,- And they were trying to stop people from speeding.
00:15:06,00:15:08,So there was one town in America
00:15:08,00:15:10,"where they put a big sign up just said,"
00:15:10,00:15:13,"""The speed limit this year is a secret."""
00:15:13,00:15:16,(all laughing)
00:15:16,00:15:18,"And the idea is everyone drives and they go,"
00:15:18,00:15:19,"""Oh shit, I'm gonna have to go slow now"
00:15:19,00:15:21,"'cause it's probably really low."""
00:15:21,00:15:22,"- God, so good."
00:15:22,00:15:23,- It sounds really fun.
00:15:23,00:15:25,It sounds like it's like doing an obstacle course
00:15:25,00:15:26,driving back in the day.
00:15:26,00:15:27,It's like you're rally driving or something.
00:15:27,00:15:28,"- It's very west, isn't it?"
00:15:28,00:15:29,- Yeah.
00:15:29,00:15:30,"- But one of the legitimate concerns,"
00:15:30,00:15:32,which is like the opposite of the concern we have now
00:15:32,00:15:35,"with driverless cars, is that humans were gonna have"
00:15:35,00:15:37,to be responsible for concentrating the whole time.
00:15:37,00:15:38,"'Cause if you think about it,"
00:15:38,00:15:41,"cars back then were called horseless carriages, basically."
00:15:41,00:15:43,And the difference between a horseless carriage
00:15:43,00:15:45,and a horse carriage is that you can kind of leave
00:15:45,00:15:47,"the horse to do most of the work,"
00:15:47,00:15:49,much like a driverless car.
00:15:49,00:15:50,"So, you know, if you're driving,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,"if you're the cabbie, you can lose concentration."
00:15:52,00:15:53,You can have a chat with your friend.
00:15:53,00:15:54,You can have a little snooze.
00:15:54,00:15:56,The horse has it under control.
00:15:56,00:15:58,"And one of the terrors was that, you know,"
00:15:58,00:16:00,"if you're driving, then it's all up to the human."
00:16:00,00:16:01,And we're shit.
00:16:01,00:16:02,- Yeah.
00:16:02,00:16:03,- And they were right.
00:16:03,00:16:05,"- Another thing in the 1920s, there was a judge"
00:16:05,00:16:09,who said that the automobile was a house of prostitution
00:16:09,00:16:13,on wheels and that of the 30 girls that had been brought
00:16:13,00:16:15,"in front of him charged with sex crimes,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,19 offenses had occurred in cars.
00:16:17,00:16:18,- Really?
00:16:18,00:16:20,- So there's a real worry that young people
00:16:20,00:16:23,are going to be able to get away from their parents and stuff
00:16:23,00:16:24,and they would be in an enclosed vehicle
00:16:24,00:16:26,and you never know what they're going to get up to.
00:16:26,00:16:27,"- Well, Madame Bovary, right?"
00:16:27,00:16:30,Didn't Madame Bovary have sex in a car?
00:16:30,00:16:31,- Carriage.
00:16:31,00:16:31,- Carriage.
00:16:31,00:16:32,"- That was the big thing, wasn't it?"
00:16:32,00:16:33,"- A horse car, yeah."
00:16:33,00:16:36,"- And in 1926, the Cleveland Motor Company"
00:16:36,00:16:37,realised this was happening
00:16:37,00:16:40,and so they invented the honeymoon special car.
00:16:40,00:16:43,And that came equipped with a foldable bed
00:16:43,00:16:45,which could be put up in just one minute
00:16:45,00:16:48,and the doors were fitted with curtains.
00:16:48,00:16:49,- That's really rude.
00:16:49,00:16:50,(audience laughing)
00:16:50,00:16:51,- For the 20s?
00:16:51,00:16:52,- Guys.
00:16:52,00:16:53,"- For the 20s, you're all saucepots."
00:16:53,00:16:54,- Yeah?
00:16:54,00:16:55,- I thought you were going to say there was a car company
00:16:55,00:16:58,which invented the car with a knife in the middle
00:16:58,00:16:59,so you can't go near anyone.
00:16:59,00:17:00,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:17:00,00:17:03,An inflatable dad of the daughter or something.
00:17:03,00:17:05,(audience laughing)
00:17:05,00:17:08,- I liked this in 1895 in the spectator.
00:17:08,00:17:11,"It was talking about how when the car first came about,"
00:17:11,00:17:13,everyone said horses were going to disappear
00:17:13,00:17:14,"off the face of the earth, which was kind of true,"
00:17:14,00:17:17,but it happened more slowly than people had predicted.
00:17:17,00:17:20,"And the spectator wrote, ""When the car first appeared,"
00:17:20,00:17:23,"""it was a common prophecy that the horse was a doomed animal,"
00:17:23,00:17:26,"""but the threatened institution of the horse-drawn cab"
00:17:26,00:17:29,"""has managed somehow, like the House of Lords,"
00:17:29,00:17:30,"""to survive in full vigor."""
00:17:30,00:17:31,(audience laughing)
00:17:31,00:17:34,"I just love the idea that even in 1895,"
00:17:34,00:17:36,"people were looking at the House of Lords going,"
00:17:36,00:17:37,"""How the fuck is this still surviving?"""
00:17:37,00:17:40,(audience laughing)
00:17:40,00:17:41,- That's so funny.
00:17:41,00:17:42,- It feels like that.
00:17:42,00:17:45,So one of the big problems with all these early day cars
00:17:45,00:17:46,is that they would come round
00:17:46,00:17:49,and they would spray dust on these roads into houses.
00:17:49,00:17:52,"And in France, where this fact begins,"
00:17:52,00:17:53,we were talking about the fact that
00:17:53,00:17:55,it was really badly received.
00:17:55,00:17:56,And part of that was people trying to say
00:17:56,00:17:58,rent out villas and so on.
00:17:58,00:17:59,They were losing all their business
00:17:59,00:18:02,"'cause as cars came by, all this spray of dust came"
00:18:02,00:18:04,and no one wanted to be there.
00:18:04,00:18:06,So roads were effectively invented
00:18:06,00:18:07,by people trying to stop that
00:18:07,00:18:11,because they started putting basically asphalt and so on
00:18:11,00:18:13,"just outside their house, just strips,"
00:18:13,00:18:15,"so that when the car went over, it would miss the house."
00:18:15,00:18:17,"And then it kind of, my theory is it caught on"
00:18:17,00:18:19,"and they went, ""Oh, let's put more of that down."""
00:18:19,00:18:20,- That's a good theory.
00:18:20,00:18:22,"There was in 1905,"
00:18:22,00:18:26,the Royal Commission on Motoring was held in Britain.
00:18:26,00:18:28,"And they again, were looking at the dust"
00:18:28,00:18:29,"and saying, ""This is terrible."""
00:18:29,00:18:32,"They blamed the dust for throat and eye infections,"
00:18:32,00:18:35,"for the inability to hand washing to dry,"
00:18:35,00:18:37,and the clogging of at least one
00:18:37,00:18:39,lady novelist's typewriter.
00:18:39,00:18:41,(audience laughing)
00:18:41,00:18:43,- Things are serious.
00:18:43,00:18:44,(audience laughing)
00:18:44,00:18:46,- It's so funny.
00:18:46,00:18:48,- We need to move on in a sec to our next fact.
00:18:48,00:18:49,- I've just got one more thing.
00:18:49,00:18:49,"- Yeah, go for it."
00:18:49,00:18:51,"- Well, I found it 'cause I was searching about chickens"
00:18:51,00:18:53,"and cars, and it's a piece of advice"
00:18:53,00:18:54,about playing chicken in a car.
00:18:54,00:18:56,- Oh yeah.
00:18:56,00:18:59,"- I mean, don't, but if you are,"
00:18:59,00:19:01,there's advice from a 1960 work
00:19:01,00:19:03,called The Strategy of Conflict by--
00:19:03,00:19:04,"- Okay, so chicken is like two cars"
00:19:04,00:19:05,driving up to each other and it's like--
00:19:05,00:19:07,"- Absolutely, you're driving towards each other"
00:19:07,00:19:09,"and whoever swears first loses, you know?"
00:19:09,00:19:11,And this is by a Nobel laureate called Thomas Shelling.
00:19:11,00:19:12,"So it's legit stuff, all right?"
00:19:12,00:19:15,And what he said is that extreme irrationality
00:19:15,00:19:17,can be rational.
00:19:17,00:19:19,"So if you are playing chicken in a car,"
00:19:19,00:19:22,the best thing to do is rip off the steering wheel
00:19:22,00:19:25,from the column and throw it out of the window.
00:19:25,00:19:27,But you should only do that if you are confident
00:19:27,00:19:29,that the other driver has seen you do it.
00:19:29,00:19:30,(audience laughing)
00:19:30,00:19:32,- Oh wow.
00:19:32,00:19:33,- Yeah.
00:19:33,00:19:34,- What year was that?
00:19:34,00:19:35,Is that early day as well?
00:19:35,00:19:36,- It was 1960.
00:19:36,00:19:36,"He died the next year, weirdly."
00:19:36,00:19:37,- I'm 1960.
00:19:37,00:19:39,(audience laughing)
00:19:39,00:19:40,- Horrible car crash.
00:19:40,00:19:42,(audience laughing)
00:19:42,00:19:43,"- I read about the first car, horn,"
00:19:43,00:19:45,which was in 1649.
00:19:45,00:19:46,- Huh?
00:19:46,00:19:48,- And this is car as in a horseless carriage.
00:19:48,00:19:52,And it was a carriage invented by a guy called Johann Housh
00:19:52,00:19:55,and it was a dragon which went at the front of the carriage
00:19:55,00:19:57,and it rolled its eyes and it spouted water
00:19:57,00:19:59,to clear pedestrians out of the way.
00:19:59,00:20:00,- That sounds fucking cool.
00:20:00,00:20:00,- Isn't that cool?
00:20:00,00:20:03,And the horn part was carved angels on either side
00:20:03,00:20:05,holding trumpets that were constantly blown.
00:20:05,00:20:06,- Oh wow.
00:20:06,00:20:08,- And this didn't need any horses to pull it
00:20:08,00:20:09,"amazingly, this vehicle."
00:20:09,00:20:11,Although it did have two men concealed
00:20:11,00:20:13,under the body of it who had to run along
00:20:13,00:20:14,with the outside stones.
00:20:14,00:20:15,- What the flip stones?
00:20:15,00:20:17,(audience laughing)
00:20:17,00:20:18,That's incredible.
00:20:18,00:20:19,- Yeah.
00:20:19,00:20:21,- We need to move on to our next fact.
00:20:21,00:20:23,"Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:20:23,00:20:24,and that is Anna.
00:20:24,00:20:27,"- My fact this week is that when libraries flood,"
00:20:27,00:20:29,the books are saved by putting them in the freezer
00:20:29,00:20:31,and then vacuuming them.
00:20:31,00:20:32,- Wow.
00:20:32,00:20:34,"- Yeah, I was reading about library book salvage"
00:20:34,00:20:35,and it's so cool.
00:20:35,00:20:37,So basically any library worth its salt
00:20:37,00:20:40,has to either have its own massive industrial freezer
00:20:40,00:20:42,or have access to an industrial freezer
00:20:42,00:20:45,and you freeze the paper as soon as it's got wet.
00:20:45,00:20:47,And this is both with floods and fires
00:20:47,00:20:49,'cause the biggest problem really for books
00:20:49,00:20:51,and libraries with fires is the getting wet afterwards.
00:20:51,00:20:53,Usually they're put out in time
00:20:53,00:20:55,but they're put out with so much water
00:20:55,00:20:57,that they get covered in water.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"If you freeze it immediately,"
00:20:59,00:21:01,then the water stops making the ink bleed
00:21:01,00:21:03,and it stops mold growing and all of those things.
00:21:03,00:21:05,But then obviously you've just got a massive freezer
00:21:05,00:21:06,full of frozen books.
00:21:06,00:21:07,- Yeah.
00:21:07,00:21:08,- It's really difficult to read
00:21:08,00:21:10,and you can't just melt it.
00:21:10,00:21:13,"And so then you vacuum it by which I mean,"
00:21:13,00:21:15,put it in a massive vacuum chamber
00:21:15,00:21:18,and that means that the water can go straight from a solid
00:21:18,00:21:23,"to a gas, can sublimate GCSE chemistry there"
00:21:23,00:21:26,'cause it like reduces the pressure in the air
00:21:26,00:21:27,if it's in a vacuum.
00:21:27,00:21:29,And so that means that there's like not enough pressure
00:21:29,00:21:30,"for water to form, right?"
00:21:30,00:21:31,It becomes gas immediately
00:21:31,00:21:32,'cause there's so much space.
00:21:32,00:21:35,All the solid ice molecules just jump around in the space
00:21:35,00:21:36,and become a gas.
00:21:36,00:21:37,- That is amazing.
00:21:37,00:21:39,You can not just buy some new books.
00:21:39,00:21:40,(audience laughs)
00:21:40,00:21:41,"- Shit, you should mention that."
00:21:41,00:21:43,"Yeah, a lot of time has been wasted."
00:21:43,00:21:45,"- Yeah, now these are precious old books, aren't they?"
00:21:45,00:21:46,"- Oh, okay, got it."
00:21:46,00:21:47,"- Yeah, these are the originals."
00:21:47,00:21:49,"- Yeah, there was one, there was a massive library fire"
00:21:49,00:21:53,"in 1986, the biggest library fire in America."
00:21:53,00:21:55,It was in Central Library in LA
00:21:55,00:21:58,"and that one they had to ask a load of,"
00:21:58,00:21:59,there were a lot of fishermen in LA
00:21:59,00:22:00,and they had to ask the fishermen
00:22:00,00:22:02,"to lend them all of their fish freezers,"
00:22:02,00:22:03,put the books in.
00:22:03,00:22:05,- I didn't see where you were going with that at all.
00:22:05,00:22:06,I thought you were gonna say
00:22:06,00:22:07,they had to get the fishermen to get the books
00:22:07,00:22:09,out of the library with their rods
00:22:09,00:22:12,because it was still too dangerous in there.
00:22:12,00:22:13,"- They're very attracted to maggots' books, actually."
00:22:13,00:22:15,They leap up.
00:22:15,00:22:17,"And the reason, and that really is, if you look that up,"
00:22:17,00:22:19,it doesn't go down that much in history
00:22:19,00:22:23,because it happened three days after Chernobyl
00:22:23,00:22:24,and so it was very much buried
00:22:24,00:22:28,in a slightly bigger explosion that week.
00:22:28,00:22:31,"The only paper that put it like proper front and center,"
00:22:31,00:22:32,"I think, or this is what I read in a book"
00:22:32,00:22:33,"called The Library Book,"
00:22:33,00:22:35,which is very good book by Susan Orleans.
00:22:35,00:22:38,"- Pravda in the Soviet Union, funny enough."
00:22:38,00:22:41,- There was nothing else happening that day.
00:22:41,00:22:42,- Exactly.
00:22:42,00:22:44,"How embarrassing for America there's library fire, right?"
00:22:44,00:22:46,Look at that.
00:22:46,00:22:49,"- They should have, like in libraries, just giant freezers."
00:22:49,00:22:52,"You know, in Australia, when you go to the bottle shop,"
00:22:52,00:22:54,"the bottle load, there's always this wine shop."
00:22:54,00:22:55,- Just a wine shop?
00:22:55,00:22:57,"- Yeah, wine shop, and you get beers."
00:22:57,00:23:00,There's always this giant freezer room that you go into.
00:23:00,00:23:01,"It's freezing to be inside,"
00:23:01,00:23:04,but it's very common in every bottle shop that you get there.
00:23:04,00:23:06,"And yeah, they should have that,"
00:23:06,00:23:07,just where all the precious books just can't be hung.
00:23:07,00:23:10,"- Well, I suppose some of the bigger places do, right?"
00:23:10,00:23:12,"Like the Natural History Museum, not a library,"
00:23:12,00:23:14,but they have a huge freezer.
00:23:14,00:23:16,Can you guess what's the largest animal
00:23:16,00:23:18,they could fit in the freezer?
00:23:18,00:23:20,"- Seal, but a big seal."
00:23:20,00:23:21,- A Diplodocus.
00:23:21,00:23:24,"- Diplodocus, giraffe."
00:23:24,00:23:27,The answer is a fully grown rhino.
00:23:27,00:23:29,They could fit that in there.
00:23:29,00:23:33,"And the largest fridge in the world, 2,800 pole away,"
00:23:33,00:23:36,"this is in Richland, Washington, in America,"
00:23:36,00:23:40,that is big enough to fit every single living rhino in the world.
00:23:40,00:23:41,- Wow.
00:23:41,00:23:43,- And actually they have a bit of space as well.
00:23:43,00:23:45,They'd have to be on top of each other's shoulders.
00:23:45,00:23:46,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:23:46,00:23:48,- I don't think that's gonna be your biggest logistical problem
00:23:48,00:23:50,"in terms of gathering all the rhinos,"
00:23:50,00:23:51,getting them to the fridge.
00:23:51,00:23:52,"I think once you've done that,"
00:23:52,00:23:54,shoving them in is gonna be an easy job.
00:23:54,00:23:55,"- Yeah, okay."
00:23:55,00:23:58,- Whose fridge is this and how big is the party they're having?
00:23:58,00:24:01,- This is a huge fridge that they use in America.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"Their farmers will send all their goods there,"
00:24:03,00:24:05,and it will keep the fruits and vegetables
00:24:05,00:24:07,kind of fresher for a bit longer.
00:24:07,00:24:07,- Nice.
00:24:07,00:24:08,- Really nice.
00:24:08,00:24:10,- Imagine how many magnets you can get on that.
00:24:10,00:24:11,So many.
00:24:11,00:24:16,"- That's a lot of shit drawings from your children, isn't it?"
00:24:16,00:24:20,- Libraries.
00:24:20,00:24:22,You know the Bodleian Library in Oxford?
00:24:22,00:24:23,- Yeah.
00:24:23,00:24:24,- I think it's one of only three libraries
00:24:24,00:24:27,which gets a copy of every single book published in the UK.
00:24:27,00:24:28,"So it's the Cambridge Library,"
00:24:28,00:24:29,"the Oxford University Library,"
00:24:29,00:24:32,which is the Bodleian and the British Library.
00:24:32,00:24:35,"For 250 years, the Librarian of the Bodleian"
00:24:35,00:24:39,"was supposed to be celibate, and none of them were."
00:24:39,00:24:40,"It was one of the main,"
00:24:40,00:24:42,"there was a guy, found it by a guy called Thomas Bodley,"
00:24:42,00:24:44,"who had read this main thing,"
00:24:44,00:24:46,and he wrote up a list of rules when he was founding the library.
00:24:46,00:24:48,The first rule was celibate.
00:24:48,00:24:50,I want no Librarian to have sex ever.
00:24:50,00:24:53,"The first Librarian got married that year,"
00:24:53,00:24:55,the year he founded it.
00:24:55,00:24:57,"All the successes did pretty much,"
00:24:57,00:24:59,"and it was 250 years, it was kept in place,"
00:24:59,00:25:00,"and then they repealed it saying,"
00:25:00,00:25:02,"""This is a ridiculous rule."""
00:25:02,00:25:04,"And why celibate, 'cause you must love the books"
00:25:04,00:25:06,more than you could ever love the human flesh?
00:25:06,00:25:07,"Or what, why?"
00:25:07,00:25:10,"What a lovely poetic way, I think it's..."
00:25:10,00:25:12,They didn't want to get any come-in-the-books?
00:25:12,00:25:13,"Yeah. Oh, my God!"
00:25:13,00:25:15,"Wow. Oh, my God!"
00:25:15,00:25:17,That's poetic from James.
00:25:17,00:25:20,No? No?
00:25:20,00:25:21,"It wasn't that, no, I think it was..."
00:25:21,00:25:22,It's sort of gas.
00:25:22,00:25:25,"Yeah, no, it's fine, and I'm blushing on stage now."
00:25:25,00:25:28,"I didn't say... Oh, my God."
00:25:28,00:25:30,"I think it was because it was kind of connected to the priesthood,"
00:25:30,00:25:35,and so it kind of came from that tradition that he was...
00:25:35,00:25:38,But Bobby himself was a bit of a mug.
00:25:38,00:25:40,"He said they didn't want idle books and riff-raffs,"
00:25:40,00:25:43,which was anything not in Latin.
00:25:43,00:25:46,And the library got a first folio of Shakespeare's works.
00:25:46,00:25:49,"Pretty good, pretty nice book in 1623, pretty valuable."
00:25:49,00:25:52,"And then a few decades later, the third folio came out,"
00:25:52,00:25:54,and they just sold the first folio off.
00:25:54,00:25:57,"They said, ""Well, we don't need this. We've got a more modern one now."""
00:25:57,00:25:59,"And so as a result, they had to..."
00:25:59,00:26:02,"Yeah, just on random, fun things about libraries,"
00:26:02,00:26:05,"I was reading about Berkeley Library in America,"
00:26:05,00:26:08,and they have every year an edible book festival.
00:26:08,00:26:10,"And the idea is that there's a few categories,"
00:26:10,00:26:14,but one of the main things is you need to do food-based puns
00:26:14,00:26:16,on existing books.
00:26:16,00:26:21,"So ""Infinite Jest"" becomes ""Infinite Zest,"" for example."
00:26:21,00:26:23,So I've got a little quiz for you guys.
00:26:23,00:26:24,"Okay, okay."
00:26:24,00:26:26,"Wait, who needs to do... How does it work?"
00:26:26,00:26:28,I'm going to give you the book name and see if you can guess
00:26:28,00:26:30,what they did with it.
00:26:30,00:26:32,"""Waiting for Goddow."""
00:26:32,00:26:34,"""Waiting for Cheddar."""
00:26:34,00:26:35,"""Waiting for Gouda."" Would be better."
00:26:35,00:26:37,There we go. That's much better.
00:26:37,00:26:38,1-0 to James.

00:27:53,00:27:55,I demand a recap.
00:27:55,00:27:57,Have you guys heard of Barbara Pratt?
00:27:57,00:27:58,No.
00:27:58,00:28:02,This is now more on refrigeration than on libraries.
00:28:02,00:28:07,"But she was hired by the shipping company Sea Land, who's now MERSC."
00:28:07,00:28:12,And basically what would happen is they would refrigerate fruits and vegetables and stuff
00:28:12,00:28:15,"and send it around the world, and then sometimes it would be fine"
00:28:15,00:28:18,and sometimes it would be rotten and no one could work out why.
00:28:18,00:28:23,"And so Barbara Pratt spent seven years living in shipping containers,"
00:28:23,00:28:27,being shipped around the world with a load of vegetables
00:28:27,00:28:30,and working out how to stop them from going rotten.
00:28:30,00:28:31,Whoa.
00:28:31,00:28:33,Is that the one thing more boring than watching paint dry?
00:28:33,00:28:35,Watching vegetables rot.
00:28:35,00:28:36,She is an absolutely hero.
00:28:36,00:28:37,Incredible.
00:28:37,00:28:38,Isn't that amazing?
00:28:38,00:28:40,She had bunk bed.
00:28:40,00:28:43,"I don't know why she had a bunk bed, because I can't imagine that."
00:28:43,00:28:45,"Because she had to have some fun, and bunk beds are fun."
00:28:45,00:28:47,"I mean, that's pretty boring."
00:28:47,00:28:50,"I would say, like the Budley, and this is a place where you're probably celibate"
00:28:50,00:28:52,if you're doing this job.
00:28:52,00:28:57,"But yes, she would monitor temperature, airflow, humidity, all that kind of stuff."
00:28:57,00:28:59,"She had loads of microprocessors, all that kind of stuff,"
00:28:59,00:29:02,and eventually worked out the regimes that they used today
00:29:02,00:29:06,to make sure that peppers and watermelons and stuff can go around the world and not go off.
00:29:06,00:29:08,That's great. Isn't that amazing?
00:29:08,00:29:11,"Did they ever have like an inspection of the shipping container,"
00:29:11,00:29:15,"and they just open it and they find a load of watermelons and Barbara Pratt just goes,"
00:29:15,00:29:17,"""Hello."""
00:29:17,00:29:19,I fear that didn't happen.
00:29:19,00:29:20,That's so good.
00:29:20,00:29:25,"On fridges, you know there's a Guinness World Record for the world's largest fridge."
00:29:25,00:29:28,"Oh, is it not the one that I talked about in America?"
00:29:28,00:29:29,"No, it's not that."
00:29:29,00:29:31,"Yeah, the official, according to Guinness World Records,"
00:29:31,00:29:35,is the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.
00:29:35,00:29:38,"And it's because it has 9,300 magnets inside it,"
00:29:38,00:29:40,and they need to be kept at an exact temperature.
00:29:40,00:29:43,"And so it's got 10,800 tons of liquid nitrogen,"
00:29:43,00:29:47,"60 tons of liquid helium, and that creates the..."
00:29:47,00:29:51,Does it count as a fridge if you can't put your cold rice from the night before in it?
00:29:51,00:29:52,But hang on a second.
00:29:52,00:29:54,We said in the first ever episode of Fish
00:29:54,00:29:56,that the Large Hadron Collider had to be stopped
00:29:56,00:29:58,because a bit of tuna baguette was dropped into it.
00:29:58,00:29:59,That's right.
00:29:59,00:30:03,"So if that is still in there, then it counts as a fridge."
00:30:03,00:30:14,We need to move on to our next fact.
00:30:14,00:30:16,"It is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:30:16,00:30:18,and that is James.
00:30:18,00:30:21,"OK, my fact this week is that there is an ophthalmologist"
00:30:21,00:30:25,at the University of Leiden called Dr I.C. Notting.
00:30:25,00:30:34,"It does work better in an Irish accent, doesn't it?"
00:30:34,00:30:37,"It does, and I'm not going to do it."
00:30:37,00:30:41,"So this was a post that I saw on the website improbable.com,"
00:30:41,00:30:44,"which is run by Mark Abraham, who is a friend of ours,"
00:30:44,00:30:47,"who's been on Fish, actually, and he runs the Ig Nobel Prizes,"
00:30:47,00:30:49,but he noticed this person.
00:30:49,00:30:53,And she was part of a team in May this year
00:30:53,00:30:58,that replaced both lenses in the eyes of a chimpanzee called Fifi.
00:30:58,00:31:00,Fifi could no longer tolerate light
00:31:00,00:31:02,"because of the situation that she'd been in,"
00:31:02,00:31:06,"and so, like, really had the lenses had gone all cloudy,"
00:31:06,00:31:08,and she was the first person to ever do in Europe
00:31:08,00:31:12,a double cataract operation on a chimpanzee.
00:31:12,00:31:13,"That's super cool, but at the same time a shame,"
00:31:13,00:31:16,because I just want to see a chimpanzee wearing sunglasses
00:31:16,00:31:17,for the rest of their life.
00:31:17,00:31:22,"And apart from that, I know Notting more about Dr Notting."
00:31:22,00:31:25,"She specialises in neuro-ophthalmology, cataracts,"
00:31:25,00:31:29,"and trabismus, which I didn't know means being cross-eyed,"
00:31:29,00:31:31,"and she's got a load of papers online,"
00:31:31,00:31:34,but they're so far out of my pay grade.
00:31:34,00:31:35,It's unbelievable.
00:31:35,00:31:40,The latest one is spectral domain optical coherence tomography
00:31:40,00:31:45,in retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy
00:31:45,00:31:47,and systemic manifestations
00:31:47,00:31:50,and monogenic small vessel disease.
00:31:50,00:31:53,Right. She sounds clever.
00:31:53,00:31:54,She sounds super clever.
00:31:54,00:31:55,She's got a funny name.
00:31:55,00:31:59,"I did find another optometrist called Hugh Seymour, which is a..."
00:31:59,00:32:00,That's great.
00:32:00,00:32:04,"There's a big list of ophthalmologists on Wikipedia,"
00:32:04,00:32:06,and I went down looking for an app name.
00:32:06,00:32:09,There was a guy who was the first person to prove
00:32:09,00:32:12,that providone iodine could be safely used
00:32:12,00:32:14,as an antimicrobial for the eyes.
00:32:14,00:32:17,He's got a very apt name. His name was Leonard Apt.
00:32:17,00:32:19,Right.
00:32:19,00:32:20,"He's going to be at home listening to this, thinking,"
00:32:20,00:32:24,"""Oh, no, they've done it again."""
00:32:24,00:32:27,"So, this fact is basically nominative determinism,"
00:32:27,00:32:30,and the idea of that is you've got a name
00:32:30,00:32:31,that matches the job that you're doing.
00:32:31,00:32:35,"So, for example, the professor of geology at Exeter University"
00:32:35,00:32:37,is called Dr Stone.
00:32:37,00:32:40,Did they become professor of that because of the name?
00:32:40,00:32:42,Did it lead them towards that?
00:32:42,00:32:44,"And there's a lot of people who say there's no truth in that,"
00:32:44,00:32:46,but it is fun when you notice people
00:32:46,00:32:47,that seem to have gone into it.
00:32:47,00:32:52,"So, Leiden, where you were saying, ""I see nothing"" is from,"
00:32:52,00:32:53,"I looked at the University of Leiden,"
00:32:53,00:32:55,"which is a different university,"
00:32:55,00:32:57,just to see if there was any people
00:32:57,00:32:59,who had similar names to the thing that they do.
00:32:59,00:33:04,"So, I found there's a professor of religion called Peter Bishop,"
00:33:04,00:33:07,"but it's Bishop, but it's very, very close."
00:33:07,00:33:09,"The professor of European law is Rick Lawson,"
00:33:09,00:33:12,and they have a professor of anthropology
00:33:12,00:33:14,who's called Gerard Person.
00:33:14,00:33:15,"Oh, that's good."
00:33:15,00:33:17,"So, do you think that Leiden University"
00:33:17,00:33:20,is just literally choosing people just based on their names?
00:33:20,00:33:22,"Yeah, sounds like it."
00:33:22,00:33:25,"Well, you'd think that academics would be above this kind of thing,"
00:33:25,00:33:27,"and if they heard this, they'd be like, ""Come on,"
00:33:27,00:33:29,"just talk about my area of knowledge."""
00:33:29,00:33:31,But this is one of my favourite things.
00:33:31,00:33:32,I don't think we've ever mentioned it.
00:33:32,00:33:35,"One of the most important papers ever written in astrophysics,"
00:33:35,00:33:38,"the authors were Alpha, Beta and Gamma."
00:33:38,00:33:40,(LAUGHTER)
00:33:40,00:33:42,"It's not quite Gamma, but it's close enough."
00:33:42,00:33:45,"And the reason for this is a guy called George Gamma,"
00:33:45,00:33:47,who's the professor on the project.
00:33:47,00:33:48,And this paper was so important.
00:33:48,00:33:51,"It was in 1948, and it basically discovered"
00:33:51,00:33:54,that the background radiation of the Big Bang
00:33:54,00:33:56,"essentially kind of justified the Big Bang happening,"
00:33:56,00:33:58,and it talked about that it created hydrogen and helium
00:33:58,00:34:00,and all the elements that we now live with today
00:34:00,00:34:03,in their proportions. Seminal paper.
00:34:03,00:34:05,So the lead author was George Gamma.
00:34:05,00:34:08,His PhD student was Ralph Alpha.
00:34:08,00:34:10,"George Gamma said, ""Hey, Ralph, wouldn't it be so funny?"
00:34:10,00:34:12,"""I've got a colleague called Beta."
00:34:12,00:34:14,"""He's really nothing to do with this whole astrophysics thing,"
00:34:14,00:34:16,"""but let's put him as an author on the paper,"
00:34:16,00:34:18,"""and then I'll be Alpha, Beta, Gamma."""
00:34:18,00:34:20,"And Alpha said, ""Absolutely not."
00:34:20,00:34:23,"""This is a huge deal for me. I'm a PhD student."""
00:34:23,00:34:25,"No, and he got completely ignored."
00:34:25,00:34:27,"And in fact, not only that, but George Gamma asked"
00:34:27,00:34:29,another one of his colleagues called Herman
00:34:29,00:34:32,if he'd changed his name to Delta in all they could.
00:34:32,00:34:36,"Oh, wow. That's too far."
00:34:36,00:34:39,"And they went ahead, and, like, he was furious."
00:34:39,00:34:41,"Ralph Alpha was so angry for years afterwards,"
00:34:41,00:34:45,"said it completely, like, undid my great achievements."
00:34:45,00:34:47,"So, okay, yeah, nominative determinism."
00:34:47,00:34:49,"We think it's probably bunk,"
00:34:49,00:34:52,but there was a paper by a group of researchers
00:34:52,00:34:55,"about medical workers and, you know,"
00:34:55,00:34:58,"all kinds of medical work, and it was a group of researchers"
00:34:58,00:35:01,who found that there was a greater frequency of medical names
00:35:01,00:35:04,in various specialisms than you would expect by chance.
00:35:04,00:35:08,"And the researchers were named Lim, Lim, Lim and Lim."
00:35:08,00:35:11,"They were in the same family, but still."
00:35:11,00:35:13,"So, you know, they looked in the American director of physicians,"
00:35:13,00:35:16,"and they found lots of doctors with the surname Doctor,"
00:35:16,00:35:18,"or Fix, or Cure, or Heal."
00:35:18,00:35:20,And they also found that some promising partnerships
00:35:20,00:35:21,failed to materialise.
00:35:21,00:35:23,"Doctors Batman and Robin are registered,"
00:35:23,00:35:27,but failed to team up in any speciality.
00:35:27,00:35:31,It's selfish. It's almost like they've got bigger priorities.
00:35:31,00:35:34,"And the paper which debunked it, which most people point at,"
00:35:34,00:35:38,"was in the Journal of Personal and Social Psychology,"
00:35:38,00:35:41,"and it was called ""I Sell Seashells by the Seashore"""
00:35:41,00:35:43,and my name is Jack.
00:35:43,00:35:47,-Killjoy. -That's so good.
00:35:47,00:35:49,"I think now, because we've talked about"
00:35:49,00:35:51,"so much nominative determinism over the years,"
00:35:51,00:35:53,as in just names that are very apt.
00:35:53,00:35:56,"And now, I feel like we have to go a level up,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,"so you've got to, like, do the doubles."
00:35:58,00:36:02,"You know, if two of someone's names are nominative deterministic,"
00:36:02,00:36:04,like Andrew Drinkwater.
00:36:04,00:36:05,I think that's the loudest head of research
00:36:05,00:36:07,at the Water Research Centre.
00:36:07,00:36:09,-That's good. -He drinks water.
00:36:09,00:36:11,I think that's okay.
00:36:11,00:36:12,I also like doubles.
00:36:12,00:36:14,I just spend quite a lot of time looking at the students' guide
00:36:14,00:36:16,to the seashore that was written by fish and fish.
00:36:16,00:36:19,I probably spent an hour desperately trying to find out
00:36:19,00:36:21,"if they were related and hoping they weren't,"
00:36:21,00:36:23,because then that would be an amazing catch.
00:36:23,00:36:26,-Yeah. -Hey.
00:36:26,00:36:27,They are husband and wife.
00:36:27,00:36:31,I've discovered deep in the bowels of Cardiff University website.
00:36:31,00:36:34,"I think, and also, Andy's favourite thing of words,"
00:36:34,00:36:36,"like, name sentences."
00:36:36,00:36:39,"-Yes. -Yeah, so what are the examples of that we always say?"
00:36:39,00:36:41,"Like, Ben Folds and Jeremy Irons."
00:36:41,00:36:43,"-Tom Waits. -Yeah, yeah, I think--"
00:36:43,00:36:45,-Wesley Snipes. -Sting.
00:36:45,00:36:47,"-Sti-- no, not sting. -No."
00:36:47,00:36:51,"It works if it's an imperative, but that's not a proper--"
00:36:51,00:36:55,"-Sorry, James. -I was reading a study from 2018,"
00:36:55,00:36:59,and this is about injecting medicine directly into your eyes.
00:36:59,00:37:01,"Okay, that sounds pretty awful,"
00:37:01,00:37:04,"but apparently, if you have something called macular edema,"
00:37:04,00:37:05,"it really, really helps."
00:37:05,00:37:07,And the person who came up with that idea
00:37:07,00:37:10,was a physician called Douglas Jabs.
00:37:10,00:37:12,"-Oh, that's great. -Sentence person."
00:37:12,00:37:14,"-Annenominative determinism. -Yeah, that's amazing."
00:37:14,00:37:17,-Takes the screen. -I found a urologist
00:37:17,00:37:20,"who performs vasectomies called Dr. Richard Chopp,"
00:37:20,00:37:21,aka Dr. Dick Chopp.
00:37:21,00:37:25,"-That's the double. -Yeah, it's the double."
00:37:25,00:37:29,-And that's well done. -That's quite a strong one.
00:37:29,00:37:31,"There was, in fact, on a similar vein,"
00:37:31,00:37:32,"there was, and I think the 19--"
00:37:32,00:37:34,-Vain. -The--
00:37:34,00:37:36,Oh.
00:37:36,00:37:37,There was--
00:37:37,00:37:41,Ron's clenching.
00:37:41,00:37:45,"There was a quote in the British Medical Journal in 1935,"
00:37:45,00:37:48,a guy calling for all male children to be circumcised
00:37:48,00:37:51,"in order to reduce masturbation, which he thought was very harmful."
00:37:51,00:37:53,And he was called Richard Cockshut.
00:37:53,00:37:55,-No. -Very good.
00:37:55,00:37:58,"-Shut that cock, kids. -Shut that cock."
00:37:58,00:38:00,-That's a hell of a catchphrase.
00:38:00,00:38:03,"It's a sitcom from the '70s, isn't it?"
00:38:03,00:38:06,"-Larry Grayson, shut that cock."
00:38:06,00:38:08,"-Have you thought about our names and what we,"
00:38:08,00:38:11,"if we were connected to a thing, what would it be?"
00:38:11,00:38:13,-Shrieber is writer. -Shrieber would be writer.
00:38:13,00:38:15,"-Toshinski means, like, little bird."
00:38:15,00:38:17,"-Like a little bird, which is why I'm wearing owls"
00:38:17,00:38:19,on my dress today. -That's right.
00:38:19,00:38:21,-You'll notice I'm never not wearing a bird.
00:38:21,00:38:22,-Is that true? -No.
00:38:22,00:38:27,LAUGHTER
00:38:27,00:38:29,"-I mean, how long have you known that?"
00:38:29,00:38:31,-Yes. Yes and yes.
00:38:31,00:38:33,"But I just thought, ""Oh, my God, I can't believe"
00:38:33,00:38:34,"""I've never noticed that all this time"
00:38:34,00:38:37,"""I'm the worst friend and colleague in the world."""
00:38:37,00:38:39,-It was a test. -I would have thought--
00:38:39,00:38:42,I think Harkin is just a place in Ireland or something.
00:38:42,00:38:44,"-Well, Harkin's-- No, that's got an interesting thing."
00:38:44,00:38:46,"It goes back and back, and so it's sort of, like,"
00:38:46,00:38:48,"changes, but as it goes further back,"
00:38:48,00:38:52,"""bloody"" and ""pig"" are two things."
00:38:52,00:38:55,"-Sounds about right. -So a farmer, maybe?"
00:38:55,00:38:57,"You knew about the chickens earlier, so maybe that's--"
00:38:57,00:39:00,"-What are you? -Well, Murray, yeah."
00:39:00,00:39:03,"-Murray. -I'm surely just a river in Scotland, isn't it?"
00:39:03,00:39:05,"-Yes, sea and settlement is the kind of thing."
00:39:05,00:39:09,"-It sounds a bit like Murray if you were a wedding officiant,"
00:39:09,00:39:11,"maybe, at a stretch. -I'd love to do that."
00:39:11,00:39:14,-He murried me today.
00:39:14,00:39:17,-That sounds disgusting.
00:39:17,00:39:20,You'd rather he'd murried me.
00:39:20,00:39:22,-Do you want to get murried? -Murried?
00:39:22,00:39:25,-No.
00:39:25,00:39:27,"-Reader, I murried him."
