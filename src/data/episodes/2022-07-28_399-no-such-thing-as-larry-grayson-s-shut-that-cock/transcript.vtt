00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.200
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.800
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.360
 this week coming to you live from Amsterdam.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.360
 (audience cheering)

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.680
 My name is Dan Schriver, I am sitting here

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.040
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.960
 and James Harkin, and once again,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.640
 we have gathered 'round the microphones

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.800
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.200
 Starting with fact number one,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.960
 and that is my fact this week.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 My fact is, in 2015, 86 inmates at the Exeter prison

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.720
 wrote an angry letter to their local newspaper,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.560
 complaining that the weekly Sudoku puzzle

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.040
 was too hard to complete.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.640
 (audience laughing)

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.960
 Yeah.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.280
 - You dogs.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.560
 (audience laughing)

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.840
 - I don't think they're gonna be in here tonight.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.080
 - So this was 86 inmates.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.920
 They found it completely impossible.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.240
 It was an unfinished puzzle that they ended up sending in

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.520
 to the editor of a local newspaper.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.760
 - Wasn't impossible, right?

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.800
 - No, it wasn't impossible.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.480
 - The newspaper replied and said actually it is possible.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.640
 Sorry, sorry, sorry, but it was possible.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.060
 Well, they discovered that basically the inmates

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.920
 had got some of the numbers wrong in the middle,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.120
 and once you do that in Sudoku,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.320
 it's impossible to fix it,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.060
 if you're trying to just continue on.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.440
 But how were 86 inmates trying to solve

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.120
 the same Sudoku puzzle?

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.920
 - Because they don't get many newspapers in there,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.760
 so they all join in and take turns and leave.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.440
 - Is there a queue?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.800
 You queue up, you do one number, the next person goes.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.280
 'Cause you can't get heads all around.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.040
 - Like, is there 81 cells in a thing?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.280
 They could have one cell each.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.120
 - Holy, yeah.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.040
 - And then five people to just check it over.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.880
 - Right shout.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.720
 - That's nice.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.560
 - Yeah. - That's a good system.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.880
 - Yeah, so they wrote this letter

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.320
 and it turned out that they were wrong,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.120
 and that is a problem because they get access

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.800
 to Thursday's newspaper,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.880
 but the answers are on a Monday and they don't get that,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.280
 so they couldn't even check it,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.840
 so they were so frustrated, that's annoying.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.320
 That's why they wrote in.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.440
 - But with Sudoku, you know when you've got it right,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.360
 really, you don't need to check.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.840
 Like, you know either you've got it wrong or right, right?

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.800
 I would argue you don't need the Monday's paper.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.680
 You know you fucked up,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.320
 now get back to the word search where you belong, clearly.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.160
 (audience laughing)

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.440
 - Can I just say, honestly,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.000
 you don't always know when you've got it right.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.560
 So for example, at the 2011 World Sudoku Championship,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.080
 one of the contenders called Weihua Huang,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.640
 he jumped up in the final,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.680
 he started high-fiving his friends in the audience,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.560
 he'd won, and a judge had to point out

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.360
 he'd included the same number twice on the top row,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.040
 and then he hadn't won.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.880
 That's a moment.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.040
 - That's unbelievably,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.640
 but it's embarrassing enough to be attending

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.720
 the World Sudoku Championships with Ben.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.920
 - Sudoku is, I mean, it took over the world.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.680
 I don't know if you remember, 2006,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.080
 the world became obsessed with Sudoku,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.000
 and it was basically down to a New Zealander

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.640
 called Wayne Gould, who--

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.120
 - Are we gonna, I'm so sorry,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.960
 but I just know that there'll be 10% of the audience

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.800
 that is driving mad.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.000
 Are we gonna address your pronunciation of Sudoku?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.840
 - Thank you.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.680
 (audience laughing)

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.720
 So how are you saying it?

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.800
 - I'm just saying it how it's pronounced.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.920
 - And how am I saying it?

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.440
 - You're saying it Sudoku.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.280
 - And it's--

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.600
 - Sudoku.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.280
 - Sudoku is what I was saying before.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.120
 - Yes.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.940
 - Yeah.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.780
 - Right.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.620
 - So don't do that.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.940
 - Okay.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.260
 So Sudoku is a--

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.760
 - Tell us about Wayne Gould.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.200
 - So Wayne Gould,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.120
 Wayne Gould was from New Zealand,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.320
 and he basically bumped into it in a newspaper

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.160
 when he was in Hong Kong,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.360
 and he thought this was really interesting.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.720
 And then when he was in England,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.000
 he basically, he sold it effectively

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.560
 like a door-to-door salesman.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.400
 He went to the doors of,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.000
 I think it was the Telegraph newspaper at times.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.260
 That's how I pronounce times.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.260
 (audience laughing)

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.560
 He went to the Times newspaper,

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.920
 and he said, "Check this out."

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.960
 And they liked it, and they started using it.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.640
 And he patented this idea of a computer

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.680
 generating all of the numbers,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.960
 so it could just generate multiple different Sudokas.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.480
 - Did you read the account by the features editor

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.640
 of The Times, this guy called Mike Harvey?

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.460
 And it genuinely was like a door-to-door thing.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.040
 So he got a phone call, Mike Harvey,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.800
 saying, "There's a man who has a puzzle to show you."

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.400
 And so he thought, "Great."

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.320
 (audience laughing)

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.000
 And he said afterwards, Harvey said,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 "I asked one of my staff to get rid of him,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.280
 "but he said he was too busy,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.800
 "so I went down myself, trying to get rid of him."

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.280
 But Wayne Gould had had a mock-up

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.640
 of the back page of The Times made,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.820
 which included a Sudoku on it,

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.360
 and they ran it the following month.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.240
 And as a result of that,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.720
 Wayne Gould was named one of the world's

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.240
 most influential people of 2006 by Time Magazine.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.080
 (audience laughing)

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.920
 That's how big it was.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.760
 - It was a quite year, wasn't it?

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.320
 (audience laughing)

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.360
 But what happened was that The Times decided to run this,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.120
 but the word got out really quickly,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.840
 and so all the other newspapers went,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.640
 "Oh, we're gonna get that in our newspapers as well," right?

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.240
 And it was just after the 2005 election.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.640
 And so kind of, there wasn't much stories left

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.480
 in the newspaper.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.640
 They had lots of inches to fill,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.160
 so they thought, "Let's just bang a load of Sudoku in there."

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.840
 And like The Sun, for instance,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.880
 made a version called Sundoku,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.360
 which featured topless women.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.200
 (audience laughing)

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.440
 - How did you get a nine by nine grid of numbers?

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.360
 - Lots of eights and zeros, I don't know.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.880
 Sixes and nines, I don't know.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.440
 But one newspaper editor said they were so popular,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.400
 they called them Viagra for newspaper circulation.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.240
 - Wow.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.080
 - And the editor of The Observer said,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.640
 "I'd put one on every page

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.160
 if I thought it would increase circulation."

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.000
 - Well, that was the thing.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.520
 When it exploded in America,

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.960
 certain newspapers carried it,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.720
 and the other ones didn't in the early days,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.640
 and people who were lifelong readers of newspapers

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.440
 changed allegiance just for the Sudoku.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.080
 They suddenly were like, "Okay, I'm gonna read

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.680
 the right-wing thing or the left-wing thing

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.520
 that I never read before."

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.960
 - Shit, is that why Brexit happened?

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.760
 It's just 'cause 10 years earlier,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.200
 all these Guardian readers preferred the telegraph Sudoku.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.360
 - I can't believe this fact,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.640
 but I'm gonna say it anyway.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.120
 This was a report in the Daily Mail

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.120
 that said that global pencil sales increased by 700% in 2005.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.960
 - I 100% believe that.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.760
 You would never have a pencil before that.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.920
 I would never have a pencil.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.760
 Why would you?

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.040
 You're a pen, you're not a child.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.640
 You've got to write those little digits up

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.800
 in the top corner then when you get the fill-up,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.840
 then you've got to erase it.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.680
 - Got it.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.720
 - There are just a few more things about the craze,

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.280
 which was all 2005.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.880
 Radio 4 apparently did an audio version of Sudoku.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.600
 I have no idea how that worked.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.920
 I have no idea.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.520
 - They just read out the numbers, didn't they?

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.520
 They went gap, gap, gap, gap, gap, seven, gap, gap, gap.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.520
 - Maybe, yeah.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.360
 - Yeah, that's probably it.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.200
 - Did they?

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.040
 - It seems they.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.680
 - Sky One commissioned a 275-square-foot Sudoku

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.080
 in a chalk hill at Chipping Sodbury.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.760
 - Yeah, but do you know the thing about that?

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.600
 - No.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.440
 - It was wrong.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.760
 - What?

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.400
 - So it was on the bath exit or near the bath exit of the M4

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.440
 and it was specifically put in a place

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.680
 where there was a 40-mile-an-hour speed limit introduced

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.720
 because otherwise it would be dangerous and distracting.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.080
 - Yes, I always try to solve my Sudoku

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.920
 below 40 miles an hour when driving.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.120
 - I keep it to the built-up areas.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.400
 - The responsible way to do it.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.440
 But they offered 5,000 pounds for the first person

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.840
 to solve this, particularly fiendish Sudoku,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.600
 and it was revealed later that it actually had

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.080
 1,905 correct solutions.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.920
 - Wow, wow, yeah.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.640
 - That's the one thing that people hate, isn't it?

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.520
 There's more than one solution.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.480
 This was in the very early days.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.960
 The mail in the telegraph really rushed out the Sudokus

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.480
 and the telegraph's compiler called Michael Mepham,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.880
 he made some puzzles that had more than one solution

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.720
 and he said, "My golly, I did get some mail."

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.200
 (laughing)

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.840
 - What's the problem with it?

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.640
 - It's just because it's unsatisfying

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.480
 if there's lots of different answers.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.360
 - There should only be one right answer.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.960
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:56.920
 - Part of the craze thing,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.680
 one thing that happened in Sydney, Australia,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.360
 there was a court case that was going on for three months.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.440
 They had 105 witnesses

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.600
 and while someone was giving evidence,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.080
 they looked up and they sort of noticed

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.680
 that the jurors were looking a bit distracted

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.600
 and it turned out that they were secretly doing Sudokus

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.400
 underneath their desk

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.400
 and then it turned out that four of them were in cahoots

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.920
 and what they were doing were printing out Sudoku

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.400
 on photocopiers and sharing them around

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.800
 and while the trial was going on

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.040
 and witnesses were talking,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.960
 they were doing it underneath

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.600
 and then comparing notes in the breaks

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.800
 and seeing how far they got.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.920
 Yeah, so that cost a million dollars,

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.320
 that trial up until that point

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.400
 and it had to be thrown out

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.560
 because it turned out the jurors weren't listening.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.560
 - Oh my God, what was it, oh, drug trial?

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.800
 - No, it was for conspiracy

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.560
 to manufacture a commercial quantity of amphetamines.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.240
 - Sounds like a drug trial to me, yeah.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.840
 (audience laughing)

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.960
 But it wasn't, it was a conspiracy trial.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.960
 (audience laughing)

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.280
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.240
 - I was reading an article

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.760
 about the world championships in 2009.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.800
 So what they often do in the world championships

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.040
 is they'll have normal Sudokus

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.440
 and then when you get to the final,

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.680
 they'll give you some kind of crazy Sudokus

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.680
 that are a little bit different,

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.240
 like they might be jigsaws that have to come together,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.640
 might be bigger, and in this case,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.600
 the final variants were so different to normal Sudokus

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.400
 that the winner from the previous two years,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.040
 who's a guy called Thomas Snyder,

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.800
 says it was like playing the final

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.360
 of a basketball championships with a different size ball.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.200
 The hoops are higher up than normal

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.480
 and everyone has trampolines in their shoes.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.320
 - Cool.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.880
 - That was the difference, that's how different it was.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.240
 There was a second puzzle hidden underneath the first puzzle,

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.080
 but then for two of the competitors,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.360
 the first puzzle accidentally fell down halfway through,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.600
 so that gave away the surprise.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.680
 This was all in an article in the Irish press,

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.040
 so they were quite interested in how the Irish team got on,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.760
 and they said that the Irish team came second to last,

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.840
 and three of the four Irish players were beaten

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.600
 by Tiang Xiong, a 10-year-old boy.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.840
 - Aw.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.000
 - The only guy from the Irish team who beat them,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.600
 a guy called Bernard Sellers,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.720
 he said, "I must make it clear

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.600
 "that this is due to incompetence, not lack of effort."

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.440
 (audience laughing)

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.240
 He said, "He has beaten us at Sudoku,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.480
 "but let's see him after a few beers."

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.480
 (audience laughing)

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.520
 - We need to move on, guys.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.640
 We need to get to our next facts.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.480
 - Okay, let's do it.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.120
 - Let's do it, okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.800
 and that is Andy.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.720
 - My fact is that in 1913,

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.600
 it was claimed that French farmers

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.880
 were raising automotive chickens,

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.520
 which were bred specifically

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.120
 to throw themselves under passing cars

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.640
 so the farmer could claim compensation.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.000
 (audience laughing)

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.840
 - Wow.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.600
 - Should we now know the answer to why did the chicken

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.440
 cross the road?

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.800
 - Absolutely, it was on a mission.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.120
 - Do we think this is true?

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.960
 - I don't.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.120
 (audience laughing)

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.400
 Everyone else has been to think what they like,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.160
 I think it's hooey.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.240
 But it was printed in a newspaper called Le Figaro,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.640
 from a famous French paper,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.720
 and, yeah, farmers were breeding this chicken

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.160
 so that the owner could claim five francs

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.480
 or whatever of damages from a driver,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.520
 and I just find it hilarious that--

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.440
 - I did find one guy called William K. Vanderbilt.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.760
 He was known as a scorcher.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.480
 He was American, not French,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.280
 but he was well known that he would pay compensation

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.160
 if he ever hit your animals.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.680
 And so there was newspaper articles

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.360
 that people would deliberately push livestock into his way.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.200
 - Yeah.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.200
 - So it was kind of some of it happening, wasn't it?

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.040
 - Poor sucker.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.120
 I wonder how many times he had a chicken suddenly appear

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.080
 in front of his car before he started to suspect.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.200
 It was like the 12th time that day.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.520
 It's just like another cow.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.360
 - Yeah.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.200
 - Come on, guys.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.040
 - Some people said it was horses

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.480
 that got pushed in the way of his car.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.320
 - Really?

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.280
 - You think he must have been quite a bad driver

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.280
 if you can't see a horse.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.120
 - He should be.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.680
 - How could you get a chicken to do that, by the way?

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.520
 How could you?

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.360
 - You couldn't.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.200
 It's not a thing.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.560
 - No, but if he was paying compensation all the time.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.400
 - You could throw it.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.240
 - You can chuck it.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.080
 - You could throw it.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:41.920
 - Wait a minute, you can.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.760
 - You could get a chicken to do that.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.080
 - You can get a chicken to do that.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.320
 - Someone in the audience has just claimed

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.920
 I could get a chicken to do that.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.880
 - For one second, I forgot we were in Devon.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.880
 (audience laughing)

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.520
 - I'll do that.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.080
 - I think if you were to draw a white line on the ground,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.480
 sometimes chickens will just follow that white line,

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.320
 wouldn't they?

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.160
 - That's true.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.000
 - I think that's a thing.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.360
 - That guy, Vanderbilt, William Vanderbilt,

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.640
 he was like a squillionaire.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.680
 And this fact came from a great article,

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.400
 I think in Littub, the website,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.160
 and it mentioned that he had these crazy adventures.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.560
 He may have been the inspiration for Mr. Toad

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.880
 in The Wind and the Willows.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.960
 You know, he's always got his car,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.480
 and he's going poop-poop, and all of this.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.320
 And...

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.160
 (audience laughing)

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.400
 - That's a good impersonation.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.240
 - Poop-poop.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.800
 - You know, get out of our way.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.840
 He's Mr. Toad.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.680
 - Sure, anyway.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.120
 Okay, but he did have a lot of crazy adventures,

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.880
 which were even more exciting than Mr. Toad's adventures.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.120
 So in 1899, visiting France,

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.480
 he had to kill two dogs,

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.840
 which were trying to bite his tires,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.040
 and then flee from a mop.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.240
 - He had to kill two dogs.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.360
 - Circumstances forced him to shoot.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.200
 He did a lot.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.120
 He had a gun a lot of the time.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.440
 He traveled with a gun, like Mr. Toad.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.200
 You know, crowds with whips and rocks

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.080
 were trying to attack him

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.800
 because he was just such a reckless driver,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.720
 and he'd shoot in the air and shoot over their heads

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.360
 and then drive off saying "poop-poop."

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.480
 (audience laughing)

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.200
 - They weren't, people were just generally terrified

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.840
 about the car for a long time as well,

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.040
 and angry and farmers especially,

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.240
 but around the same time in Pennsylvania,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.040
 the legislature passed a law

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.800
 that all cars traveling on country roads at night

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.880
 had to send up a rocket every mile

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.320
 to let everyone know that they were coming.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.660
 - Sorry, God.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.520
 - It's just, you know, big on firework.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.760
 - I think suggested the law rather than passed it, though.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.560
 - No, they passed, the legislature passed the law

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.520
 and then it was rejected by the governor.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.800
 So the legislature said, "Pass this law,"

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.600
 and then they had to send a rocket up every mile,

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.160
 explode it, then wait for 10 minutes for the road to clear,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.400
 and then the driver had to proceed with caution,

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.960
 blowing his horn and shooting off Roman candles

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.640
 as before. - What the hell?

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.840
 Wow.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.280
 - So if you were on your horse,

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.080
 you'd have to judge was that a mile or two miles

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.560
 that the rocket went up, right?

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.240
 - Do you think there was like, you know,

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.280
 when a thunderstorm's coming and you count the seconds?

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.120
 Was it like that?

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.120
 - Yeah, between the light and the sound.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.920
 - Yeah, yeah, that would work.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.760
 - Patent number 1,122,742 in America.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.320
 - Don't tell me, don't tell me, I know this one.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.360
 - I'm so annoyed, I know the one before.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.920
 - Yes, it was a huge knife that you attached

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.240
 to the front of your car.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.120
 Can you guess, can you guess why you might do that?

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:11.960
 - Cababs.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.800
 Chicken, chicken, cabab.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.400
 (all laughing)

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.720
 - Just to make everyone get the fuck off the road.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.680
 - Kind of.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.400
 So like Hannah said, people were really scared of cars,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.640
 but they also hated them.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.360
 And there was a thing where people put ropes

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.000
 across the road to try and stop you from going too fast,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.400
 'cause then it would like, you know,

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.000
 like a barrier would stop you.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.240
 And so this thing was invented to kind of cut those ropes.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.080
 - Wow.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.580
 - Nice.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.080
 - It's crazy, what do you read about it?

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.520
 Because it sounds like it was just hectic

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.280
 to drive a car in those early days.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.360
 There were accounts of where sort of like farmers

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.240
 and locals would sort of sprinkle nails

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.960
 and broken glass on the road.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.400
 They would, as you say, tie ropes across.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.040
 They would dig holes in the ground.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.320
 So they would just, you know, fall into it.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.080
 There was a story that near Sacramento in California,

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.160
 13 cars were captured.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.620
 You know, like captured is the word they use in the article.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.460
 Yeah.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.520
 - And they were trying to stop people from speeding.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.480
 So there was one town in America

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.800
 where they put a big sign up just said,

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.620
 "The speed limit this year is a secret."

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.680
 (all laughing)

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.000
 And the idea is everyone drives and they go,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.640
 "Oh shit, I'm gonna have to go slow now

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.600
 'cause it's probably really low."

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.440
 - God, so good.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.480
 - It sounds really fun.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.040
 It sounds like it's like doing an obstacle course

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.120
 driving back in the day.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.200
 It's like you're rally driving or something.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.280
 - It's very west, isn't it?

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.120
 - Yeah.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.640
 - But one of the legitimate concerns,

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.560
 which is like the opposite of the concern we have now

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.240
 with driverless cars, is that humans were gonna have

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.360
 to be responsible for concentrating the whole time.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.440
 'Cause if you think about it,

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.560
 cars back then were called horseless carriages, basically.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.400
 And the difference between a horseless carriage

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.960
 and a horse carriage is that you can kind of leave

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.400
 the horse to do most of the work,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.040
 much like a driverless car.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.720
 So, you know, if you're driving,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.480
 if you're the cabbie, you can lose concentration.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.480
 You can have a chat with your friend.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.880
 You can have a little snooze.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.680
 The horse has it under control.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.560
 And one of the terrors was that, you know,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.840
 if you're driving, then it's all up to the human.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.680
 And we're shit.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.520
 - Yeah.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.360
 - And they were right.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.960
 - Another thing in the 1920s, there was a judge

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.000
 who said that the automobile was a house of prostitution

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.280
 on wheels and that of the 30 girls that had been brought

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.200
 in front of him charged with sex crimes,

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.880
 19 offenses had occurred in cars.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.720
 - Really?

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.520
 - So there's a real worry that young people

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.080
 are going to be able to get away from their parents and stuff

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.720
 and they would be in an enclosed vehicle

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.680
 and you never know what they're going to get up to.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.920
 - Well, Madame Bovary, right?

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.280
 Didn't Madame Bovary have sex in a car?

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.120
 - Carriage.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:31.960
 - Carriage.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.800
 - That was the big thing, wasn't it?

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.640
 - A horse car, yeah.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.360
 - And in 1926, the Cleveland Motor Company

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.760
 realised this was happening

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.600
 and so they invented the honeymoon special car.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.920
 And that came equipped with a foldable bed

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.920
 which could be put up in just one minute

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.000
 and the doors were fitted with curtains.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.600
 - That's really rude.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.440
 (audience laughing)

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.920
 - For the 20s?

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.760
 - Guys.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.800
 - For the 20s, you're all saucepots.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.640
 - Yeah?

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.800
 - I thought you were going to say there was a car company

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.040
 which invented the car with a knife in the middle

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.480
 so you can't go near anyone.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.280
 An inflatable dad of the daughter or something.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.720
 (audience laughing)

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.680
 - I liked this in 1895 in the spectator.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.360
 It was talking about how when the car first came about,

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.200
 everyone said horses were going to disappear

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.920
 off the face of the earth, which was kind of true,

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.280
 but it happened more slowly than people had predicted.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.200
 And the spectator wrote, "When the car first appeared,

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.480
 "it was a common prophecy that the horse was a doomed animal,

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.120
 "but the threatened institution of the horse-drawn cab

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.000
 "has managed somehow, like the House of Lords,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.840
 "to survive in full vigor."

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.880
 (audience laughing)

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.600
 I just love the idea that even in 1895,

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.080
 people were looking at the House of Lords going,

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.840
 "How the fuck is this still surviving?"

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.680
 (audience laughing)

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.520
 - That's so funny.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.360
 - It feels like that.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.000
 So one of the big problems with all these early day cars

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.360
 is that they would come round

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.840
 and they would spray dust on these roads into houses.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.040
 And in France, where this fact begins,

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.680
 we were talking about the fact that

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.160
 it was really badly received.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.720
 And part of that was people trying to say

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.680
 rent out villas and so on.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.840
 They were losing all their business

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.680
 'cause as cars came by, all this spray of dust came

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.120
 and no one wanted to be there.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.480
 So roads were effectively invented

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.840
 by people trying to stop that

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.160
 because they started putting basically asphalt and so on

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.360
 just outside their house, just strips,

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.440
 so that when the car went over, it would miss the house.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.720
 And then it kind of, my theory is it caught on

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.520
 and they went, "Oh, let's put more of that down."

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.760
 - That's a good theory.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.320
 There was in 1905,

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.120
 the Royal Commission on Motoring was held in Britain.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.040
 And they again, were looking at the dust

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.400
 and saying, "This is terrible."

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.760
 They blamed the dust for throat and eye infections,

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.280
 for the inability to hand washing to dry,

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.400
 and the clogging of at least one

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.240
 lady novelist's typewriter.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.560
 (audience laughing)

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.080
 - Things are serious.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.960
 (audience laughing)

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.320
 - It's so funny.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.200
 - We need to move on in a sec to our next fact.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.040
 - I've just got one more thing.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:49.880
 - Yeah, go for it.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.760
 - Well, I found it 'cause I was searching about chickens

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.320
 and cars, and it's a piece of advice

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.920
 about playing chicken in a car.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.240
 - Oh yeah.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.400
 - I mean, don't, but if you are,

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.200
 there's advice from a 1960 work

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.040
 called The Strategy of Conflict by--

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.760
 - Okay, so chicken is like two cars

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.920
 driving up to each other and it's like--

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.520
 - Absolutely, you're driving towards each other

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.200
 and whoever swears first loses, you know?

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.240
 And this is by a Nobel laureate called Thomas Shelling.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.880
 So it's legit stuff, all right?

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.920
 And what he said is that extreme irrationality

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.080
 can be rational.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.400
 So if you are playing chicken in a car,

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.320
 the best thing to do is rip off the steering wheel

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.560
 from the column and throw it out of the window.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.840
 But you should only do that if you are confident

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.880
 that the other driver has seen you do it.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.960
 (audience laughing)

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.680
 - Oh wow.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.520
 - Yeah.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.360
 - What year was that?

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.200
 Is that early day as well?

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.040
 - It was 1960.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.880
 He died the next year, weirdly.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.720
 - I'm 1960.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.080
 (audience laughing)

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.000
 - Horrible car crash.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.160
 (audience laughing)

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.640
 - I read about the first car, horn,

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.600
 which was in 1649.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.440
 - Huh?

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.920
 - And this is car as in a horseless carriage.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.000
 And it was a carriage invented by a guy called Johann Housh

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.040
 and it was a dragon which went at the front of the carriage

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.480
 and it rolled its eyes and it spouted water

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.040
 to clear pedestrians out of the way.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.120
 - That sounds fucking cool.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:00.960
 - Isn't that cool?

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.560
 And the horn part was carved angels on either side

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.440
 holding trumpets that were constantly blown.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.400
 - Oh wow.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.200
 - And this didn't need any horses to pull it

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.800
 amazingly, this vehicle.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.520
 Although it did have two men concealed

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.680
 under the body of it who had to run along

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.520
 with the outside stones.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.360
 - What the flip stones?

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.160
 (audience laughing)

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.000
 That's incredible.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.520
 - Yeah.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.280
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.240
 Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.760
 and that is Anna.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.360
 - My fact this week is that when libraries flood,

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.840
 the books are saved by putting them in the freezer

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.480
 and then vacuuming them.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.320
 - Wow.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.280
 - Yeah, I was reading about library book salvage

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.520
 and it's so cool.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.200
 So basically any library worth its salt

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.360
 has to either have its own massive industrial freezer

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.880
 or have access to an industrial freezer

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.240
 and you freeze the paper as soon as it's got wet.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.280
 And this is both with floods and fires

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.440
 'cause the biggest problem really for books

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.800
 and libraries with fires is the getting wet afterwards.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.720
 Usually they're put out in time

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.800
 but they're put out with so much water

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.480
 that they get covered in water.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.080
 If you freeze it immediately,

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.200
 then the water stops making the ink bleed

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.800
 and it stops mold growing and all of those things.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.800
 But then obviously you've just got a massive freezer

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.640
 full of frozen books.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.480
 - Yeah.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.920
 - It's really difficult to read

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.440
 and you can't just melt it.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.080
 And so then you vacuum it by which I mean,

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.440
 put it in a massive vacuum chamber

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.280
 and that means that the water can go straight from a solid

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.280
 to a gas, can sublimate GCSE chemistry there

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.200
 'cause it like reduces the pressure in the air

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.080
 if it's in a vacuum.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.040
 And so that means that there's like not enough pressure

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.360
 for water to form, right?

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.520
 It becomes gas immediately

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.800
 'cause there's so much space.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.640
 All the solid ice molecules just jump around in the space

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.480
 and become a gas.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.320
 - That is amazing.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.040
 You can not just buy some new books.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.080
 (audience laughs)

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.200
 - Shit, you should mention that.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.600
 Yeah, a lot of time has been wasted.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.640
 - Yeah, now these are precious old books, aren't they?

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.480
 - Oh, okay, got it.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.320
 - Yeah, these are the originals.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.840
 - Yeah, there was one, there was a massive library fire

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.080
 in 1986, the biggest library fire in America.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.240
 It was in Central Library in LA

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.000
 and that one they had to ask a load of,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.480
 there were a lot of fishermen in LA

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.560
 and they had to ask the fishermen

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.440
 to lend them all of their fish freezers,

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.280
 put the books in.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.280
 - I didn't see where you were going with that at all.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.200
 I thought you were gonna say

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.680
 they had to get the fishermen to get the books

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.760
 out of the library with their rods

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.040
 because it was still too dangerous in there.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.960
 - They're very attracted to maggots' books, actually.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.320
 They leap up.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.360
 And the reason, and that really is, if you look that up,

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.840
 it doesn't go down that much in history

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.040
 because it happened three days after Chernobyl

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.720
 and so it was very much buried

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.200
 in a slightly bigger explosion that week.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.040
 The only paper that put it like proper front and center,

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.440
 I think, or this is what I read in a book

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.560
 called The Library Book,

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.680
 which is very good book by Susan Orleans.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.520
 - Pravda in the Soviet Union, funny enough.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.200
 - There was nothing else happening that day.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.480
 - Exactly.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.960
 How embarrassing for America there's library fire, right?

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.560
 Look at that.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.520
 - They should have, like in libraries, just giant freezers.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.280
 You know, in Australia, when you go to the bottle shop,

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.560
 the bottle load, there's always this wine shop.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.400
 - Just a wine shop?

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.120
 - Yeah, wine shop, and you get beers.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.040
 There's always this giant freezer room that you go into.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.680
 It's freezing to be inside,

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.680
 but it's very common in every bottle shop that you get there.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.080
 And yeah, they should have that,

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.960
 just where all the precious books just can't be hung.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.120
 - Well, I suppose some of the bigger places do, right?

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.240
 Like the Natural History Museum, not a library,

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.240
 but they have a huge freezer.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.160
 Can you guess what's the largest animal

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.120
 they could fit in the freezer?

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.440
 - Seal, but a big seal.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.560
 - A Diplodocus.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.400
 - Diplodocus, giraffe.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.920
 The answer is a fully grown rhino.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.760
 They could fit that in there.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.840
 And the largest fridge in the world, 2,800 pole away,

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.520
 this is in Richland, Washington, in America,

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.800
 that is big enough to fit every single living rhino in the world.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.640
 - Wow.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.280
 - And actually they have a bit of space as well.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.480
 They'd have to be on top of each other's shoulders.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.200
 - I don't think that's gonna be your biggest logistical problem

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.320
 in terms of gathering all the rhinos,

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.320
 getting them to the fridge.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.400
 I think once you've done that,

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.240
 shoving them in is gonna be an easy job.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.640
 - Yeah, okay.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.720
 - Whose fridge is this and how big is the party they're having?

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.440
 - This is a huge fridge that they use in America.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.680
 Their farmers will send all their goods there,

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.600
 and it will keep the fruits and vegetables

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.040
 kind of fresher for a bit longer.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:07.880
 - Nice.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.720
 - Really nice.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.840
 - Imagine how many magnets you can get on that.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.680
 So many.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.440
 - That's a lot of shit drawings from your children, isn't it?

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.320
 - Libraries.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.400
 You know the Bodleian Library in Oxford?

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.240
 - Yeah.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.080
 - I think it's one of only three libraries

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.120
 which gets a copy of every single book published in the UK.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.560
 So it's the Cambridge Library,

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.840
 the Oxford University Library,

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.560
 which is the Bodleian and the British Library.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.720
 For 250 years, the Librarian of the Bodleian

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.200
 was supposed to be celibate, and none of them were.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.840
 It was one of the main,

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.720
 there was a guy, found it by a guy called Thomas Bodley,

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.000
 who had read this main thing,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.680
 and he wrote up a list of rules when he was founding the library.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.120
 The first rule was celibate.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.440
 I want no Librarian to have sex ever.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.840
 The first Librarian got married that year,

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.600
 the year he founded it.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.360
 All the successes did pretty much,

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.840
 and it was 250 years, it was kept in place,

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.680
 and then they repealed it saying,

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.160
 "This is a ridiculous rule."

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.200
 And why celibate, 'cause you must love the books

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.640
 more than you could ever love the human flesh?

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.720
 Or what, why?

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.240
 What a lovely poetic way, I think it's...

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.080
 They didn't want to get any come-in-the-books?

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.400
 Yeah. Oh, my God!

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.680
 Wow. Oh, my God!

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.200
 That's poetic from James.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.480
 No? No?

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.880
 It wasn't that, no, I think it was...

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.720
 It's sort of gas.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.400
 Yeah, no, it's fine, and I'm blushing on stage now.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.040
 I didn't say... Oh, my God.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.760
 I think it was because it was kind of connected to the priesthood,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.280
 and so it kind of came from that tradition that he was...

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.000
 But Bobby himself was a bit of a mug.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.400
 He said they didn't want idle books and riff-raffs,

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.240
 which was anything not in Latin.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.000
 And the library got a first folio of Shakespeare's works.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.880
 Pretty good, pretty nice book in 1623, pretty valuable.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.480
 And then a few decades later, the third folio came out,

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.240
 and they just sold the first folio off.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.440
 They said, "Well, we don't need this. We've got a more modern one now."

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.000
 And so as a result, they had to...

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.680
 Yeah, just on random, fun things about libraries,

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.440
 I was reading about Berkeley Library in America,

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.360
 and they have every year an edible book festival.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.960
 And the idea is that there's a few categories,

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.520
 but one of the main things is you need to do food-based puns

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.440
 on existing books.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:21.400
 So "Infinite Jest" becomes "Infinite Zest," for example.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.840
 So I've got a little quiz for you guys.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.840
 Okay, okay.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.160
 Wait, who needs to do... How does it work?

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.600
 I'm going to give you the book name and see if you can guess

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.120
 what they did with it.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.640
 "Waiting for Goddow."

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.280
 "Waiting for Cheddar."

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.880
 "Waiting for Gouda." Would be better.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.720
 There we go. That's much better.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.720
 1-0 to James.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.040
 He just crossed it, and I just knotted it in the corner.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:41.880
 That's okay.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.720
 "Game of Thrones."

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.720
 "Game of Cheddar."

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.600
 "Game of Bones?"

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.600
 "Game of Skones."

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.840
 Also, "game" is already a type of meat.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.480
 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.480
 James is submitting "no change."

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.720
 Technically, "game" is a kind of meat.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.480
 Question number three, "One flu over the cuckoo's nest."

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.000
 "You can eat a cuckoo," says James.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 "No change."

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.200
 "One flu over a cuckoo's nest."

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:12.920
 Oh, yeah, that's good.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.400
 "One flu over the cuckoo's nest."

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.920
 "One flu over the cuckoo's nest."

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.200
 "Cuckoo's nest."

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.600
 Can we play this for the rest of the podcast?

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.360
 I'm going to join you so much, so I'll give you two more, okay?

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.800
 "Something Wicked This Way Comes."

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.920
 "Something Wicked This Way Bones?"

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.040
 Very good, but no, it's "Dumpling Wicked This Way Comes."

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.760
 "Dumpling Wicked This Way Comes."

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.720
 "Heart of Darkness" is the last one.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.200
 "Heart of Cheddar."

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.560
 It's correct. No, it's not.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.160
 Well, actually, "part" is already part of an animal that you can eat.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.240
 "Altichoke Heart of Darkness."

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.200
 Oh, that's good.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:53.440
 It's "Heart of Darkness," and I think Andy takes it with a win there.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.640
 I demand a recap.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.720
 Have you guys heard of Barbara Pratt?

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.720
 No.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.360
 This is now more on refrigeration than on libraries.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:07.120
 But she was hired by the shipping company Sea Land, who's now MERSC.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:12.080
 And basically what would happen is they would refrigerate fruits and vegetables and stuff

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.160
 and send it around the world, and then sometimes it would be fine

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.000
 and sometimes it would be rotten and no one could work out why.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.080
 And so Barbara Pratt spent seven years living in shipping containers,

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.400
 being shipped around the world with a load of vegetables

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.040
 and working out how to stop them from going rotten.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.560
 Whoa.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.880
 Is that the one thing more boring than watching paint dry?

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.240
 Watching vegetables rot.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.440
 She is an absolutely hero.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.440
 Incredible.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.680
 Isn't that amazing?

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.440
 She had bunk bed.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.000
 I don't know why she had a bunk bed, because I can't imagine that.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.840
 Because she had to have some fun, and bunk beds are fun.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.120
 I mean, that's pretty boring.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.840
 I would say, like the Budley, and this is a place where you're probably celibate

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.760
 if you're doing this job.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.240
 But yes, she would monitor temperature, airflow, humidity, all that kind of stuff.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.880
 She had loads of microprocessors, all that kind of stuff,

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.920
 and eventually worked out the regimes that they used today

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.840
 to make sure that peppers and watermelons and stuff can go around the world and not go off.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.240
 That's great. Isn't that amazing?

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.080
 Did they ever have like an inspection of the shipping container,

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:15.600
 and they just open it and they find a load of watermelons and Barbara Pratt just goes,

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.800
 "Hello."

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.360
 I fear that didn't happen.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.640
 That's so good.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.120
 On fridges, you know there's a Guinness World Record for the world's largest fridge.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.120
 Oh, is it not the one that I talked about in America?

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.320
 No, it's not that.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.920
 Yeah, the official, according to Guinness World Records,

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.160
 is the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.160
 And it's because it has 9,300 magnets inside it,

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.560
 and they need to be kept at an exact temperature.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.760
 And so it's got 10,800 tons of liquid nitrogen,

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.080
 60 tons of liquid helium, and that creates the...

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.000
 Does it count as a fridge if you can't put your cold rice from the night before in it?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.240
 But hang on a second.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.520
 We said in the first ever episode of Fish

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.360
 that the Large Hadron Collider had to be stopped

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.400
 because a bit of tuna baguette was dropped into it.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.520
 That's right.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.840
 So if that is still in there, then it counts as a fridge.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:14.160
 We need to move on to our next fact.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.480
 It is time for our final fact of the show,

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.200
 and that is James.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.640
 OK, my fact this week is that there is an ophthalmologist

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.800
 at the University of Leiden called Dr I.C. Notting.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:34.800
 It does work better in an Irish accent, doesn't it?

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.720
 It does, and I'm not going to do it.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:41.600
 So this was a post that I saw on the website improbable.com,

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.360
 which is run by Mark Abraham, who is a friend of ours,

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.800
 who's been on Fish, actually, and he runs the Ig Nobel Prizes,

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.760
 but he noticed this person.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.120
 And she was part of a team in May this year

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:58.640
 that replaced both lenses in the eyes of a chimpanzee called Fifi.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.600
 Fifi could no longer tolerate light

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.920
 because of the situation that she'd been in,

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.400
 and so, like, really had the lenses had gone all cloudy,

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.720
 and she was the first person to ever do in Europe

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.160
 a double cataract operation on a chimpanzee.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.960
 That's super cool, but at the same time a shame,

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.120
 because I just want to see a chimpanzee wearing sunglasses

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.720
 for the rest of their life.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:22.280
 And apart from that, I know Notting more about Dr Notting.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.880
 She specialises in neuro-ophthalmology, cataracts,

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.960
 and trabismus, which I didn't know means being cross-eyed,

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.960
 and she's got a load of papers online,

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.200
 but they're so far out of my pay grade.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.480
 It's unbelievable.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.000
 The latest one is spectral domain optical coherence tomography

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.800
 in retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.720
 and systemic manifestations

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.800
 and monogenic small vessel disease.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.080
 Right. She sounds clever.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.560
 She sounds super clever.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.720
 She's got a funny name.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.360
 I did find another optometrist called Hugh Seymour, which is a...

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.720
 That's great.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.560
 There's a big list of ophthalmologists on Wikipedia,

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.880
 and I went down looking for an app name.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.320
 There was a guy who was the first person to prove

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.160
 that providone iodine could be safely used

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.280
 as an antimicrobial for the eyes.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.480
 He's got a very apt name. His name was Leonard Apt.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.160
 Right.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.920
 He's going to be at home listening to this, thinking,

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:24.080
 "Oh, no, they've done it again."

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.560
 So, this fact is basically nominative determinism,

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.360
 and the idea of that is you've got a name

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.880
 that matches the job that you're doing.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.520
 So, for example, the professor of geology at Exeter University

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.080
 is called Dr Stone.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.200
 Did they become professor of that because of the name?

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.320
 Did it lead them towards that?

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.640
 And there's a lot of people who say there's no truth in that,

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.720
 but it is fun when you notice people

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.880
 that seem to have gone into it.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:52.040
 So, Leiden, where you were saying, "I see nothing" is from,

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.640
 I looked at the University of Leiden,

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.200
 which is a different university,

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.280
 just to see if there was any people

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.880
 who had similar names to the thing that they do.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:04.160
 So, I found there's a professor of religion called Peter Bishop,

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.200
 but it's Bishop, but it's very, very close.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.880
 The professor of European law is Rick Lawson,

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.400
 and they have a professor of anthropology

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.360
 who's called Gerard Person.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.920
 Oh, that's good.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.840
 So, do you think that Leiden University

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.760
 is just literally choosing people just based on their names?

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.240
 Yeah, sounds like it.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.400
 Well, you'd think that academics would be above this kind of thing,

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.240
 and if they heard this, they'd be like, "Come on,

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.560
 just talk about my area of knowledge."

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.480
 But this is one of my favourite things.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.640
 I don't think we've ever mentioned it.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.880
 One of the most important papers ever written in astrophysics,

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.880
 the authors were Alpha, Beta and Gamma.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.200
 (LAUGHTER)

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.640
 It's not quite Gamma, but it's close enough.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.280
 And the reason for this is a guy called George Gamma,

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.160
 who's the professor on the project.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.760
 And this paper was so important.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.200
 It was in 1948, and it basically discovered

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.000
 that the background radiation of the Big Bang

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.320
 essentially kind of justified the Big Bang happening,

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.880
 and it talked about that it created hydrogen and helium

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.600
 and all the elements that we now live with today

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.040
 in their proportions. Seminal paper.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.640
 So the lead author was George Gamma.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.080
 His PhD student was Ralph Alpha.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.960
 George Gamma said, "Hey, Ralph, wouldn't it be so funny?

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.520
 "I've got a colleague called Beta.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.440
 "He's really nothing to do with this whole astrophysics thing,

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.720
 "but let's put him as an author on the paper,

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.640
 "and then I'll be Alpha, Beta, Gamma."

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.920
 And Alpha said, "Absolutely not.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.120
 "This is a huge deal for me. I'm a PhD student."

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.320
 No, and he got completely ignored.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.600
 And in fact, not only that, but George Gamma asked

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.600
 another one of his colleagues called Herman

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.400
 if he'd changed his name to Delta in all they could.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.120
 Oh, wow. That's too far.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.040
 And they went ahead, and, like, he was furious.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.440
 Ralph Alpha was so angry for years afterwards,

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.200
 said it completely, like, undid my great achievements.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.200
 So, okay, yeah, nominative determinism.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.440
 We think it's probably bunk,

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.320
 but there was a paper by a group of researchers

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.320
 about medical workers and, you know,

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.440
 all kinds of medical work, and it was a group of researchers

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.520
 who found that there was a greater frequency of medical names

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.640
 in various specialisms than you would expect by chance.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.960
 And the researchers were named Lim, Lim, Lim and Lim.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.760
 They were in the same family, but still.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.840
 So, you know, they looked in the American director of physicians,

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.040
 and they found lots of doctors with the surname Doctor,

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.240
 or Fix, or Cure, or Heal.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.520
 And they also found that some promising partnerships

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.680
 failed to materialise.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.680
 Doctors Batman and Robin are registered,

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.560
 but failed to team up in any speciality.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.000
 It's selfish. It's almost like they've got bigger priorities.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.440
 And the paper which debunked it, which most people point at,

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.240
 was in the Journal of Personal and Social Psychology,

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.480
 and it was called "I Sell Seashells by the Seashore"

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.120
 and my name is Jack.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:47.840
 -Killjoy. -That's so good.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.800
 I think now, because we've talked about

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.720
 so much nominative determinism over the years,

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.560
 as in just names that are very apt.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.280
 And now, I feel like we have to go a level up,

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.000
 so you've got to, like, do the doubles.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 You know, if two of someone's names are nominative deterministic,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.360
 like Andrew Drinkwater.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.880
 I think that's the loudest head of research

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.240
 at the Water Research Centre.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.480
 -That's good. -He drinks water.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.080
 I think that's okay.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.040
 I also like doubles.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.200
 I just spend quite a lot of time looking at the students' guide

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.840
 to the seashore that was written by fish and fish.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.320
 I probably spent an hour desperately trying to find out

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.760
 if they were related and hoping they weren't,

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.840
 because then that would be an amazing catch.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.000
 -Yeah. -Hey.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.280
 They are husband and wife.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.880
 I've discovered deep in the bowels of Cardiff University website.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.640
 I think, and also, Andy's favourite thing of words,

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.320
 like, name sentences.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.480
 -Yes. -Yeah, so what are the examples of that we always say?

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.960
 Like, Ben Folds and Jeremy Irons.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.560
 -Tom Waits. -Yeah, yeah, I think--

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.240
 -Wesley Snipes. -Sting.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.120
 -Sti-- no, not sting. -No.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.600
 It works if it's an imperative, but that's not a proper--

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:55.920
 -Sorry, James. -I was reading a study from 2018,

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.640
 and this is about injecting medicine directly into your eyes.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.040
 Okay, that sounds pretty awful,

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.120
 but apparently, if you have something called macular edema,

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.640
 it really, really helps.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.960
 And the person who came up with that idea

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.960
 was a physician called Douglas Jabs.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.800
 -Oh, that's great. -Sentence person.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.440
 -Annenominative determinism. -Yeah, that's amazing.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.200
 -Takes the screen. -I found a urologist

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.040
 who performs vasectomies called Dr. Richard Chopp,

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.720
 aka Dr. Dick Chopp.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.160
 -That's the double. -Yeah, it's the double.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:29.720
 -And that's well done. -That's quite a strong one.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.520
 There was, in fact, on a similar vein,

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.720
 there was, and I think the 19--

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.720
 -Vain. -The--

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.040
 Oh.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.840
 There was--

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.440
 Ron's clenching.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:45.040
 There was a quote in the British Medical Journal in 1935,

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.280
 a guy calling for all male children to be circumcised

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.400
 in order to reduce masturbation, which he thought was very harmful.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.960
 And he was called Richard Cockshut.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.960
 -No. -Very good.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.840
 -Shut that cock, kids. -Shut that cock.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.840
 -That's a hell of a catchphrase.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.360
 It's a sitcom from the '70s, isn't it?

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.440
 -Larry Grayson, shut that cock.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.440
 -Have you thought about our names and what we,

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.040
 if we were connected to a thing, what would it be?

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.720
 -Shrieber is writer. -Shrieber would be writer.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.320
 -Toshinski means, like, little bird.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.080
 -Like a little bird, which is why I'm wearing owls

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.160
 on my dress today. -That's right.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.000
 -You'll notice I'm never not wearing a bird.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.600
 -Is that true? -No.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:27.120
 LAUGHTER

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.400
 -I mean, how long have you known that?

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.360
 -Yes. Yes and yes.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.160
 But I just thought, "Oh, my God, I can't believe

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.920
 "I've never noticed that all this time

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.560
 "I'm the worst friend and colleague in the world."

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.440
 -It was a test. -I would have thought--

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.040
 I think Harkin is just a place in Ireland or something.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.040
 -Well, Harkin's-- No, that's got an interesting thing.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.640
 It goes back and back, and so it's sort of, like,

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.640
 changes, but as it goes further back,

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.440
 "bloody" and "pig" are two things.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.040
 -Sounds about right. -So a farmer, maybe?

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.640
 You knew about the chickens earlier, so maybe that's--

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.200
 -What are you? -Well, Murray, yeah.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.240
 -Murray. -I'm surely just a river in Scotland, isn't it?

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.200
 -Yes, sea and settlement is the kind of thing.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:09.120
 -It sounds a bit like Murray if you were a wedding officiant,

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.640
 maybe, at a stretch. -I'd love to do that.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.320
 -He murried me today.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.400
 -That sounds disgusting.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.760
 You'd rather he'd murried me.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.640
 -Do you want to get murried? -Murried?

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.240
 -No.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.720
 -Reader, I murried him.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:32.800
 -We need a wrap-up.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.360
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.040
