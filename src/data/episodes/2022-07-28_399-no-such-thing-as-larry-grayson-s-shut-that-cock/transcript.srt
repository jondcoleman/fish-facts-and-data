1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,200
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,800
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,360
 this week coming to you live from Amsterdam.

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,360
 (audience cheering)

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,680
 My name is Dan Schriver, I am sitting here

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,040
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,960
 and James Harkin, and once again,

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,640
 we have gathered 'round the microphones

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,800
 and in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,200
 Starting with fact number one,

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,960
 and that is my fact this week.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,960
 My fact is, in 2015, 86 inmates at the Exeter prison

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,720
 wrote an angry letter to their local newspaper,

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,560
 complaining that the weekly Sudoku puzzle

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,040
 was too hard to complete.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,640
 (audience laughing)

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,960
 Yeah.

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,280
 - You dogs.

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,560
 (audience laughing)

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,840
 - I don't think they're gonna be in here tonight.

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,080
 - So this was 86 inmates.

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,920
 They found it completely impossible.

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,240
 It was an unfinished puzzle that they ended up sending in

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,520
 to the editor of a local newspaper.

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,760
 - Wasn't impossible, right?

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,800
 - No, it wasn't impossible.

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,480
 - The newspaper replied and said actually it is possible.

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,640
 Sorry, sorry, sorry, but it was possible.

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,060
 Well, they discovered that basically the inmates

32
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,920
 had got some of the numbers wrong in the middle,

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,120
 and once you do that in Sudoku,

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,320
 it's impossible to fix it,

35
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,060
 if you're trying to just continue on.

36
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,440
 But how were 86 inmates trying to solve

37
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,120
 the same Sudoku puzzle?

38
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,920
 - Because they don't get many newspapers in there,

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,760
 so they all join in and take turns and leave.

40
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,440
 - Is there a queue?

42
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,800
 You queue up, you do one number, the next person goes.

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,280
 'Cause you can't get heads all around.

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,040
 - Like, is there 81 cells in a thing?

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,280
 They could have one cell each.

46
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,120
 - Holy, yeah.

47
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,040
 - And then five people to just check it over.

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,880
 - Right shout.

49
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,720
 - That's nice.

50
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,560
 - Yeah. - That's a good system.

51
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,880
 - Yeah, so they wrote this letter

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,320
 and it turned out that they were wrong,

53
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,120
 and that is a problem because they get access

54
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,800
 to Thursday's newspaper,

55
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,880
 but the answers are on a Monday and they don't get that,

56
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,280
 so they couldn't even check it,

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
 so they were so frustrated, that's annoying.

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,320
 That's why they wrote in.

59
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,440
 - But with Sudoku, you know when you've got it right,

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
 really, you don't need to check.

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,840
 Like, you know either you've got it wrong or right, right?

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,800
 I would argue you don't need the Monday's paper.

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,680
 You know you fucked up,

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,320
 now get back to the word search where you belong, clearly.

65
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,160
 (audience laughing)

66
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,440
 - Can I just say, honestly,

67
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,000
 you don't always know when you've got it right.

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,560
 So for example, at the 2011 World Sudoku Championship,

69
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,080
 one of the contenders called Weihua Huang,

70
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,640
 he jumped up in the final,

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,680
 he started high-fiving his friends in the audience,

72
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,560
 he'd won, and a judge had to point out

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,360
 he'd included the same number twice on the top row,

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,040
 and then he hadn't won.

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,880
 That's a moment.

76
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,040
 - That's unbelievably,

77
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,640
 but it's embarrassing enough to be attending

78
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,720
 the World Sudoku Championships with Ben.

79
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,920
 - Sudoku is, I mean, it took over the world.

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,680
 I don't know if you remember, 2006,

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,080
 the world became obsessed with Sudoku,

82
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
 and it was basically down to a New Zealander

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,640
 called Wayne Gould, who--

84
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,120
 - Are we gonna, I'm so sorry,

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,960
 but I just know that there'll be 10% of the audience

86
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,800
 that is driving mad.

87
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,000
 Are we gonna address your pronunciation of Sudoku?

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,840
 - Thank you.

89
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,680
 (audience laughing)

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,720
 So how are you saying it?

91
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,800
 - I'm just saying it how it's pronounced.

92
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,920
 - And how am I saying it?

93
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,440
 - You're saying it Sudoku.

94
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,280
 - And it's--

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,600
 - Sudoku.

96
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,280
 - Sudoku is what I was saying before.

97
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,120
 - Yes.

98
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,940
 - Yeah.

99
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,780
 - Right.

100
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,620
 - So don't do that.

101
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,940
 - Okay.

102
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,260
 So Sudoku is a--

103
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,760
 - Tell us about Wayne Gould.

104
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,200
 - So Wayne Gould,

105
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,120
 Wayne Gould was from New Zealand,

106
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,320
 and he basically bumped into it in a newspaper

107
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,160
 when he was in Hong Kong,

108
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,360
 and he thought this was really interesting.

109
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,720
 And then when he was in England,

110
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,000
 he basically, he sold it effectively

111
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,560
 like a door-to-door salesman.

112
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
 He went to the doors of,

113
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,000
 I think it was the Telegraph newspaper at times.

114
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,260
 That's how I pronounce times.

115
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,260
 (audience laughing)

116
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,560
 He went to the Times newspaper,

117
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,920
 and he said, "Check this out."

118
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,960
 And they liked it, and they started using it.

119
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,640
 And he patented this idea of a computer

120
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,680
 generating all of the numbers,

121
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,960
 so it could just generate multiple different Sudokas.

122
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,480
 - Did you read the account by the features editor

123
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,640
 of The Times, this guy called Mike Harvey?

124
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,460
 And it genuinely was like a door-to-door thing.

125
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,040
 So he got a phone call, Mike Harvey,

126
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,800
 saying, "There's a man who has a puzzle to show you."

127
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,400
 And so he thought, "Great."

128
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,320
 (audience laughing)

129
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
 And he said afterwards, Harvey said,

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 "I asked one of my staff to get rid of him,

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,280
 "but he said he was too busy,

132
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,800
 "so I went down myself, trying to get rid of him."

133
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,280
 But Wayne Gould had had a mock-up

134
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,640
 of the back page of The Times made,

135
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,820
 which included a Sudoku on it,

136
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,360
 and they ran it the following month.

137
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,240
 And as a result of that,

138
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,720
 Wayne Gould was named one of the world's

139
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,240
 most influential people of 2006 by Time Magazine.

140
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,080
 (audience laughing)

141
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,920
 That's how big it was.

142
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,760
 - It was a quite year, wasn't it?

143
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,320
 (audience laughing)

144
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,360
 But what happened was that The Times decided to run this,

145
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,120
 but the word got out really quickly,

146
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,840
 and so all the other newspapers went,

147
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,640
 "Oh, we're gonna get that in our newspapers as well," right?

148
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,240
 And it was just after the 2005 election.

149
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,640
 And so kind of, there wasn't much stories left

150
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,480
 in the newspaper.

151
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,640
 They had lots of inches to fill,

152
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,160
 so they thought, "Let's just bang a load of Sudoku in there."

153
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,840
 And like The Sun, for instance,

154
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,880
 made a version called Sundoku,

155
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,360
 which featured topless women.

156
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,200
 (audience laughing)

157
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,440
 - How did you get a nine by nine grid of numbers?

158
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,360
 - Lots of eights and zeros, I don't know.

159
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,880
 Sixes and nines, I don't know.

160
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,440
 But one newspaper editor said they were so popular,

161
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,400
 they called them Viagra for newspaper circulation.

162
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,240
 - Wow.

163
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,080
 - And the editor of The Observer said,

164
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,640
 "I'd put one on every page

165
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,160
 if I thought it would increase circulation."

166
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,000
 - Well, that was the thing.

167
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,520
 When it exploded in America,

168
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,960
 certain newspapers carried it,

169
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,720
 and the other ones didn't in the early days,

170
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,640
 and people who were lifelong readers of newspapers

171
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,440
 changed allegiance just for the Sudoku.

172
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,080
 They suddenly were like, "Okay, I'm gonna read

173
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,680
 the right-wing thing or the left-wing thing

174
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,520
 that I never read before."

175
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,960
 - Shit, is that why Brexit happened?

176
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,760
 It's just 'cause 10 years earlier,

177
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,200
 all these Guardian readers preferred the telegraph Sudoku.

178
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,360
 - I can't believe this fact,

179
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,640
 but I'm gonna say it anyway.

180
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,120
 This was a report in the Daily Mail

181
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,120
 that said that global pencil sales increased by 700% in 2005.

182
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,960
 - I 100% believe that.

183
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,760
 You would never have a pencil before that.

184
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,920
 I would never have a pencil.

185
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,760
 Why would you?

186
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,040
 You're a pen, you're not a child.

187
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,640
 You've got to write those little digits up

188
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,800
 in the top corner then when you get the fill-up,

189
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,840
 then you've got to erase it.

190
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,680
 - Got it.

191
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,720
 - There are just a few more things about the craze,

192
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,280
 which was all 2005.

193
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,880
 Radio 4 apparently did an audio version of Sudoku.

194
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,600
 I have no idea how that worked.

195
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,920
 I have no idea.

196
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,520
 - They just read out the numbers, didn't they?

197
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,520
 They went gap, gap, gap, gap, gap, seven, gap, gap, gap.

198
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,520
 - Maybe, yeah.

199
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,360
 - Yeah, that's probably it.

200
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
 - Did they?

201
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,040
 - It seems they.

202
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,680
 - Sky One commissioned a 275-square-foot Sudoku

203
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,080
 in a chalk hill at Chipping Sodbury.

204
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,760
 - Yeah, but do you know the thing about that?

205
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,600
 - No.

206
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,440
 - It was wrong.

207
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,760
 - What?

208
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,400
 - So it was on the bath exit or near the bath exit of the M4

209
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,440
 and it was specifically put in a place

210
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,680
 where there was a 40-mile-an-hour speed limit introduced

211
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,720
 because otherwise it would be dangerous and distracting.

212
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,080
 - Yes, I always try to solve my Sudoku

213
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,920
 below 40 miles an hour when driving.

214
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,120
 - I keep it to the built-up areas.

215
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,400
 - The responsible way to do it.

216
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,440
 But they offered 5,000 pounds for the first person

217
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,840
 to solve this, particularly fiendish Sudoku,

218
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,600
 and it was revealed later that it actually had

219
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,080
 1,905 correct solutions.

220
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,920
 - Wow, wow, yeah.

221
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,640
 - That's the one thing that people hate, isn't it?

222
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,520
 There's more than one solution.

223
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,480
 This was in the very early days.

224
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,960
 The mail in the telegraph really rushed out the Sudokus

225
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,480
 and the telegraph's compiler called Michael Mepham,

226
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,880
 he made some puzzles that had more than one solution

227
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,720
 and he said, "My golly, I did get some mail."

228
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,200
 (laughing)

229
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,840
 - What's the problem with it?

230
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,640
 - It's just because it's unsatisfying

231
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,480
 if there's lots of different answers.

232
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,360
 - There should only be one right answer.

233
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,960
 - Yeah, exactly.

234
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,920
 - Part of the craze thing,

235
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,680
 one thing that happened in Sydney, Australia,

236
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,360
 there was a court case that was going on for three months.

237
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,440
 They had 105 witnesses

238
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,600
 and while someone was giving evidence,

239
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,080
 they looked up and they sort of noticed

240
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,680
 that the jurors were looking a bit distracted

241
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,600
 and it turned out that they were secretly doing Sudokus

242
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,400
 underneath their desk

243
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
 and then it turned out that four of them were in cahoots

244
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,920
 and what they were doing were printing out Sudoku

245
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,400
 on photocopiers and sharing them around

246
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,800
 and while the trial was going on

247
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,040
 and witnesses were talking,

248
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,960
 they were doing it underneath

249
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,600
 and then comparing notes in the breaks

250
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,800
 and seeing how far they got.

251
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,920
 Yeah, so that cost a million dollars,

252
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,320
 that trial up until that point

253
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,400
 and it had to be thrown out

254
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,560
 because it turned out the jurors weren't listening.

255
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
 - Oh my God, what was it, oh, drug trial?

256
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,800
 - No, it was for conspiracy

257
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,560
 to manufacture a commercial quantity of amphetamines.

258
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,240
 - Sounds like a drug trial to me, yeah.

259
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,840
 (audience laughing)

260
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,960
 But it wasn't, it was a conspiracy trial.

261
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
 (audience laughing)

262
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,280
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

263
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,240
 - I was reading an article

264
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,760
 about the world championships in 2009.

265
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,800
 So what they often do in the world championships

266
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,040
 is they'll have normal Sudokus

267
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,440
 and then when you get to the final,

268
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,680
 they'll give you some kind of crazy Sudokus

269
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
 that are a little bit different,

270
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,240
 like they might be jigsaws that have to come together,

271
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,640
 might be bigger, and in this case,

272
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,600
 the final variants were so different to normal Sudokus

273
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
 that the winner from the previous two years,

274
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,040
 who's a guy called Thomas Snyder,

275
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,800
 says it was like playing the final

276
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,360
 of a basketball championships with a different size ball.

277
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,200
 The hoops are higher up than normal

278
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,480
 and everyone has trampolines in their shoes.

279
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
 - Cool.

280
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,880
 - That was the difference, that's how different it was.

281
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,240
 There was a second puzzle hidden underneath the first puzzle,

282
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,080
 but then for two of the competitors,

283
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,360
 the first puzzle accidentally fell down halfway through,

284
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,600
 so that gave away the surprise.

285
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,680
 This was all in an article in the Irish press,

286
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,040
 so they were quite interested in how the Irish team got on,

287
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,760
 and they said that the Irish team came second to last,

288
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,840
 and three of the four Irish players were beaten

289
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,600
 by Tiang Xiong, a 10-year-old boy.

290
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,840
 - Aw.

291
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,000
 - The only guy from the Irish team who beat them,

292
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
 a guy called Bernard Sellers,

293
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,720
 he said, "I must make it clear

294
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,600
 "that this is due to incompetence, not lack of effort."

295
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,440
 (audience laughing)

296
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,240
 He said, "He has beaten us at Sudoku,

297
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,480
 "but let's see him after a few beers."

298
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,480
 (audience laughing)

299
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,520
 - We need to move on, guys.

300
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,640
 We need to get to our next facts.

301
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,480
 - Okay, let's do it.

302
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,120
 - Let's do it, okay, it is time for fact number two,

303
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,800
 and that is Andy.

304
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,720
 - My fact is that in 1913,

305
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,600
 it was claimed that French farmers

306
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,880
 were raising automotive chickens,

307
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,520
 which were bred specifically

308
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,120
 to throw themselves under passing cars

309
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,640
 so the farmer could claim compensation.

310
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,000
 (audience laughing)

311
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,840
 - Wow.

312
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,600
 - Should we now know the answer to why did the chicken

313
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,440
 cross the road?

314
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,800
 - Absolutely, it was on a mission.

315
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,120
 - Do we think this is true?

316
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,960
 - I don't.

317
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,120
 (audience laughing)

318
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,400
 Everyone else has been to think what they like,

319
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,160
 I think it's hooey.

320
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,240
 But it was printed in a newspaper called Le Figaro,

321
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,640
 from a famous French paper,

322
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,720
 and, yeah, farmers were breeding this chicken

323
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,160
 so that the owner could claim five francs

324
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,480
 or whatever of damages from a driver,

325
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,520
 and I just find it hilarious that--

326
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,440
 - I did find one guy called William K. Vanderbilt.

327
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,760
 He was known as a scorcher.

328
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,480
 He was American, not French,

329
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,280
 but he was well known that he would pay compensation

330
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,160
 if he ever hit your animals.

331
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
 And so there was newspaper articles

332
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,360
 that people would deliberately push livestock into his way.

333
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,200
 - Yeah.

334
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
 - So it was kind of some of it happening, wasn't it?

335
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,040
 - Poor sucker.

336
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,120
 I wonder how many times he had a chicken suddenly appear

337
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,080
 in front of his car before he started to suspect.

338
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,200
 It was like the 12th time that day.

339
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,520
 It's just like another cow.

340
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,360
 - Yeah.

341
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,200
 - Come on, guys.

342
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,040
 - Some people said it was horses

343
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,480
 that got pushed in the way of his car.

344
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,320
 - Really?

345
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,280
 - You think he must have been quite a bad driver

346
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
 if you can't see a horse.

347
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,120
 - He should be.

348
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

349
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,680
 - How could you get a chicken to do that, by the way?

350
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,520
 How could you?

351
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,360
 - You couldn't.

352
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,200
 It's not a thing.

353
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,560
 - No, but if he was paying compensation all the time.

354
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,400
 - You could throw it.

355
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,240
 - You can chuck it.

356
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,080
 - You could throw it.

357
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,920
 - Wait a minute, you can.

358
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,760
 - You could get a chicken to do that.

359
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,080
 - You can get a chicken to do that.

360
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,320
 - Someone in the audience has just claimed

361
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,920
 I could get a chicken to do that.

362
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,880
 - For one second, I forgot we were in Devon.

363
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,880
 (audience laughing)

364
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,520
 - I'll do that.

365
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,080
 - I think if you were to draw a white line on the ground,

366
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,480
 sometimes chickens will just follow that white line,

367
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,320
 wouldn't they?

368
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,160
 - That's true.

369
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,000
 - I think that's a thing.

370
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,360
 - That guy, Vanderbilt, William Vanderbilt,

371
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,640
 he was like a squillionaire.

372
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,680
 And this fact came from a great article,

373
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,400
 I think in Littub, the website,

374
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,160
 and it mentioned that he had these crazy adventures.

375
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,560
 He may have been the inspiration for Mr. Toad

376
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,880
 in The Wind and the Willows.

377
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,960
 You know, he's always got his car,

378
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,480
 and he's going poop-poop, and all of this.

379
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,320
 And...

380
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,160
 (audience laughing)

381
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,400
 - That's a good impersonation.

382
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,240
 - Poop-poop.

383
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,800
 - You know, get out of our way.

384
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,840
 He's Mr. Toad.

385
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,680
 - Sure, anyway.

386
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,120
 Okay, but he did have a lot of crazy adventures,

387
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,880
 which were even more exciting than Mr. Toad's adventures.

388
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,120
 So in 1899, visiting France,

389
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,480
 he had to kill two dogs,

390
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,840
 which were trying to bite his tires,

391
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,040
 and then flee from a mop.

392
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,240
 - He had to kill two dogs.

393
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,360
 - Circumstances forced him to shoot.

394
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,200
 He did a lot.

395
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,120
 He had a gun a lot of the time.

396
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,440
 He traveled with a gun, like Mr. Toad.

397
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,200
 You know, crowds with whips and rocks

398
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,080
 were trying to attack him

399
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,800
 because he was just such a reckless driver,

400
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,720
 and he'd shoot in the air and shoot over their heads

401
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,360
 and then drive off saying "poop-poop."

402
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,480
 (audience laughing)

403
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,200
 - They weren't, people were just generally terrified

404
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,840
 about the car for a long time as well,

405
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,040
 and angry and farmers especially,

406
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,240
 but around the same time in Pennsylvania,

407
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,040
 the legislature passed a law

408
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,800
 that all cars traveling on country roads at night

409
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,880
 had to send up a rocket every mile

410
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,320
 to let everyone know that they were coming.

411
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,660
 - Sorry, God.

412
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,520
 - It's just, you know, big on firework.

413
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,760
 - I think suggested the law rather than passed it, though.

414
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,560
 - No, they passed, the legislature passed the law

415
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,520
 and then it was rejected by the governor.

416
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,800
 So the legislature said, "Pass this law,"

417
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,600
 and then they had to send a rocket up every mile,

418
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,160
 explode it, then wait for 10 minutes for the road to clear,

419
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,400
 and then the driver had to proceed with caution,

420
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,960
 blowing his horn and shooting off Roman candles

421
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,640
 as before. - What the hell?

422
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,840
 Wow.

423
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,280
 - So if you were on your horse,

424
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,080
 you'd have to judge was that a mile or two miles

425
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,560
 that the rocket went up, right?

426
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,400
 - Yeah, yeah.

427
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,240
 - Do you think there was like, you know,

428
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,280
 when a thunderstorm's coming and you count the seconds?

429
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,120
 Was it like that?

430
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
 - Yeah, between the light and the sound.

431
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,920
 - Yeah, yeah, that would work.

432
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,760
 - Patent number 1,122,742 in America.

433
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,320
 - Don't tell me, don't tell me, I know this one.

434
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,360
 - I'm so annoyed, I know the one before.

435
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,920
 - Yes, it was a huge knife that you attached

436
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,240
 to the front of your car.

437
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,120
 Can you guess, can you guess why you might do that?

438
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,960
 - Cababs.

439
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,800
 Chicken, chicken, cabab.

440
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,400
 (all laughing)

441
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,720
 - Just to make everyone get the fuck off the road.

442
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,680
 - Kind of.

443
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,400
 So like Hannah said, people were really scared of cars,

444
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,640
 but they also hated them.

445
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,360
 And there was a thing where people put ropes

446
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,000
 across the road to try and stop you from going too fast,

447
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,400
 'cause then it would like, you know,

448
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,000
 like a barrier would stop you.

449
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,240
 And so this thing was invented to kind of cut those ropes.

450
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,080
 - Wow.

451
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,580
 - Nice.

452
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,080
 - It's crazy, what do you read about it?

453
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,520
 Because it sounds like it was just hectic

454
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,280
 to drive a car in those early days.

455
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,360
 There were accounts of where sort of like farmers

456
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,240
 and locals would sort of sprinkle nails

457
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,960
 and broken glass on the road.

458
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,400
 They would, as you say, tie ropes across.

459
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,040
 They would dig holes in the ground.

460
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,320
 So they would just, you know, fall into it.

461
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,080
 There was a story that near Sacramento in California,

462
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,160
 13 cars were captured.

463
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,620
 You know, like captured is the word they use in the article.

464
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,460
 Yeah.

465
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,520
 - And they were trying to stop people from speeding.

466
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,480
 So there was one town in America

467
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,800
 where they put a big sign up just said,

468
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,620
 "The speed limit this year is a secret."

469
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,680
 (all laughing)

470
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,000
 And the idea is everyone drives and they go,

471
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,640
 "Oh shit, I'm gonna have to go slow now

472
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,600
 'cause it's probably really low."

473
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,440
 - God, so good.

474
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,480
 - It sounds really fun.

475
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,040
 It sounds like it's like doing an obstacle course

476
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,120
 driving back in the day.

477
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,200
 It's like you're rally driving or something.

478
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,280
 - It's very west, isn't it?

479
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,120
 - Yeah.

480
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,640
 - But one of the legitimate concerns,

481
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,560
 which is like the opposite of the concern we have now

482
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,240
 with driverless cars, is that humans were gonna have

483
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,360
 to be responsible for concentrating the whole time.

484
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,440
 'Cause if you think about it,

485
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,560
 cars back then were called horseless carriages, basically.

486
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,400
 And the difference between a horseless carriage

487
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,960
 and a horse carriage is that you can kind of leave

488
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,400
 the horse to do most of the work,

489
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,040
 much like a driverless car.

490
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,720
 So, you know, if you're driving,

491
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,480
 if you're the cabbie, you can lose concentration.

492
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
 You can have a chat with your friend.

493
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,880
 You can have a little snooze.

494
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,680
 The horse has it under control.

495
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,560
 And one of the terrors was that, you know,

496
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,840
 if you're driving, then it's all up to the human.

497
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,680
 And we're shit.

498
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,520
 - Yeah.

499
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,360
 - And they were right.

500
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,960
 - Another thing in the 1920s, there was a judge

501
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,000
 who said that the automobile was a house of prostitution

502
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,280
 on wheels and that of the 30 girls that had been brought

503
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,200
 in front of him charged with sex crimes,

504
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,880
 19 offenses had occurred in cars.

505
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,720
 - Really?

506
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,520
 - So there's a real worry that young people

507
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,080
 are going to be able to get away from their parents and stuff

508
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,720
 and they would be in an enclosed vehicle

509
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,680
 and you never know what they're going to get up to.

510
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,920
 - Well, Madame Bovary, right?

511
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,280
 Didn't Madame Bovary have sex in a car?

512
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,120
 - Carriage.

513
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,960
 - Carriage.

514
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,800
 - That was the big thing, wasn't it?

515
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,640
 - A horse car, yeah.

516
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,360
 - And in 1926, the Cleveland Motor Company

517
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,760
 realised this was happening

518
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,600
 and so they invented the honeymoon special car.

519
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,920
 And that came equipped with a foldable bed

520
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
 which could be put up in just one minute

521
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,000
 and the doors were fitted with curtains.

522
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
 - That's really rude.

523
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,440
 (audience laughing)

524
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,920
 - For the 20s?

525
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,760
 - Guys.

526
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,800
 - For the 20s, you're all saucepots.

527
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,640
 - Yeah?

528
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,800
 - I thought you were going to say there was a car company

529
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,040
 which invented the car with a knife in the middle

530
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,480
 so you can't go near anyone.

531
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

532
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,280
 An inflatable dad of the daughter or something.

533
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,720
 (audience laughing)

534
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,680
 - I liked this in 1895 in the spectator.

535
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,360
 It was talking about how when the car first came about,

536
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,200
 everyone said horses were going to disappear

537
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,920
 off the face of the earth, which was kind of true,

538
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,280
 but it happened more slowly than people had predicted.

539
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,200
 And the spectator wrote, "When the car first appeared,

540
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,480
 "it was a common prophecy that the horse was a doomed animal,

541
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,120
 "but the threatened institution of the horse-drawn cab

542
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,000
 "has managed somehow, like the House of Lords,

543
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,840
 "to survive in full vigor."

544
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,880
 (audience laughing)

545
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,600
 I just love the idea that even in 1895,

546
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,080
 people were looking at the House of Lords going,

547
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,840
 "How the fuck is this still surviving?"

548
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,680
 (audience laughing)

549
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,520
 - That's so funny.

550
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,360
 - It feels like that.

551
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,000
 So one of the big problems with all these early day cars

552
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,360
 is that they would come round

553
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,840
 and they would spray dust on these roads into houses.

554
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,040
 And in France, where this fact begins,

555
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,680
 we were talking about the fact that

556
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,160
 it was really badly received.

557
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,720
 And part of that was people trying to say

558
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,680
 rent out villas and so on.

559
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,840
 They were losing all their business

560
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,680
 'cause as cars came by, all this spray of dust came

561
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,120
 and no one wanted to be there.

562
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,480
 So roads were effectively invented

563
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,840
 by people trying to stop that

564
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,160
 because they started putting basically asphalt and so on

565
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,360
 just outside their house, just strips,

566
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,440
 so that when the car went over, it would miss the house.

567
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,720
 And then it kind of, my theory is it caught on

568
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,520
 and they went, "Oh, let's put more of that down."

569
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,760
 - That's a good theory.

570
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,320
 There was in 1905,

571
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,120
 the Royal Commission on Motoring was held in Britain.

572
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,040
 And they again, were looking at the dust

573
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,400
 and saying, "This is terrible."

574
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,760
 They blamed the dust for throat and eye infections,

575
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,280
 for the inability to hand washing to dry,

576
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,400
 and the clogging of at least one

577
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,240
 lady novelist's typewriter.

578
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,560
 (audience laughing)

579
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,080
 - Things are serious.

580
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,960
 (audience laughing)

581
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,320
 - It's so funny.

582
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,200
 - We need to move on in a sec to our next fact.

583
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,040
 - I've just got one more thing.

584
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,880
 - Yeah, go for it.

585
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,760
 - Well, I found it 'cause I was searching about chickens

586
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,320
 and cars, and it's a piece of advice

587
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,920
 about playing chicken in a car.

588
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,240
 - Oh yeah.

589
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,400
 - I mean, don't, but if you are,

590
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,200
 there's advice from a 1960 work

591
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,040
 called The Strategy of Conflict by--

592
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,760
 - Okay, so chicken is like two cars

593
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,920
 driving up to each other and it's like--

594
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,520
 - Absolutely, you're driving towards each other

595
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
 and whoever swears first loses, you know?

596
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,240
 And this is by a Nobel laureate called Thomas Shelling.

597
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,880
 So it's legit stuff, all right?

598
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,920
 And what he said is that extreme irrationality

599
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,080
 can be rational.

600
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,400
 So if you are playing chicken in a car,

601
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,320
 the best thing to do is rip off the steering wheel

602
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,560
 from the column and throw it out of the window.

603
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,840
 But you should only do that if you are confident

604
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,880
 that the other driver has seen you do it.

605
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,960
 (audience laughing)

606
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,680
 - Oh wow.

607
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,520
 - Yeah.

608
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,360
 - What year was that?

609
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,200
 Is that early day as well?

610
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,040
 - It was 1960.

611
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,880
 He died the next year, weirdly.

612
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,720
 - I'm 1960.

613
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,080
 (audience laughing)

614
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,000
 - Horrible car crash.

615
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,160
 (audience laughing)

616
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,640
 - I read about the first car, horn,

617
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,600
 which was in 1649.

618
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,440
 - Huh?

619
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,920
 - And this is car as in a horseless carriage.

620
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,000
 And it was a carriage invented by a guy called Johann Housh

621
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,040
 and it was a dragon which went at the front of the carriage

622
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,480
 and it rolled its eyes and it spouted water

623
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,040
 to clear pedestrians out of the way.

624
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,120
 - That sounds fucking cool.

625
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,960
 - Isn't that cool?

626
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,560
 And the horn part was carved angels on either side

627
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,440
 holding trumpets that were constantly blown.

628
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,400
 - Oh wow.

629
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,200
 - And this didn't need any horses to pull it

630
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,800
 amazingly, this vehicle.

631
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,520
 Although it did have two men concealed

632
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,680
 under the body of it who had to run along

633
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,520
 with the outside stones.

634
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,360
 - What the flip stones?

635
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,160
 (audience laughing)

636
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,000
 That's incredible.

637
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,520
 - Yeah.

638
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,280
 - We need to move on to our next fact.

639
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,240
 Okay, it is time for fact number three

640
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,760
 and that is Anna.

641
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,360
 - My fact this week is that when libraries flood,

642
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,840
 the books are saved by putting them in the freezer

643
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,480
 and then vacuuming them.

644
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,320
 - Wow.

645
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,280
 - Yeah, I was reading about library book salvage

646
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,520
 and it's so cool.

647
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,200
 So basically any library worth its salt

648
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,360
 has to either have its own massive industrial freezer

649
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,880
 or have access to an industrial freezer

650
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,240
 and you freeze the paper as soon as it's got wet.

651
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,280
 And this is both with floods and fires

652
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,440
 'cause the biggest problem really for books

653
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,800
 and libraries with fires is the getting wet afterwards.

654
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,720
 Usually they're put out in time

655
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,800
 but they're put out with so much water

656
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,480
 that they get covered in water.

657
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,080
 If you freeze it immediately,

658
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,200
 then the water stops making the ink bleed

659
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,800
 and it stops mold growing and all of those things.

660
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
 But then obviously you've just got a massive freezer

661
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,640
 full of frozen books.

662
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,480
 - Yeah.

663
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,920
 - It's really difficult to read

664
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,440
 and you can't just melt it.

665
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,080
 And so then you vacuum it by which I mean,

666
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,440
 put it in a massive vacuum chamber

667
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,280
 and that means that the water can go straight from a solid

668
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,280
 to a gas, can sublimate GCSE chemistry there

669
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,200
 'cause it like reduces the pressure in the air

670
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,080
 if it's in a vacuum.

671
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,040
 And so that means that there's like not enough pressure

672
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,360
 for water to form, right?

673
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,520
 It becomes gas immediately

674
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
 'cause there's so much space.

675
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,640
 All the solid ice molecules just jump around in the space

676
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,480
 and become a gas.

677
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,320
 - That is amazing.

678
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,040
 You can not just buy some new books.

679
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,080
 (audience laughs)

680
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,200
 - Shit, you should mention that.

681
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,600
 Yeah, a lot of time has been wasted.

682
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,640
 - Yeah, now these are precious old books, aren't they?

683
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,480
 - Oh, okay, got it.

684
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,320
 - Yeah, these are the originals.

685
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,840
 - Yeah, there was one, there was a massive library fire

686
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,080
 in 1986, the biggest library fire in America.

687
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,240
 It was in Central Library in LA

688
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,000
 and that one they had to ask a load of,

689
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,480
 there were a lot of fishermen in LA

690
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,560
 and they had to ask the fishermen

691
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,440
 to lend them all of their fish freezers,

692
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,280
 put the books in.

693
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
 - I didn't see where you were going with that at all.

694
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,200
 I thought you were gonna say

695
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,680
 they had to get the fishermen to get the books

696
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,760
 out of the library with their rods

697
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,040
 because it was still too dangerous in there.

698
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,960
 - They're very attracted to maggots' books, actually.

699
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,320
 They leap up.

700
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,360
 And the reason, and that really is, if you look that up,

701
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,840
 it doesn't go down that much in history

702
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,040
 because it happened three days after Chernobyl

703
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,720
 and so it was very much buried

704
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,200
 in a slightly bigger explosion that week.

705
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,040
 The only paper that put it like proper front and center,

706
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,440
 I think, or this is what I read in a book

707
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,560
 called The Library Book,

708
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,680
 which is very good book by Susan Orleans.

709
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,520
 - Pravda in the Soviet Union, funny enough.

710
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,200
 - There was nothing else happening that day.

711
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,480
 - Exactly.

712
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,960
 How embarrassing for America there's library fire, right?

713
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,560
 Look at that.

714
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,520
 - They should have, like in libraries, just giant freezers.

715
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,280
 You know, in Australia, when you go to the bottle shop,

716
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,560
 the bottle load, there's always this wine shop.

717
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,400
 - Just a wine shop?

718
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,120
 - Yeah, wine shop, and you get beers.

719
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,040
 There's always this giant freezer room that you go into.

720
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,680
 It's freezing to be inside,

721
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,680
 but it's very common in every bottle shop that you get there.

722
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,080
 And yeah, they should have that,

723
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,960
 just where all the precious books just can't be hung.

724
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,120
 - Well, I suppose some of the bigger places do, right?

725
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,240
 Like the Natural History Museum, not a library,

726
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
 but they have a huge freezer.

727
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,160
 Can you guess what's the largest animal

728
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,120
 they could fit in the freezer?

729
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,440
 - Seal, but a big seal.

730
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,560
 - A Diplodocus.

731
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,400
 - Diplodocus, giraffe.

732
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,920
 The answer is a fully grown rhino.

733
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,760
 They could fit that in there.

734
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,840
 And the largest fridge in the world, 2,800 pole away,

735
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,520
 this is in Richland, Washington, in America,

736
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,800
 that is big enough to fit every single living rhino in the world.

737
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,640
 - Wow.

738
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,280
 - And actually they have a bit of space as well.

739
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,480
 They'd have to be on top of each other's shoulders.

740
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

741
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,200
 - I don't think that's gonna be your biggest logistical problem

742
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,320
 in terms of gathering all the rhinos,

743
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
 getting them to the fridge.

744
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,400
 I think once you've done that,

745
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,240
 shoving them in is gonna be an easy job.

746
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,640
 - Yeah, okay.

747
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,720
 - Whose fridge is this and how big is the party they're having?

748
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,440
 - This is a huge fridge that they use in America.

749
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,680
 Their farmers will send all their goods there,

750
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,600
 and it will keep the fruits and vegetables

751
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,040
 kind of fresher for a bit longer.

752
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,880
 - Nice.

753
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,720
 - Really nice.

754
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,840
 - Imagine how many magnets you can get on that.

755
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,680
 So many.

756
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,440
 - That's a lot of shit drawings from your children, isn't it?

757
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,320
 - Libraries.

758
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,400
 You know the Bodleian Library in Oxford?

759
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,240
 - Yeah.

760
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,080
 - I think it's one of only three libraries

761
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,120
 which gets a copy of every single book published in the UK.

762
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,560
 So it's the Cambridge Library,

763
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,840
 the Oxford University Library,

764
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,560
 which is the Bodleian and the British Library.

765
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,720
 For 250 years, the Librarian of the Bodleian

766
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,200
 was supposed to be celibate, and none of them were.

767
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,840
 It was one of the main,

768
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,720
 there was a guy, found it by a guy called Thomas Bodley,

769
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,000
 who had read this main thing,

770
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,680
 and he wrote up a list of rules when he was founding the library.

771
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,120
 The first rule was celibate.

772
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,440
 I want no Librarian to have sex ever.

773
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,840
 The first Librarian got married that year,

774
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,600
 the year he founded it.

775
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,360
 All the successes did pretty much,

776
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,840
 and it was 250 years, it was kept in place,

777
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,680
 and then they repealed it saying,

778
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,160
 "This is a ridiculous rule."

779
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,200
 And why celibate, 'cause you must love the books

780
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,640
 more than you could ever love the human flesh?

781
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,720
 Or what, why?

782
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,240
 What a lovely poetic way, I think it's...

783
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,080
 They didn't want to get any come-in-the-books?

784
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,400
 Yeah. Oh, my God!

785
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,680
 Wow. Oh, my God!

786
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,200
 That's poetic from James.

787
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,480
 No? No?

788
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,880
 It wasn't that, no, I think it was...

789
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,720
 It's sort of gas.

790
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,400
 Yeah, no, it's fine, and I'm blushing on stage now.

791
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,040
 I didn't say... Oh, my God.

792
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,760
 I think it was because it was kind of connected to the priesthood,

793
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,280
 and so it kind of came from that tradition that he was...

794
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,000
 But Bobby himself was a bit of a mug.

795
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,400
 He said they didn't want idle books and riff-raffs,

796
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,240
 which was anything not in Latin.

797
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,000
 And the library got a first folio of Shakespeare's works.

798
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,880
 Pretty good, pretty nice book in 1623, pretty valuable.

799
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,480
 And then a few decades later, the third folio came out,

800
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,240
 and they just sold the first folio off.

801
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,440
 They said, "Well, we don't need this. We've got a more modern one now."

802
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,000
 And so as a result, they had to...

803
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,680
 Yeah, just on random, fun things about libraries,

804
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,440
 I was reading about Berkeley Library in America,

805
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,360
 and they have every year an edible book festival.

806
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,960
 And the idea is that there's a few categories,

807
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,520
 but one of the main things is you need to do food-based puns

808
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,440
 on existing books.

809
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,400
 So "Infinite Jest" becomes "Infinite Zest," for example.

810
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,840
 So I've got a little quiz for you guys.

811
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
 Okay, okay.

812
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,160
 Wait, who needs to do... How does it work?

813
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,600
 I'm going to give you the book name and see if you can guess

814
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,120
 what they did with it.

815
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,640
 "Waiting for Goddow."

816
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,280
 "Waiting for Cheddar."

817
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,880
 "Waiting for Gouda." Would be better.

818
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,720
 There we go. That's much better.

819
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
 1-0 to James.

820
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,040
 He just crossed it, and I just knotted it in the corner.

821
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,880
 That's okay.

822
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,720
 "Game of Thrones."

823
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
 "Game of Cheddar."

824
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,600
 "Game of Bones?"

825
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
 "Game of Skones."

826
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,840
 Also, "game" is already a type of meat.

827
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,480
 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

828
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
 James is submitting "no change."

829
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,720
 Technically, "game" is a kind of meat.

830
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,480
 Question number three, "One flu over the cuckoo's nest."

831
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,000
 "You can eat a cuckoo," says James.

832
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 "No change."

833
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,200
 "One flu over a cuckoo's nest."

834
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,920
 Oh, yeah, that's good.

835
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,400
 "One flu over the cuckoo's nest."

836
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,920
 "One flu over the cuckoo's nest."

837
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,200
 "Cuckoo's nest."

838
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,600
 Can we play this for the rest of the podcast?

839
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,360
 I'm going to join you so much, so I'll give you two more, okay?

840
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,800
 "Something Wicked This Way Comes."

841
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,920
 "Something Wicked This Way Bones?"

842
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,040
 Very good, but no, it's "Dumpling Wicked This Way Comes."

843
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,760
 "Dumpling Wicked This Way Comes."

844
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,720
 "Heart of Darkness" is the last one.

845
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,200
 "Heart of Cheddar."

846
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,560
 It's correct. No, it's not.

847
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,160
 Well, actually, "part" is already part of an animal that you can eat.

848
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,240
 "Altichoke Heart of Darkness."

849
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,200
 Oh, that's good.

850
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,440
 It's "Heart of Darkness," and I think Andy takes it with a win there.

851
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,640
 I demand a recap.

852
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,720
 Have you guys heard of Barbara Pratt?

853
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
 No.

854
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,360
 This is now more on refrigeration than on libraries.

855
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,120
 But she was hired by the shipping company Sea Land, who's now MERSC.

856
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,080
 And basically what would happen is they would refrigerate fruits and vegetables and stuff

857
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,160
 and send it around the world, and then sometimes it would be fine

858
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,000
 and sometimes it would be rotten and no one could work out why.

859
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,080
 And so Barbara Pratt spent seven years living in shipping containers,

860
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,400
 being shipped around the world with a load of vegetables

861
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,040
 and working out how to stop them from going rotten.

862
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,560
 Whoa.

863
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,880
 Is that the one thing more boring than watching paint dry?

864
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,240
 Watching vegetables rot.

865
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,440
 She is an absolutely hero.

866
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
 Incredible.

867
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,680
 Isn't that amazing?

868
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,440
 She had bunk bed.

869
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,000
 I don't know why she had a bunk bed, because I can't imagine that.

870
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,840
 Because she had to have some fun, and bunk beds are fun.

871
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,120
 I mean, that's pretty boring.

872
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,840
 I would say, like the Budley, and this is a place where you're probably celibate

873
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,760
 if you're doing this job.

874
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,240
 But yes, she would monitor temperature, airflow, humidity, all that kind of stuff.

875
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,880
 She had loads of microprocessors, all that kind of stuff,

876
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,920
 and eventually worked out the regimes that they used today

877
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,840
 to make sure that peppers and watermelons and stuff can go around the world and not go off.

878
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,240
 That's great. Isn't that amazing?

879
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,080
 Did they ever have like an inspection of the shipping container,

880
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,600
 and they just open it and they find a load of watermelons and Barbara Pratt just goes,

881
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,800
 "Hello."

882
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,360
 I fear that didn't happen.

883
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,640
 That's so good.

884
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,120
 On fridges, you know there's a Guinness World Record for the world's largest fridge.

885
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,120
 Oh, is it not the one that I talked about in America?

886
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,320
 No, it's not that.

887
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,920
 Yeah, the official, according to Guinness World Records,

888
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,160
 is the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.

889
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,160
 And it's because it has 9,300 magnets inside it,

890
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,560
 and they need to be kept at an exact temperature.

891
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,760
 And so it's got 10,800 tons of liquid nitrogen,

892
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,080
 60 tons of liquid helium, and that creates the...

893
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,000
 Does it count as a fridge if you can't put your cold rice from the night before in it?

894
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,240
 But hang on a second.

895
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,520
 We said in the first ever episode of Fish

896
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,360
 that the Large Hadron Collider had to be stopped

897
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,400
 because a bit of tuna baguette was dropped into it.

898
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,520
 That's right.

899
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,840
 So if that is still in there, then it counts as a fridge.

900
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:14,160
 We need to move on to our next fact.

901
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,480
 It is time for our final fact of the show,

902
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,200
 and that is James.

903
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,640
 OK, my fact this week is that there is an ophthalmologist

904
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,800
 at the University of Leiden called Dr I.C. Notting.

905
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:34,800
 It does work better in an Irish accent, doesn't it?

906
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,720
 It does, and I'm not going to do it.

907
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,600
 So this was a post that I saw on the website improbable.com,

908
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,360
 which is run by Mark Abraham, who is a friend of ours,

909
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,800
 who's been on Fish, actually, and he runs the Ig Nobel Prizes,

910
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,760
 but he noticed this person.

911
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,120
 And she was part of a team in May this year

912
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,640
 that replaced both lenses in the eyes of a chimpanzee called Fifi.

913
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,600
 Fifi could no longer tolerate light

914
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,920
 because of the situation that she'd been in,

915
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,400
 and so, like, really had the lenses had gone all cloudy,

916
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,720
 and she was the first person to ever do in Europe

917
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,160
 a double cataract operation on a chimpanzee.

918
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,960
 That's super cool, but at the same time a shame,

919
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,120
 because I just want to see a chimpanzee wearing sunglasses

920
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,720
 for the rest of their life.

921
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,280
 And apart from that, I know Notting more about Dr Notting.

922
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,880
 She specialises in neuro-ophthalmology, cataracts,

923
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,960
 and trabismus, which I didn't know means being cross-eyed,

924
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,960
 and she's got a load of papers online,

925
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,200
 but they're so far out of my pay grade.

926
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,480
 It's unbelievable.

927
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,000
 The latest one is spectral domain optical coherence tomography

928
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,800
 in retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy

929
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,720
 and systemic manifestations

930
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,800
 and monogenic small vessel disease.

931
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,080
 Right. She sounds clever.

932
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,560
 She sounds super clever.

933
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,720
 She's got a funny name.

934
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,360
 I did find another optometrist called Hugh Seymour, which is a...

935
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,720
 That's great.

936
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,560
 There's a big list of ophthalmologists on Wikipedia,

937
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,880
 and I went down looking for an app name.

938
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,320
 There was a guy who was the first person to prove

939
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,160
 that providone iodine could be safely used

940
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,280
 as an antimicrobial for the eyes.

941
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,480
 He's got a very apt name. His name was Leonard Apt.

942
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,160
 Right.

943
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,920
 He's going to be at home listening to this, thinking,

944
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,080
 "Oh, no, they've done it again."

945
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,560
 So, this fact is basically nominative determinism,

946
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,360
 and the idea of that is you've got a name

947
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,880
 that matches the job that you're doing.

948
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,520
 So, for example, the professor of geology at Exeter University

949
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,080
 is called Dr Stone.

950
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,200
 Did they become professor of that because of the name?

951
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,320
 Did it lead them towards that?

952
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,640
 And there's a lot of people who say there's no truth in that,

953
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,720
 but it is fun when you notice people

954
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,880
 that seem to have gone into it.

955
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,040
 So, Leiden, where you were saying, "I see nothing" is from,

956
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,640
 I looked at the University of Leiden,

957
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,200
 which is a different university,

958
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,280
 just to see if there was any people

959
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,880
 who had similar names to the thing that they do.

960
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,160
 So, I found there's a professor of religion called Peter Bishop,

961
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,200
 but it's Bishop, but it's very, very close.

962
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,880
 The professor of European law is Rick Lawson,

963
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,400
 and they have a professor of anthropology

964
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,360
 who's called Gerard Person.

965
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,920
 Oh, that's good.

966
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,840
 So, do you think that Leiden University

967
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,760
 is just literally choosing people just based on their names?

968
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,240
 Yeah, sounds like it.

969
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,400
 Well, you'd think that academics would be above this kind of thing,

970
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,240
 and if they heard this, they'd be like, "Come on,

971
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,560
 just talk about my area of knowledge."

972
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,480
 But this is one of my favourite things.

973
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,640
 I don't think we've ever mentioned it.

974
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,880
 One of the most important papers ever written in astrophysics,

975
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,880
 the authors were Alpha, Beta and Gamma.

976
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,200
 (LAUGHTER)

977
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,640
 It's not quite Gamma, but it's close enough.

978
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,280
 And the reason for this is a guy called George Gamma,

979
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,160
 who's the professor on the project.

980
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,760
 And this paper was so important.

981
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,200
 It was in 1948, and it basically discovered

982
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,000
 that the background radiation of the Big Bang

983
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,320
 essentially kind of justified the Big Bang happening,

984
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,880
 and it talked about that it created hydrogen and helium

985
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,600
 and all the elements that we now live with today

986
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,040
 in their proportions. Seminal paper.

987
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,640
 So the lead author was George Gamma.

988
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,080
 His PhD student was Ralph Alpha.

989
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,960
 George Gamma said, "Hey, Ralph, wouldn't it be so funny?

990
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,520
 "I've got a colleague called Beta.

991
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,440
 "He's really nothing to do with this whole astrophysics thing,

992
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,720
 "but let's put him as an author on the paper,

993
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,640
 "and then I'll be Alpha, Beta, Gamma."

994
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,920
 And Alpha said, "Absolutely not.

995
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,120
 "This is a huge deal for me. I'm a PhD student."

996
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,320
 No, and he got completely ignored.

997
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,600
 And in fact, not only that, but George Gamma asked

998
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,600
 another one of his colleagues called Herman

999
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,400
 if he'd changed his name to Delta in all they could.

1000
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,120
 Oh, wow. That's too far.

1001
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,040
 And they went ahead, and, like, he was furious.

1002
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,440
 Ralph Alpha was so angry for years afterwards,

1003
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,200
 said it completely, like, undid my great achievements.

1004
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
 So, okay, yeah, nominative determinism.

1005
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,440
 We think it's probably bunk,

1006
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,320
 but there was a paper by a group of researchers

1007
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,320
 about medical workers and, you know,

1008
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,440
 all kinds of medical work, and it was a group of researchers

1009
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,520
 who found that there was a greater frequency of medical names

1010
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,640
 in various specialisms than you would expect by chance.

1011
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,960
 And the researchers were named Lim, Lim, Lim and Lim.

1012
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,760
 They were in the same family, but still.

1013
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,840
 So, you know, they looked in the American director of physicians,

1014
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,040
 and they found lots of doctors with the surname Doctor,

1015
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,240
 or Fix, or Cure, or Heal.

1016
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,520
 And they also found that some promising partnerships

1017
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,680
 failed to materialise.

1018
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
 Doctors Batman and Robin are registered,

1019
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,560
 but failed to team up in any speciality.

1020
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,000
 It's selfish. It's almost like they've got bigger priorities.

1021
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,440
 And the paper which debunked it, which most people point at,

1022
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,240
 was in the Journal of Personal and Social Psychology,

1023
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,480
 and it was called "I Sell Seashells by the Seashore"

1024
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,120
 and my name is Jack.

1025
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,840
 -Killjoy. -That's so good.

1026
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,800
 I think now, because we've talked about

1027
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,720
 so much nominative determinism over the years,

1028
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,560
 as in just names that are very apt.

1029
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,280
 And now, I feel like we have to go a level up,

1030
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,000
 so you've got to, like, do the doubles.

1031
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 You know, if two of someone's names are nominative deterministic,

1032
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,360
 like Andrew Drinkwater.

1033
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,880
 I think that's the loudest head of research

1034
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,240
 at the Water Research Centre.

1035
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,480
 -That's good. -He drinks water.

1036
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,080
 I think that's okay.

1037
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,040
 I also like doubles.

1038
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,200
 I just spend quite a lot of time looking at the students' guide

1039
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,840
 to the seashore that was written by fish and fish.

1040
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,320
 I probably spent an hour desperately trying to find out

1041
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,760
 if they were related and hoping they weren't,

1042
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,840
 because then that would be an amazing catch.

1043
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,000
 -Yeah. -Hey.

1044
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,280
 They are husband and wife.

1045
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,880
 I've discovered deep in the bowels of Cardiff University website.

1046
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,640
 I think, and also, Andy's favourite thing of words,

1047
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,320
 like, name sentences.

1048
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,480
 -Yes. -Yeah, so what are the examples of that we always say?

1049
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,960
 Like, Ben Folds and Jeremy Irons.

1050
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,560
 -Tom Waits. -Yeah, yeah, I think--

1051
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,240
 -Wesley Snipes. -Sting.

1052
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,120
 -Sti-- no, not sting. -No.

1053
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,600
 It works if it's an imperative, but that's not a proper--

1054
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,920
 -Sorry, James. -I was reading a study from 2018,

1055
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,640
 and this is about injecting medicine directly into your eyes.

1056
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,040
 Okay, that sounds pretty awful,

1057
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,120
 but apparently, if you have something called macular edema,

1058
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,640
 it really, really helps.

1059
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,960
 And the person who came up with that idea

1060
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,960
 was a physician called Douglas Jabs.

1061
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,800
 -Oh, that's great. -Sentence person.

1062
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,440
 -Annenominative determinism. -Yeah, that's amazing.

1063
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,200
 -Takes the screen. -I found a urologist

1064
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,040
 who performs vasectomies called Dr. Richard Chopp,

1065
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,720
 aka Dr. Dick Chopp.

1066
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,160
 -That's the double. -Yeah, it's the double.

1067
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,720
 -And that's well done. -That's quite a strong one.

1068
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,520
 There was, in fact, on a similar vein,

1069
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,720
 there was, and I think the 19--

1070
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
 -Vain. -The--

1071
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,040
 Oh.

1072
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,840
 There was--

1073
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,440
 Ron's clenching.

1074
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,040
 There was a quote in the British Medical Journal in 1935,

1075
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,280
 a guy calling for all male children to be circumcised

1076
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,400
 in order to reduce masturbation, which he thought was very harmful.

1077
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,960
 And he was called Richard Cockshut.

1078
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,960
 -No. -Very good.

1079
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,840
 -Shut that cock, kids. -Shut that cock.

1080
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,840
 -That's a hell of a catchphrase.

1081
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,360
 It's a sitcom from the '70s, isn't it?

1082
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,440
 -Larry Grayson, shut that cock.

1083
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,440
 -Have you thought about our names and what we,

1084
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,040
 if we were connected to a thing, what would it be?

1085
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,720
 -Shrieber is writer. -Shrieber would be writer.

1086
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,320
 -Toshinski means, like, little bird.

1087
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,080
 -Like a little bird, which is why I'm wearing owls

1088
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,160
 on my dress today. -That's right.

1089
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,000
 -You'll notice I'm never not wearing a bird.

1090
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,600
 -Is that true? -No.

1091
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,120
 LAUGHTER

1092
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,400
 -I mean, how long have you known that?

1093
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,360
 -Yes. Yes and yes.

1094
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,160
 But I just thought, "Oh, my God, I can't believe

1095
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,920
 "I've never noticed that all this time

1096
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,560
 "I'm the worst friend and colleague in the world."

1097
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,440
 -It was a test. -I would have thought--

1098
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,040
 I think Harkin is just a place in Ireland or something.

1099
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
 -Well, Harkin's-- No, that's got an interesting thing.

1100
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,640
 It goes back and back, and so it's sort of, like,

1101
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,640
 changes, but as it goes further back,

1102
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,440
 "bloody" and "pig" are two things.

1103
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,040
 -Sounds about right. -So a farmer, maybe?

1104
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,640
 You knew about the chickens earlier, so maybe that's--

1105
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,200
 -What are you? -Well, Murray, yeah.

1106
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,240
 -Murray. -I'm surely just a river in Scotland, isn't it?

1107
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,200
 -Yes, sea and settlement is the kind of thing.

1108
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,120
 -It sounds a bit like Murray if you were a wedding officiant,

1109
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,640
 maybe, at a stretch. -I'd love to do that.

1110
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,320
 -He murried me today.

1111
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,400
 -That sounds disgusting.

1112
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,760
 You'd rather he'd murried me.

1113
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,640
 -Do you want to get murried? -Murried?

1114
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,240
 -No.

1115
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,720
 -Reader, I murried him.

1116
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,800
 -We need a wrap-up.

1117
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,360
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

1118
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,040
