1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
 I am really happy in the middle bit

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,320
 between Christmas and New Year.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,400
 Ooh, very nice.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,240
 Thank you very much.

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,640
 I'm trying to get a range of greeting cards out.

6
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,480
 Going very soon.

7
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,480
 No, was to buy greetings cards after Christmas, very weird.

8
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,680
 - Yeah, Dan and Andy here.

9
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,120
 We just want to quickly let you know

10
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,880
 what you're about to listen to.

11
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,960
 This is a compilation of all the outtakes

12
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,040
 from the whole of 2017.

13
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,760
 Every podcast, we always chop away a lot of stuff

14
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,240
 and James has been secretly collecting it

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,160
 to put together for this big bumper addition,

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,880
 78-minute-long episode.

17
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,880
 - 78 minutes.

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,240
 - 78 minutes of outtake.

19
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,680
 - I could watch a short children's film.

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,440
 We're a very, very long episode of Frazier in that time.

21
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,440
 Frazier made 78-minute-long episodes.

22
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,360
 - I don't believe so, but it was the,

23
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,880
 the only thing I can think of that's shorter than 78 minutes.

24
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,200
 So what we're saying is, please do enjoy it

25
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,520
 unless there's a weird Frazier marathon on,

26
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,920
 in which case we give you a license to go

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,920
 and watch that instead.

28
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,040
 We hope you enjoy this.

29
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,440
 Have a wonderful New Year.

30
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,200
 When it comes, I will see you then.

31
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,560
 - All right, on with the outtakes.

32
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,800
 - I'm off to watch Frazier.

33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,180
 (upbeat music)

34
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:16,880
 - Did you guys know that anteaters,

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,520
 who have obviously famously long tongues,

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,960
 have got very, very few taste buds?

37
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,800
 - Really?

38
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,640
 - Yeah.

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,480
 - What does one taste but every middle, eh?

40
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,200
 - They can hardly taste what they're eating.

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,840
 - Well, they're eating shitty ants and you know,

42
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,680
 termites and stuff.

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,520
 - They're eating ants and they occasionally swallow dirt

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
 as well as the other thing.

45
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,360
 - Yeah, really?

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,600
 - So it may be an advantage.

47
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,880
 - You don't need to be a,

48
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,240
 'cause all ants are gonna taste the same, right?

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,760
 They're gonna taste vinegary.

50
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,600
 - Oh.

51
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,440
 - Yeah, they are.

52
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
 - No. - 'Cause they're full of formic acid.

53
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,280
 - That's so antists.

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,120
 - Disagree.

55
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,960
 - 100% disagree.

56
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,720
 'Cause there are some of those ants,

57
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,200
 and they do remember, they swallow honey

58
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,080
 and they hang upside down,

59
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,680
 and they're sort of honey repositories.

60
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,240
 - Imagine how much you must think you've locked out

61
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,080
 when you get the odd honey tasting ants.

62
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,560
 Such a relief.

63
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,840
 They have, well, pangolins, which look quite similar,

64
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,920
 have their tongues attached to their pelvis.

65
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
 I don't know if I'm using the same thing,

66
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,880
 'cause they have such long tongues,

67
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,480
 when they start their pelvis.

68
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,840
 So I think their tongues are.

69
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,440
 - So they're attached at the back.

70
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,280
 - They don't.

71
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,120
 - They don't, they don't.

72
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
 - They don't.

73
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,280
 - They're on the inside of them.

74
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,640
 They're the way their tongue comes out

75
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,480
 and then sweeps around.

76
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,640
 - That's what I was thinking.

77
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,720
 Yeah. - Hang on.

78
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,560
 - Yeah.

79
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,120
 - It can't be all tongue all the way back.

80
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,520
 It's to all tongue, all the way back into a pangolin.

81
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,600
 Their tongues are longer than their bodies are.

82
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,560
 - What's the point of that?

83
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,760
 - So you can, I guess, maneuver it all the way down the tongue.

84
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,120
 And once it's back at the pelvis,

85
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,640
 the food's practically there.

86
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,960
 The belly need a digestive system.

87
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,200
 I don't know, they've just tested for the truth.

88
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,440
 - That's amazing.

89
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
 - Isn't it true that I think woodpeckers

90
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,960
 have them all the way through back into the skull

91
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,280
 and they wind around the skull?

92
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,200
 I've seen like an X-ray of them, right?

93
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,560
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

94
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,880
 - And that helps cushion their skull

95
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,040
 when they're pecking, doesn't it?

96
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,320
 - As well as being a useful place to store their tongue.

97
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,800
 - Do you know what the longest tongue is?

98
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
 And this is relation to body size.

99
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,840
 - It must be this pangolin.

100
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,480
 I think, no, go on.

101
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,680
 - Go for it, no, have a bat.

102
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
 - Is it a bat?

103
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,120
 - Yes, it is, yeah, it's the tube-lipped nectar bat.

104
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,480
 And its tongue can go to 1.5 times the length

105
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,760
 of its actual body.

106
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,600
 - Wow.

107
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,000
 So that's the longest tongue in proportion to body size.

108
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 - Exactly, in an animal.

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,760
 - I know the length of that bat.

110
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,600
 - Oh do you?

111
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,960
 Nora fist you later.

112
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,720
 - How on earth did you remember that?

113
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,760
 - It's weird that with it having such a massive tongue

114
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,560
 and a tongue being 1.5 times bigger than the whole thing

115
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,400
 that they choose to name it after the lip.

116
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,960
 - Yes, that's true.

117
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,680
 - But maybe they didn't see the tongue for a long time.

118
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,040
 Maybe they're like, well, look at that lip.

119
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,200
 - Almost no one had ever seen the tongue

120
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,040
 because it's always in these massively long flower nose.

121
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
 - What am I saying now?

122
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
 - The flower nose.

123
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,880
 - The flower nose.

124
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,720
 - The trumpet of a flower.

125
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,160
 - Did they think that the bat's face was a flower?

126
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,480
 (laughing)

127
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
 That's got the head of a flower.

128
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
 - It's really weird.

129
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,320
 - Do you know when an elephant's charging you

130
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,360
 when you should be nervous?

131
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,120
 - It's running towards you very fast.

132
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,240
 - Is it only about 30 centimeters

133
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,800
 for a hit to you, you panic?

134
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,000
 (laughing)

135
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,840
 - It's not that.

136
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,480
 If an elephant has its trunk out, this is according to.

137
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,840
 - Whoa, what is it?

138
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,480
 How can it have its trunk in?

139
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
 - If it's up its bum.

140
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
 (laughing)

141
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,640
 - If it's like coiled up, I guess.

142
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,560
 I'm like not in use.

143
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,040
 - Yeah, if it's trunk is like, that is facing downwards

144
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,640
 or coiled up or it's relaxed.

145
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,280
 - It's always out, that was it.

146
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,920
 - It is always out, so it's never sucked into its face.

147
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,760
 - Yeah.

148
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,320
 - It's just like lifting up and it's doing like,

149
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,720
 one of those like, charge the light brigade

150
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,960
 like fanfares out of it.

151
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,360
 Like, and charging at you, that's when you know

152
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,200
 it's going to attack.

153
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
 - No, it's not going to attack then

154
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,280
 when it's doing the charge of the light brigade.

155
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,720
 So when it's got its trunk protruding out towards you,

156
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,960
 you can absolutely relax.

157
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,240
 You're going to be fine.

158
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,880
 Apparently, that's a bluff.

159
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,200
 And it's when the trunk's down and relax

160
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
 that they're doing a proper job.

161
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
 - I've never seen an elephant

162
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,360
 with its trunk straight out like a...

163
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,640
 - Well, that's because they genuinely want

164
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,200
 to trample you down, James.

165
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,120
 - Have you seen that that I've never even seen

166
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,960
 a picture of that?

167
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,800
 - I haven't really.

168
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,040
 - I'm running with your fist out.

169
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,880
 - Ready to hit someone.

170
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
 - Yeah.

171
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,160
 - But you very rarely get to photograph

172
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,680
 an elephant charging from the side on.

173
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,520
 Don't you?

174
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,760
 Normally, a human elephant contact is rare enough,

175
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,200
 especially in Safari,

176
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,240
 that there wouldn't be another group of people

177
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,560
 photographing the elephant from the side.

178
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,960
 - So you're saying he saw it face on

179
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
 and it just looked like an elephant without a trunk.

180
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,200
 - It's pointing straight out of his.

181
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,520
 - I do see that.

182
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,120
 But I'm just surprised I've never come across a picture

183
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,960
 like that.

184
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,800
 - I think something that happens.

185
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,440
 - I'm surprised I didn't look at Google images

186
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,560
 as soon as I read the facts.

187
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,160
 - So what's going to happen if the trunk is stretched

188
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
 down and it's bluffing?

189
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Will it just get up to you and then they're just being

190
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,840
 awkward?

191
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,040
 - Get up to you and then noddle you, friend.

192
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,960
 In a friendly manner.

193
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
 - Shove is shrunken your mouth.

194
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,400
 - Just thinks you're stressed.

195
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,880
 It's just to scare you away.

196
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,720
 - Oh, okay.

197
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,840
 I think it would work for me.

198
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,160
 - Even if I remember this conversation and thought,

199
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,840
 Hannah said that that's not gonna hurt me.

200
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
 - Imagine if I've got this the wrong way around

201
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,960
 and how guilty I'm gonna feel.

202
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
 - Well, I always forget the numbers.

203
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,400
 I always think 99% of elephant charges of bluffs.

204
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,160
 And then I think, or is that 99% of shark attacks?

205
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,000
 - Yeah.

206
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,320
 - And actually, only 4% of elephant charges of bluffs.

207
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,480
 (laughing)

208
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,320
 - But then it's also like, but the black bear

209
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,160
 and the brown bear.

210
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,560
 But then brown bears can be black.

211
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,760
 And then which one is way...

212
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,600
 - It's the nightmare.

213
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,440
 - Yeah.

214
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,280
 - Yeah.

215
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
 - Just run away from them all.

216
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,200
 I think it's what I was saying.

217
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,280
 Just live in a city.

218
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,240
 (laughing)

219
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,960
 - Have you heard of Hobart's funnies?

220
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,800
 - No.

221
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,440
 - Good, great.

222
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,000
 So these were tanks that were used in D-Day.

223
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,800
 And there was this whole range.

224
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,440
 Like a range of superheroes, basically.

225
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,400
 They all each had their own special superpower.

226
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,320
 - Were they named funnies because they're unusual?

227
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,160
 - Yeah, pretty much.

228
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,960
 - That was a sort of nickname they were given.

229
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,160
 There was one whose sole job was

230
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,560
 to carry massive bundles of sticks.

231
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,240
 - Ah, fash skis.

232
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,080
 - Fash skis, exactly.

233
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,440
 It was called the faskine carrier.

234
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,080
 And it basically, if you came to a ramp

235
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,720
 that was too steep or a hole in the ground

236
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,560
 that you needed to fill in,

237
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,080
 it just dropped a few massive bundles of,

238
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,640
 and these were enormous bundles of sticks.

239
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,640
 - And that's where the name fashism comes from.

240
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,480
 - Exactly.

241
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,800
 So it was using the faskine carrier to defeat fashism.

242
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,640
 - Yeah.

243
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,480
 - Ah.

244
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,760
 - They were the first ones actually.

245
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,040
 The first armoured vehicle launch bridges,

246
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,800
 were the ones that just carried a big bunch of sticks

247
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,720
 and then tip them into a ditch.

248
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,120
 - It can't assume very scary.

249
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,080
 If those were the first things

250
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,440
 the Germans saw on the horizon.

251
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,280
 (laughing)

252
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,080
 - The least scary robot was robots.

253
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,240
 - Yeah.

254
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,720
 - But you would think that the like in the end of Macbeth,

255
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,200
 spoiler alert, trees, the trees are coming towards you.

256
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,040
 - Oh yeah, that's true.

257
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,640
 Yeah, I guess any German soldiers

258
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,160
 who had done the English PTSD wouldn't be frightened.

259
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,160
 - Did you guys know that,

260
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,920
 and I'm not sure that this is true.

261
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,720
 So I'm sort of asking, as well as saying,

262
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,800
 that in France, Camembert is the translated equivalent

263
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,240
 of our pie chart.

264
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
 - It is.

265
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,920
 - Is it?

266
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,760
 - Camembert.

267
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,600
 - Camembert charts.

268
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,000
 - Let's take a look at this Camembert for a pie chart.

269
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,840
 - That's awesome.

270
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,000
 - Yeah, and that's because the correct way to eat

271
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,960
 Camembert is to slice it into pie shapes, really.

272
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,040
 - And then the people who think trees

273
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,320
 may be a better prime minister,

274
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,960
 get one bit of the cheese.

275
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,120
 - They got tiny little slither of cheese.

276
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,160
 (laughing)

277
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,120
 And they don't know who's just getting massive of the cheese.

278
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,880
 And actually on Reddit, I think it was this year,

279
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,640
 or it was late last year, they had a big argument

280
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,080
 where somebody showed a picture of a Camembert

281
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,840
 that their mum had cut.

282
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,760
 And their mum had cut it in not a slicey way.

283
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,400
 And this was a French lady,

284
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,120
 and they were all saying she should be kicked out

285
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,560
 the country for that.

286
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,160
 - I've got to say, I wouldn't cross my mind

287
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,880
 not to slice it up like a pie.

288
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,480
 Who's doing it in a slicey way?

289
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,320
 That's insane.

290
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,160
 - This lady.

291
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,000
 - Well, this lady.

292
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,240
 - We would have a kicked out.

293
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,440
 - Well, they didn't kick her out.

294
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,480
 I don't think in the end.

295
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,200
 But someone said, oh, there's a cause

296
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,640
 for loss of nationality.

297
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,000
 And another commenter said,

298
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,320
 "Take her to the British border immediately."

299
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,120
 (laughing)

300
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,440
 - I actually cut off the top of the Camembert,

301
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
 the whole thing.

302
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,280
 - Just the mold.

303
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,640
 - I just eat that.

304
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,440
 - 'Cause that is just solid bacteria, isn't it?

305
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
 Basically, I think so.

306
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,120
 - The rind of the Camembert, the edible liquid.

307
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,200
 A solid mat of mold.

308
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,320
 - And then the bacteria is a little brownie bits,

309
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,000
 and you should have some brown bits on it,

310
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,880
 but not too much.

311
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,720
 - Like a banana?

312
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,280
 - Yes, like a banana.

313
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,240
 That depends what you like in a banana.

314
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,880
 - That also probably depends what you like in a Camembert.

315
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,640
 - No, this is objective facts.

316
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,400
 (laughing)

317
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,520
 - So I've been to Pompeii.

318
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,920
 I went last year, and there was a lot of brothels there

319
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,520
 that they found which were still standing.

320
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,040
 In particular, there's one called Lupinar,

321
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,080
 and the Latin for that is she-wolf,

322
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,920
 which was slang for prostitutes.

323
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,560
 And it was two levels, had five rooms,

324
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,120
 and you know that it's a brothel because on the walls,

325
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,600
 there was still depictions of people in various positions,

326
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,360
 having sex, and they think the idea behind that

327
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,720
 was it was almost like porn material to be watching

328
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,960
 while you were having sex.

329
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,240
 It was the equivalent of having a pornographic movie

330
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,200
 on in the background for them.

331
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,040
 Isn't that weird?

332
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,600
 They had porn on their walls in the brothel.

333
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,080
 - It might have been like one of those menus,

334
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,120
 where if you don't speak the language,

335
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,440
 you just point at the thing you want.

336
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,720
 But yeah, no, it's an extraordinary place.

337
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,600
 Highly recommend, if you go there.

338
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,800
 - They also, one of the things I find amazing about Pompeii,

339
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,680
 it might be Herculenium, which was the place

340
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,480
 nearby, the same thing happened to it,

341
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,000
 is the scrolls that were found.

342
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,560
 So 800 scrolls were found, perfectly preserved,

343
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,120
 as everything there was.

344
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,880
 And it's, you know, one of the ancient world's

345
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,480
 best surviving libraries, most extensive surviving libraries,

346
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,680
 and we can't read it, or we can't read a huge amount of it,

347
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,520
 because they're in such a delicate state

348
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,360
 that we can't touch them.

349
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,760
 So we've got all these rolled up scrolls,

350
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,440
 and we don't know what they say,

351
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,080
 and they're sitting in museums and stuff,

352
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,080
 and we're just developing the X-ray technology

353
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,200
 to try and read bits of them, and they've just found out

354
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,120
 that they use lead sometimes in the ink,

355
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,960
 and now X-rays can see what the lead shapes are,

356
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,040
 and work out what they read.

357
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,320
 But how annoying is that?

358
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,560
 Wouldn't you just, if I saw that, I'd try an Unreal one.

359
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,120
 - Is that case? - Oh, well, they did try,

360
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,120
 but every time they tried, they would just fall apart.

361
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,600
 - Oh, so they did sample that for the time. - Yeah, they tried it,

362
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,720
 and they'd fall apart, and then I read an article,

363
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
 I don't know how this would work, but one time they said,

364
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,200
 they tried to open it and explode it.

365
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,720
 - Wow. - Can I just open it and explode?

366
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,280
 That don't know how that works. - Wow.

367
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,440
 But yeah, this X-ray stuff is really interesting, isn't it?

368
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,760
 Because they convertually unroll scrolls,

369
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,680
 which is just unbelievable. - It's so cool.

370
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,280
 - So they kind of get the X-ray scan of it,

371
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,400
 and then they go, okay, now we're gonna take off the first layer,

372
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,840
 and they can unroll it, and they can see what's on the next layer,

373
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,040
 which is just outrageous. - Yeah, that's super cool.

374
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,600
 - Amazing. - How many scrolls do you think they ruined

375
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,680
 that turned a dust in their hand before they went,

376
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
 "You know what, this isn't working?"

377
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,160
 - I would have stopped after about 50.

378
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,320
 - I simply... (laughing)

379
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,840
 - In the 1930s, sociologist Norbert Elias walked around Europe

380
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,680
 with his shoelaces on tie to see what people would say to him.

381
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,200
 - No. - He did.

382
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,680
 - What was his real name, though?

383
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,000
 (laughing)

384
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,120
 - Oh, very good. - Yeah.

385
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,960
 - That sounds like alias.

386
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,440
 (laughing)

387
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,760
 - That's good.

388
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,760
 He found that in England, most old men won that he might fall over.

389
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,880
 When he was in Germany, the old men would look at him with contempt.

390
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,440
 - Wow. - And he was walking around

391
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,960
 a Spanish fishing village with his shoelaces untied,

392
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,240
 and he felt that he was being warned that his laces were untied,

393
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,440
 but he felt that it was helping him to be included

394
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,120
 in the village community.

395
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,600
 - Really? - Yeah, I think I read about this guy.

396
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,960
 There's something about, I don't know what country he was walking,

397
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,360
 and a bunch of girls were giggling at him,

398
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,920
 little girls were giggling at him because of the untying

399
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,520
 of the shoelaces, and then he tied them up,

400
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,520
 and that really transformed how he felt about his connection

401
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,720
 to the places that he was in, when he realized who he was, yeah.

402
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,960
 - That's weird because if I saw someone walking around

403
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
 with the shoelaces untied, I think my instinct would be

404
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,040
 to go and try and step on one and to trip them over.

405
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,680
 So you not find that, happened a lot?

406
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,000
 (laughing)

407
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,560
 - Or to wait until they stop and then to tie them together.

408
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,280
 - Yeah, definitely. - Oh, wow, yeah.

409
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,120
 - If you've got enough time for that, that's the dream.

410
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
 (laughing)

411
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,640
 - Do you guys know about the orangutan that can tie knots,

412
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,320
 and we don't know why, and this sounds like a,

413
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,120
 it's a bullshit animal fact,

414
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,320
 but it's genuinely true and it's bizarre.

415
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,640
 So there's this orangutan called Watana.

416
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,520
 She was born, I think it's a she.

417
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,040
 Yeah, she was born in 1995 in Belgium,

418
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,840
 and this guy called Chris Hertz,

419
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,320
 who's written a book about her,

420
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,840
 but she ties knots and no one's ever taught her to do it,

421
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,160
 and she just finds two threads or two finds or whatever,

422
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,520
 then she ties them together.

423
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,000
 - I think she's trying to escape.

424
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,080
 (laughing)

425
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,520
 - Is she kept in a very high zoo?

426
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,760
 (laughing)

427
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,000
 - She's, she's never tried to climb up out of them

428
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,560
 or hand herself from them.

429
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,400
 - She's.

430
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,240
 - Sorry.

431
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,360
 (laughing)

432
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
 - Are you hosting her?

433
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,960
 - That got dark, very quickly.

434
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
 (laughing)

435
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,880
 - That was my instinct when he said she was trying to escape,

436
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,160
 and I realized that I'd got it wrong.

437
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,280
 - Escape from the monotony of life.

438
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,040
 (laughing)

439
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,480
 - There was an article in The New York Times from 1976,

440
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,120
 which reports an occasion where there was an exhibition game

441
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,800
 of football between a team from China and a team from Athens,

442
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,480
 and over the loudspeaker, a tune started blaring,

443
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,080
 and both teams stood up and put hands on hearts,

444
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,040
 because you know, they seemed it was the other ones,

445
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,160
 national hook of them, and it turned out it was a toothpaste

446
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
 advert.

447
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,000
 (laughing)

448
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Everyone, the stadium stood up, and respectfully.

449
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,840
 - That was amazing.

450
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,680
 That's really good.

451
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,560
 - Do you know what the rules are about singing the anthem?

452
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,800
 The government have said that you should dress appropriately.

453
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,640
 - Right.

454
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,360
 - Also that you should stand still.

455
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,200
 - Right.

456
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,520
 - And that you should be full of energy.

457
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,680
 (laughing)

458
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,520
 - Okay.

459
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
 - That's interesting.

460
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,440
 - Yeah.

461
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,680
 - Stand still, so you're ready to go, basically.

462
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,160
 - Yeah, I think you have to be quivering, basically.

463
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,000
 (laughing)

464
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,280
 - That's not still.

465
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
 - No, you're right, you're right.

466
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
 I don't know how do you say that.

467
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,800
 - As soon as they finish, everyone's just gonna explode

468
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,280
 in some kind of--

469
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,640
 - Yeah, and you're not allowed to whisper during it.

470
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,640
 You're not allowed to talk on the phone during it.

471
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,720
 - But lots of countries have weird rules, don't they?

472
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,560
 - That's true.

473
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,800
 - I think Philippines, in the Philippines,

474
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,640
 their national anthem has to be between 120 beats per minute.

475
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,960
 The Star Spangled Banner, when that was first written,

476
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,640
 it was supposed to be Conspirito, which means with spirit.

477
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,960
 - Oh, I thought you meant it was meant to be called?

478
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,800
 - No.

479
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
 - Conspirito.

480
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,120
 - It sounds like a magician.

481
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,960
 - Yeah.

482
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,800
 (laughing)

483
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,280
 - And also, the God saved the Queen.

484
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,240
 George the Fifth, he thought he was an expert

485
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,640
 'cause he'd listened to it so many times.

486
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,480
 And he said.

487
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,840
 (laughing)

488
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,760
 - It was called God Save the King then as well.

489
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,600
 - Yeah.

490
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,920
 - He was desperate pleading for some kind of skill.

491
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,680
 How many times have you listened to it?

492
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,480
 (laughing)

493
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,640
 - If that is for, he is like,

494
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,280
 I'm the person who has to hear this more than any of you.

495
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,120
 - That's true.

496
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,200
 - Please, can you sing it right?

497
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,720
 - But if he sings it, it's called God Save Me.

498
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,440
 - I'm sorry, that doesn't scam.

499
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,640
 - God save our gracious me.

500
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,800
 It was like Prince Philip's joke.

501
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,200
 He jokes that he's the world's best plaque on Vaila.

502
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,040
 - Oh yeah.

503
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,200
 - And there's a great cut of him saying it repeatedly.

504
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,600
 - It's still a good joke.

505
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,960
 - Anyway, he said that the opening section,

506
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,440
 you should set your metronome to 60.

507
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,120
 And then later on it goes down to 52.

508
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,560
 Well, that's pretty slow, that.

509
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,640
 (laughing)

510
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,600
 - What sort of as everyone loses energy?

511
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,880
 - No, no, that's always a big ending

512
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,840
 of an American national anthem.

513
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
 - No, you're talking about God Save Me.

514
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,680
 - I'm talking about God Save the King.

515
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,520
 - I'm sorry, I'm talking about God Save the King.

516
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,040
 - So the American national anthem was supposed to be quite,

517
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,680
 you know, conspirator with spirit

518
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,720
 was supposed to be kind of quite upbeat

519
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,560
 and whatever.

520
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,680
 Of course, these days, if you watch the Super Bowl,

521
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,320
 you can bet on how long it's gonna be

522
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,960
 and the average is usually about one minute,

523
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,680
 50 or something I think.

524
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,720
 - Is that slow?

525
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,680
 - Yeah.

526
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,360
 So they put loads of extra notes in like,

527
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,800
 they're on American Idol, don't they?

528
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,400
 (laughing)

529
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,840
 - Other things that are being played at the wrong tempo?

530
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,680
 - Oh yeah.

531
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,080
 - A lot of bait hoven.

532
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,040
 So this is a theory that bait hoven's metronome

533
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,880
 was broken.

534
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,160
 (laughing)

535
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,360
 - That just says like a sick bird from the review.

536
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,360
 I just, wait, so he wrote his songs at the wrong tempo?

537
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,080
 - No, he wrote them at the wrong tempo

538
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,160
 'cause his metronome was wrong.

539
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,080
 So this is some research that's been done by...

540
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,240
 - He's been by Brahms.

541
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,720
 (laughing)

542
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,560
 - Because he has...

543
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,440
 - He's not playing like, whoa, this is fast.

544
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,600
 - No, no, no, no, that's not...

545
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,080
 So he played it at a tempo that doesn't sound fast.

546
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,360
 But he ever went through a phase of writing

547
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,760
 pieces of music that are unplayably fast.

548
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,640
 So between 1850 and 1820, the timing that he writes,

549
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,000
 the time he says he should play it in

550
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
 is like unplayably fast, it's impossible.

551
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,520
 So no one plays it at that tempo

552
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,440
 and everyone thinks, well, why not, that he write this?

553
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,360
 It sounds awful.

554
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,600
 It's frantic and mad.

555
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,640
 And it turns out this guy called Peter Stadlin,

556
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,400
 who's a pianist, did some in-depth research

557
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,000
 and some mathematical analysis

558
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,560
 and worked out that the metronome he had

559
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,160
 was weighted slightly wrong.

560
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,040
 So Beethoven was just writing down the wrong stuff

561
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,400
 because his metronome was ticking wrong.

562
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,800
 So when his metronome was saying,

563
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,720
 yeah, you're playing a 60 beats a minute,

564
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,520
 he was actually playing at 90 beats a minute.

565
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,360
 - That is brilliant.

566
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,920
 - That's amazing to know he wrote to a metronome.

567
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,040
 I'd never...

568
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,960
 - Well, he actually owned the first ever metronome, I think,

569
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,520
 or he owned a metronome that was made

570
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,120
 by the inventor of the metronome.

571
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,960
 He was really excited by this new technology.

572
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,960
 Turns out it wasn't actually quite developed for the end.

573
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,920
 - I suppose it's plausible that you could have a pianist

574
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,720
 who writes music and all of his keys are out of tune

575
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,080
 and then when he writes it down,

576
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,880
 it's just a completely different tune

577
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,560
 to what he thought it was.

578
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,520
 Like every single time Beethoven thought

579
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,720
 he was writing Happy Birthday or something,

580
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,960
 but then his keys just kept going out of tune.

581
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,680
 - Do you think Beethoven's 9th is actually Happy Birthday?

582
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,520
 - Yeah.

583
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,360
 - Miss Written.

584
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,400
 - I don't really think that.

585
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,560
 - There's a really creepy ant colony

586
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,400
 that they've just discovered in Poland,

587
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,760
 which lives in old Soviet nuclear bunker.

588
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
 And basically, there's this Anson S on top of a ventilation pipe

589
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,880
 outlet that comes up from the nuclear bunker,

590
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,960
 but a lot of ants are falling through this ventilation pipe

591
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,720
 and they're falling into the bunker below,

592
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,240
 which is about three meters underground,

593
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,400
 and then they can't get out,

594
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,480
 so they can't climb up the walls and get back out.

595
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,680
 And they do what ants do, so they build nests

596
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,600
 and they operate as ants, but they have no food, obviously,

597
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,960
 so they die eventually, but they constantly are being replenished.

598
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,520
 So there's this deadly community where new ants keep falling

599
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,200
 down onto what is now about a few centimeters thick layer

600
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,240
 of their dead comrades, and then they just keep working

601
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,560
 and building at their nests, and they die,

602
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,720
 and then their stock is replenished.

603
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,760
 - Oh my god, that's like six sci-fi films.

604
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,600
 - It is, isn't it?

605
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,640
 - It sounds like a metaphor for the Soviet times.

606
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,600
 (laughs)

607
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,440
 - It does.

608
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,080
 I was thinking it's kind of like a metaphor for life, isn't it?

609
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,560
 - Yeah. - That's really just what we're doing.

610
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
 - Yeah, just falling into a life and dying

611
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,360
 on top of our dead comrades.

612
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,520
 - And on that note.

613
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,800
 (laughs)

614
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,720
 - In 1850, there's an article that I found it

615
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,480
 in the English Civil Engineer and Architects Journal,

616
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,240
 and it states that the Academy of Sciences in France

617
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,320
 was considering an idea for a suspension bridge

618
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,120
 between England and France, so going from Dove to Calais.

619
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,160
 Four barges would be sunk at equal distances

620
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,400
 apart across the channel, and then they'd have chains

621
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,240
 going up from the barges to the surface,

622
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,440
 and then the chains would be fixed to the bridge,

623
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,920
 which would run from England to France,

624
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,440
 and then above the bridge would be these huge balloons.

625
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,080
 It describes them as giant balloons of elliptical form

626
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,000
 and firmly secured, which would support in the air

627
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,120
 the extremity of these chains.

628
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,440
 In my head, I'm imagining it like the big red balls

629
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,920
 in total wipeout, and you could just bounce from balloon

630
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,760
 to balloon.

631
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,360
 - Now, I can see that working.

632
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,800
 What I think about those big plastic balls

633
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,360
 is they're in South America somewhere, aren't they?

634
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,560
 If mankind kind of collapses quite soon,

635
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,000
 and then all of the world just kind of becomes grown over

636
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,600
 by plants and stuff like that,

637
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,480
 they're made of plastic, so they won't really buy or degrade.

638
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,800
 So if aliens come along, all they'll see

639
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,480
 really is these big plastic things around.

640
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,600
 - No, no, I don't think that's true.

641
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,720
 - No, I think that's true.

642
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,840
 - If they landed in South America,

643
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,840
 all of the concrete and stuff would go before the plastic,

644
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,680
 surely.

645
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,160
 - But we've got a lot more plastic than just the balls

646
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,800
 that are used in this weird TV show.

647
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,640
 - Sure, sure, sure.

648
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,200
 But they'd probably think that that was the center

649
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,720
 of human civilization or something.

650
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,520
 This is where they built their greatest table.

651
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,880
 - Exactly, you were probably looking at it,

652
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,040
 and they probably, there may be north-south aligned

653
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,200
 or something like that, or they'd probably work out

654
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,160
 that they're aligned with the sun or something,

655
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,640
 and they think that it was a temple.

656
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,720
 - Yeah, although they think it's a model of the planners,

657
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,920
 they think it's an early human attempt

658
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,520
 to understand the solar system,

659
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,560
 and that the different sizes represent the different things.

660
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,160
 - They're all the same size, though.

661
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,840
 So they'd be like, you idiotic humans.

662
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,640
 - They thought that Mars and Jupiter were the same size.

663
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,320
 - Actually, James, you make a very compelling argument.

664
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,000
 Think of all the temples, the step pyramids in South America.

665
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,600
 Think of what game show they probably were.

666
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,440
 (all laughing)

667
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,840
 - And we're in Gladiators, they used to have a thing

668
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,520
 where you had to climb up a pyramid.

669
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,720
 - That was probably it.

670
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,560
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

671
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,760
 - You get to the top and at the top.

672
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
 You're sacrifice.

673
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,520
 (all laughing)

674
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,360
 - I think we all know that they'll assume

675
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,360
 the Disney plastic castle in Paris is our ultimate temple.

676
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,200
 - That's true.

677
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,800
 - We're gonna lose such a weird stuff behind it.

678
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,880
 I was reading an article the other day,

679
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,240
 about what happens first,

680
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,760
 when if all humans disappeared,

681
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,840
 the rough running order of how things wind down.

682
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,560
 (all laughing)

683
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,400
 It's fascinating,

684
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,560
 'cause it was talking about actually concrete

685
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,160
 last a lot less time than you would think,

686
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,160
 because freezing and thawing in, let's say, New York,

687
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,800
 actually in about 10 years,

688
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,360
 lots of plants will have grown

689
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,760
 in between the cracks in the concrete

690
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
 and it'll all be working loose.

691
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
 And actually, it's quite quickly that you end up with.

692
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,080
 - In 10 years?

693
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,200
 (all laughing)

694
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
 - It's like a bit more than that.

695
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,040
 - Well, I did think so.

696
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,200
 - 'Cause you know, just rebuild New York every 10 years today.

697
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,280
 - If I mean, if this is predicting the apocalypse

698
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,240
 and they're like, well, the concrete's gonna disappear

699
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,480
 in 10 years, that shouldn't have been headline.

700
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
 I can't believe they buried the news.

701
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,640
 - But it is a fair point, perhaps,

702
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,120
 that in 1,500 years or 2,000 years,

703
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,640
 that only the Disney Tower in Paris,

704
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,640
 the one in Disneyland, the one in Disney World,

705
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,360
 these are gonna be the only buildings left,

706
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,680
 'cause they made a plastic.

707
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,520
 - Yeah.

708
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,560
 - Are they made a plastic?

709
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,400
 (all laughing)

710
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,240
 - We assume.

711
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
 - Or just Wendy Houses.

712
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
 (all laughing)

713
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
 - Big wheel lift.

714
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,000
 - A tiny race of polypockets.

715
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,840
 (all laughing)

716
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,560
 - All the exhibits in their museums

717
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,440
 will be, you know, little Play-Mobile dolls and Lego people.

718
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,280
 (all laughing)

719
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,720
 We think that these were the life forms themselves

720
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,480
 frozen when they disaster came.

721
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,800
 - What are we talking about bridges?

722
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,640
 - You don't know.

723
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,240
 - Absolutely, you lost it.

724
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,280
 How does Dan keep this thing together?

725
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
 - So hard to know.

726
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,720
 - So much fun when teachers away.

727
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,280
 (all laughing)

728
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,240
 - They used to, in the medieval times,

729
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,400
 draw elephants with actual trumpets for trunks.

730
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,240
 - Did they?

731
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,080
 - Yeah.

732
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,160
 So the idea they think is not that they actually thought

733
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,480
 this was the case, but it was kind of an allegorical way

734
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,320
 of drawing.

735
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,560
 - It would be very weird if they thought

736
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,520
 it was like, if they'd seen an elephant

737
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,640
 and they saw a trumpet.

738
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,400
 - And the idea being that they did make loud noises

739
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,760
 and they thought their noises came from the trunks

740
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,440
 and the only way you can show them on a picture is

741
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,600
 by showing the trunk as natural trumpet.

742
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,440
 - Oh, cool.

743
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,240
 - And they think maybe a lot of medieval pictures

744
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,080
 are like this.

745
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,960
 They're more allegorical than actually literal.

746
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,800
 - Oh, that's kind of what I said,

747
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,760
 whenever you put anything that has notes coming out of it.

748
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,040
 Like, to symbolize music.

749
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,880
 - Yeah.

750
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,720
 - Like, a bit like that, yeah.

751
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,400
 - It's not a notation, it's not actually, yeah.

752
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,480
 - Yeah.

753
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,720
 - Wait, you said they thought that the noise came out

754
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,560
 of the trunks.

755
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,400
 - It does, doesn't it?

756
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,240
 - I don't know.

757
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,080
 - Yeah, they do.

758
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,160
 - It sounds very nasal, the noise.

759
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,560
 I think it comes out of the trunk.

760
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,400
 - Sure.

761
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,880
 - You're basing this off your own...

762
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,240
 - I just tried doing it, yeah.

763
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,520
 - And it sounded very elephant time

764
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,640
 when I did it out of the nose.

765
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,480
 - I think you're right.

766
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,720
 (laughing)

767
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,160
 - And now with the mouth?

768
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
 - Ha!

769
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
 It's not the same.

770
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,400
 - Actually, did you read about that woman?

771
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,720
 I think it was in this country.

772
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,080
 This week or last week, who ordered a takeaway,

773
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,000
 and she put a note on the takeaway,

774
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,680
 when it said, "Are there any delivery instructions?"

775
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,400
 Saying, "I feel so ill, I've got terrible flu.

776
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
 "Can't get out of bed, please.

777
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,680
 "Could you stop there chemist on the way

778
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,920
 "and bring me some Benadryl?

779
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,240
 "I don't even want the takeaway.

780
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,960
 "I'm only ordering this, so you can do that."

781
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,800
 (laughing)

782
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,440
 And so this restaurant brought her her medication.

783
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,680
 (laughing)

784
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,040
 - There was a Chinese restaurant near me

785
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,880
 that used to deliver cigarettes as well.

786
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,040
 So people just used to order a bag of prawn crackers

787
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,400
 and tin boxes of cigarettes.

788
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,000
 (laughing)

789
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,160
 I've got a whole business school who did a study

790
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,920
 and came up with this thing called the Ikea effect,

791
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,640
 which is that you place more value on Ikea

792
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,000
 for self-assembled furniture, which is what Ikea furniture used for you.

793
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,160
 - Yeah, because you made it yourself.

794
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,600
 - Yeah, and you kind of get attached to it

795
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,920
 and fall in love with it as you're building.

796
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
 And then by the end of it, you've got a shitty book,

797
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,640
 so it doesn't really stand out right, but you use yours.

798
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,840
 - But you fall in love with it.

799
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,680
 Is that, I think that's--

800
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,440
 - He said fall in love with those at his will, that's not why.

801
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,280
 - All right, okay.

802
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,040
 Because that would be like a good argument

803
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,480
 in favor of a robotic wife, for instance, that you build yourself--

804
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,200
 - Oh, yeah.

805
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
 - Or a Lego wife.

806
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,520
 - Yeah, either of those.

807
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,040
 - But she's too tiny for you.

808
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
 - She will be tiny.

809
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,240
 (laughing)

810
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,400
 - You get massive Lego people, though, don't you?

811
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,240
 - Do you?

812
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,480
 - Yeah, Lego Latin, Lego Latin.

813
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,640
 - Not like a Lego Latin.

814
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,120
 - But you'd have to get married at Lego Latin, wouldn't you?

815
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,280
 But I think if you're going as far as getting a Lego wife,

816
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,560
 I think that's probably not an issue.

817
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,520
 - No, it's gonna be like, no, it's not really my scene.

818
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,280
 (laughing)

819
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,600
 - You've put on a lot of bricks since we married.

820
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,560
 (laughing)

821
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,800
 - Have you guys ever heard of the National Fruit Collection?

822
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,640
 - No.

823
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,760
 - I saw this, I was reading about apples, and I just saw it.

824
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,000
 And I've never heard of it, so I don't know anything about it,

825
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,840
 apart from what I saw in this article.

826
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,080
 But apparently it's in Brockdale in Kent,

827
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,680
 and they have a living collection of apples,

828
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,720
 presumably old trees.

829
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,720
 They have 2,300 traditional varieties of apple.

830
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,000
 - Wow.

831
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,840
 - Really?

832
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,200
 - Apparently they get 40,000 visitors a year.

833
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
 - That's so cool.

834
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,040
 So you get a chance to taste all those varieties

835
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,400
 that have gone out of public use.

836
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,240
 - Isn't that the name of said you can eat them?

837
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,800
 - Yeah, I know, I'm not sure if you're allowed to eat them.

838
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,640
 (laughing)

839
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,480
 - I don't know.

840
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,640
 - I'm assuming it's like anything in a museum.

841
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,080
 - The National Fruit Collection was demolishing this scene.

842
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,480
 (laughing)

843
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,800
 - It's not hearing, there's a zoo,

844
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,960
 with the most rare and fun-looking animals in all the world.

845
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,920
 And you can try all of them in our restaurant.

846
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,160
 - You're the reason they don't have the,

847
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,240
 please don't eat the penguins I know.

848
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,400
 (laughing)

849
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
 - Yeah, but isn't that cool?

850
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,240
 Apparently it's been this, it's 1952,

851
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,400
 and I've never heard of it.

852
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,840
 - I really want to go and visit that, that sounds so fun.

853
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,840
 - I found it, I think we should visit actually.

854
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
 - Yeah, let's go.

855
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,680
 - Let's go.

856
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,520
 - Cool.

857
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
 - If you're listening to this and you work

858
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,000
 at the National Fruit Collection,

859
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 why not invite us?

860
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,840
 (laughing)

861
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,680
 - Give us a discount.

862
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,600
 - Do you know what was the company that was a huge boon

863
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,200
 for Apple eating in the world over the last 15 years?

864
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,040
 - Strong boon.

865
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,160
 - Close, but they're major in Apple drinking.

866
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,960
 - Apple eating, is it an Apple Tart company?

867
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,800
 - Like Mr. Kippling.

868
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,080
 - It is not Mr. Kippling.

869
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,560
 The answer is, oh, I think we can get it.

870
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,400
 - I know, I know.

871
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,560
 - So I'll give you some clues.

872
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,400
 - I can lolly company, it was like a flavoring thing.

873
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,680
 - Smoothie makers.

874
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,720
 - I'll give you some clues.

875
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,920
 - I will give you some clues.

876
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,720
 - So, basically, when sliced apples started being a thing,

877
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,600
 consumption suddenly went massively up.

878
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,240
 - Sorry, I missed that memo.

879
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,680
 - That sliced apples are fake.

880
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,920
 - I have one of my lunch box.

881
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,280
 Pretty much every day of school.

882
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,400
 - I'm still stuck on avocado toast.

883
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,160
 (laughing)

884
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,120
 - You know, when you buy Apple in the supermarket,

885
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,920
 some people do, and it's sliced, and it's in a packet.

886
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,000
 - I didn't know of that, no.

887
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,680
 - Have you never seen those in the food section?

888
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,520
 - I have seen that.

889
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,360
 I think it's very weird.

890
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,000
 - I've never met anyone who's done this,

891
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,880
 but you can go to McDonald's and exchange your fries

892
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,080
 for sliced apples or carrots.

893
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,480
 - Oh, those.

894
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,320
 - That's right, why?

895
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,160
 - You can't see that.

896
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,000
 - It's the McDonald's, Emma.

897
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,840
 - There you go.

898
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,320
 (laughing)

899
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,200
 - I can't even, I wasn't told you, I get points.

900
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,040
 There are no points.

901
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,600
 - Well, I'm gonna wear this out, what you just said.

902
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,440
 (laughing)

903
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,400
 - It is McDonald's, so they introduced sliced apples

904
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,840
 in the 1980s into their restaurant fair.

905
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,120
 I think it was the 1980s.

906
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,960
 And overall, Apple consumption tripled within 10 years.

907
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,320
 And it's because children, especially,

908
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,680
 but all of us, we are more willing to eat more of an apple.

909
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,360
 If it's sliced, it's just easier to eat.

910
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,640
 And Apple consumption shoots up.

911
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,240
 And it's also really helped in schools across Britain.

912
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,600
 - People before that were just having

913
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,480
 one bite of an apple and throwing it away, weren't they?

914
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,560
 - But I think it's also, as I'm partly to the,

915
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,480
 just the size of McDonald's as a franchise,

916
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,640
 because when they started giving away free books

917
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,760
 on in Happy Meals one year,

918
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,280
 they became the largest literary producer

919
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
 in the world for a lifetime.

920
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,200
 - Literacy tripled in America.

921
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,120
 (laughing)

922
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,280
 - Yeah, so it's 10% of apples sold in the US

923
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,960
 are of sliced apples sold in the US up from McDonald's.

924
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,800
 - But exactly the same thing happened in the UK

925
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,280
 when they introduced them into schools.

926
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,360
 Then Apple consumption went up by almost 100%.

927
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,840
 - Wow, easy in schools though,

928
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,320
 'cause they can just make you eat stuff.

929
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,160
 - Oh, sorry.

930
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,000
 - But they tried to make you eat full apples

931
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,840
 and it didn't work.

932
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,240
 And then when you get sliced apples.

933
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,440
 - I had an apple this morning.

934
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,280
 - Did you?

935
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,840
 - And I'm amazed at my bravery in getting through it

936
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,400
 without having it sliced for me.

937
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
 (laughing)

938
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,440
 James has an apple peeling machine by his desk.

939
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,320
 - I do, I've never used it.

940
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,360
 I bought it for QI because for the opening show,

941
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,560
 I was gonna put it in there as a weird opening thing

942
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,760
 and then I bought it and everyone went,

943
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,120
 "That's not weird."

944
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,760
 - Everyone has one of those.

945
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,600
 - I think you can have one.

946
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,440
 - What the hell?

947
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,280
 I've never heard of that.

948
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,120
 Does it actually work?

949
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,960
 - It looks like a little torture device.

950
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,000
 It's made of metal and you basically skewer the apple

951
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,600
 and you put it on a skewer and then you turn it

952
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,360
 so it's being like spit roasted, essentially.

953
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,200
 And then there's a kind of little arm that comes down

954
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,040
 with a little knife on it and you sort of turn it

955
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,640
 and it peels it off the, it takes off the peel

956
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,560
 like a little big, big little spiral.

957
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,080
 - It's also for oranges.

958
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,440
 - I only really like an apple on a skewer

959
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,760
 when it's got a suckling pig wrapped around it.

960
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,040
 (laughing)

961
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,720
 - So there is a shaving brush manufacturer

962
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,600
 around at the moment called Penn Halligan's.

963
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,200
 I think they're quite an old,

964
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,760
 an old one with a lot of history.

965
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,200
 On their website, they're asked,

966
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,160
 "Do you use badger hair on your shaving brushes?"

967
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,960
 And they say, "Yes, we do."

968
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,120
 But they take them from parts of the world

969
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,960
 where badgers are not endangered

970
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,320
 and in fact are primarily farmed for their meat.

971
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,600
 - Wow, that's good.

972
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,880
 - And I don't know where that is

973
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,160
 'cause I can't see really many places in the world

974
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,120
 where they farm badgers for meat.

975
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,960
 (laughing)

976
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,320
 But presumably they must do.

977
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,320
 - Well, I was on a forum.

978
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,560
 I think it was a Gillette forum about whether the badger hair

979
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,760
 on brushes was ethically farmed

980
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,560
 and they got theirs from China.

981
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,320
 So I think it was Gillette wrote a really good email

982
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,680
 saying, "You know, we make sure that we source

983
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,000
 only the most ethical badger hair."

984
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 - So do you think they farm badger for meat in China?

985
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,320
 Maybe they do. - Maybe.

986
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,560
 - They used to eat badger in Europe

987
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,800
 and old European recipes for badger would tell you

988
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,520
 to lay it in running water for several days

989
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,000
 to get rid of its rink of flavor.

990
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 - Several days.

991
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,240
 (laughing)

992
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,280
 - You just have to tie it up in the river, I guess.

993
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,120
 - Yeah.

994
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,560
 - But rink flavor is a lot of the most.

995
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
 (laughing)

996
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,080
 Or just eat beef.

997
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,440
 - Well badgers, they don't make a noise though.

998
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,280
 Do they?

999
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,120
 - Do they not?

1000
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,960
 - Well, do they?

1001
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,800
 - They must.

1002
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,560
 - Yeah, depending on what you do to them.

1003
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,840
 (laughing)

1004
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,480
 - Old McDonald had a badger, EIO.

1005
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,560
 - Yes. - With a...

1006
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,040
 - What?

1007
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,880
 - Do they?

1008
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,120
 - I don't know, do they fuff like ferrets do?

1009
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,480
 Like fuff?

1010
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,840
 - Maybe. - I don't like that.

1011
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,880
 I imagine squealing.

1012
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,360
 I reckon they squeal if you run away.

1013
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,880
 (laughing)

1014
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,600
 - That'd be a great quiz, by the way.

1015
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,880
 Just sing the old McDonald's song

1016
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,040
 and put in a new animal and the person has to respond

1017
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,680
 and if they're wrong, they're out of the quiz.

1018
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,520
 - That is good.

1019
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,520
 - How many animals can you get down the line?

1020
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,280
 - Big ships.

1021
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,120
 - Yeah.

1022
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,760
 - The sea-wise giant is pretty much the biggest ship.

1023
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,920
 I think it is the biggest.

1024
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,840
 It's longer than the Empire State Building is tall.

1025
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,160
 - Wow.

1026
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,320
 - It goes at about 16.5 knots, which is about 30 kilometers an hour

1027
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,200
 and it's stopping distance is nine kilometers.

1028
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,360
 - Nine kilometers?

1029
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,200
 - Wow.

1030
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,720
 - If it's going at that speed.

1031
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,560
 And it's turning circle in clear weather is three kilometers.

1032
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,520
 - So that's like, imagine we're standing outside our office

1033
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,880
 facing south and we wanted to face north.

1034
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,200
 We had to go all the way around to around

1035
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,640
 where Madame Tussauds is, before we were facing north.

1036
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,480
 - Wow.

1037
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,280
 We're like quite close to Trafalgar Square, aren't we?

1038
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,720
 - Imagine in an emergency, like in the way you would in a car

1039
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,720
 hitting the brakes on a boat, but nine kilometers away.

1040
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,320
 Because if you did it just one kilometer too late,

1041
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,600
 you'd be like, we're screwed.

1042
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,880
 - We just have to watch ourselves plow into this island.

1043
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,200
 - I have a fact about banning songs and rude songs.

1044
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
 - Okay.

1045
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,040
 - So it's about parental advisory lyrics.

1046
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,280
 You know that sticker that you see on albums?

1047
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,040
 Do you know who those are partly thanks to?

1048
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,880
 You may do.

1049
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,280
 - Can I actually have a genuine guest?

1050
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,760
 - Cypress Hill, or now one of the early people to have it.

1051
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,080
 - Okay, that's not what I've got, although that might be part of the NWA.

1052
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,920
 - Is it a rap group?

1053
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
 - It's Al Gore's wife.

1054
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,920
 (laughing)

1055
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,000
 - I thought you were close.

1056
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,240
 - Is she part of a rap group?

1057
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,720
 - Yeah, she is, yeah.

1058
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,240
 No, she was listening to Prince with her young daughter.

1059
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,960
 And she heard some very explicit lyrics.

1060
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,320
 They were things like, I guess you could say she was a sex fiend.

1061
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,720
 I met her in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine.

1062
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,440
 And she was very angry about this because she was listening

1063
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,480
 with her daughter and she thought it was very inappropriate.

1064
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,000
 So she wrote a book called Raising PG Kids in an X-rated Society.

1065
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,640
 And as part of this drive, she set up the parents music

1066
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
 that was all sent to.

1067
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,480
 And they released the list of artists called The Filthy 15.

1068
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,520
 So this contributed to the rise of the parental advisory.

1069
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,400
 - Filthy 15 is a great name.

1070
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,640
 - Yeah, it's equal to the dirty dozen.

1071
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,120
 (laughing)

1072
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,720
 - But there was an album once that got a parental advisory label

1073
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,240
 in spite of the fact that it was completely instrumental.

1074
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,080
 - Why?

1075
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,640
 - Did it have sex noises?

1076
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,880
 - No, it didn't, no, it was completely instrumental.

1077
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,000
 It's by Frank Zapper, it's a Frank Zapper album.

1078
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,080
 It was called G-Spot tornado.

1079
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,280
 (laughing)

1080
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,440
 - What are the other bits of trivia from the movie Twister?

1081
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,760
 It was because there's a cow which goes through at some point.

1082
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,600
 - Yeah.

1083
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,960
 - That was a sort of early CGI cow.

1084
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,600
 - Supposedly, I haven't backed this up yet though.

1085
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,040
 Supposedly, that cow was originally one of the zebras

1086
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
 from Jumanji.

1087
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,120
 (laughing)

1088
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,120
 - That's quite a career change, is there?

1089
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,280
 I tried to be typecast it as a zebra.

1090
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,520
 (laughing)

1091
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,440
 - I also like that you say I haven't backed this up yet.

1092
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,600
 Like, as soon as we stop this podcast,

1093
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
 you're gonna be out there.

1094
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,000
 - I think this zebra's CV, it says,

1095
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,840
 oh, it says here you can also do cow.

1096
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,080
 (laughing)

1097
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,640
 - You need two zebra's, one in the front

1098
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,040
 and one in the back of the cow.

1099
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,640
 (laughing)

1100
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,480
 Yeah, no, you're right.

1101
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,320
 After every podcast and I go through verifying everything.

1102
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,160
 (laughing)

1103
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,800
 - What did they, what do you mean by that?

1104
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,000
 Did they paint the stripes off the zebra

1105
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,600
 or did they paint stripes onto a zebra for Jumanji?

1106
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,520
 - I think maybe, 'cause Jumanji came out first,

1107
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,480
 maybe they had the design of a zebra going round

1108
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
 in a tornado.

1109
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,560
 - Yeah, and so they just use that footage,

1110
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,760
 not the footage, but you don't, I mean,

1111
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,680
 that little computer generator thing to be the cow.

1112
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,880
 I don't, as I say, have them backed it up yet.

1113
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,360
 Gonna do it as soon as the podcast ends.

1114
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,120
 - So my friend, Dan, who works in CGI,

1115
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,120
 told me he, a fact, he learned to London film school.

1116
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,320
 And again, I haven't been able to back this up.

1117
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,560
 So possibly if someone CGI is listening,

1118
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,160
 - If you guys have thought of your research

1119
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,280
 before the podcast, I'm pretty sure that would be ideal.

1120
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,840
 - No, but this is, it's one of those things

1121
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,160
 where it's been said, but don't know where the proof is.

1122
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,160
 Any time CGI's been used, I don't know if it's now,

1123
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,400
 but let's say movies of the last 10 years,

1124
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,240
 roughly the last, maybe five years predominantly,

1125
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,440
 CGI has been using, if they have a person in it,

1126
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,160
 they've been using Brad Pitt.

1127
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,520
 Because when Benjamin Button was made,

1128
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,600
 they made a full DNA, as it were,

1129
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,840
 CGI of Brad Pitt, the full motion of him.

1130
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,520
 And rather than needing to replicate that,

1131
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,440
 you just use that.

1132
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,120
 So the company that built that sells Brad Pitt

1133
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,440
 to all these different movies that need a body.

1134
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,280
 - That's cool, CGI.

1135
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,560
 - You can use all the different ages of man as well.

1136
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,400
 - Exactly.

1137
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,800
 So theoretically, in World War Z, the zombie film,

1138
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,480
 would all the zombies that they used

1139
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,800
 have also been Brad Pitt.

1140
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,640
 - Wow.

1141
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,240
 - I hope they paid him well for that.

1142
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,240
 (all laughing)

1143
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,080
 - I bet they did.

1144
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,320
 (all laughing)

1145
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,520
 - What if someone really overweight or something?

1146
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,920
 Was there a bit in Benjamin Buttonway,

1147
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,760
 put on lots of weight?

1148
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,600
 - Two Brad Pitt's.

1149
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,120
 - One of the proofs, what in the back?

1150
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,720
 (all laughing)

1151
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,320
 Have you seen the new thing that Ikea is doing

1152
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,200
 where they're using augmented reality?

1153
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,400
 This is pretty cool.

1154
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,400
 So if you wanna get, let's say you wanna get a sofa

1155
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,720
 and you wanna have it in your front room,

1156
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,240
 but you wanna know what it looks like,

1157
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,040
 they've got a new app where you can take a photo of your room,

1158
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,080
 and then you can kind of augment a sofa

1159
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,640
 in the place where it would be.

1160
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,360
 So you can see what the room would look like

1161
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,200
 with that sofa.

1162
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,040
 - That is so cool.

1163
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,880
 - That's amazing.

1164
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,720
 - Clever, isn't it?

1165
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,960
 - 'Cause they already had, they had like,

1166
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,040
 a build your own kitchen in your website.

1167
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,400
 It was like a budget version of the Sims

1168
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,680
 but without the people in it, which had hours of fun.

1169
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,680
 - We did that for our new house, it was amazing.

1170
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,520
 - Yeah, yeah.

1171
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,360
 - We didn't go with them at the end.

1172
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,400
 - But we've got pictures of what it might've looked like.

1173
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,520
 - This thing, you've got a happy ending

1174
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,600
 if you think it's public kitchen,

1175
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,200
 whereas I'm just like, well, I can't do this.

1176
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,520
 (all laughing)

1177
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,280
 - Don't ask the owner anywhere for the kitchen to see.

1178
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,120
 - Ah, but there is a video game as well.

1179
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,800
 You'll love this then.

1180
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,400
 It's basically a, it simulates you building Ikea furniture

1181
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,840
 but on a computer and there's no end to it.

1182
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,120
 You know, you don't win.

1183
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,800
 - No, you just, you don't even end up with the furniture.

1184
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,400
 - No, yeah, and the idea is that it basically simulates

1185
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,080
 the frustration of what it's like to build Ikea furniture

1186
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,640
 and you can do it with up to four friends.

1187
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,440
 It's a game called Home Improvisation.

1188
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,840
 So Home Improvisation.

1189
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,000
 (all laughing)

1190
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,960
 - Thanks for the translation, dad.

1191
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,120
 - What language are you from?

1192
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,360
 - I googled that, turns out it translates as Home Improvisation.

1193
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,160
 And it lets you, yeah, basically through virtual reality,

1194
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,520
 exactly what you're doing, Alex.

1195
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,360
 So if you want to build stuff outside of kitchens,

1196
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,200
 that's there for you.

1197
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,960
 - That's fine.

1198
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,000
 - There is a thing that's happening at the moment.

1199
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,280
 People keep having sleepovers in Ikea shops and Ikea.

1200
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,800
 I'm not relaxed about it.

1201
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,440
 They are really annoying.

1202
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,280
 - Well, surely they could just stop people

1203
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,640
 like as in kick them out.

1204
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,920
 - Well, people go in and they hide in cupboards at the end.

1205
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,320
 - So they can't go through at the end of every working day

1206
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,480
 checking every cupboard in the shop.

1207
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,680
 - There's an old status and there's something like,

1208
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,640
 it might be 1% as well of people in Europe

1209
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,360
 were conceived in an Ikea bed.

1210
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,440
 - So you're one in ten.

1211
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,680
 - One in ten is it, wow.

1212
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,480
 And were they all in the shop?

1213
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,600
 (laughing)

1214
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,720
 - Somebody filmed the soap opera set entirely in Ikea

1215
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,160
 and they did it without Ikea's knowledge

1216
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,280
 and yeah, it was a web series.

1217
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,120
 Yeah.

1218
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,960
 - That's amazing.

1219
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,120
 - That's awesome.

1220
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,400
 So they were in the physical shop

1221
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,640
 that they just never staffed, never called onto.

1222
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,240
 They were always filming with sort of handheld cameras

1223
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,560
 and things and presumably they must have got asked

1224
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,400
 to leave a few times,

1225
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,240
 but isn't they filmed in an entire web series?

1226
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,640
 And you know, it was just they were just like living

1227
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,480
 in the holes and so on.

1228
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,920
 - Oh, 'cause yeah, 'cause if it's a kitchen set,

1229
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,240
 yeah, they're like doing a set.

1230
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,800
 - I think the only other thing is that in every scene

1231
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,520
 you've got random people walking around your house

1232
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,320
 and just like, you're picking up your kids

1233
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,960
 and you're tensed up and taking them away.

1234
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,840
 - So the whole concept of the sitcom

1235
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,920
 has to be about a place where you live

1236
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,080
 where there's a lot of burglars.

1237
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,920
 - Yeah.

1238
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,560
 (laughing)

1239
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,720
 - Do you know if we ever said that when Nelson died

1240
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,720
 and he famously had a hardy next to him

1241
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,120
 and cradling him and his arms

1242
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,480
 and the person who wrote the account

1243
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,920
 who was there at the time said that,

1244
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,800
 Nelson said kiss me hardy and then hardy kissed him.

1245
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,960
 And then we ever mentioned that for about 80 years

1246
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,560
 during the Victorian era, that story was changed

1247
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,760
 so that he said kiss me hardy

1248
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,160
 because they were too squeamish

1249
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,800
 about the idea of two men kissing each other

1250
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,320
 and kiss me was a Turkish for fate.

1251
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,160
 And so they said that he'd said kiss me hardy.

1252
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,440
 And this guy must have misheard it.

1253
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,840
 No one would have said kiss me hardy.

1254
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,800
 - Why do you say kiss me hardy?

1255
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,640
 Isn't that?

1256
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,440
 (laughing)

1257
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,120
 'Cause he wasn't a fake pirate.

1258
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,280
 - Right.

1259
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,680
 - It's a missed opportunity, I think.

1260
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,320
 - I bet hardy got a load of those jokes

1261
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,480
 all the way through his name.

1262
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,320
 - Yeah.

1263
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:28,400
 - But if the story was that Nelson said kiss me hardy,

1264
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,960
 how do they explain away the bit where hardy

1265
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,800
 then kisses me?

1266
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,360
 (laughing)

1267
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,080
 Do they say, oh Nelson said, oh get off me you weirdo.

1268
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,880
 (laughing)

1269
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,840
 - Can I throw in one Nixon fact before we move on?

1270
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,840
 Can anyone tell me what Richard Nixon's middle name

1271
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,680
 is Mill House?

1272
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,600
 - Yeah, it's a Mill House.

1273
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,440
 - Yeah, so it is Mill House.

1274
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,440
 However, I'm gonna put forward the reviewed fact

1275
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,320
 that it's in fact a double barrel surname.

1276
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,160
 - Okay.

1277
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,520
 - Because it is his mother's maiden name.

1278
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,440
 Mill House was his mum.

1279
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,280
 - Okay.

1280
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,600
 - So he took that on and I would say that that's not a--

1281
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,480
 - That's quite, so my brother has the same thing

1282
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,680
 with my mother's maiden name.

1283
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,600
 That's quite common.

1284
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,320
 And I would say that's not double barrelled

1285
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,640
 because it's not the mother's name anymore, is it?

1286
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,720
 - Well, it can still be her name.

1287
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,640
 She might, yeah.

1288
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,120
 - What's her name still Mill House?

1289
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,360
 - I don't know, but it's taken

1290
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,760
 because it's his mother's maiden name.

1291
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,600
 - Interesting.

1292
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,640
 - Yeah, I just, I didn't know that connection in any case.

1293
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,600
 - It's a huge, huge news if true though,

1294
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,800
 that Richard Nixon's middle name isn't Mill House.

1295
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,600
 It might just be a part of it, sir.

1296
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,400
 - Yeah, well that's what I'm trying to put forward here, yeah.

1297
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,800
 - It is a relatively common thing.

1298
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,200
 I think especially in Scotland, they do that a lot, don't they?

1299
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,320
 - They use mothers maiden name for middle names.

1300
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,160
 - I don't.

1301
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
 - If that is took correct,

1302
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,880
 then there will presumably a lot of times

1303
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,200
 his name has been carved into stone,

1304
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,040
 but they're gonna have to go back

1305
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,440
 and do a really botched squeeze

1306
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,320
 of the word Mill House into it.

1307
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,440
 I don't know how many times his name's been written in stone.

1308
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,680
 (laughing)

1309
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,680
 - Yeah, that's true.

1310
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,320
 - I mean, he's not, I don't think he's one

1311
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,760
 of Mount Rushmar, is he Nixon?

1312
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,000
 (laughing)

1313
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,160
 - No, no.

1314
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,000
 - But it should be a shit rush more with Andrew Jackson

1315
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,080
 and Nixon and you know--

1316
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,920
 - Calvin Coolidge.

1317
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,520
 - Calvin Coolidge, Trump, yeah.

1318
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,720
 - That's just another thing about his name.

1319
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,640
 He was named after a British king.

1320
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,040
 So there's a thought that his family tree actually goes back

1321
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,200
 and he descends from King Edward III of England.

1322
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,160
 That's a sort of an idea that was put out there.

1323
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,040
 But he's named after Richard the Lionheart

1324
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,760
 and he is one of four brothers

1325
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,040
 and all of them also carry English king names.

1326
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,880
 - Really?

1327
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,720
 - Yeah. - What do you have the names?

1328
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,560
 - Well, there are only about three other names.

1329
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,400
 - Sorry, sorry, three of them carried it

1330
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,280
 and then there was Francis who was name of his dad,

1331
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,360
 who carried his dad's name.

1332
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,880
 - Isn't rich the Lionheart far back enough

1333
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,600
 that everyone is directly descended from him?

1334
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,960
 I think he is.

1335
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,280
 I think Edward III is.

1336
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,160
 So everyone on earth is directly descended.

1337
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,000
 - What?

1338
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,800
 - 'Cause everyone in Britain,

1339
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,960
 everyone pretty much everyone in Western Europe's.

1340
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,880
 - But everyone in America as well, 'cause--

1341
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,680
 - But Danny Dyer did who do you think you are

1342
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,320
 and they found that he is related to Edward III

1343
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,160
 and it's this huge story.

1344
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,000
 And actually, the odds of him not being related,

1345
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,480
 it would have been an amazing new story

1346
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,760
 if he had not been related to Edward III.

1347
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,480
 - I don't think that's gonna sell many papers, is it?

1348
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,520
 - Danny Dyer, they're not related to it.

1349
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,200
 - By the odds, the odds are that 99% of everyone

1350
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,200
 is related to Edward III.

1351
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,960
 It's suddenly a very interesting story.

1352
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,960
 - I see that, but then people don't usually go

1353
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,320
 much past their headlines, are they?

1354
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,680
 - And if their headline is Danny Dyer,

1355
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,280
 isn't related to Edward III.

1356
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,960
 But that's an interesting story

1357
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,920
 because the odds of 99% that he would be.

1358
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,080
 I'm my newspaper, it's gonna have very long headlines

1359
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,120
 that are really short articles.

1360
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,600
 - Country music has the most intelligent lyrics, apparently,

1361
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,840
 because one of the measures,

1362
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,200
 which sounds like not a great measure,

1363
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,040
 is the number of syllables in words.

1364
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,280
 And it doesn't have filler words,

1365
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,640
 so you don't get a lot of, oh yeah, yeah, oh,

1366
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,080
 you know, that kind of stuff you get.

1367
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:46,920
 - I see what you mean.

1368
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,920
 - But if you say that the most advanced songs,

1369
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,200
 are the ones with more syllables,

1370
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,560
 then the most advanced song in history

1371
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,080
 is Supercalifragilistique Spialidosius.

1372
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,640
 - Yeah, it takes years of study to understand that.

1373
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
 (laughing)

1374
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,360
 The study example the study used was,

1375
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,200
 country music uses more syllables,

1376
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,440
 using words such as cigarettes,

1377
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,360
 tackle box and hillbilly.

1378
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,840
 - tackle box.

1379
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,840
 (laughing)

1380
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,960
 - Apparently.

1381
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,480
 So that's too advanced for an eight-year-old, obviously.

1382
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,360
 - Yeah, fair enough.

1383
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,200
 - Also on Too Big To Fit,

1384
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,200
 I googled Too Big To Fit and Dwayne, The Rock Johnson,

1385
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,040
 is Too Big To Fit in a lot of the cars

1386
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,960
 in the latest Fast and the Furious.

1387
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,800
 - Wow.

1388
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,440
 - So there is an interview with him

1389
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,880
 and they're asking him why you always in trucks

1390
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,000
 not in the little cars,

1391
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,840
 and he's like, "I'm too big to fit in there."

1392
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,160
 - Oh my God.

1393
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,000
 - Wow.

1394
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,200
 - That makes sense, yeah.

1395
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,080
 - You should drill a hole in the ceiling or something.

1396
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,880
 Is he too tall or too?

1397
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,280
 - He's very muscular.

1398
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,200
 - He's muscular, yeah.

1399
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,560
 - But that is extraordinary.

1400
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,400
 - He's good that, isn't it?

1401
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,360
 - Could they have an adapted one

1402
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,920
 where he's just got one seat in the middle,

1403
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,560
 so there's not a two-seater?

1404
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,760
 - I guess they could, although they'd have to write that

1405
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,520
 into the story line of the film.

1406
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,360
 - Yeah.

1407
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,600
 - What story line there is in the film?

1408
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,600
 (laughing)

1409
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,240
 If you wanna collect semen from Macax, it's quite hard.

1410
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,080
 - Macax.

1411
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,280
 - Macax, little primates, little monkey things.

1412
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,120
 - Oh yeah.

1413
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,200
 - What they used to do is they would stimulate

1414
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,480
 their genitals with electricity.

1415
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,600
 Sometimes a little weak jolt,

1416
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,920
 but it would make them ejaculate.

1417
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,400
 But one researcher realized that actually

1418
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,840
 they were ejaculating quite a lot anyway,

1419
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,760
 because they do it like four times an hour

1420
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,600
 or something like that.

1421
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,600
 - Wow.

1422
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,920
 - Yeah, they average four times an hour ejaculating

1423
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,960
 when they're just having fun and just on their own.

1424
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,840
 - Watch all the time.

1425
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,760
 - Not for the rest of the time.

1426
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,760
 - Not for the rest of the time.

1427
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,520
 - But whether it's sleep now, it just keeps going.

1428
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,920
 (laughing)

1429
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,760
 But do they ejaculate 40 times a day?

1430
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,600
 You know?

1431
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,600
 - Yeah, I think they do.

1432
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,160
 - I'm seeing on, so what I'm seeing here

1433
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,440
 on this bit of paper is on the island,

1434
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,240
 the male's masturbate on average four times an hour.

1435
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,080
 So that's on average four times an hour.

1436
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,680
 They could have some better hours than that.

1437
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,160
 - In a good hour.

1438
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,400
 - And so what she realized this researcher is what she could do

1439
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,840
 is just kind of hang around,

1440
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,240
 'cause it happens so frequently.

1441
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,320
 And then when it happens, just quickly get in there

1442
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,080
 with the pipette and suck it up.

1443
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,600
 And she does that.

1444
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,520
 The main problem being that they often lick the ground

1445
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,600
 or their hands clean before she can get close

1446
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,120
 because semen happens to be highly nutritious

1447
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,280
 and they don't want to waste the nutrients.

1448
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,920
 - Devious, devious mechanics.

1449
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,200
 - Yeah, they all randy though, they're randy.

1450
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,560
 Um, you can have so many more times an hour.

1451
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,080
 - Yeah, they'd like to masturbate.

1452
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,760
 - Look, we all like to masturbate,

1453
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,000
 but they should get a job.

1454
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,880
 (laughing)

1455
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,160
 - You know when crocodiles die,

1456
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,440
 they bloat and float.

1457
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,320
 They're bloaters and floaters.

1458
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,040
 Because of all these gasses being released,

1459
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,200
 they keep them afloat.

1460
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,280
 And they float for over a month without thinking.

1461
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,120
 - Wow.

1462
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,840
 - So I don't understand why we don't see crocodiles

1463
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,080
 floating down.

1464
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:57,920
 - Well, we must do.

1465
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,760
 - We must do.

1466
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,360
 - Maybe we do in countries with crocodiles.

1467
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,400
 - Just think they're lugs.

1468
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,240
 - Yeah.

1469
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,600
 - Or crocodiles because they're very stealth, aren't they?

1470
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,440
 - That's true.

1471
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,280
 - They're very stealthy.

1472
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,120
 - They don't do much movement.

1473
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,880
 So if you saw one going like that,

1474
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,560
 you'd think, oh, he's on a cheeky mission.

1475
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,200
 - Cockroaches go on the back, don't they?

1476
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,240
 When they die, famously.

1477
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,080
 - Oh, yes.

1478
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:15,920
 - Yeah.

1479
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,360
 - The reason being that they have long legs for an insect

1480
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,040
 and they have a high sensor of gravity.

1481
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,040
 The sensor of gravity is quite near that bone kind of thing.

1482
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,600
 And as they get older,

1483
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:31,040
 they kind of start to get weighed down to their bump side.

1484
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,520
 And then when they kind of eventually die,

1485
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,600
 they flip over and they don't have enough energy

1486
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,440
 in their arms.

1487
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,160
 They don't have enough strength in their legs

1488
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,000
 to put them back over.

1489
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,720
 And the same thing happens if you give them kind of pesticides,

1490
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,600
 they spasm and they'll flip over

1491
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,200
 and then they won't have the energy left

1492
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,280
 in their legs to flip them back.

1493
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,560
 - So they're flipping over their head.

1494
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,320
 They're not rolling over sideways.

1495
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,360
 - They're flipping over vertically

1496
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,720
 because their bones weigh down.

1497
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,240
 - Exactly, they do that flip.

1498
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,200
 - Well, I don't know if it's exactly like that.

1499
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,480
 It could be a slightly sideways, slightly back flippy thing.

1500
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,880
 I don't know about that.

1501
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,480
 But basically, you're walking around with a heavy bump

1502
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,080
 and as you get older, you're less able to deal with it.

1503
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,560
 - We know it feels.

1504
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:19,920
 - Tortuses have that same problem.

1505
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,760
 - Do they?

1506
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,760
 - Obviously, they've got round shells.

1507
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,360
 But they have this really weird balancing act

1508
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,400
 that they need to strike

1509
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,440
 because bigger animals obviously do better

1510
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,760
 because they're stronger and they can fight other males

1511
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,160
 and they can compete more.

1512
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,800
 But also, if they get too big,

1513
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,640
 a bigger shell means that it's hard to write yourself again.

1514
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,360
 So you have all the advantages of being big,

1515
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,720
 but if you lose one fight

1516
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,200
 and you then get rolled over onto your back,

1517
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,440
 it's much likely that you won't be able to

1518
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,440
 write yourself again.

1519
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,520
 - Oh, yeah.

1520
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,360
 - It's a trade-off.

1521
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,840
 - It's basically putting all your eggs in one basket.

1522
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,000
 It'll be really big.

1523
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,840
 There's a really interesting thing about tortoises

1524
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,640
 which we covered on QI years and years ago.

1525
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,880
 And that is that it's possible to invent a shape

1526
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,200
 that you put it on a table

1527
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,280
 and it always flips over to a certain side.

1528
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,520
 - I just chewed to the shape of the thing.

1529
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,760
 It's felt like a gumbok,

1530
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,080
 but I think it's pronounced more like gumbots.

1531
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,000
 Anyway, so this shape has been invented by computer scientists

1532
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,640
 and it took us decades to do it

1533
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,240
 and they managed to do it through using computers.

1534
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,520
 But tortoises, some tortoises have this exact same shape.

1535
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,840
 And so if they flip over,

1536
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,000
 they naturally kind of roll back onto their feet.

1537
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,840
 - Oh wow.

1538
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,680
 - That's so cool.

1539
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,520
 - That's awesome.

1540
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,680
 Was the inventor of the gumbok inspired by totals

1541
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,040
 or with tortoises, or is that?

1542
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,400
 - I believe he was.

1543
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,480
 I've met him and I can't remember.

1544
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,800
 - Oh, was it vice versa?

1545
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,280
 You're going to watch the turtles?

1546
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,080
 We went to one of his shows and thought, guys,

1547
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,320
 we should try that.

1548
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,840
 - Yeah, I was so proud of myself

1549
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,960
 for not finishing the set so you can clearly do

1550
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,040
 where I was going with that.

1551
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,800
 I was like, no, 'cause James started talking.

1552
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,880
 I thought, ah, that looks like a clever question now.

1553
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,240
 - I wasn't gonna let him save you.

1554
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,160
 - Diamonds are the hardest substance in the world.

1555
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,960
 I read a, whoop, they're not James.

1556
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,960
 - James is in diesel.

1557
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:07,800
 - In diesel.

1558
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,280
 - They're not, what is that?

1559
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,640
 - They're the hardest naturally occurrence.

1560
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,960
 - Sorry, that's what I meant to say.

1561
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,120
 Yes, the hardest naturally occurrence substance.

1562
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,560
 You can't scratch a diamond,

1563
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,560
 except with another diamond you can.

1564
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,400
 - Yeah.

1565
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,000
 - So you can scratch a diamond with a diamond.

1566
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,840
 - That's what it means.

1567
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,600
 - That's what hardness means in this sense.

1568
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,120
 It means that you can scratch something with something.

1569
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,000
 - So hardness is whether something can be scratched

1570
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,720
 and toughness is whether it shatters into a thousand pieces

1571
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,880
 if you hit it with something.

1572
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,640
 So diamonds, because the layers of carbon are very tough,

1573
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,600
 you know, internally, but do you hit it with a hammer?

1574
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,600
 Bang, smash it.

1575
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,760
 - Right.

1576
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,600
 - So don't try that.

1577
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,440
 - Don't do that.

1578
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,280
 - Yeah.

1579
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,000
 - And that's, I think we may have said this before,

1580
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,720
 that's what traders used to do.

1581
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,760
 If someone had mined a diamond,

1582
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,200
 there was someone's group, there's people who'd say,

1583
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,200
 well, okay, let's have a look.

1584
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,400
 And we'll just give it a quick test to see

1585
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,840
 if it's a real diamond.

1586
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,520
 I'll just hit it with this hammer, bang, smash it.

1587
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,720
 And then he says, I'm so sorry,

1588
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,880
 it wasn't a real diamond after all.

1589
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,720
 It was something else.

1590
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,800
 - But I'll keep the shards.

1591
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,480
 - I'll keep the shards and I'll pay you a nominal sum

1592
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,320
 for them.

1593
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,800
 I'll pay you a tiny bit to keep yourself going, you know?

1594
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,080
 And then they'd just sell off a load of smaller diamonds.

1595
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,920
 - A very clever.

1596
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,240
 - Very clever, yeah.

1597
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,520
 - Or you could groom back together

1598
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,040
 and make a bigger diamond again.

1599
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,880
 - Oh god.

1600
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,720
 - I think that's where the imperfections come in.

1601
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,080
 - Come on down to Hannah's shitty diamond store.

1602
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,160
 (all laughing)

1603
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,760
 We got loads of rubbish diamonds full of glue.

1604
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,760
 (all laughing)

1605
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,600
 - I've got some stuff on quarantine.

1606
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,440
 - Oh, right.

1607
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,280
 - Yeah.

1608
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,520
 Comes from the Italian for 40.

1609
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,720
 Quarantee, which...

1610
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,400
 - Because you used to have to stay 40 days in quarantine.

1611
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,800
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

1612
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,320
 - Incubation period of the Black Death

1613
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,160
 supposedly.

1614
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,000
 - Oh, okay.

1615
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 - They put astronauts in quarantine.

1616
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,840
 - That's right.

1617
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,480
 - When they come back down.

1618
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,520
 Do you know why?

1619
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:55,000
 - Yeah, because of radiation and in case in space

1620
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,840
 they were given some sort of flu disease.

1621
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,480
 It was to do with diseases, wasn't it?

1622
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,000
 - Well, it is a little bit.

1623
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,120
 - Aliens with smallpox.

1624
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,760
 - Yeah, so you might think if you were a sci-fi fan

1625
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,880
 that it was to stop alien diseases coming to Earth.

1626
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,800
 But it's actually because their immune system

1627
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,880
 is lessened due to them being in space.

1628
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,600
 So when they come back down, they need to go in quarantine

1629
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,080
 so they don't pick up bugs on Earth.

1630
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,080
 - Is that so amazing?

1631
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,960
 - Technically that you're putting the entire rest

1632
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,360
 of the world in quarantine.

1633
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,200
 - Yeah.

1634
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,040
 - Yes.

1635
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,560
 - That's just true of all quarantine.

1636
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,440
 Just flip around the exit mentions.

1637
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,280
 - That's fine.

1638
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,760
 (laughing)

1639
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,560
 - Yeah, I suppose that is true.

1640
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,680
 - There was, you know, just picking up on that quickly.

1641
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,920
 When the Apollo 11 astronauts came down,

1642
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,920
 they had to do that.

1643
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,920
 They had to be in quarantine in this room

1644
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,680
 where they had a sort of kitchen in there

1645
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,080
 and living quarters and so on.

1646
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,080
 They had to stay in there for ages

1647
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,480
 before they could do any of their parades around the world.

1648
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,320
 - Wow.

1649
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:50,440
 - And what ended up happening was if a scientist accidentally

1650
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,520
 kind of was infected as it were with the room

1651
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,560
 that they were kept in because they were delivering stuff

1652
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,920
 and so on, I guess, in suits.

1653
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,360
 - And then it was for possible space cooties, wasn't it?

1654
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,360
 - Yes, yes.

1655
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,600
 Those scientists then had to move in with them.

1656
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,640
 So there was a whole batch of people

1657
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,960
 that subtly got, or might have been infected.

1658
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,640
 So therefore needed to be quarantined.

1659
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,520
 - It's people came along to give them some food

1660
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,360
 and they got infected.

1661
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,200
 - Exactly.

1662
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,040
 - It's like a horror film.

1663
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,360
 It's like, oh, where's Sarah?

1664
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,520
 I better go and find out.

1665
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,360
 Oh no, what's Bernard gone now?

1666
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,520
 - It's a bit like a game of sardines.

1667
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,120
 - It is, it is, exactly.

1668
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,320
 And there was a suggestion, and I'm not saying this is true,

1669
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,480
 but there was a suggestion that some of the people

1670
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,840
 who accidentally had to go into the quarantine

1671
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,120
 looked like ladies of the night,

1672
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,640
 who made their way into there and had to live out.

1673
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,480
 - I don't even know what the implication you're making is.

1674
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,320
 - Prostitutes.

1675
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,680
 - Was it postitutes?

1676
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,920
 - No, 'cause it's back on Earth now.

1677
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,080
 (laughing)

1678
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,160
 - And also, space prostitutes don't exist.

1679
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,480
 - Oh yeah, it's like, yeah.

1680
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,920
 - But it was another time, wasn't it, the '60s?

1681
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,920
 - Yeah.

1682
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,560
 - I mean, it literally was, yes, to you know.

1683
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,280
 (laughing)

1684
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,160
 - I looked at some skillful number people,

1685
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,280
 and I was looking at like the world record

1686
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,680
 for memorizing numbers and stuff like that.

1687
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,680
 - Okay.

1688
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,080
 - And the world record for most digits memorized

1689
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,040
 in one minute has two different sections,

1690
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,840
 one with the light on and one with the light off.

1691
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,400
 'Cause apparently, it's miles easier when the lights off.

1692
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,000
 - That makes sense, 'cause there's no distractions.

1693
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,120
 - I guess so, right?

1694
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,480
 But you can close your eyes.

1695
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,640
 - How do you see the number to memorize?

1696
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,640
 (laughing)

1697
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,280
 - Maybe that's another reason.

1698
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,200
 But yeah, maybe you're allowed a little torch

1699
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,360
 or something, I don't know.

1700
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,200
 - All right.

1701
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,120
 - But perhaps I'll give you an audio recording of it.

1702
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,320
 - Maybe, I don't know.

1703
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,360
 So this is for binary digits, so it's zeros and ones.

1704
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,680
 - Okay, the one, the specific one I'm looking at.

1705
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,520
 And the record for most zeros and ones memorized

1706
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:46,520
 in one minute with the light on is 107.

1707
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:50,040
 With the light off, it's 273.

1708
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,360
 - Oh, wow.

1709
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,200
 - Isn't that amazing?

1710
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,200
 That makes that much difference.

1711
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,160
 - That's incredible.

1712
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,720
 - So all mass exams should be held in the dark, shouldn't they?

1713
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,680
 - I guess so, if they were all in binary.

1714
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,760
 (laughing)

1715
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,960
 - Mine, mine are worse.

1716
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,960
 (laughing)

1717
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,680
 - Did you just quickly one thing on chocolate?

1718
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,880
 I think it's quite funny.

1719
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,640
 Bernie Madoff, remember him, is now running a chocolate racket

1720
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,000
 in prison.

1721
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,480
 So... - Who's he again, sorry?

1722
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,240
 - You know, he's the guy who...

1723
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,640
 - He ran a massive Ponzi screen, didn't he?

1724
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,480
 - Ponzi screen.

1725
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,480
 (laughing)

1726
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,840
 Yeah, so he was a business man who it turned out

1727
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,440
 was stealing lots of people's investments.

1728
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,000
 So he got millions and millions of pounds

1729
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,600
 and stole lots of money.

1730
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,160
 And he's running this chocolate racket.

1731
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,480
 And in prison in America now, he's really respected

1732
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,720
 'cause he stole a more money than anyone else in there.

1733
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,040
 So he wrote this letter to his daughter

1734
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,200
 saying he's quite the celebrity in there.

1735
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,160
 Other inmates treat him like a mafia don

1736
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,800
 and call him Uncle Bernie.

1737
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,480
 I can't walk anywhere without people shouting their greetings

1738
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,560
 and encouragement.

1739
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,800
 It's really quite sweet.

1740
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,120
 And he's brought up all the chocolate in the prison.

1741
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,640
 And now he runs this racket

1742
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,200
 where the only person you can get it from is him.

1743
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,240
 And so he makes a big profit.

1744
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,080
 - How's it work?

1745
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,320
 'Cause it sounds like that should be illegal, right?

1746
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,160
 - Hi.

1747
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,400
 - It's unusual to have people committing

1748
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,800
 a very similar crime in prison

1749
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,960
 to the one they were put in there.

1750
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,800
 - Yeah.

1751
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,280
 - And then to announce it, I mean,

1752
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,200
 do prison guards not read news or?

1753
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,120
 - But that's not illegal.

1754
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,120
 - It's not illegal.

1755
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,200
 - No, what, just to buy up to get in there first

1756
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,720
 and buy up all the stuff so you can sell it

1757
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,040
 on for a profit, that's okay.

1758
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,200
 - It's immoral.

1759
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,040
 - Right.

1760
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,640
 - It's a bit of a monopoly, but I don't think there's

1761
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,520
 like anti-monopoly rules in prisons.

1762
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,920
 - It's touting.

1763
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,400
 - It is touting, yeah.

1764
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,240
 - Okay.

1765
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,080
 - Well, good luck to him.

1766
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,800
 I think that's what you're saying.

1767
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,520
 - Couldn't have happened to a nice guy.

1768
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,040
 - God, I'd love to know where the boxes are

1769
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,160
 from, Dealer, no deal.

1770
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,360
 (laughing)

1771
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,120
 - Your notice, I said nothing in that whole bit

1772
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,160
 'cause I was busy thinking,

1773
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,440
 "Gaddy, yeah, did they wear no diamonds

1774
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,360
 "just got them in his house?"

1775
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,200
 - Yeah.

1776
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,960
 He probably, I reckon he uses them to wrap Christmas presents.

1777
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,880
 - That would be such a good idea if he doesn't

1778
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,720
 and he's listening.

1779
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,720
 - But that's a great Christmas present.

1780
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,720
 So you unwrap it.

1781
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,400
 There's a box, you open the boxes, nothing inside.

1782
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,440
 And you're like, oh, this is terrible.

1783
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,040
 And he says, actually, it's one of the boxes

1784
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:54,960
 from Dealer, no deal.

1785
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,360
 And you're like, that's the best present ever,

1786
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,440
 no-leadment and Christmas is saved.

1787
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,280
 - Hmm, yeah.

1788
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,320
 - I would be still unhappy with Dealer, no deal.

1789
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,240
 - Box is my Christmas present, just the two of you

1790
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,080
 who's thinking about it.

1791
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,560
 - If it was a real one that was used on the show.

1792
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,320
 - I really intentionally did not want that as a present.

1793
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,160
 - Great.

1794
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,000
 (laughing)

1795
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,200
 I'm sure someone else will have it.

1796
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,680
 - Yeah, I bought it now.

1797
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,040
 - Sorry, no, we thought she'd love it.

1798
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,480
 - Or he might use it for storage.

1799
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,320
 - Yeah.

1800
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,560
 - Or if he goes shopping, putting his shopping in the boxes.

1801
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,200
 - Yeah, he just goes everywhere.

1802
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,640
 If you look at every phone of him these days,

1803
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,000
 he's actually got a box with him.

1804
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,600
 - If he gets fired, once he got fired from a job,

1805
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,440
 do you think he'd clear this desk in those boxes?

1806
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,320
 - Yeah, when he got cats or, yeah.

1807
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,360
 - Yeah, how do you move in there?

1808
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,800
 Has he put handles on them or wheels?

1809
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,560
 - Yeah, 'cause they don't have handles today.

1810
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,280
 - No, very easy to carry.

1811
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,240
 - How many items of check-in luggage really have today?

1812
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,640
 So I've got 15.

1813
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,240
 (laughing)

1814
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,760
 - I read a thing.

1815
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,200
 There's a basketball player called Jimmy Butler.

1816
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,640
 He plays for the Chicago Bulls.

1817
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,880
 I think he's just been traded, but I'm not sure to wear.

1818
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,000
 But he, I read it article, this is the, in the headline,

1819
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,920
 it says that Jimmy Butler took out his car rear-view mirror

1820
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,240
 as a reminder to never look back.

1821
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,400
 (laughing)

1822
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,840
 - That was awesome.

1823
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,480
 - It was promptly arrested.

1824
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,440
 (laughing)

1825
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,160
 - Have you heard of the North American Walnut Sphinx caterpillar?

1826
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,560
 - No, that's a goody.

1827
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,640
 (laughing)

1828
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,520
 It pretends to be a bird to freak birds out.

1829
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,240
 - A bird's freak's out to other birds.

1830
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,080
 - Yeah.

1831
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,480
 (laughing)

1832
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,400
 - That's one thing they most used to.

1833
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,240
 (laughing)

1834
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,520
 They used to hang it around with birds.

1835
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,720
 - Sorry, I should clarify.

1836
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,000
 - They make a noise like a freaked out bird.

1837
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
 - Oh, no.

1838
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,200
 - I'll just scare the other incoming birds away.

1839
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,120
 - Exactly, so what they do, it's amazing.

1840
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:39,000
 They, to make the noise, they have not quite lungs

1841
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,640
 in the sense that we understand they have these holes

1842
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,120
 along their sides called spiracles, exactly.

1843
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,720
 And to make the noise, they squeeze themselves shut

1844
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,880
 like an accordion.

1845
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,120
 (laughing)

1846
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,320
 It's amazing.

1847
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,520
 And that, when they do that, it makes a noise that goes,

1848
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,360
 "Eee!"

1849
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,440
 And it sounds exactly like a bird's alarm call saying,

1850
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,800
 "There is a bird of prey nearby,"

1851
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,520
 or, "Get out of here, we're under attack."

1852
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,360
 And so the other birds all fly off as soon as

1853
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,200
 this caterpillar makes a noise.

1854
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,920
 - No, they do it to scare the birds away.

1855
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,920
 - They do it to scare the birds away,

1856
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,960
 because the birds would prey on them.

1857
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,520
 - Is that, is that evolution or is that coincidence

1858
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,960
 at the note, the specific note?

1859
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,760
 - That's everything's evolution, doesn't it?

1860
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,600
 - Yeah.

1861
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,560
 (laughing)

1862
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,320
 - That's what we all are, the product of.

1863
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,720
 - What was the other option,

1864
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,560
 of it that could even happen?

1865
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,400
 - Coincidence.

1866
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,240
 - Coincidence.

1867
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,080
 (laughing)

1868
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,400
 - Well, yeah.

1869
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,840
 It could be evolution by coincidence.

1870
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,280
 - Yeah, at least, it probably started as a bit of a coincidence.

1871
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,280
 - That's what I was looking at.

1872
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,560
 - But that's how evolution works.

1873
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,880
 Evolution always starts as a coincidence,

1874
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,800
 which then evolves into being a pattern.

1875
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,640
 - That's it.

1876
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,480
 - Yeah, yeah.

1877
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,440
 (laughing)

1878
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,000
 - No, but if you were an animal

1879
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,640
 and you were living on the Galapagos

1880
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,080
 and the trees were too high,

1881
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,640
 and the leaves were too high on the tree,

1882
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,240
 it's not coincidence for you to grow your neck to try and...

1883
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,080
 - Yes, it is.

1884
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,880
 It's a coincidence that there was someone

1885
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,280
 who was born with a really long neck.

1886
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,920
 - No, but don't you grow your neck?

1887
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,520
 - No, oh my god.

1888
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,600
 - That's Lemarkism.

1889
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,880
 - That's Lemarkism, the original evolution.

1890
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,240
 And in some people's eyes are the best.

1891
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,560
 (laughing)

1892
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,200
 - One individual gets born with a slightly longer neck.

1893
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,240
 Slightly, not one individual is born with 50 per cent.

1894
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,080
 (laughing)

1895
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,880
 - That's a coincidence.

1896
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,200
 - That has a million children

1897
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,120
 'cause it's got all the leaves.

1898
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,160
 Slightly longer neck and then can get one or two more leaves

1899
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,520
 and then it's a bit more likely to pass on its genes.

1900
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,200
 - Yes, I knew that bit.

1901
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,200
 - Right, did you though?

1902
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,600
 (laughing)

1903
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,960
 It just sounded a lot like he didn't.

1904
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:39,920
 - Yeah, when I was reading about caterpillars,

1905
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,280
 I read this statement that said that basically

1906
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,880
 all they're doing is collecting food

1907
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,680
 for the moment where they go into their chrysalis stage.

1908
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,480
 So their whole life as a caterpillar

1909
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,800
 is just to feed themselves in order for that.

1910
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,440
 Like how I moved house the other day,

1911
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,400
 it'd be like as if my whole life was just collecting boxes

1912
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,240
 for the mood.

1913
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,920
 - For the food, I mean in order to live and breathe

1914
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,240
 and for their processes to work,

1915
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,160
 they have to be metabolizing some of the food.

1916
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,320
 They can't just all be, I mean they're just creating

1917
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,760
 as well. - No, yeah, they're effectively

1918
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,120
 just like I just need to just eat

1919
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:12,960
 and get myself ready.

1920
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,280
 - They are also using the food a little bit

1921
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,920
 for energy as a caterpillar.

1922
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,600
 - Yes, totally, yeah, no but it's.

1923
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,280
 - But what's the point of using all that energy

1924
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,080
 so that you can turn into a butterfly?

1925
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,720
 - Exactly, it's the same as Dan saving up for his new house.

1926
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,360
 Like he has spent some of the money on, you know,

1927
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,400
 co-comprostedutes and whatever.

1928
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,680
 But eventually he's been saving up for this house.

1929
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,520
 - Got it.

1930
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,360
 They're putting something aside is what you're saying.

1931
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,680
 They've got a little savings account on the side.

1932
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,120
 - Yeah, but it defines their whole existence.

1933
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:39,960
 - Right.

1934
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,400
 - Because then there a new thing.

1935
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,080
 There a new, it's a whole new account.

1936
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,360
 - Who would you just say what defines

1937
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,880
 the existence of a caterpillar?

1938
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,960
 - I didn't know I read it in an article.

1939
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,200
 - I don't know if a caterpillar would agree with that.

1940
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,360
 - They probably wouldn't be able to argue me to try to.

1941
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,200
 - Totally agree.

1942
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,360
 - Even though they're caterpillars.

1943
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,360
 (all laughing)

1944
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:06,000
 - Do you know Auctioneers watch videos

1945
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,480
 of other Auctioneers at their best?

1946
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,600
 Sort of like the greatest hits of auctioneering.

1947
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,640
 - Do you mean like auctioneers have to do that

1948
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,480
 as part of their training?

1949
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,720
 - No, no, they watch it to marvel at the complexity

1950
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,360
 of what certain Auctioneers have done.

1951
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,640
 So there's a guy called Chris Birch

1952
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,360
 who's acknowledged as Christie's greatest Auctioneer.

1953
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,640
 Some people acknowledge him as the greatest Auctioneer

1954
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,160
 of all time.

1955
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,000
 - What do I think?

1956
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,160
 - What do I think?

1957
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,320
 (all laughing)

1958
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,760
 - I think I've slightly made that up.

1959
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:39,320
 - He basically, so he joined Christie's in 1970

1960
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,560
 and he averaged, now I'm just gonna read this sentence

1961
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,840
 as it's written, I didn't fully understand it

1962
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,200
 'cause I can't believe it's true.

1963
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,480
 Averaging more than $1 million a minute in sales

1964
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,840
 up to his retirement in 2012.

1965
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,840
 - No, can't be true.

1966
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,680
 - Can't be true, right?

1967
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,520
 - Can't be true, right?

1968
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,360
 - No, very fast.

1969
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:59,840
 - That's his, that's per minutes across his sales, isn't it?

1970
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,360
 So if an Auction takes 50 minutes,

1971
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,760
 then his average was 1 million a minute.

1972
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,240
 - Ah, in the 30 minutes.

1973
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,200
 - So you've got a 50 million auctioneer.

1974
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,640
 - So she sells one painting for $25 million in one minute.

1975
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,040
 He can then sit around for 24 minutes.

1976
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:13,880
 - Yeah, yeah.

1977
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,720
 - Really not try.

1978
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,840
 - He does, that makes it interesting.

1979
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,000
 - But so there's a video of him

1980
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,720
 that Auctioneers love to watch.

1981
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,480
 And he sold the 10 most expensive works

1982
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,560
 ever sold at Auction in the world.

1983
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,400
 - Wow.

1984
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,240
 - Yeah.

1985
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:32,400
 And the video is of him selling Monae's water lilies in New York.

1986
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,280
 And in it, he's taking bids from three people in the room

1987
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,720
 and two people on the phone.

1988
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,360
 And what they're watching is the magic of him

1989
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,520
 being able to juggle between it all be charming and witty

1990
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,560
 and it's a sort of master class in auctioneering videos.

1991
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,360
 - Well, I mean, I listen to other podcasts.

1992
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,200
 So it's the same kind of thing.

1993
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,520
 - Yeah, I mean, you want to, yeah,

1994
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,560
 if you do love auctioneering and you're an auctioneer,

1995
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,200
 of course, you're going to watch videos.

1996
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,560
 I just didn't know that they existed

1997
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,760
 that there's a greatest hits out there.

1998
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:59,600
 - Yeah.

1999
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,920
 - There are DVDs and things you can get.

2000
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,440
 The most greatest auctioneers.

2001
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,520
 Yeah, the most we are.

2002
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,760
 - I don't think that's the biggest auction

2003
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,560
 of all time though, even the walking is one.

2004
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,000
 I've got one that was bigger.

2005
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,840
 - Go on.

2006
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,680
 - Yeah.

2007
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,240
 - The entire Roman Empire was auctioned.

2008
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,280
 It was auctioned off in 193 AD.

2009
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,640
 Yeah, it was auctioned off by the Praetorian Guard

2010
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,320
 who took bids from a couple of people.

2011
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,640
 It was a closed auction, there wasn't anyone could bid.

2012
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,120
 And this is according to Cassie's deal

2013
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,480
 who wrote a history of Rome.

2014
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,720
 And two people were bidding saw Pikianas

2015
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,400
 and Marcus Didier's Salvia's Julianas

2016
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,600
 and he made the maximum bid.

2017
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,800
 Supposedly, it was the equivalent

2018
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,400
 of about five million quid in today's money,

2019
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,760
 which I think surely someone else could have stumped up more.

2020
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,920
 - It was past its best in 193 AD.

2021
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:43,760
 - Yeah, it was true.

2022
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,600
 - Yeah.

2023
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,360
 - Some, some damage.

2024
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,040
 (laughing)

2025
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,520
 But then several careless owners.

2026
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,600
 (laughing)

2027
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,800
 - So at the moment, British police are investigating

2028
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,920
 a caterpillar thief who has stolen

2029
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,680
 from a nature reserve in Norfolk

2030
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,280
 some milk parsley plants, right?

2031
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,080
 Now there is a kind of butterfly in Britain

2032
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,080
 called the Swallowtail.

2033
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,640
 It's the largest native British butterfly

2034
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,080
 and the caterpillars only eat milk parsley.

2035
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:14,640
 And these plants in Norfolk had Swallowtail caterpillars

2036
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:15,680
 on them.

2037
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,400
 So the police think that they've been stolen

2038
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,280
 and the plants will be kept alive

2039
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,960
 and then eventually the caterpillars will turn into butterflies

2040
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,160
 and then collectors will kill the butterflies.

2041
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,440
 And they're very rare these butterflies

2042
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,520
 'cause they only feed on these plants, right?

2043
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,360
 - So wait, so someone's thrown the plants

2044
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,400
 in order to get the caterpillars

2045
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,640
 that they can sell to collectors?

2046
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,480
 - Yes.

2047
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,520
 - Well, no, to turn the caterpillars into butterflies

2048
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,840
 to be killed for collectors, yeah.

2049
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,760
 - Yeah, but then you're breeding caterpillars, I suppose.

2050
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,240
 So you want to make more of the species?

2051
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,920
 - Then you're immediately killing the butterflies

2052
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,040
 as soon as it comes out of the thing.

2053
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,880
 - Right.

2054
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,200
 - Yeah, kind of swings around about this.

2055
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,440
 - No, it's all swigs.

2056
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,000
 (laughing)

2057
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
 - Craft playground.

2058
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,080
 (laughing)

2059
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,520
 - Do you know that they're used to play cricket

2060
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,600
 on the ice in the fins?

2061
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:00,240
 And this was in North, in what's it called,

2062
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,240
 in East Anglia, in England?

2063
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,120
 - Was that not quite confusing

2064
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,480
 if they were wearing their wipes?

2065
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,520
 (laughing)

2066
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,920
 - No, this would take place in the 18th,

2067
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,600
 in the 19th century.

2068
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,360
 And I read one account saying that the fielding

2069
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,640
 and batting of many of the players was considered

2070
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,200
 to be far superior and more graceful

2071
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,240
 than any cricketing on the green.

2072
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,080
 - Really?

2073
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,480
 - So apparently playing cricket on ice is better.

2074
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,160
 - Were they in skates or were they just running around with me?

2075
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,840
 - I think they were on skates, yeah.

2076
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,120
 - That must be amazing.

2077
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,120
 - Yeah, I mean, the ball will go so far.

2078
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,920
 If you hit it, it goes up, yeah, yeah.

2079
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,720
 - Standing on skates to bat.

2080
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,440
 - Hang on, why would the ball go far?

2081
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,800
 - 'Cause it was skid on the ice.

2082
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,400
 - Oh, once it hit the ground,

2083
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,080
 if we were going to give you superhuman power

2084
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,200
 of hitting on the ice.

2085
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,400
 (laughing)

2086
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,560
 - Just quickly on the dutch

2087
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,160
 and how good they are at skating.

2088
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,960
 - Oh, they're amazing at speed skating, aren't they?

2089
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:50,800
 - This is the thing, okay.

2090
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,200
 So they're now so good that other countries

2091
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,800
 are refusing to play against the moment.

2092
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,640
 (laughing)

2093
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,480
 There's no point.

2094
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,280
 In Sotchi, in 2014, the Norwegians dropped out

2095
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,200
 of the 10,000 meter speed skating race,

2096
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,400
 ostensibly because they said,

2097
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,040
 we want to focus on the team event, actually,

2098
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,000
 just 'cause they knew they get marmalized by the dutch.

2099
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,600
 And so, annoying, love skating as well.

2100
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,720
 So that's a big thing.

2101
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,120
 So the women's 1,500 meter team,

2102
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:17,520
 they came first, second, third, and fourth in that event.

2103
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,880
 And out of 36 medals, the dutch got 23.

2104
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,480
 No other team got more than three.

2105
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,120
 - Maybe it's on fur, 'cause they're the tallest nation, aren't they?

2106
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,240
 So perhaps it's on fur, 'cause they're legs are too long.

2107
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:32,400
 - But they will have a higher center of gravity, meaning.

2108
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,400
 - Sure.

2109
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,800
 - That is easier than to fall over.

2110
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,440
 - Are we sure that being tall is an advantage in ice skating, I think.

2111
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,680
 - We are certainly not sure of that.

2112
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,760
 - Really long legs might help, I guess, if you're

2113
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,400
 trying to, if you're pelling yourself forward,

2114
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,080
 'cause you can go further from each stroke, maybe,

2115
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,080
 and it's like a more efficient use of energy, perhaps.

2116
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:48,920
 - I don't know, I guess.

2117
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:53,600
 - I would suggest that if Jamaica were to take part in this event,

2118
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,880
 they might be as good as, if not better, than the dutch.

2119
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,920
 - I think we've just come with a sequel to cool runnings.

2120
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,520
 (laughing)

2121
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,160
 - But the fastest skater, the world record holder

2122
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,560
 for the fastest skater is a Russian,

2123
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:11,680
 called Pavel Kuliznikov, and he, whatever,

2124
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,040
 how would you say it then, James?

2125
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:13,880
 - Kolesnikov.

2126
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,720
 - Kolesnikov, yeah, they go.

2127
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,560
 (laughing)

2128
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,840
 Pavel Kolesnikov, and to be fair,

2129
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,760
 I didn't even read the name until just now.

2130
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,880
 I should have written the phonetic spelling down.

2131
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,720
 And he went at, he was registered going at,

2132
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,680
 53 kilometres an hour, registered going,

2133
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,880
 not well, like a police camera, but like,

2134
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,360
 he, I just think that's astonishingly fast for a skater,

2135
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,800
 and he was in a 500 metre rate, so he picked up speed fast.

2136
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,280
 - How many is that in Malzana, please?

2137
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,760
 I don't know, I can't be bothered with this.

2138
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,480
 - It's going to be 32.91, yeah.

2139
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,320
 - Yeah.

2140
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,080
 - Is that, that's fast, isn't it?

2141
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:46,040
 - Yeah. - Can you say in both run of 30 miles an hour?

2142
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,840
 He's not, it doesn't normally happen in Malzana,

2143
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,680
 does it?

2144
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,120
 They do it in seconds per 100 metres.

2145
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:50,960
 (laughing)

2146
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,560
 - I think it'll be nice if it was Malzana for the spectators.

2147
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,560
 - He can run at approximately 9.9 seconds per 100 metres.

2148
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,480
 - I'm not sure what that is in Malzana.

2149
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,480
 - Someone at home can work it out.

2150
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,120
 - I think it's less, I think it's about 20 that he runs, isn't it?

2151
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,480
 - Oh, that's not very, that's like a built-up area.

2152
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,240
 (laughing)

2153
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,840
 - I was looking up lonely insects,

2154
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,120
 and I was looking up cockroaches,

2155
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,680
 and they suffer from isolation syndrome,

2156
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,120
 if they're left on their own, and they die,

2157
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,280
 so, or they are not able to mature properly,

2158
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,240
 and this is really weird, so the way that cockroaches

2159
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,800
 are really affectionate physically,

2160
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,600
 so you know, if you see them, they're always crawling

2161
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,400
 all over each other and stuff, and touching each other,

2162
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,880
 and it turns out all this physical contact stimulates them

2163
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,240
 to grow, so if you isolate a cockroach,

2164
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,920
 even if you give it food and water, then it won't grow,

2165
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,240
 and it won't melt properly, and it won't mature,

2166
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,840
 but you can make it mature by poking it with a feather.

2167
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:44,960
 (laughing)

2168
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,520
 So, yeah, and that convinces them

2169
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,800
 that they're having this physical contact

2170
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,520
 with their fellow cockroaches, and they grow properly mature.

2171
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,520
 - That's amazing.

2172
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,120
 Does it have to be a feather, or?

2173
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,680
 - It can probably actually be any kind of slightly

2174
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,680
 ridiculous device.

2175
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,000
 - Is there a limit to how big a cockroach grows?

2176
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,840
 - Yes.

2177
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,680
 - 'Cause they can maintain it, right?

2178
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,200
 Like, if they were touching another cockroach,

2179
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,600
 they're like, "I just want to grow a bit today,"

2180
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,840
 and so they touch a cockroach.

2181
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,640
 - So, you're saying, if you get a cockroach,

2182
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,920
 and you tickle it for, like, let's say, seven weeks,

2183
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,560
 yeah, it might be the size of a dog.

2184
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,200
 - Exactly, that's my question.

2185
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,320
 - Maybe, try it.

2186
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,640
 - I think Andy's skeptical.

2187
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,360
 - I'm skeptical, and I'm surprised I know

2188
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:18,640
 that you're encouraging this life of a coward, isn't it?

2189
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,040
 - And we've cli-bottled a lot of the stupid things

2190
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,640
 he said today, I thought we'd just let this go.

2191
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,880
 (laughing)

2192
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:32,120
 - So, for many years, in many places, collecting flies

2193
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,400
 and giving them to the government has gotten you money.

2194
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:39,920
 So, in China, officials in Luai Yang

2195
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,920
 offered $125 per 2,000 dead flies during a campaign.

2196
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:48,920
 Each fly was worth about $0.7.

2197
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,480
 - Was that a massive amount for a fly?

2198
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,880
 - This recently, sorry.

2199
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,800
 - I know, it's quite recently, yeah.

2200
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,880
 - The scent is quite a lot bigger than a fly as well.

2201
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,000
 - Yeah, that's not really how money works.

2202
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,840
 (laughing)

2203
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,240
 - It's interesting that usually,

2204
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,840
 the money's less than the thing that you made.

2205
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,160
 - Don't touch it at all, actually.

2206
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,000
 - That's not true at all.

2207
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,200
 - That goes to the shop with loads of flies,

2208
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,480
 so they say, you can't pay with that,

2209
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,400
 and you're like, well, it's heavier than a pound note.

2210
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,480
 - Oh, it's weird, 'cause the sandwich

2211
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,920
 weighs a lot more than 20 pounds,

2212
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,880
 but the 20 pound note is heavier.

2213
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,920
 (laughing)

2214
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,960
 - It doesn't really make sense.

2215
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,800
 - It doesn't really.

2216
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,600
 - It doesn't really, I completely retry that.

2217
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,280
 - It's ridiculous thing to say.

2218
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,520
 - So, in...

2219
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,280
 - 'Cause then you wouldn't be able to buy anything.

2220
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,120
 (laughing)

2221
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,440
 - You're not gonna learn that diamonds, are you?

2222
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,880
 - I just bought my first house.

2223
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,160
 - Oh, man, that must be tough.

2224
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,960
 Yeah, I'd find a coin as big as a house.

2225
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,360
 (laughing)

2226
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:35,920
 - That's what happens on the island of Yap in Micronesia,

2227
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,760
 'cause they have massive stone coins with holes in them,

2228
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,560
 and the bigger the better, really.

2229
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,760
 - Yeah, that's what I was doing with that.

2230
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,600
 - It's embarrassing.

2231
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,560
 (laughing)

2232
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,880
 - Salvador Dali, he was obsessed with breasts,

2233
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,000
 wasn't he, as in a lot of his art depicts breasts,

2234
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,280
 but his ultimate obsession was with the other,

2235
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,640
 'cause he said it's a very weird sexual thing.

2236
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,240
 It's half penis and half other.

2237
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,080
 - Well, sorry.

2238
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:01,920
 - Sorry, sorry.

2239
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,480
 (laughing)

2240
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,080
 It's half penis, half breast, all other.

2241
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,160
 - It more sense is an utter half penis.

2242
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,360
 - It's incorrect, Salvador Dali is the correct.

2243
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,640
 He went out on a limb, he was wrong.

2244
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:17,760
 - A UFC fighter called Justine Kish,

2245
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,960
 she was in a fight,

2246
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,240
 and halfway through the match,

2247
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:24,280
 she was held in, I think, in a stranglehold,

2248
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:29,280
 and as a result, she put herself midfights in the octagon.

2249
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,120
 - Nice.

2250
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,280
 - Still won the match,

2251
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:35,240
 and she got offered a bum-wiping product

2252
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,480
 as her sponsor for future- - Do you mean Tyler Mesa?

2253
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,680
 - No, it's, it's wipes.

2254
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,320
 - She goes, I'll shop your wipes.

2255
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,440
 - Yes, can I have some bum-wiping products, please?

2256
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,520
 (laughing)

2257
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,840
 - Yeah, this is how the test goes.

2258
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,040
 It's quite equivalent when they're not allowed to call it

2259
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,240
 a jaffa cake, so they can call it filled biscuits

2260
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,520
 with chocolate on top.

2261
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,240
 (laughing)

2262
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,440
 - Without the chocolate on chocolate,

2263
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,280
 it's just one.

2264
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:59,280
 (laughing)

2265
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,200
 - But actually, this wasn't Tyler pay for you.

2266
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,920
 - No, no, it's wipes, it's bum-wipes.

2267
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:04,760
 - Yes, wipes.

2268
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,560
 - Wet wipes for adults as opposed to babies.

2269
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,200
 So yeah, so she thought she was gonna do it,

2270
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,040
 and she was really good,

2271
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,200
 'cause she won the match anyway,

2272
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,200
 and she came off and they asked her about it,

2273
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,800
 and she said, "Shit, it happens."

2274
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,800
 - Did she go, it's very nice.

2275
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,120
 - Did she use it as a weapon in the fight?

2276
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,640
 I mean, in no holds barred.

2277
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,440
 - There's no weapons in UFC.

2278
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,640
 - But there's no rules, right?

2279
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,480
 - Yeah.

2280
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,320
 - There's no rules, that's true.

2281
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,160
 - It's not eye-gouging if you rub your shit

2282
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,000
 in some space.

2283
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,840
 - That's true.

2284
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,760
 Oh, do you mean did she use the poo in the fight?

2285
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:31,960
 - Not her wipes.

2286
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,600
 (laughing)

2287
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,440
 - Right.

2288
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,440
 - I'll wipe the floor with you.

2289
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,280
 (laughing)

2290
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,120
 - Have you heard of the, in Holland,

2291
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,200
 there's a race in Holland called the Elf Staden Tocht.

2292
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,240
 The Leven Skirer told me about this, actually.

2293
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,800
 So it's this race that happens,

2294
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,480
 well, it happens whenever it's able to happen.

2295
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,840
 So sometimes it doesn't happen for 20 years,

2296
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,160
 sometimes it'll happen in consecutive years,

2297
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,520
 and it's apparently a massive event in Holland

2298
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,360
 when it does happen.

2299
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,240
 And it is a ice skating tour

2300
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,920
 that is about 200 kilometers long

2301
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,040
 and goes to 11 cities,

2302
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:01,880
 and that's what the name is,

2303
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,880
 it's the 11th city tour.

2304
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,520
 And apparently it's just a massive event.

2305
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,320
 And what happens is, every year,

2306
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,040
 everything gets cold and freezes in winter,

2307
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:11,920
 and they go around the race track

2308
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,080
 and these go along the network and come out.

2309
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:15,920
 Yeah, exactly.

2310
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,440
 And they have to make sure that the ice is sticking off,

2311
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,800
 'cause it's an amateur contest,

2312
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,720
 and the professionals and amateurs take part.

2313
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:24,600
 And so they're loads and loads of people take part in it,

2314
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,680
 and then pretty much the rest of the country,

2315
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,880
 all cool and sick, and watch it on television.

2316
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,240
 And no, apparently that's like a thing.

2317
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,000
 It's like, so they stay home, like watch it.

2318
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,240
 It's a bit like, I know, the Grand National here,

2319
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,560
 but everybody watches it or something.

2320
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,400
 - Yeah, all of them.

2321
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,560
 (laughing)

2322
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,560
 - Or any sports event.

2323
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,400
 - A massive sports event,

2324
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,560
 but everyone watches it, yeah, absolutely.

2325
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,760
 - Yeah, I have heard of that,

2326
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,440
 but I think global warming means it hasn't happened for a while.

2327
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,280
 - Yeah, it hasn't happened for a while.

2328
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,040
 There was one that was going to happen in 2012,

2329
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,200
 and they called it, and what happens is,

2330
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,280
 they decide they're gonna call it,

2331
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,960
 and then it has to happen in the next 48 hours,

2332
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,480
 so everyone has to rush to get prepared.

2333
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,280
 But then it didn't happen even though they called it,

2334
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,280
 because the ice just wasn't thick and--

2335
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,280
 - It's so exciting.

2336
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,960
 - And there was actually speaking of ice preparation,

2337
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,600
 they do this thing called ice transplanting,

2338
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,360
 which is taking thick ice from one place,

2339
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,880
 and moving it to say a bit under a bridge,

2340
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,080
 where the ice isn't very thick,

2341
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,200
 and to kind of fusing it to the ice.

2342
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,480
 It's like a skin transplant,

2343
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,960
 but yeah, isn't that really cool?

2344
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,440
 - 'Cause it has to be six inches thick

2345
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:18,520
 along the entire 200 kilometers of the course,

2346
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,240
 and obviously that's very seldom gonna happen.

2347
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,080
 - Yeah.

2348
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,400
 - Why aren't the climate change lobby using this more

2349
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,440
 in their PR?

2350
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:28,080
 I really think that might persuade the likes of Donald Trump

2351
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,160
 and another such people, surely.

2352
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,440
 If we know that this canal ice race is gonna end,

2353
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,480
 - It's on track and people would step up to the plate.

2354
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,200
 - Yeah, it's on track as a secret passion

2355
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,360
 for ice, it's getting race racing.

2356
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,200
 I don't think he does.

2357
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,160
 - Who would it for this?

2358
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,680
 - Yeah, it is incredible.

2359
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,080
 It's so cool.

2360
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,680
 - Do you mind if I ask why people are monitoring

2361
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,880
 the koala populations?

2362
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:48,920
 Do we know that?

2363
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,560
 - Yeah, I think more--

2364
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,400
 - Do you mind if I ask?

2365
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,520
 - It wasn't that person on the course, you know?

2366
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,600
 (laughing)

2367
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,680
 - Sorry, it's not me finding really invasive.

2368
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,640
 (laughing)

2369
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:04,320
 - Did you guys see that photo from March of this year?

2370
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,280
 There was a guy sitting at a train station.

2371
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,920
 He looked up, and he just couldn't believe what he saw.

2372
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,200
 He took a photo to prove it.

2373
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,800
 He was stopped at Seven Sisters Station,

2374
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,800
 sitting right there on the platform with seven nuns.

2375
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,240
 Seven nuns, seven sisters.

2376
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:25,520
 And he took a photo of it, yeah.

2377
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,480
 - Do you think an eighth nun wanted to come on that trip,

2378
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,760
 but they were like, "Guys, we can't."

2379
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,720
 - No, this is like the moon landing's being fake.

2380
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,320
 If you look in the photo, there is an eighth nun.

2381
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:35,920
 - Well, there's an eighth man--

2382
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,880
 - No, there's one man, but--

2383
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,040
 - No, he's an eighth in the party.

2384
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,400
 - Oh, I thought I saw an eighth nun when I looked at the photo.

2385
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,240
 - Oh, really?

2386
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,440
 - So was there an eighth nun behind the other nuns?

2387
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,760
 - You're right, there's an eighth nun!

2388
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,560
 - Oh my God, ruined.

2389
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:53,320
 - Oh, man, I'm sorry, I feel like I've killed Christmas.

2390
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,160
 - God, did you do it that easy with the moon landing's as well?

2391
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,160
 (laughing)

2392
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,320
 - Have you heard of open-source seeds?

2393
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,000
 No. - No.

2394
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:03,840
 - Okay, so--

2395
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,280
 - Is that seeds that don't charge you to read them?

2396
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,120
 - Kind of.

2397
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:07,960
 - Okay.

2398
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:11,120
 - I think these are the seeds that are in these libraries,

2399
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:11,960
 these open-source seeds.

2400
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:16,640
 - Well, so in the 1930s, the USA started applying patent law

2401
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,360
 to plants.

2402
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,520
 So there are various plants where the intellectual property

2403
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,600
 is owned.

2404
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,680
 - Like, you can own an avocado?

2405
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,080
 - Well, you can own an avocado,

2406
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:29,000
 but you can own the whole avocado.

2407
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,200
 - The whole concept of the avocado.

2408
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,800
 - The whole species of the, yeah.

2409
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,480
 They've got this new kind of rice that's called golden rice,

2410
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,320
 which is hardier and it grows faster and better

2411
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,320
 and therefore is prevented starvation.

2412
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:43,080
 That is owned by someone, the intellectual property for it.

2413
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,920
 - Does that mean you're not allowed to grow it

2414
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,760
 or you're not allowed to give it the name?

2415
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,760
 - I think you're not allowed to then, I'm not sure about this,

2416
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,200
 I think you're then not allowed to breed it, develop it,

2417
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,080
 and then make money selling your own ex for strain of it,

2418
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,120
 but I'm not certain.

2419
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,760
 So anyway-- - No commercial use, basically.

2420
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,880
 And I think that's because that specific breed of rice

2421
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,800
 was growing in space.

2422
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,960
 And it was like the means that it took to do that

2423
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,000
 and then means, well, therefore,

2424
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,680
 those people deserve a kind of a cut of any profits.

2425
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,720
 - Well, I don't think it's the specific of the space thing,

2426
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,360
 but I just think-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the specific

2427
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,200
 I see, yeah.

2428
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,960
 - The effort went into making that new breed of rice.

2429
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,160
 - Yeah, so if you, it's kind of like developing a medicine,

2430
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,200
 in some ways, that if you develop the medicine,

2431
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,280
 you then get the rights to it

2432
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,040
 because you've spent money developing it,

2433
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,560
 but they've now got this thing called open-source seeds.

2434
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,480
 German breeders are experimenting with it.

2435
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,720
 You're not allowed to patent anything

2436
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,720
 that you get out of it, any new great strains

2437
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,600
 that you get, but you don't have to pay anybody

2438
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,520
 to do the developing and--

2439
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,840
 - Okay. - Isn't that weird?

2440
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,080
 - Yeah, that's truly bizarre.

2441
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,480
 And it doesn't seem morally great, surely.

2442
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,520
 If you're not allowed to let anyone grow

2443
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,320
 this thing that could be a great food source,

2444
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,160
 that you can probably-- - Right.

2445
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,080
 It might not incentivise people to develop new strains

2446
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,240
 if you can't own it.

2447
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,560
 So there's a bit of a-- - That's it.

2448
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,400
 - That sort of capitalism.

2449
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,480
 - This is cognitiveism.

2450
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,360
 (laughing)

2451
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,360
 So I'm getting one simple sentence.

2452
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,300
 (laughing)

2453
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,480
 - Imagine you'd like everybody to have an off-to-eat anna.

2454
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,920
 - Well, well, I'm sorry.

2455
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,040
 (laughing)

2456
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,680
 - I suppose it's not a million miles away

2457
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,160
 from patenting a Mars bar.

2458
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,240
 - Or a strain of Apple,

2459
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,880
 that isn't like a granny's myth or something.

2460
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,720
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

2461
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,800
 - A fan I was in charge.

2462
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,360
 Just be formless lumps of chocolate

2463
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,240
 and new garlic we'd be eating now.

2464
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,720
 - And everyone would get one, wouldn't they?

2465
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,080
 It's a better world.

2466
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,660
 (upbeat music)

2467
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:26,240
 (upbeat music)

2468
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:31,920
 (upbeat music)

2469
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:41,920
