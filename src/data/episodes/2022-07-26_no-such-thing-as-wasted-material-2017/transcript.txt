 I am really happy in the middle bit
 between Christmas and New Year.
 Ooh, very nice.
 Thank you very much.
 I'm trying to get a range of greeting cards out.
 Going very soon.
 No, was to buy greetings cards after Christmas, very weird.
 - Yeah, Dan and Andy here.
 We just want to quickly let you know
 what you're about to listen to.
 This is a compilation of all the outtakes
 from the whole of 2017.
 Every podcast, we always chop away a lot of stuff
 and James has been secretly collecting it
 to put together for this big bumper addition,
 78-minute-long episode.
 - 78 minutes.
 - 78 minutes of outtake.
 - I could watch a short children's film.
 We're a very, very long episode of Frazier in that time.
 Frazier made 78-minute-long episodes.
 - I don't believe so, but it was the,
 the only thing I can think of that's shorter than 78 minutes.
 So what we're saying is, please do enjoy it
 unless there's a weird Frazier marathon on,
 in which case we give you a license to go
 and watch that instead.
 We hope you enjoy this.
 Have a wonderful New Year.
 When it comes, I will see you then.
 - All right, on with the outtakes.
 - I'm off to watch Frazier.
 (upbeat music)
 - Did you guys know that anteaters,
 who have obviously famously long tongues,
 have got very, very few taste buds?
 - Really?
 - Yeah.
 - What does one taste but every middle, eh?
 - They can hardly taste what they're eating.
 - Well, they're eating shitty ants and you know,
 termites and stuff.
 - They're eating ants and they occasionally swallow dirt
 as well as the other thing.
 - Yeah, really?
 - So it may be an advantage.
 - You don't need to be a,
 'cause all ants are gonna taste the same, right?
 They're gonna taste vinegary.
 - Oh.
 - Yeah, they are.
 - No. - 'Cause they're full of formic acid.
 - That's so antists.
 - Disagree.
 - 100% disagree.
 'Cause there are some of those ants,
 and they do remember, they swallow honey
 and they hang upside down,
 and they're sort of honey repositories.
 - Imagine how much you must think you've locked out
 when you get the odd honey tasting ants.
 Such a relief.
 They have, well, pangolins, which look quite similar,
 have their tongues attached to their pelvis.
 I don't know if I'm using the same thing,
 'cause they have such long tongues,
 when they start their pelvis.
 So I think their tongues are.
 - So they're attached at the back.
 - They don't.
 - They don't, they don't.
 - They don't.
 - They're on the inside of them.
 They're the way their tongue comes out
 and then sweeps around.
 - That's what I was thinking.
 Yeah. - Hang on.
 - Yeah.
 - It can't be all tongue all the way back.
 It's to all tongue, all the way back into a pangolin.
 Their tongues are longer than their bodies are.
 - What's the point of that?
 - So you can, I guess, maneuver it all the way down the tongue.
 And once it's back at the pelvis,
 the food's practically there.
 The belly need a digestive system.
 I don't know, they've just tested for the truth.
 - That's amazing.
 - Isn't it true that I think woodpeckers
 have them all the way through back into the skull
 and they wind around the skull?
 I've seen like an X-ray of them, right?
 - Yeah. - Yeah.
 - And that helps cushion their skull
 when they're pecking, doesn't it?
 - As well as being a useful place to store their tongue.
 - Do you know what the longest tongue is?
 And this is relation to body size.
 - It must be this pangolin.
 I think, no, go on.
 - Go for it, no, have a bat.
 - Is it a bat?
 - Yes, it is, yeah, it's the tube-lipped nectar bat.
 And its tongue can go to 1.5 times the length
 of its actual body.
 - Wow.
 So that's the longest tongue in proportion to body size.
 - Exactly, in an animal.
 - I know the length of that bat.
 - Oh do you?
 Nora fist you later.
 - How on earth did you remember that?
 - It's weird that with it having such a massive tongue
 and a tongue being 1.5 times bigger than the whole thing
 that they choose to name it after the lip.
 - Yes, that's true.
 - But maybe they didn't see the tongue for a long time.
 Maybe they're like, well, look at that lip.
 - Almost no one had ever seen the tongue
 because it's always in these massively long flower nose.
 - What am I saying now?
 - The flower nose.
 - The flower nose.
 - The trumpet of a flower.
 - Did they think that the bat's face was a flower?
 (laughing)
 That's got the head of a flower.
 - It's really weird.
 - Do you know when an elephant's charging you
 when you should be nervous?
 - It's running towards you very fast.
 - Is it only about 30 centimeters
 for a hit to you, you panic?
 (laughing)
 - It's not that.
 If an elephant has its trunk out, this is according to.
 - Whoa, what is it?
 How can it have its trunk in?
 - If it's up its bum.
 (laughing)
 - If it's like coiled up, I guess.
 I'm like not in use.
 - Yeah, if it's trunk is like, that is facing downwards
 or coiled up or it's relaxed.
 - It's always out, that was it.
 - It is always out, so it's never sucked into its face.
 - Yeah.
 - It's just like lifting up and it's doing like,
 one of those like, charge the light brigade
 like fanfares out of it.
 Like, and charging at you, that's when you know
 it's going to attack.
 - No, it's not going to attack then
 when it's doing the charge of the light brigade.
 So when it's got its trunk protruding out towards you,
 you can absolutely relax.
 You're going to be fine.
 Apparently, that's a bluff.
 And it's when the trunk's down and relax
 that they're doing a proper job.
 - I've never seen an elephant
 with its trunk straight out like a...
 - Well, that's because they genuinely want
 to trample you down, James.
 - Have you seen that that I've never even seen
 a picture of that?
 - I haven't really.
 - I'm running with your fist out.
 - Ready to hit someone.
 - Yeah.
 - But you very rarely get to photograph
 an elephant charging from the side on.
 Don't you?
 Normally, a human elephant contact is rare enough,
 especially in Safari,
 that there wouldn't be another group of people
 photographing the elephant from the side.
 - So you're saying he saw it face on
 and it just looked like an elephant without a trunk.
 - It's pointing straight out of his.
 - I do see that.
 But I'm just surprised I've never come across a picture
 like that.
 - I think something that happens.
 - I'm surprised I didn't look at Google images
 as soon as I read the facts.
 - So what's going to happen if the trunk is stretched
 down and it's bluffing?
 Will it just get up to you and then they're just being
 awkward?
 - Get up to you and then noddle you, friend.
 In a friendly manner.
 - Shove is shrunken your mouth.
 - Just thinks you're stressed.
 It's just to scare you away.
 - Oh, okay.
 I think it would work for me.
 - Even if I remember this conversation and thought,
 Hannah said that that's not gonna hurt me.
 - Imagine if I've got this the wrong way around
 and how guilty I'm gonna feel.
 - Well, I always forget the numbers.
 I always think 99% of elephant charges of bluffs.
 And then I think, or is that 99% of shark attacks?
 - Yeah.
 - And actually, only 4% of elephant charges of bluffs.
 (laughing)
 - But then it's also like, but the black bear
 and the brown bear.
 But then brown bears can be black.
 And then which one is way...
 - It's the nightmare.
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah.
 - Just run away from them all.
 I think it's what I was saying.
 Just live in a city.
 (laughing)
 - Have you heard of Hobart's funnies?
 - No.
 - Good, great.
 So these were tanks that were used in D-Day.
 And there was this whole range.
 Like a range of superheroes, basically.
 They all each had their own special superpower.
 - Were they named funnies because they're unusual?
 - Yeah, pretty much.
 - That was a sort of nickname they were given.
 There was one whose sole job was
 to carry massive bundles of sticks.
 - Ah, fash skis.
 - Fash skis, exactly.
 It was called the faskine carrier.
 And it basically, if you came to a ramp
 that was too steep or a hole in the ground
 that you needed to fill in,
 it just dropped a few massive bundles of,
 and these were enormous bundles of sticks.
 - And that's where the name fashism comes from.
 - Exactly.
 So it was using the faskine carrier to defeat fashism.
 - Yeah.
 - Ah.
 - They were the first ones actually.
 The first armoured vehicle launch bridges,
 were the ones that just carried a big bunch of sticks
 and then tip them into a ditch.
 - It can't assume very scary.
 If those were the first things
 the Germans saw on the horizon.
 (laughing)
 - The least scary robot was robots.
 - Yeah.
 - But you would think that the like in the end of Macbeth,
 spoiler alert, trees, the trees are coming towards you.
 - Oh yeah, that's true.
 Yeah, I guess any German soldiers
 who had done the English PTSD wouldn't be frightened.
 - Did you guys know that,
 and I'm not sure that this is true.
 So I'm sort of asking, as well as saying,
 that in France, Camembert is the translated equivalent
 of our pie chart.
 - It is.
 - Is it?
 - Camembert.
 - Camembert charts.
 - Let's take a look at this Camembert for a pie chart.
 - That's awesome.
 - Yeah, and that's because the correct way to eat
 Camembert is to slice it into pie shapes, really.
 - And then the people who think trees
 may be a better prime minister,
 get one bit of the cheese.
 - They got tiny little slither of cheese.
 (laughing)
 And they don't know who's just getting massive of the cheese.
 And actually on Reddit, I think it was this year,
 or it was late last year, they had a big argument
 where somebody showed a picture of a Camembert
 that their mum had cut.
 And their mum had cut it in not a slicey way.
 And this was a French lady,
 and they were all saying she should be kicked out
 the country for that.
 - I've got to say, I wouldn't cross my mind
 not to slice it up like a pie.
 Who's doing it in a slicey way?
 That's insane.
 - This lady.
 - Well, this lady.
 - We would have a kicked out.
 - Well, they didn't kick her out.
 I don't think in the end.
 But someone said, oh, there's a cause
 for loss of nationality.
 And another commenter said,
 "Take her to the British border immediately."
 (laughing)
 - I actually cut off the top of the Camembert,
 the whole thing.
 - Just the mold.
 - I just eat that.
 - 'Cause that is just solid bacteria, isn't it?
 Basically, I think so.
 - The rind of the Camembert, the edible liquid.
 A solid mat of mold.
 - And then the bacteria is a little brownie bits,
 and you should have some brown bits on it,
 but not too much.
 - Like a banana?
 - Yes, like a banana.
 That depends what you like in a banana.
 - That also probably depends what you like in a Camembert.
 - No, this is objective facts.
 (laughing)
 - So I've been to Pompeii.
 I went last year, and there was a lot of brothels there
 that they found which were still standing.
 In particular, there's one called Lupinar,
 and the Latin for that is she-wolf,
 which was slang for prostitutes.
 And it was two levels, had five rooms,
 and you know that it's a brothel because on the walls,
 there was still depictions of people in various positions,
 having sex, and they think the idea behind that
 was it was almost like porn material to be watching
 while you were having sex.
 It was the equivalent of having a pornographic movie
 on in the background for them.
 Isn't that weird?
 They had porn on their walls in the brothel.
 - It might have been like one of those menus,
 where if you don't speak the language,
 you just point at the thing you want.
 But yeah, no, it's an extraordinary place.
 Highly recommend, if you go there.
 - They also, one of the things I find amazing about Pompeii,
 it might be Herculenium, which was the place
 nearby, the same thing happened to it,
 is the scrolls that were found.
 So 800 scrolls were found, perfectly preserved,
 as everything there was.
 And it's, you know, one of the ancient world's
 best surviving libraries, most extensive surviving libraries,
 and we can't read it, or we can't read a huge amount of it,
 because they're in such a delicate state
 that we can't touch them.
 So we've got all these rolled up scrolls,
 and we don't know what they say,
 and they're sitting in museums and stuff,
 and we're just developing the X-ray technology
 to try and read bits of them, and they've just found out
 that they use lead sometimes in the ink,
 and now X-rays can see what the lead shapes are,
 and work out what they read.
 But how annoying is that?
 Wouldn't you just, if I saw that, I'd try an Unreal one.
 - Is that case? - Oh, well, they did try,
 but every time they tried, they would just fall apart.
 - Oh, so they did sample that for the time. - Yeah, they tried it,
 and they'd fall apart, and then I read an article,
 I don't know how this would work, but one time they said,
 they tried to open it and explode it.
 - Wow. - Can I just open it and explode?
 That don't know how that works. - Wow.
 But yeah, this X-ray stuff is really interesting, isn't it?
 Because they convertually unroll scrolls,
 which is just unbelievable. - It's so cool.
 - So they kind of get the X-ray scan of it,
 and then they go, okay, now we're gonna take off the first layer,
 and they can unroll it, and they can see what's on the next layer,
 which is just outrageous. - Yeah, that's super cool.
 - Amazing. - How many scrolls do you think they ruined
 that turned a dust in their hand before they went,
 "You know what, this isn't working?"
 - I would have stopped after about 50.
 - I simply... (laughing)
 - In the 1930s, sociologist Norbert Elias walked around Europe
 with his shoelaces on tie to see what people would say to him.
 - No. - He did.
 - What was his real name, though?
 (laughing)
 - Oh, very good. - Yeah.
 - That sounds like alias.
 (laughing)
 - That's good.
 He found that in England, most old men won that he might fall over.
 When he was in Germany, the old men would look at him with contempt.
 - Wow. - And he was walking around
 a Spanish fishing village with his shoelaces untied,
 and he felt that he was being warned that his laces were untied,
 but he felt that it was helping him to be included
 in the village community.
 - Really? - Yeah, I think I read about this guy.
 There's something about, I don't know what country he was walking,
 and a bunch of girls were giggling at him,
 little girls were giggling at him because of the untying
 of the shoelaces, and then he tied them up,
 and that really transformed how he felt about his connection
 to the places that he was in, when he realized who he was, yeah.
 - That's weird because if I saw someone walking around
 with the shoelaces untied, I think my instinct would be
 to go and try and step on one and to trip them over.
 So you not find that, happened a lot?
 (laughing)
 - Or to wait until they stop and then to tie them together.
 - Yeah, definitely. - Oh, wow, yeah.
 - If you've got enough time for that, that's the dream.
 (laughing)
 - Do you guys know about the orangutan that can tie knots,
 and we don't know why, and this sounds like a,
 it's a bullshit animal fact,
 but it's genuinely true and it's bizarre.
 So there's this orangutan called Watana.
 She was born, I think it's a she.
 Yeah, she was born in 1995 in Belgium,
 and this guy called Chris Hertz,
 who's written a book about her,
 but she ties knots and no one's ever taught her to do it,
 and she just finds two threads or two finds or whatever,
 then she ties them together.
 - I think she's trying to escape.
 (laughing)
 - Is she kept in a very high zoo?
 (laughing)
 - She's, she's never tried to climb up out of them
 or hand herself from them.
 - She's.
 - Sorry.
 (laughing)
 - Are you hosting her?
 - That got dark, very quickly.
 (laughing)
 - That was my instinct when he said she was trying to escape,
 and I realized that I'd got it wrong.
 - Escape from the monotony of life.
 (laughing)
 - There was an article in The New York Times from 1976,
 which reports an occasion where there was an exhibition game
 of football between a team from China and a team from Athens,
 and over the loudspeaker, a tune started blaring,
 and both teams stood up and put hands on hearts,
 because you know, they seemed it was the other ones,
 national hook of them, and it turned out it was a toothpaste
 advert.
 (laughing)
 Everyone, the stadium stood up, and respectfully.
 - That was amazing.
 That's really good.
 - Do you know what the rules are about singing the anthem?
 The government have said that you should dress appropriately.
 - Right.
 - Also that you should stand still.
 - Right.
 - And that you should be full of energy.
 (laughing)
 - Okay.
 - That's interesting.
 - Yeah.
 - Stand still, so you're ready to go, basically.
 - Yeah, I think you have to be quivering, basically.
 (laughing)
 - That's not still.
 - No, you're right, you're right.
 I don't know how do you say that.
 - As soon as they finish, everyone's just gonna explode
 in some kind of--
 - Yeah, and you're not allowed to whisper during it.
 You're not allowed to talk on the phone during it.
 - But lots of countries have weird rules, don't they?
 - That's true.
 - I think Philippines, in the Philippines,
 their national anthem has to be between 120 beats per minute.
 The Star Spangled Banner, when that was first written,
 it was supposed to be Conspirito, which means with spirit.
 - Oh, I thought you meant it was meant to be called?
 - No.
 - Conspirito.
 - It sounds like a magician.
 - Yeah.
 (laughing)
 - And also, the God saved the Queen.
 George the Fifth, he thought he was an expert
 'cause he'd listened to it so many times.
 And he said.
 (laughing)
 - It was called God Save the King then as well.
 - Yeah.
 - He was desperate pleading for some kind of skill.
 How many times have you listened to it?
 (laughing)
 - If that is for, he is like,
 I'm the person who has to hear this more than any of you.
 - That's true.
 - Please, can you sing it right?
 - But if he sings it, it's called God Save Me.
 - I'm sorry, that doesn't scam.
 - God save our gracious me.
 It was like Prince Philip's joke.
 He jokes that he's the world's best plaque on Vaila.
 - Oh yeah.
 - And there's a great cut of him saying it repeatedly.
 - It's still a good joke.
 - Anyway, he said that the opening section,
 you should set your metronome to 60.
 And then later on it goes down to 52.
 Well, that's pretty slow, that.
 (laughing)
 - What sort of as everyone loses energy?
 - No, no, that's always a big ending
 of an American national anthem.
 - No, you're talking about God Save Me.
 - I'm talking about God Save the King.
 - I'm sorry, I'm talking about God Save the King.
 - So the American national anthem was supposed to be quite,
 you know, conspirator with spirit
 was supposed to be kind of quite upbeat
 and whatever.
 Of course, these days, if you watch the Super Bowl,
 you can bet on how long it's gonna be
 and the average is usually about one minute,
 50 or something I think.
 - Is that slow?
 - Yeah.
 So they put loads of extra notes in like,
 they're on American Idol, don't they?
 (laughing)
 - Other things that are being played at the wrong tempo?
 - Oh yeah.
 - A lot of bait hoven.
 So this is a theory that bait hoven's metronome
 was broken.
 (laughing)
 - That just says like a sick bird from the review.
 I just, wait, so he wrote his songs at the wrong tempo?
 - No, he wrote them at the wrong tempo
 'cause his metronome was wrong.
 So this is some research that's been done by...
 - He's been by Brahms.
 (laughing)
 - Because he has...
 - He's not playing like, whoa, this is fast.
 - No, no, no, no, that's not...
 So he played it at a tempo that doesn't sound fast.
 But he ever went through a phase of writing
 pieces of music that are unplayably fast.
 So between 1850 and 1820, the timing that he writes,
 the time he says he should play it in
 is like unplayably fast, it's impossible.
 So no one plays it at that tempo
 and everyone thinks, well, why not, that he write this?
 It sounds awful.
 It's frantic and mad.
 And it turns out this guy called Peter Stadlin,
 who's a pianist, did some in-depth research
 and some mathematical analysis
 and worked out that the metronome he had
 was weighted slightly wrong.
 So Beethoven was just writing down the wrong stuff
 because his metronome was ticking wrong.
 So when his metronome was saying,
 yeah, you're playing a 60 beats a minute,
 he was actually playing at 90 beats a minute.
 - That is brilliant.
 - That's amazing to know he wrote to a metronome.
 I'd never...
 - Well, he actually owned the first ever metronome, I think,
 or he owned a metronome that was made
 by the inventor of the metronome.
 He was really excited by this new technology.
 Turns out it wasn't actually quite developed for the end.
 - I suppose it's plausible that you could have a pianist
 who writes music and all of his keys are out of tune
 and then when he writes it down,
 it's just a completely different tune
 to what he thought it was.
 Like every single time Beethoven thought
 he was writing Happy Birthday or something,
 but then his keys just kept going out of tune.
 - Do you think Beethoven's 9th is actually Happy Birthday?
 - Yeah.
 - Miss Written.
 - I don't really think that.
 - There's a really creepy ant colony
 that they've just discovered in Poland,
 which lives in old Soviet nuclear bunker.
 And basically, there's this Anson S on top of a ventilation pipe
 outlet that comes up from the nuclear bunker,
 but a lot of ants are falling through this ventilation pipe
 and they're falling into the bunker below,
 which is about three meters underground,
 and then they can't get out,
 so they can't climb up the walls and get back out.
 And they do what ants do, so they build nests
 and they operate as ants, but they have no food, obviously,
 so they die eventually, but they constantly are being replenished.
 So there's this deadly community where new ants keep falling
 down onto what is now about a few centimeters thick layer
 of their dead comrades, and then they just keep working
 and building at their nests, and they die,
 and then their stock is replenished.
 - Oh my god, that's like six sci-fi films.
 - It is, isn't it?
 - It sounds like a metaphor for the Soviet times.
 (laughs)
 - It does.
 I was thinking it's kind of like a metaphor for life, isn't it?
 - Yeah. - That's really just what we're doing.
 - Yeah, just falling into a life and dying
 on top of our dead comrades.
 - And on that note.
 (laughs)
 - In 1850, there's an article that I found it
 in the English Civil Engineer and Architects Journal,
 and it states that the Academy of Sciences in France
 was considering an idea for a suspension bridge
 between England and France, so going from Dove to Calais.
 Four barges would be sunk at equal distances
 apart across the channel, and then they'd have chains
 going up from the barges to the surface,
 and then the chains would be fixed to the bridge,
 which would run from England to France,
 and then above the bridge would be these huge balloons.
 It describes them as giant balloons of elliptical form
 and firmly secured, which would support in the air
 the extremity of these chains.
 In my head, I'm imagining it like the big red balls
 in total wipeout, and you could just bounce from balloon
 to balloon.
 - Now, I can see that working.
 What I think about those big plastic balls
 is they're in South America somewhere, aren't they?
 If mankind kind of collapses quite soon,
 and then all of the world just kind of becomes grown over
 by plants and stuff like that,
 they're made of plastic, so they won't really buy or degrade.
 So if aliens come along, all they'll see
 really is these big plastic things around.
 - No, no, I don't think that's true.
 - No, I think that's true.
 - If they landed in South America,
 all of the concrete and stuff would go before the plastic,
 surely.
 - But we've got a lot more plastic than just the balls
 that are used in this weird TV show.
 - Sure, sure, sure.
 But they'd probably think that that was the center
 of human civilization or something.
 This is where they built their greatest table.
 - Exactly, you were probably looking at it,
 and they probably, there may be north-south aligned
 or something like that, or they'd probably work out
 that they're aligned with the sun or something,
 and they think that it was a temple.
 - Yeah, although they think it's a model of the planners,
 they think it's an early human attempt
 to understand the solar system,
 and that the different sizes represent the different things.
 - They're all the same size, though.
 So they'd be like, you idiotic humans.
 - They thought that Mars and Jupiter were the same size.
 - Actually, James, you make a very compelling argument.
 Think of all the temples, the step pyramids in South America.
 Think of what game show they probably were.
 (all laughing)
 - And we're in Gladiators, they used to have a thing
 where you had to climb up a pyramid.
 - That was probably it.
 - Yeah. - Yeah.
 - You get to the top and at the top.
 You're sacrifice.
 (all laughing)
 - I think we all know that they'll assume
 the Disney plastic castle in Paris is our ultimate temple.
 - That's true.
 - We're gonna lose such a weird stuff behind it.
 I was reading an article the other day,
 about what happens first,
 when if all humans disappeared,
 the rough running order of how things wind down.
 (all laughing)
 It's fascinating,
 'cause it was talking about actually concrete
 last a lot less time than you would think,
 because freezing and thawing in, let's say, New York,
 actually in about 10 years,
 lots of plants will have grown
 in between the cracks in the concrete
 and it'll all be working loose.
 And actually, it's quite quickly that you end up with.
 - In 10 years?
 (all laughing)
 - It's like a bit more than that.
 - Well, I did think so.
 - 'Cause you know, just rebuild New York every 10 years today.
 - If I mean, if this is predicting the apocalypse
 and they're like, well, the concrete's gonna disappear
 in 10 years, that shouldn't have been headline.
 I can't believe they buried the news.
 - But it is a fair point, perhaps,
 that in 1,500 years or 2,000 years,
 that only the Disney Tower in Paris,
 the one in Disneyland, the one in Disney World,
 these are gonna be the only buildings left,
 'cause they made a plastic.
 - Yeah.
 - Are they made a plastic?
 (all laughing)
 - We assume.
 - Or just Wendy Houses.
 (all laughing)
 - Big wheel lift.
 - A tiny race of polypockets.
 (all laughing)
 - All the exhibits in their museums
 will be, you know, little Play-Mobile dolls and Lego people.
 (all laughing)
 We think that these were the life forms themselves
 frozen when they disaster came.
 - What are we talking about bridges?
 - You don't know.
 - Absolutely, you lost it.
 How does Dan keep this thing together?
 - So hard to know.
 - So much fun when teachers away.
 (all laughing)
 - They used to, in the medieval times,
 draw elephants with actual trumpets for trunks.
 - Did they?
 - Yeah.
 So the idea they think is not that they actually thought
 this was the case, but it was kind of an allegorical way
 of drawing.
 - It would be very weird if they thought
 it was like, if they'd seen an elephant
 and they saw a trumpet.
 - And the idea being that they did make loud noises
 and they thought their noises came from the trunks
 and the only way you can show them on a picture is
 by showing the trunk as natural trumpet.
 - Oh, cool.
 - And they think maybe a lot of medieval pictures
 are like this.
 They're more allegorical than actually literal.
 - Oh, that's kind of what I said,
 whenever you put anything that has notes coming out of it.
 Like, to symbolize music.
 - Yeah.
 - Like, a bit like that, yeah.
 - It's not a notation, it's not actually, yeah.
 - Yeah.
 - Wait, you said they thought that the noise came out
 of the trunks.
 - It does, doesn't it?
 - I don't know.
 - Yeah, they do.
 - It sounds very nasal, the noise.
 I think it comes out of the trunk.
 - Sure.
 - You're basing this off your own...
 - I just tried doing it, yeah.
 - And it sounded very elephant time
 when I did it out of the nose.
 - I think you're right.
 (laughing)
 - And now with the mouth?
 - Ha!
 It's not the same.
 - Actually, did you read about that woman?
 I think it was in this country.
 This week or last week, who ordered a takeaway,
 and she put a note on the takeaway,
 when it said, "Are there any delivery instructions?"
 Saying, "I feel so ill, I've got terrible flu.
 "Can't get out of bed, please.
 "Could you stop there chemist on the way
 "and bring me some Benadryl?
 "I don't even want the takeaway.
 "I'm only ordering this, so you can do that."
 (laughing)
 And so this restaurant brought her her medication.
 (laughing)
 - There was a Chinese restaurant near me
 that used to deliver cigarettes as well.
 So people just used to order a bag of prawn crackers
 and tin boxes of cigarettes.
 (laughing)
 I've got a whole business school who did a study
 and came up with this thing called the Ikea effect,
 which is that you place more value on Ikea
 for self-assembled furniture, which is what Ikea furniture used for you.
 - Yeah, because you made it yourself.
 - Yeah, and you kind of get attached to it
 and fall in love with it as you're building.
 And then by the end of it, you've got a shitty book,
 so it doesn't really stand out right, but you use yours.
 - But you fall in love with it.
 Is that, I think that's--
 - He said fall in love with those at his will, that's not why.
 - All right, okay.
 Because that would be like a good argument
 in favor of a robotic wife, for instance, that you build yourself--
 - Oh, yeah.
 - Or a Lego wife.
 - Yeah, either of those.
 - But she's too tiny for you.
 - She will be tiny.
 (laughing)
 - You get massive Lego people, though, don't you?
 - Do you?
 - Yeah, Lego Latin, Lego Latin.
 - Not like a Lego Latin.
 - But you'd have to get married at Lego Latin, wouldn't you?
 But I think if you're going as far as getting a Lego wife,
 I think that's probably not an issue.
 - No, it's gonna be like, no, it's not really my scene.
 (laughing)
 - You've put on a lot of bricks since we married.
 (laughing)
 - Have you guys ever heard of the National Fruit Collection?
 - No.
 - I saw this, I was reading about apples, and I just saw it.
 And I've never heard of it, so I don't know anything about it,
 apart from what I saw in this article.
 But apparently it's in Brockdale in Kent,
 and they have a living collection of apples,
 presumably old trees.
 They have 2,300 traditional varieties of apple.
 - Wow.
 - Really?
 - Apparently they get 40,000 visitors a year.
 - That's so cool.
 So you get a chance to taste all those varieties
 that have gone out of public use.
 - Isn't that the name of said you can eat them?
 - Yeah, I know, I'm not sure if you're allowed to eat them.
 (laughing)
 - I don't know.
 - I'm assuming it's like anything in a museum.
 - The National Fruit Collection was demolishing this scene.
 (laughing)
 - It's not hearing, there's a zoo,
 with the most rare and fun-looking animals in all the world.
 And you can try all of them in our restaurant.
 - You're the reason they don't have the,
 please don't eat the penguins I know.
 (laughing)
 - Yeah, but isn't that cool?
 Apparently it's been this, it's 1952,
 and I've never heard of it.
 - I really want to go and visit that, that sounds so fun.
 - I found it, I think we should visit actually.
 - Yeah, let's go.
 - Let's go.
 - Cool.
 - If you're listening to this and you work
 at the National Fruit Collection,
 why not invite us?
 (laughing)
 - Give us a discount.
 - Do you know what was the company that was a huge boon
 for Apple eating in the world over the last 15 years?
 - Strong boon.
 - Close, but they're major in Apple drinking.
 - Apple eating, is it an Apple Tart company?
 - Like Mr. Kippling.
 - It is not Mr. Kippling.
 The answer is, oh, I think we can get it.
 - I know, I know.
 - So I'll give you some clues.
 - I can lolly company, it was like a flavoring thing.
 - Smoothie makers.
 - I'll give you some clues.
 - I will give you some clues.
 - So, basically, when sliced apples started being a thing,
 consumption suddenly went massively up.
 - Sorry, I missed that memo.
 - That sliced apples are fake.
 - I have one of my lunch box.
 Pretty much every day of school.
 - I'm still stuck on avocado toast.
 (laughing)
 - You know, when you buy Apple in the supermarket,
 some people do, and it's sliced, and it's in a packet.
 - I didn't know of that, no.
 - Have you never seen those in the food section?
 - I have seen that.
 I think it's very weird.
 - I've never met anyone who's done this,
 but you can go to McDonald's and exchange your fries
 for sliced apples or carrots.
 - Oh, those.
 - That's right, why?
 - You can't see that.
 - It's the McDonald's, Emma.
 - There you go.
 (laughing)
 - I can't even, I wasn't told you, I get points.
 There are no points.
 - Well, I'm gonna wear this out, what you just said.
 (laughing)
 - It is McDonald's, so they introduced sliced apples
 in the 1980s into their restaurant fair.
 I think it was the 1980s.
 And overall, Apple consumption tripled within 10 years.
 And it's because children, especially,
 but all of us, we are more willing to eat more of an apple.
 If it's sliced, it's just easier to eat.
 And Apple consumption shoots up.
 And it's also really helped in schools across Britain.
 - People before that were just having
 one bite of an apple and throwing it away, weren't they?
 - But I think it's also, as I'm partly to the,
 just the size of McDonald's as a franchise,
 because when they started giving away free books
 on in Happy Meals one year,
 they became the largest literary producer
 in the world for a lifetime.
 - Literacy tripled in America.
 (laughing)
 - Yeah, so it's 10% of apples sold in the US
 are of sliced apples sold in the US up from McDonald's.
 - But exactly the same thing happened in the UK
 when they introduced them into schools.
 Then Apple consumption went up by almost 100%.
 - Wow, easy in schools though,
 'cause they can just make you eat stuff.
 - Oh, sorry.
 - But they tried to make you eat full apples
 and it didn't work.
 And then when you get sliced apples.
 - I had an apple this morning.
 - Did you?
 - And I'm amazed at my bravery in getting through it
 without having it sliced for me.
 (laughing)
 James has an apple peeling machine by his desk.
 - I do, I've never used it.
 I bought it for QI because for the opening show,
 I was gonna put it in there as a weird opening thing
 and then I bought it and everyone went,
 "That's not weird."
 - Everyone has one of those.
 - I think you can have one.
 - What the hell?
 I've never heard of that.
 Does it actually work?
 - It looks like a little torture device.
 It's made of metal and you basically skewer the apple
 and you put it on a skewer and then you turn it
 so it's being like spit roasted, essentially.
 And then there's a kind of little arm that comes down
 with a little knife on it and you sort of turn it
 and it peels it off the, it takes off the peel
 like a little big, big little spiral.
 - It's also for oranges.
 - I only really like an apple on a skewer
 when it's got a suckling pig wrapped around it.
 (laughing)
 - So there is a shaving brush manufacturer
 around at the moment called Penn Halligan's.
 I think they're quite an old,
 an old one with a lot of history.
 On their website, they're asked,
 "Do you use badger hair on your shaving brushes?"
 And they say, "Yes, we do."
 But they take them from parts of the world
 where badgers are not endangered
 and in fact are primarily farmed for their meat.
 - Wow, that's good.
 - And I don't know where that is
 'cause I can't see really many places in the world
 where they farm badgers for meat.
 (laughing)
 But presumably they must do.
 - Well, I was on a forum.
 I think it was a Gillette forum about whether the badger hair
 on brushes was ethically farmed
 and they got theirs from China.
 So I think it was Gillette wrote a really good email
 saying, "You know, we make sure that we source
 only the most ethical badger hair."
 - So do you think they farm badger for meat in China?
 Maybe they do. - Maybe.
 - They used to eat badger in Europe
 and old European recipes for badger would tell you
 to lay it in running water for several days
 to get rid of its rink of flavor.
 - Several days.
 (laughing)
 - You just have to tie it up in the river, I guess.
 - Yeah.
 - But rink flavor is a lot of the most.
 (laughing)
 Or just eat beef.
 - Well badgers, they don't make a noise though.
 Do they?
 - Do they not?
 - Well, do they?
 - They must.
 - Yeah, depending on what you do to them.
 (laughing)
 - Old McDonald had a badger, EIO.
 - Yes. - With a...
 - What?
 - Do they?
 - I don't know, do they fuff like ferrets do?
 Like fuff?
 - Maybe. - I don't like that.
 I imagine squealing.
 I reckon they squeal if you run away.
 (laughing)
 - That'd be a great quiz, by the way.
 Just sing the old McDonald's song
 and put in a new animal and the person has to respond
 and if they're wrong, they're out of the quiz.
 - That is good.
 - How many animals can you get down the line?
 - Big ships.
 - Yeah.
 - The sea-wise giant is pretty much the biggest ship.
 I think it is the biggest.
 It's longer than the Empire State Building is tall.
 - Wow.
 - It goes at about 16.5 knots, which is about 30 kilometers an hour
 and it's stopping distance is nine kilometers.
 - Nine kilometers?
 - Wow.
 - If it's going at that speed.
 And it's turning circle in clear weather is three kilometers.
 - So that's like, imagine we're standing outside our office
 facing south and we wanted to face north.
 We had to go all the way around to around
 where Madame Tussauds is, before we were facing north.
 - Wow.
 We're like quite close to Trafalgar Square, aren't we?
 - Imagine in an emergency, like in the way you would in a car
 hitting the brakes on a boat, but nine kilometers away.
 Because if you did it just one kilometer too late,
 you'd be like, we're screwed.
 - We just have to watch ourselves plow into this island.
 - I have a fact about banning songs and rude songs.
 - Okay.
 - So it's about parental advisory lyrics.
 You know that sticker that you see on albums?
 Do you know who those are partly thanks to?
 You may do.
 - Can I actually have a genuine guest?
 - Cypress Hill, or now one of the early people to have it.
 - Okay, that's not what I've got, although that might be part of the NWA.
 - Is it a rap group?
 - It's Al Gore's wife.
 (laughing)
 - I thought you were close.
 - Is she part of a rap group?
 - Yeah, she is, yeah.
 No, she was listening to Prince with her young daughter.
 And she heard some very explicit lyrics.
 They were things like, I guess you could say she was a sex fiend.
 I met her in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine.
 And she was very angry about this because she was listening
 with her daughter and she thought it was very inappropriate.
 So she wrote a book called Raising PG Kids in an X-rated Society.
 And as part of this drive, she set up the parents music
 that was all sent to.
 And they released the list of artists called The Filthy 15.
 So this contributed to the rise of the parental advisory.
 - Filthy 15 is a great name.
 - Yeah, it's equal to the dirty dozen.
 (laughing)
 - But there was an album once that got a parental advisory label
 in spite of the fact that it was completely instrumental.
 - Why?
 - Did it have sex noises?
 - No, it didn't, no, it was completely instrumental.
 It's by Frank Zapper, it's a Frank Zapper album.
 It was called G-Spot tornado.
 (laughing)
 - What are the other bits of trivia from the movie Twister?
 It was because there's a cow which goes through at some point.
 - Yeah.
 - That was a sort of early CGI cow.
 - Supposedly, I haven't backed this up yet though.
 Supposedly, that cow was originally one of the zebras
 from Jumanji.
 (laughing)
 - That's quite a career change, is there?
 I tried to be typecast it as a zebra.
 (laughing)
 - I also like that you say I haven't backed this up yet.
 Like, as soon as we stop this podcast,
 you're gonna be out there.
 - I think this zebra's CV, it says,
 oh, it says here you can also do cow.
 (laughing)
 - You need two zebra's, one in the front
 and one in the back of the cow.
 (laughing)
 Yeah, no, you're right.
 After every podcast and I go through verifying everything.
 (laughing)
 - What did they, what do you mean by that?
 Did they paint the stripes off the zebra
 or did they paint stripes onto a zebra for Jumanji?
 - I think maybe, 'cause Jumanji came out first,
 maybe they had the design of a zebra going round
 in a tornado.
 - Yeah, and so they just use that footage,
 not the footage, but you don't, I mean,
 that little computer generator thing to be the cow.
 I don't, as I say, have them backed it up yet.
 Gonna do it as soon as the podcast ends.
 - So my friend, Dan, who works in CGI,
 told me he, a fact, he learned to London film school.
 And again, I haven't been able to back this up.
 So possibly if someone CGI is listening,
 - If you guys have thought of your research
 before the podcast, I'm pretty sure that would be ideal.
 - No, but this is, it's one of those things
 where it's been said, but don't know where the proof is.
 Any time CGI's been used, I don't know if it's now,
 but let's say movies of the last 10 years,
 roughly the last, maybe five years predominantly,
 CGI has been using, if they have a person in it,
 they've been using Brad Pitt.
 Because when Benjamin Button was made,
 they made a full DNA, as it were,
 CGI of Brad Pitt, the full motion of him.
 And rather than needing to replicate that,
 you just use that.
 So the company that built that sells Brad Pitt
 to all these different movies that need a body.
 - That's cool, CGI.
 - You can use all the different ages of man as well.
 - Exactly.
 So theoretically, in World War Z, the zombie film,
 would all the zombies that they used
 have also been Brad Pitt.
 - Wow.
 - I hope they paid him well for that.
 (all laughing)
 - I bet they did.
 (all laughing)
 - What if someone really overweight or something?
 Was there a bit in Benjamin Buttonway,
 put on lots of weight?
 - Two Brad Pitt's.
 - One of the proofs, what in the back?
 (all laughing)
 Have you seen the new thing that Ikea is doing
 where they're using augmented reality?
 This is pretty cool.
 So if you wanna get, let's say you wanna get a sofa
 and you wanna have it in your front room,
 but you wanna know what it looks like,
 they've got a new app where you can take a photo of your room,
 and then you can kind of augment a sofa
 in the place where it would be.
 So you can see what the room would look like
 with that sofa.
 - That is so cool.
 - That's amazing.
 - Clever, isn't it?
 - 'Cause they already had, they had like,
 a build your own kitchen in your website.
 It was like a budget version of the Sims
 but without the people in it, which had hours of fun.
 - We did that for our new house, it was amazing.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - We didn't go with them at the end.
 - But we've got pictures of what it might've looked like.
 - This thing, you've got a happy ending
 if you think it's public kitchen,
 whereas I'm just like, well, I can't do this.
 (all laughing)
 - Don't ask the owner anywhere for the kitchen to see.
 - Ah, but there is a video game as well.
 You'll love this then.
 It's basically a, it simulates you building Ikea furniture
 but on a computer and there's no end to it.
 You know, you don't win.
 - No, you just, you don't even end up with the furniture.
 - No, yeah, and the idea is that it basically simulates
 the frustration of what it's like to build Ikea furniture
 and you can do it with up to four friends.
 It's a game called Home Improvisation.
 So Home Improvisation.
 (all laughing)
 - Thanks for the translation, dad.
 - What language are you from?
 - I googled that, turns out it translates as Home Improvisation.
 And it lets you, yeah, basically through virtual reality,
 exactly what you're doing, Alex.
 So if you want to build stuff outside of kitchens,
 that's there for you.
 - That's fine.
 - There is a thing that's happening at the moment.
 People keep having sleepovers in Ikea shops and Ikea.
 I'm not relaxed about it.
 They are really annoying.
 - Well, surely they could just stop people
 like as in kick them out.
 - Well, people go in and they hide in cupboards at the end.
 - So they can't go through at the end of every working day
 checking every cupboard in the shop.
 - There's an old status and there's something like,
 it might be 1% as well of people in Europe
 were conceived in an Ikea bed.
 - So you're one in ten.
 - One in ten is it, wow.
 And were they all in the shop?
 (laughing)
 - Somebody filmed the soap opera set entirely in Ikea
 and they did it without Ikea's knowledge
 and yeah, it was a web series.
 Yeah.
 - That's amazing.
 - That's awesome.
 So they were in the physical shop
 that they just never staffed, never called onto.
 They were always filming with sort of handheld cameras
 and things and presumably they must have got asked
 to leave a few times,
 but isn't they filmed in an entire web series?
 And you know, it was just they were just like living
 in the holes and so on.
 - Oh, 'cause yeah, 'cause if it's a kitchen set,
 yeah, they're like doing a set.
 - I think the only other thing is that in every scene
 you've got random people walking around your house
 and just like, you're picking up your kids
 and you're tensed up and taking them away.
 - So the whole concept of the sitcom
 has to be about a place where you live
 where there's a lot of burglars.
 - Yeah.
 (laughing)
 - Do you know if we ever said that when Nelson died
 and he famously had a hardy next to him
 and cradling him and his arms
 and the person who wrote the account
 who was there at the time said that,
 Nelson said kiss me hardy and then hardy kissed him.
 And then we ever mentioned that for about 80 years
 during the Victorian era, that story was changed
 so that he said kiss me hardy
 because they were too squeamish
 about the idea of two men kissing each other
 and kiss me was a Turkish for fate.
 And so they said that he'd said kiss me hardy.
 And this guy must have misheard it.
 No one would have said kiss me hardy.
 - Why do you say kiss me hardy?
 Isn't that?
 (laughing)
 'Cause he wasn't a fake pirate.
 - Right.
 - It's a missed opportunity, I think.
 - I bet hardy got a load of those jokes
 all the way through his name.
 - Yeah.
 - But if the story was that Nelson said kiss me hardy,
 how do they explain away the bit where hardy
 then kisses me?
 (laughing)
 Do they say, oh Nelson said, oh get off me you weirdo.
 (laughing)
 - Can I throw in one Nixon fact before we move on?
 Can anyone tell me what Richard Nixon's middle name
 is Mill House?
 - Yeah, it's a Mill House.
 - Yeah, so it is Mill House.
 However, I'm gonna put forward the reviewed fact
 that it's in fact a double barrel surname.
 - Okay.
 - Because it is his mother's maiden name.
 Mill House was his mum.
 - Okay.
 - So he took that on and I would say that that's not a--
 - That's quite, so my brother has the same thing
 with my mother's maiden name.
 That's quite common.
 And I would say that's not double barrelled
 because it's not the mother's name anymore, is it?
 - Well, it can still be her name.
 She might, yeah.
 - What's her name still Mill House?
 - I don't know, but it's taken
 because it's his mother's maiden name.
 - Interesting.
 - Yeah, I just, I didn't know that connection in any case.
 - It's a huge, huge news if true though,
 that Richard Nixon's middle name isn't Mill House.
 It might just be a part of it, sir.
 - Yeah, well that's what I'm trying to put forward here, yeah.
 - It is a relatively common thing.
 I think especially in Scotland, they do that a lot, don't they?
 - They use mothers maiden name for middle names.
 - I don't.
 - If that is took correct,
 then there will presumably a lot of times
 his name has been carved into stone,
 but they're gonna have to go back
 and do a really botched squeeze
 of the word Mill House into it.
 I don't know how many times his name's been written in stone.
 (laughing)
 - Yeah, that's true.
 - I mean, he's not, I don't think he's one
 of Mount Rushmar, is he Nixon?
 (laughing)
 - No, no.
 - But it should be a shit rush more with Andrew Jackson
 and Nixon and you know--
 - Calvin Coolidge.
 - Calvin Coolidge, Trump, yeah.
 - That's just another thing about his name.
 He was named after a British king.
 So there's a thought that his family tree actually goes back
 and he descends from King Edward III of England.
 That's a sort of an idea that was put out there.
 But he's named after Richard the Lionheart
 and he is one of four brothers
 and all of them also carry English king names.
 - Really?
 - Yeah. - What do you have the names?
 - Well, there are only about three other names.
 - Sorry, sorry, three of them carried it
 and then there was Francis who was name of his dad,
 who carried his dad's name.
 - Isn't rich the Lionheart far back enough
 that everyone is directly descended from him?
 I think he is.
 I think Edward III is.
 So everyone on earth is directly descended.
 - What?
 - 'Cause everyone in Britain,
 everyone pretty much everyone in Western Europe's.
 - But everyone in America as well, 'cause--
 - But Danny Dyer did who do you think you are
 and they found that he is related to Edward III
 and it's this huge story.
 And actually, the odds of him not being related,
 it would have been an amazing new story
 if he had not been related to Edward III.
 - I don't think that's gonna sell many papers, is it?
 - Danny Dyer, they're not related to it.
 - By the odds, the odds are that 99% of everyone
 is related to Edward III.
 It's suddenly a very interesting story.
 - I see that, but then people don't usually go
 much past their headlines, are they?
 - And if their headline is Danny Dyer,
 isn't related to Edward III.
 But that's an interesting story
 because the odds of 99% that he would be.
 I'm my newspaper, it's gonna have very long headlines
 that are really short articles.
 - Country music has the most intelligent lyrics, apparently,
 because one of the measures,
 which sounds like not a great measure,
 is the number of syllables in words.
 And it doesn't have filler words,
 so you don't get a lot of, oh yeah, yeah, oh,
 you know, that kind of stuff you get.
 - I see what you mean.
 - But if you say that the most advanced songs,
 are the ones with more syllables,
 then the most advanced song in history
 is Supercalifragilistique Spialidosius.
 - Yeah, it takes years of study to understand that.
 (laughing)
 The study example the study used was,
 country music uses more syllables,
 using words such as cigarettes,
 tackle box and hillbilly.
 - tackle box.
 (laughing)
 - Apparently.
 So that's too advanced for an eight-year-old, obviously.
 - Yeah, fair enough.
 - Also on Too Big To Fit,
 I googled Too Big To Fit and Dwayne, The Rock Johnson,
 is Too Big To Fit in a lot of the cars
 in the latest Fast and the Furious.
 - Wow.
 - So there is an interview with him
 and they're asking him why you always in trucks
 not in the little cars,
 and he's like, "I'm too big to fit in there."
 - Oh my God.
 - Wow.
 - That makes sense, yeah.
 - You should drill a hole in the ceiling or something.
 Is he too tall or too?
 - He's very muscular.
 - He's muscular, yeah.
 - But that is extraordinary.
 - He's good that, isn't it?
 - Could they have an adapted one
 where he's just got one seat in the middle,
 so there's not a two-seater?
 - I guess they could, although they'd have to write that
 into the story line of the film.
 - Yeah.
 - What story line there is in the film?
 (laughing)
 If you wanna collect semen from Macax, it's quite hard.
 - Macax.
 - Macax, little primates, little monkey things.
 - Oh yeah.
 - What they used to do is they would stimulate
 their genitals with electricity.
 Sometimes a little weak jolt,
 but it would make them ejaculate.
 But one researcher realized that actually
 they were ejaculating quite a lot anyway,
 because they do it like four times an hour
 or something like that.
 - Wow.
 - Yeah, they average four times an hour ejaculating
 when they're just having fun and just on their own.
 - Watch all the time.
 - Not for the rest of the time.
 - Not for the rest of the time.
 - But whether it's sleep now, it just keeps going.
 (laughing)
 But do they ejaculate 40 times a day?
 You know?
 - Yeah, I think they do.
 - I'm seeing on, so what I'm seeing here
 on this bit of paper is on the island,
 the male's masturbate on average four times an hour.
 So that's on average four times an hour.
 They could have some better hours than that.
 - In a good hour.
 - And so what she realized this researcher is what she could do
 is just kind of hang around,
 'cause it happens so frequently.
 And then when it happens, just quickly get in there
 with the pipette and suck it up.
 And she does that.
 The main problem being that they often lick the ground
 or their hands clean before she can get close
 because semen happens to be highly nutritious
 and they don't want to waste the nutrients.
 - Devious, devious mechanics.
 - Yeah, they all randy though, they're randy.
 Um, you can have so many more times an hour.
 - Yeah, they'd like to masturbate.
 - Look, we all like to masturbate,
 but they should get a job.
 (laughing)
 - You know when crocodiles die,
 they bloat and float.
 They're bloaters and floaters.
 Because of all these gasses being released,
 they keep them afloat.
 And they float for over a month without thinking.
 - Wow.
 - So I don't understand why we don't see crocodiles
 floating down.
 - Well, we must do.
 - We must do.
 - Maybe we do in countries with crocodiles.
 - Just think they're lugs.
 - Yeah.
 - Or crocodiles because they're very stealth, aren't they?
 - That's true.
 - They're very stealthy.
 - They don't do much movement.
 So if you saw one going like that,
 you'd think, oh, he's on a cheeky mission.
 - Cockroaches go on the back, don't they?
 When they die, famously.
 - Oh, yes.
 - Yeah.
 - The reason being that they have long legs for an insect
 and they have a high sensor of gravity.
 The sensor of gravity is quite near that bone kind of thing.
 And as they get older,
 they kind of start to get weighed down to their bump side.
 And then when they kind of eventually die,
 they flip over and they don't have enough energy
 in their arms.
 They don't have enough strength in their legs
 to put them back over.
 And the same thing happens if you give them kind of pesticides,
 they spasm and they'll flip over
 and then they won't have the energy left
 in their legs to flip them back.
 - So they're flipping over their head.
 They're not rolling over sideways.
 - They're flipping over vertically
 because their bones weigh down.
 - Exactly, they do that flip.
 - Well, I don't know if it's exactly like that.
 It could be a slightly sideways, slightly back flippy thing.
 I don't know about that.
 But basically, you're walking around with a heavy bump
 and as you get older, you're less able to deal with it.
 - We know it feels.
 - Tortuses have that same problem.
 - Do they?
 - Obviously, they've got round shells.
 But they have this really weird balancing act
 that they need to strike
 because bigger animals obviously do better
 because they're stronger and they can fight other males
 and they can compete more.
 But also, if they get too big,
 a bigger shell means that it's hard to write yourself again.
 So you have all the advantages of being big,
 but if you lose one fight
 and you then get rolled over onto your back,
 it's much likely that you won't be able to
 write yourself again.
 - Oh, yeah.
 - It's a trade-off.
 - It's basically putting all your eggs in one basket.
 It'll be really big.
 There's a really interesting thing about tortoises
 which we covered on QI years and years ago.
 And that is that it's possible to invent a shape
 that you put it on a table
 and it always flips over to a certain side.
 - I just chewed to the shape of the thing.
 It's felt like a gumbok,
 but I think it's pronounced more like gumbots.
 Anyway, so this shape has been invented by computer scientists
 and it took us decades to do it
 and they managed to do it through using computers.
 But tortoises, some tortoises have this exact same shape.
 And so if they flip over,
 they naturally kind of roll back onto their feet.
 - Oh wow.
 - That's so cool.
 - That's awesome.
 Was the inventor of the gumbok inspired by totals
 or with tortoises, or is that?
 - I believe he was.
 I've met him and I can't remember.
 - Oh, was it vice versa?
 You're going to watch the turtles?
 We went to one of his shows and thought, guys,
 we should try that.
 - Yeah, I was so proud of myself
 for not finishing the set so you can clearly do
 where I was going with that.
 I was like, no, 'cause James started talking.
 I thought, ah, that looks like a clever question now.
 - I wasn't gonna let him save you.
 - Diamonds are the hardest substance in the world.
 I read a, whoop, they're not James.
 - James is in diesel.
 - In diesel.
 - They're not, what is that?
 - They're the hardest naturally occurrence.
 - Sorry, that's what I meant to say.
 Yes, the hardest naturally occurrence substance.
 You can't scratch a diamond,
 except with another diamond you can.
 - Yeah.
 - So you can scratch a diamond with a diamond.
 - That's what it means.
 - That's what hardness means in this sense.
 It means that you can scratch something with something.
 - So hardness is whether something can be scratched
 and toughness is whether it shatters into a thousand pieces
 if you hit it with something.
 So diamonds, because the layers of carbon are very tough,
 you know, internally, but do you hit it with a hammer?
 Bang, smash it.
 - Right.
 - So don't try that.
 - Don't do that.
 - Yeah.
 - And that's, I think we may have said this before,
 that's what traders used to do.
 If someone had mined a diamond,
 there was someone's group, there's people who'd say,
 well, okay, let's have a look.
 And we'll just give it a quick test to see
 if it's a real diamond.
 I'll just hit it with this hammer, bang, smash it.
 And then he says, I'm so sorry,
 it wasn't a real diamond after all.
 It was something else.
 - But I'll keep the shards.
 - I'll keep the shards and I'll pay you a nominal sum
 for them.
 I'll pay you a tiny bit to keep yourself going, you know?
 And then they'd just sell off a load of smaller diamonds.
 - A very clever.
 - Very clever, yeah.
 - Or you could groom back together
 and make a bigger diamond again.
 - Oh god.
 - I think that's where the imperfections come in.
 - Come on down to Hannah's shitty diamond store.
 (all laughing)
 We got loads of rubbish diamonds full of glue.
 (all laughing)
 - I've got some stuff on quarantine.
 - Oh, right.
 - Yeah.
 Comes from the Italian for 40.
 Quarantee, which...
 - Because you used to have to stay 40 days in quarantine.
 - Yeah, that makes sense.
 - Incubation period of the Black Death
 supposedly.
 - Oh, okay.
 - They put astronauts in quarantine.
 - That's right.
 - When they come back down.
 Do you know why?
 - Yeah, because of radiation and in case in space
 they were given some sort of flu disease.
 It was to do with diseases, wasn't it?
 - Well, it is a little bit.
 - Aliens with smallpox.
 - Yeah, so you might think if you were a sci-fi fan
 that it was to stop alien diseases coming to Earth.
 But it's actually because their immune system
 is lessened due to them being in space.
 So when they come back down, they need to go in quarantine
 so they don't pick up bugs on Earth.
 - Is that so amazing?
 - Technically that you're putting the entire rest
 of the world in quarantine.
 - Yeah.
 - Yes.
 - That's just true of all quarantine.
 Just flip around the exit mentions.
 - That's fine.
 (laughing)
 - Yeah, I suppose that is true.
 - There was, you know, just picking up on that quickly.
 When the Apollo 11 astronauts came down,
 they had to do that.
 They had to be in quarantine in this room
 where they had a sort of kitchen in there
 and living quarters and so on.
 They had to stay in there for ages
 before they could do any of their parades around the world.
 - Wow.
 - And what ended up happening was if a scientist accidentally
 kind of was infected as it were with the room
 that they were kept in because they were delivering stuff
 and so on, I guess, in suits.
 - And then it was for possible space cooties, wasn't it?
 - Yes, yes.
 Those scientists then had to move in with them.
 So there was a whole batch of people
 that subtly got, or might have been infected.
 So therefore needed to be quarantined.
 - It's people came along to give them some food
 and they got infected.
 - Exactly.
 - It's like a horror film.
 It's like, oh, where's Sarah?
 I better go and find out.
 Oh no, what's Bernard gone now?
 - It's a bit like a game of sardines.
 - It is, it is, exactly.
 And there was a suggestion, and I'm not saying this is true,
 but there was a suggestion that some of the people
 who accidentally had to go into the quarantine
 looked like ladies of the night,
 who made their way into there and had to live out.
 - I don't even know what the implication you're making is.
 - Prostitutes.
 - Was it postitutes?
 - No, 'cause it's back on Earth now.
 (laughing)
 - And also, space prostitutes don't exist.
 - Oh yeah, it's like, yeah.
 - But it was another time, wasn't it, the '60s?
 - Yeah.
 - I mean, it literally was, yes, to you know.
 (laughing)
 - I looked at some skillful number people,
 and I was looking at like the world record
 for memorizing numbers and stuff like that.
 - Okay.
 - And the world record for most digits memorized
 in one minute has two different sections,
 one with the light on and one with the light off.
 'Cause apparently, it's miles easier when the lights off.
 - That makes sense, 'cause there's no distractions.
 - I guess so, right?
 But you can close your eyes.
 - How do you see the number to memorize?
 (laughing)
 - Maybe that's another reason.
 But yeah, maybe you're allowed a little torch
 or something, I don't know.
 - All right.
 - But perhaps I'll give you an audio recording of it.
 - Maybe, I don't know.
 So this is for binary digits, so it's zeros and ones.
 - Okay, the one, the specific one I'm looking at.
 And the record for most zeros and ones memorized
 in one minute with the light on is 107.
 With the light off, it's 273.
 - Oh, wow.
 - Isn't that amazing?
 That makes that much difference.
 - That's incredible.
 - So all mass exams should be held in the dark, shouldn't they?
 - I guess so, if they were all in binary.
 (laughing)
 - Mine, mine are worse.
 (laughing)
 - Did you just quickly one thing on chocolate?
 I think it's quite funny.
 Bernie Madoff, remember him, is now running a chocolate racket
 in prison.
 So... - Who's he again, sorry?
 - You know, he's the guy who...
 - He ran a massive Ponzi screen, didn't he?
 - Ponzi screen.
 (laughing)
 Yeah, so he was a business man who it turned out
 was stealing lots of people's investments.
 So he got millions and millions of pounds
 and stole lots of money.
 And he's running this chocolate racket.
 And in prison in America now, he's really respected
 'cause he stole a more money than anyone else in there.
 So he wrote this letter to his daughter
 saying he's quite the celebrity in there.
 Other inmates treat him like a mafia don
 and call him Uncle Bernie.
 I can't walk anywhere without people shouting their greetings
 and encouragement.
 It's really quite sweet.
 And he's brought up all the chocolate in the prison.
 And now he runs this racket
 where the only person you can get it from is him.
 And so he makes a big profit.
 - How's it work?
 'Cause it sounds like that should be illegal, right?
 - Hi.
 - It's unusual to have people committing
 a very similar crime in prison
 to the one they were put in there.
 - Yeah.
 - And then to announce it, I mean,
 do prison guards not read news or?
 - But that's not illegal.
 - It's not illegal.
 - No, what, just to buy up to get in there first
 and buy up all the stuff so you can sell it
 on for a profit, that's okay.
 - It's immoral.
 - Right.
 - It's a bit of a monopoly, but I don't think there's
 like anti-monopoly rules in prisons.
 - It's touting.
 - It is touting, yeah.
 - Okay.
 - Well, good luck to him.
 I think that's what you're saying.
 - Couldn't have happened to a nice guy.
 - God, I'd love to know where the boxes are
 from, Dealer, no deal.
 (laughing)
 - Your notice, I said nothing in that whole bit
 'cause I was busy thinking,
 "Gaddy, yeah, did they wear no diamonds
 "just got them in his house?"
 - Yeah.
 He probably, I reckon he uses them to wrap Christmas presents.
 - That would be such a good idea if he doesn't
 and he's listening.
 - But that's a great Christmas present.
 So you unwrap it.
 There's a box, you open the boxes, nothing inside.
 And you're like, oh, this is terrible.
 And he says, actually, it's one of the boxes
 from Dealer, no deal.
 And you're like, that's the best present ever,
 no-leadment and Christmas is saved.
 - Hmm, yeah.
 - I would be still unhappy with Dealer, no deal.
 - Box is my Christmas present, just the two of you
 who's thinking about it.
 - If it was a real one that was used on the show.
 - I really intentionally did not want that as a present.
 - Great.
 (laughing)
 I'm sure someone else will have it.
 - Yeah, I bought it now.
 - Sorry, no, we thought she'd love it.
 - Or he might use it for storage.
 - Yeah.
 - Or if he goes shopping, putting his shopping in the boxes.
 - Yeah, he just goes everywhere.
 If you look at every phone of him these days,
 he's actually got a box with him.
 - If he gets fired, once he got fired from a job,
 do you think he'd clear this desk in those boxes?
 - Yeah, when he got cats or, yeah.
 - Yeah, how do you move in there?
 Has he put handles on them or wheels?
 - Yeah, 'cause they don't have handles today.
 - No, very easy to carry.
 - How many items of check-in luggage really have today?
 So I've got 15.
 (laughing)
 - I read a thing.
 There's a basketball player called Jimmy Butler.
 He plays for the Chicago Bulls.
 I think he's just been traded, but I'm not sure to wear.
 But he, I read it article, this is the, in the headline,
 it says that Jimmy Butler took out his car rear-view mirror
 as a reminder to never look back.
 (laughing)
 - That was awesome.
 - It was promptly arrested.
 (laughing)
 - Have you heard of the North American Walnut Sphinx caterpillar?
 - No, that's a goody.
 (laughing)
 It pretends to be a bird to freak birds out.
 - A bird's freak's out to other birds.
 - Yeah.
 (laughing)
 - That's one thing they most used to.
 (laughing)
 They used to hang it around with birds.
 - Sorry, I should clarify.
 - They make a noise like a freaked out bird.
 - Oh, no.
 - I'll just scare the other incoming birds away.
 - Exactly, so what they do, it's amazing.
 They, to make the noise, they have not quite lungs
 in the sense that we understand they have these holes
 along their sides called spiracles, exactly.
 And to make the noise, they squeeze themselves shut
 like an accordion.
 (laughing)
 It's amazing.
 And that, when they do that, it makes a noise that goes,
 "Eee!"
 And it sounds exactly like a bird's alarm call saying,
 "There is a bird of prey nearby,"
 or, "Get out of here, we're under attack."
 And so the other birds all fly off as soon as
 this caterpillar makes a noise.
 - No, they do it to scare the birds away.
 - They do it to scare the birds away,
 because the birds would prey on them.
 - Is that, is that evolution or is that coincidence
 at the note, the specific note?
 - That's everything's evolution, doesn't it?
 - Yeah.
 (laughing)
 - That's what we all are, the product of.
 - What was the other option,
 of it that could even happen?
 - Coincidence.
 - Coincidence.
 (laughing)
 - Well, yeah.
 It could be evolution by coincidence.
 - Yeah, at least, it probably started as a bit of a coincidence.
 - That's what I was looking at.
 - But that's how evolution works.
 Evolution always starts as a coincidence,
 which then evolves into being a pattern.
 - That's it.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 (laughing)
 - No, but if you were an animal
 and you were living on the Galapagos
 and the trees were too high,
 and the leaves were too high on the tree,
 it's not coincidence for you to grow your neck to try and...
 - Yes, it is.
 It's a coincidence that there was someone
 who was born with a really long neck.
 - No, but don't you grow your neck?
 - No, oh my god.
 - That's Lemarkism.
 - That's Lemarkism, the original evolution.
 And in some people's eyes are the best.
 (laughing)
 - One individual gets born with a slightly longer neck.
 Slightly, not one individual is born with 50 per cent.
 (laughing)
 - That's a coincidence.
 - That has a million children
 'cause it's got all the leaves.
 Slightly longer neck and then can get one or two more leaves
 and then it's a bit more likely to pass on its genes.
 - Yes, I knew that bit.
 - Right, did you though?
 (laughing)
 It just sounded a lot like he didn't.
 - Yeah, when I was reading about caterpillars,
 I read this statement that said that basically
 all they're doing is collecting food
 for the moment where they go into their chrysalis stage.
 So their whole life as a caterpillar
 is just to feed themselves in order for that.
 Like how I moved house the other day,
 it'd be like as if my whole life was just collecting boxes
 for the mood.
 - For the food, I mean in order to live and breathe
 and for their processes to work,
 they have to be metabolizing some of the food.
 They can't just all be, I mean they're just creating
 as well. - No, yeah, they're effectively
 just like I just need to just eat
 and get myself ready.
 - They are also using the food a little bit
 for energy as a caterpillar.
 - Yes, totally, yeah, no but it's.
 - But what's the point of using all that energy
 so that you can turn into a butterfly?
 - Exactly, it's the same as Dan saving up for his new house.
 Like he has spent some of the money on, you know,
 co-comprostedutes and whatever.
 But eventually he's been saving up for this house.
 - Got it.
 They're putting something aside is what you're saying.
 They've got a little savings account on the side.
 - Yeah, but it defines their whole existence.
 - Right.
 - Because then there a new thing.
 There a new, it's a whole new account.
 - Who would you just say what defines
 the existence of a caterpillar?
 - I didn't know I read it in an article.
 - I don't know if a caterpillar would agree with that.
 - They probably wouldn't be able to argue me to try to.
 - Totally agree.
 - Even though they're caterpillars.
 (all laughing)
 - Do you know Auctioneers watch videos
 of other Auctioneers at their best?
 Sort of like the greatest hits of auctioneering.
 - Do you mean like auctioneers have to do that
 as part of their training?
 - No, no, they watch it to marvel at the complexity
 of what certain Auctioneers have done.
 So there's a guy called Chris Birch
 who's acknowledged as Christie's greatest Auctioneer.
 Some people acknowledge him as the greatest Auctioneer
 of all time.
 - What do I think?
 - What do I think?
 (all laughing)
 - I think I've slightly made that up.
 - He basically, so he joined Christie's in 1970
 and he averaged, now I'm just gonna read this sentence
 as it's written, I didn't fully understand it
 'cause I can't believe it's true.
 Averaging more than $1 million a minute in sales
 up to his retirement in 2012.
 - No, can't be true.
 - Can't be true, right?
 - Can't be true, right?
 - No, very fast.
 - That's his, that's per minutes across his sales, isn't it?
 So if an Auction takes 50 minutes,
 then his average was 1 million a minute.
 - Ah, in the 30 minutes.
 - So you've got a 50 million auctioneer.
 - So she sells one painting for $25 million in one minute.
 He can then sit around for 24 minutes.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Really not try.
 - He does, that makes it interesting.
 - But so there's a video of him
 that Auctioneers love to watch.
 And he sold the 10 most expensive works
 ever sold at Auction in the world.
 - Wow.
 - Yeah.
 And the video is of him selling Monae's water lilies in New York.
 And in it, he's taking bids from three people in the room
 and two people on the phone.
 And what they're watching is the magic of him
 being able to juggle between it all be charming and witty
 and it's a sort of master class in auctioneering videos.
 - Well, I mean, I listen to other podcasts.
 So it's the same kind of thing.
 - Yeah, I mean, you want to, yeah,
 if you do love auctioneering and you're an auctioneer,
 of course, you're going to watch videos.
 I just didn't know that they existed
 that there's a greatest hits out there.
 - Yeah.
 - There are DVDs and things you can get.
 The most greatest auctioneers.
 Yeah, the most we are.
 - I don't think that's the biggest auction
 of all time though, even the walking is one.
 I've got one that was bigger.
 - Go on.
 - Yeah.
 - The entire Roman Empire was auctioned.
 It was auctioned off in 193 AD.
 Yeah, it was auctioned off by the Praetorian Guard
 who took bids from a couple of people.
 It was a closed auction, there wasn't anyone could bid.
 And this is according to Cassie's deal
 who wrote a history of Rome.
 And two people were bidding saw Pikianas
 and Marcus Didier's Salvia's Julianas
 and he made the maximum bid.
 Supposedly, it was the equivalent
 of about five million quid in today's money,
 which I think surely someone else could have stumped up more.
 - It was past its best in 193 AD.
 - Yeah, it was true.
 - Yeah.
 - Some, some damage.
 (laughing)
 But then several careless owners.
 (laughing)
 - So at the moment, British police are investigating
 a caterpillar thief who has stolen
 from a nature reserve in Norfolk
 some milk parsley plants, right?
 Now there is a kind of butterfly in Britain
 called the Swallowtail.
 It's the largest native British butterfly
 and the caterpillars only eat milk parsley.
 And these plants in Norfolk had Swallowtail caterpillars
 on them.
 So the police think that they've been stolen
 and the plants will be kept alive
 and then eventually the caterpillars will turn into butterflies
 and then collectors will kill the butterflies.
 And they're very rare these butterflies
 'cause they only feed on these plants, right?
 - So wait, so someone's thrown the plants
 in order to get the caterpillars
 that they can sell to collectors?
 - Yes.
 - Well, no, to turn the caterpillars into butterflies
 to be killed for collectors, yeah.
 - Yeah, but then you're breeding caterpillars, I suppose.
 So you want to make more of the species?
 - Then you're immediately killing the butterflies
 as soon as it comes out of the thing.
 - Right.
 - Yeah, kind of swings around about this.
 - No, it's all swigs.
 (laughing)
 - Craft playground.
 (laughing)
 - Do you know that they're used to play cricket
 on the ice in the fins?
 And this was in North, in what's it called,
 in East Anglia, in England?
 - Was that not quite confusing
 if they were wearing their wipes?
 (laughing)
 - No, this would take place in the 18th,
 in the 19th century.
 And I read one account saying that the fielding
 and batting of many of the players was considered
 to be far superior and more graceful
 than any cricketing on the green.
 - Really?
 - So apparently playing cricket on ice is better.
 - Were they in skates or were they just running around with me?
 - I think they were on skates, yeah.
 - That must be amazing.
 - Yeah, I mean, the ball will go so far.
 If you hit it, it goes up, yeah, yeah.
 - Standing on skates to bat.
 - Hang on, why would the ball go far?
 - 'Cause it was skid on the ice.
 - Oh, once it hit the ground,
 if we were going to give you superhuman power
 of hitting on the ice.
 (laughing)
 - Just quickly on the dutch
 and how good they are at skating.
 - Oh, they're amazing at speed skating, aren't they?
 - This is the thing, okay.
 So they're now so good that other countries
 are refusing to play against the moment.
 (laughing)
 There's no point.
 In Sotchi, in 2014, the Norwegians dropped out
 of the 10,000 meter speed skating race,
 ostensibly because they said,
 we want to focus on the team event, actually,
 just 'cause they knew they get marmalized by the dutch.
 And so, annoying, love skating as well.
 So that's a big thing.
 So the women's 1,500 meter team,
 they came first, second, third, and fourth in that event.
 And out of 36 medals, the dutch got 23.
 No other team got more than three.
 - Maybe it's on fur, 'cause they're the tallest nation, aren't they?
 So perhaps it's on fur, 'cause they're legs are too long.
 - But they will have a higher center of gravity, meaning.
 - Sure.
 - That is easier than to fall over.
 - Are we sure that being tall is an advantage in ice skating, I think.
 - We are certainly not sure of that.
 - Really long legs might help, I guess, if you're
 trying to, if you're pelling yourself forward,
 'cause you can go further from each stroke, maybe,
 and it's like a more efficient use of energy, perhaps.
 - I don't know, I guess.
 - I would suggest that if Jamaica were to take part in this event,
 they might be as good as, if not better, than the dutch.
 - I think we've just come with a sequel to cool runnings.
 (laughing)
 - But the fastest skater, the world record holder
 for the fastest skater is a Russian,
 called Pavel Kuliznikov, and he, whatever,
 how would you say it then, James?
 - Kolesnikov.
 - Kolesnikov, yeah, they go.
 (laughing)
 Pavel Kolesnikov, and to be fair,
 I didn't even read the name until just now.
 I should have written the phonetic spelling down.
 And he went at, he was registered going at,
 53 kilometres an hour, registered going,
 not well, like a police camera, but like,
 he, I just think that's astonishingly fast for a skater,
 and he was in a 500 metre rate, so he picked up speed fast.
 - How many is that in Malzana, please?
 I don't know, I can't be bothered with this.
 - It's going to be 32.91, yeah.
 - Yeah.
 - Is that, that's fast, isn't it?
 - Yeah. - Can you say in both run of 30 miles an hour?
 He's not, it doesn't normally happen in Malzana,
 does it?
 They do it in seconds per 100 metres.
 (laughing)
 - I think it'll be nice if it was Malzana for the spectators.
 - He can run at approximately 9.9 seconds per 100 metres.
 - I'm not sure what that is in Malzana.
 - Someone at home can work it out.
 - I think it's less, I think it's about 20 that he runs, isn't it?
 - Oh, that's not very, that's like a built-up area.
 (laughing)
 - I was looking up lonely insects,
 and I was looking up cockroaches,
 and they suffer from isolation syndrome,
 if they're left on their own, and they die,
 so, or they are not able to mature properly,
 and this is really weird, so the way that cockroaches
 are really affectionate physically,
 so you know, if you see them, they're always crawling
 all over each other and stuff, and touching each other,
 and it turns out all this physical contact stimulates them
 to grow, so if you isolate a cockroach,
 even if you give it food and water, then it won't grow,
 and it won't melt properly, and it won't mature,
 but you can make it mature by poking it with a feather.
 (laughing)
 So, yeah, and that convinces them
 that they're having this physical contact
 with their fellow cockroaches, and they grow properly mature.
 - That's amazing.
 Does it have to be a feather, or?
 - It can probably actually be any kind of slightly
 ridiculous device.
 - Is there a limit to how big a cockroach grows?
 - Yes.
 - 'Cause they can maintain it, right?
 Like, if they were touching another cockroach,
 they're like, "I just want to grow a bit today,"
 and so they touch a cockroach.
 - So, you're saying, if you get a cockroach,
 and you tickle it for, like, let's say, seven weeks,
 yeah, it might be the size of a dog.
 - Exactly, that's my question.
 - Maybe, try it.
 - I think Andy's skeptical.
 - I'm skeptical, and I'm surprised I know
 that you're encouraging this life of a coward, isn't it?
 - And we've cli-bottled a lot of the stupid things
 he said today, I thought we'd just let this go.
 (laughing)
 - So, for many years, in many places, collecting flies
 and giving them to the government has gotten you money.
 So, in China, officials in Luai Yang
 offered $125 per 2,000 dead flies during a campaign.
 Each fly was worth about $0.7.
 - Was that a massive amount for a fly?
 - This recently, sorry.
 - I know, it's quite recently, yeah.
 - The scent is quite a lot bigger than a fly as well.
 - Yeah, that's not really how money works.
 (laughing)
 - It's interesting that usually,
 the money's less than the thing that you made.
 - Don't touch it at all, actually.
 - That's not true at all.
 - That goes to the shop with loads of flies,
 so they say, you can't pay with that,
 and you're like, well, it's heavier than a pound note.
 - Oh, it's weird, 'cause the sandwich
 weighs a lot more than 20 pounds,
 but the 20 pound note is heavier.
 (laughing)
 - It doesn't really make sense.
 - It doesn't really.
 - It doesn't really, I completely retry that.
 - It's ridiculous thing to say.
 - So, in...
 - 'Cause then you wouldn't be able to buy anything.
 (laughing)
 - You're not gonna learn that diamonds, are you?
 - I just bought my first house.
 - Oh, man, that must be tough.
 Yeah, I'd find a coin as big as a house.
 (laughing)
 - That's what happens on the island of Yap in Micronesia,
 'cause they have massive stone coins with holes in them,
 and the bigger the better, really.
 - Yeah, that's what I was doing with that.
 - It's embarrassing.
 (laughing)
 - Salvador Dali, he was obsessed with breasts,
 wasn't he, as in a lot of his art depicts breasts,
 but his ultimate obsession was with the other,
 'cause he said it's a very weird sexual thing.
 It's half penis and half other.
 - Well, sorry.
 - Sorry, sorry.
 (laughing)
 It's half penis, half breast, all other.
 - It more sense is an utter half penis.
 - It's incorrect, Salvador Dali is the correct.
 He went out on a limb, he was wrong.
 - A UFC fighter called Justine Kish,
 she was in a fight,
 and halfway through the match,
 she was held in, I think, in a stranglehold,
 and as a result, she put herself midfights in the octagon.
 - Nice.
 - Still won the match,
 and she got offered a bum-wiping product
 as her sponsor for future- - Do you mean Tyler Mesa?
 - No, it's, it's wipes.
 - She goes, I'll shop your wipes.
 - Yes, can I have some bum-wiping products, please?
 (laughing)
 - Yeah, this is how the test goes.
 It's quite equivalent when they're not allowed to call it
 a jaffa cake, so they can call it filled biscuits
 with chocolate on top.
 (laughing)
 - Without the chocolate on chocolate,
 it's just one.
 (laughing)
 - But actually, this wasn't Tyler pay for you.
 - No, no, it's wipes, it's bum-wipes.
 - Yes, wipes.
 - Wet wipes for adults as opposed to babies.
 So yeah, so she thought she was gonna do it,
 and she was really good,
 'cause she won the match anyway,
 and she came off and they asked her about it,
 and she said, "Shit, it happens."
 - Did she go, it's very nice.
 - Did she use it as a weapon in the fight?
 I mean, in no holds barred.
 - There's no weapons in UFC.
 - But there's no rules, right?
 - Yeah.
 - There's no rules, that's true.
 - It's not eye-gouging if you rub your shit
 in some space.
 - That's true.
 Oh, do you mean did she use the poo in the fight?
 - Not her wipes.
 (laughing)
 - Right.
 - I'll wipe the floor with you.
 (laughing)
 - Have you heard of the, in Holland,
 there's a race in Holland called the Elf Staden Tocht.
 The Leven Skirer told me about this, actually.
 So it's this race that happens,
 well, it happens whenever it's able to happen.
 So sometimes it doesn't happen for 20 years,
 sometimes it'll happen in consecutive years,
 and it's apparently a massive event in Holland
 when it does happen.
 And it is a ice skating tour
 that is about 200 kilometers long
 and goes to 11 cities,
 and that's what the name is,
 it's the 11th city tour.
 And apparently it's just a massive event.
 And what happens is, every year,
 everything gets cold and freezes in winter,
 and they go around the race track
 and these go along the network and come out.
 Yeah, exactly.
 And they have to make sure that the ice is sticking off,
 'cause it's an amateur contest,
 and the professionals and amateurs take part.
 And so they're loads and loads of people take part in it,
 and then pretty much the rest of the country,
 all cool and sick, and watch it on television.
 And no, apparently that's like a thing.
 It's like, so they stay home, like watch it.
 It's a bit like, I know, the Grand National here,
 but everybody watches it or something.
 - Yeah, all of them.
 (laughing)
 - Or any sports event.
 - A massive sports event,
 but everyone watches it, yeah, absolutely.
 - Yeah, I have heard of that,
 but I think global warming means it hasn't happened for a while.
 - Yeah, it hasn't happened for a while.
 There was one that was going to happen in 2012,
 and they called it, and what happens is,
 they decide they're gonna call it,
 and then it has to happen in the next 48 hours,
 so everyone has to rush to get prepared.
 But then it didn't happen even though they called it,
 because the ice just wasn't thick and--
 - It's so exciting.
 - And there was actually speaking of ice preparation,
 they do this thing called ice transplanting,
 which is taking thick ice from one place,
 and moving it to say a bit under a bridge,
 where the ice isn't very thick,
 and to kind of fusing it to the ice.
 It's like a skin transplant,
 but yeah, isn't that really cool?
 - 'Cause it has to be six inches thick
 along the entire 200 kilometers of the course,
 and obviously that's very seldom gonna happen.
 - Yeah.
 - Why aren't the climate change lobby using this more
 in their PR?
 I really think that might persuade the likes of Donald Trump
 and another such people, surely.
 If we know that this canal ice race is gonna end,
 - It's on track and people would step up to the plate.
 - Yeah, it's on track as a secret passion
 for ice, it's getting race racing.
 I don't think he does.
 - Who would it for this?
 - Yeah, it is incredible.
 It's so cool.
 - Do you mind if I ask why people are monitoring
 the koala populations?
 Do we know that?
 - Yeah, I think more--
 - Do you mind if I ask?
 - It wasn't that person on the course, you know?
 (laughing)
 - Sorry, it's not me finding really invasive.
 (laughing)
 - Did you guys see that photo from March of this year?
 There was a guy sitting at a train station.
 He looked up, and he just couldn't believe what he saw.
 He took a photo to prove it.
 He was stopped at Seven Sisters Station,
 sitting right there on the platform with seven nuns.
 Seven nuns, seven sisters.
 And he took a photo of it, yeah.
 - Do you think an eighth nun wanted to come on that trip,
 but they were like, "Guys, we can't."
 - No, this is like the moon landing's being fake.
 If you look in the photo, there is an eighth nun.
 - Well, there's an eighth man--
 - No, there's one man, but--
 - No, he's an eighth in the party.
 - Oh, I thought I saw an eighth nun when I looked at the photo.
 - Oh, really?
 - So was there an eighth nun behind the other nuns?
 - You're right, there's an eighth nun!
 - Oh my God, ruined.
 - Oh, man, I'm sorry, I feel like I've killed Christmas.
 - God, did you do it that easy with the moon landing's as well?
 (laughing)
 - Have you heard of open-source seeds?
 No. - No.
 - Okay, so--
 - Is that seeds that don't charge you to read them?
 - Kind of.
 - Okay.
 - I think these are the seeds that are in these libraries,
 these open-source seeds.
 - Well, so in the 1930s, the USA started applying patent law
 to plants.
 So there are various plants where the intellectual property
 is owned.
 - Like, you can own an avocado?
 - Well, you can own an avocado,
 but you can own the whole avocado.
 - The whole concept of the avocado.
 - The whole species of the, yeah.
 They've got this new kind of rice that's called golden rice,
 which is hardier and it grows faster and better
 and therefore is prevented starvation.
 That is owned by someone, the intellectual property for it.
 - Does that mean you're not allowed to grow it
 or you're not allowed to give it the name?
 - I think you're not allowed to then, I'm not sure about this,
 I think you're then not allowed to breed it, develop it,
 and then make money selling your own ex for strain of it,
 but I'm not certain.
 So anyway-- - No commercial use, basically.
 And I think that's because that specific breed of rice
 was growing in space.
 And it was like the means that it took to do that
 and then means, well, therefore,
 those people deserve a kind of a cut of any profits.
 - Well, I don't think it's the specific of the space thing,
 but I just think-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the specific
 I see, yeah.
 - The effort went into making that new breed of rice.
 - Yeah, so if you, it's kind of like developing a medicine,
 in some ways, that if you develop the medicine,
 you then get the rights to it
 because you've spent money developing it,
 but they've now got this thing called open-source seeds.
 German breeders are experimenting with it.
 You're not allowed to patent anything
 that you get out of it, any new great strains
 that you get, but you don't have to pay anybody
 to do the developing and--
 - Okay. - Isn't that weird?
 - Yeah, that's truly bizarre.
 And it doesn't seem morally great, surely.
 If you're not allowed to let anyone grow
 this thing that could be a great food source,
 that you can probably-- - Right.
 It might not incentivise people to develop new strains
 if you can't own it.
 So there's a bit of a-- - That's it.
 - That sort of capitalism.
 - This is cognitiveism.
 (laughing)
 So I'm getting one simple sentence.
 (laughing)
 - Imagine you'd like everybody to have an off-to-eat anna.
 - Well, well, I'm sorry.
 (laughing)
 - I suppose it's not a million miles away
 from patenting a Mars bar.
 - Or a strain of Apple,
 that isn't like a granny's myth or something.
 - Yeah. - Yeah.
 - A fan I was in charge.
 Just be formless lumps of chocolate
 and new garlic we'd be eating now.
 - And everyone would get one, wouldn't they?
 It's a better world.
