WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
 I am really happy in the middle bit

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.320
 between Christmas and New Year.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.400
 Ooh, very nice.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.240
 Thank you very much.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.640
 I'm trying to get a range of greeting cards out.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.480
 Going very soon.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.480
 No, was to buy greetings cards after Christmas, very weird.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.680
 - Yeah, Dan and Andy here.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.120
 We just want to quickly let you know

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.880
 what you're about to listen to.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.960
 This is a compilation of all the outtakes

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.040
 from the whole of 2017.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.760
 Every podcast, we always chop away a lot of stuff

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.240
 and James has been secretly collecting it

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.160
 to put together for this big bumper addition,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.880
 78-minute-long episode.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.880
 - 78 minutes.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.240
 - 78 minutes of outtake.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.680
 - I could watch a short children's film.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.440
 We're a very, very long episode of Frazier in that time.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 Frazier made 78-minute-long episodes.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.360
 - I don't believe so, but it was the,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.880
 the only thing I can think of that's shorter than 78 minutes.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.200
 So what we're saying is, please do enjoy it

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.520
 unless there's a weird Frazier marathon on,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.920
 in which case we give you a license to go

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 and watch that instead.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.040
 We hope you enjoy this.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.440
 Have a wonderful New Year.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.200
 When it comes, I will see you then.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.560
 - All right, on with the outtakes.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.800
 - I'm off to watch Frazier.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.180
 (upbeat music)

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:16.880
 - Did you guys know that anteaters,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.520
 who have obviously famously long tongues,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.960
 have got very, very few taste buds?

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.800
 - Really?

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.640
 - Yeah.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.480
 - What does one taste but every middle, eh?

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.200
 - They can hardly taste what they're eating.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.840
 - Well, they're eating shitty ants and you know,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.680
 termites and stuff.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.520
 - They're eating ants and they occasionally swallow dirt

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 as well as the other thing.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.360
 - Yeah, really?

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.600
 - So it may be an advantage.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.880
 - You don't need to be a,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.240
 'cause all ants are gonna taste the same, right?

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.760
 They're gonna taste vinegary.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.600
 - Oh.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.440
 - Yeah, they are.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.440
 - No. - 'Cause they're full of formic acid.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.280
 - That's so antists.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.120
 - Disagree.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.960
 - 100% disagree.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.720
 'Cause there are some of those ants,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.200
 and they do remember, they swallow honey

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.080
 and they hang upside down,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.680
 and they're sort of honey repositories.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.240
 - Imagine how much you must think you've locked out

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.080
 when you get the odd honey tasting ants.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.560
 Such a relief.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.840
 They have, well, pangolins, which look quite similar,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.920
 have their tongues attached to their pelvis.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.920
 I don't know if I'm using the same thing,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.880
 'cause they have such long tongues,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.480
 when they start their pelvis.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.840
 So I think their tongues are.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.440
 - So they're attached at the back.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.280
 - They don't.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.120
 - They don't, they don't.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.960
 - They don't.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.280
 - They're on the inside of them.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.640
 They're the way their tongue comes out

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.480
 and then sweeps around.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.640
 - That's what I was thinking.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.720
 Yeah. - Hang on.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.560
 - Yeah.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.120
 - It can't be all tongue all the way back.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.520
 It's to all tongue, all the way back into a pangolin.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.600
 Their tongues are longer than their bodies are.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.560
 - What's the point of that?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.760
 - So you can, I guess, maneuver it all the way down the tongue.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.120
 And once it's back at the pelvis,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.640
 the food's practically there.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.960
 The belly need a digestive system.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.200
 I don't know, they've just tested for the truth.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.440
 - That's amazing.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.440
 - Isn't it true that I think woodpeckers

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.960
 have them all the way through back into the skull

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.280
 and they wind around the skull?

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.200
 I've seen like an X-ray of them, right?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.560
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.880
 - And that helps cushion their skull

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.040
 when they're pecking, doesn't it?

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.320
 - As well as being a useful place to store their tongue.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.800
 - Do you know what the longest tongue is?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.480
 And this is relation to body size.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.840
 - It must be this pangolin.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.480
 I think, no, go on.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.680
 - Go for it, no, have a bat.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.680
 - Is it a bat?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.120
 - Yes, it is, yeah, it's the tube-lipped nectar bat.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.480
 And its tongue can go to 1.5 times the length

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.760
 of its actual body.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.600
 - Wow.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.000
 So that's the longest tongue in proportion to body size.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 - Exactly, in an animal.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.760
 - I know the length of that bat.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.600
 - Oh do you?

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.960
 Nora fist you later.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.720
 - How on earth did you remember that?

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.760
 - It's weird that with it having such a massive tongue

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.560
 and a tongue being 1.5 times bigger than the whole thing

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.400
 that they choose to name it after the lip.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.960
 - Yes, that's true.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.680
 - But maybe they didn't see the tongue for a long time.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.040
 Maybe they're like, well, look at that lip.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.200
 - Almost no one had ever seen the tongue

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.040
 because it's always in these massively long flower nose.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.040
 - What am I saying now?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040
 - The flower nose.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.880
 - The flower nose.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.720
 - The trumpet of a flower.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.160
 - Did they think that the bat's face was a flower?

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.480
 (laughing)

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.920
 That's got the head of a flower.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.920
 - It's really weird.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.320
 - Do you know when an elephant's charging you

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.360
 when you should be nervous?

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.120
 - It's running towards you very fast.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.240
 - Is it only about 30 centimeters

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.800
 for a hit to you, you panic?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.000
 (laughing)

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.840
 - It's not that.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.480
 If an elephant has its trunk out, this is according to.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.840
 - Whoa, what is it?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.480
 How can it have its trunk in?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.480
 - If it's up its bum.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.480
 (laughing)

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.640
 - If it's like coiled up, I guess.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.560
 I'm like not in use.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.040
 - Yeah, if it's trunk is like, that is facing downwards

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.640
 or coiled up or it's relaxed.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.280
 - It's always out, that was it.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.920
 - It is always out, so it's never sucked into its face.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.760
 - Yeah.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.320
 - It's just like lifting up and it's doing like,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.720
 one of those like, charge the light brigade

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.960
 like fanfares out of it.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.360
 Like, and charging at you, that's when you know

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.200
 it's going to attack.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.200
 - No, it's not going to attack then

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.280
 when it's doing the charge of the light brigade.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.720
 So when it's got its trunk protruding out towards you,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.960
 you can absolutely relax.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.240
 You're going to be fine.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.880
 Apparently, that's a bluff.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.200
 And it's when the trunk's down and relax

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.200
 that they're doing a proper job.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.200
 - I've never seen an elephant

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.360
 with its trunk straight out like a...

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.640
 - Well, that's because they genuinely want

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.200
 to trample you down, James.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.120
 - Have you seen that that I've never even seen

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.960
 a picture of that?

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.800
 - I haven't really.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.040
 - I'm running with your fist out.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.880
 - Ready to hit someone.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.720
 - Yeah.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.160
 - But you very rarely get to photograph

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.680
 an elephant charging from the side on.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.520
 Don't you?

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.760
 Normally, a human elephant contact is rare enough,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.200
 especially in Safari,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.240
 that there wouldn't be another group of people

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.560
 photographing the elephant from the side.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.960
 - So you're saying he saw it face on

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.720
 and it just looked like an elephant without a trunk.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.200
 - It's pointing straight out of his.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.520
 - I do see that.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.120
 But I'm just surprised I've never come across a picture

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.960
 like that.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.800
 - I think something that happens.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.440
 - I'm surprised I didn't look at Google images

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.560
 as soon as I read the facts.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.160
 - So what's going to happen if the trunk is stretched

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.000
 down and it's bluffing?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Will it just get up to you and then they're just being

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.840
 awkward?

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.040
 - Get up to you and then noddle you, friend.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.960
 In a friendly manner.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.960
 - Shove is shrunken your mouth.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.400
 - Just thinks you're stressed.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.880
 It's just to scare you away.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.720
 - Oh, okay.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.840
 I think it would work for me.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.160
 - Even if I remember this conversation and thought,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.840
 Hannah said that that's not gonna hurt me.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.360
 - Imagine if I've got this the wrong way around

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.960
 and how guilty I'm gonna feel.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.160
 - Well, I always forget the numbers.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.400
 I always think 99% of elephant charges of bluffs.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.160
 And then I think, or is that 99% of shark attacks?

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.000
 - Yeah.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.320
 - And actually, only 4% of elephant charges of bluffs.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.480
 (laughing)

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.320
 - But then it's also like, but the black bear

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.160
 and the brown bear.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.560
 But then brown bears can be black.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.760
 And then which one is way...

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.600
 - It's the nightmare.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.440
 - Yeah.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.280
 - Yeah.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.280
 - Just run away from them all.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.200
 I think it's what I was saying.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.280
 Just live in a city.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.240
 (laughing)

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.960
 - Have you heard of Hobart's funnies?

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.800
 - No.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.440
 - Good, great.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.000
 So these were tanks that were used in D-Day.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.800
 And there was this whole range.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.440
 Like a range of superheroes, basically.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.400
 They all each had their own special superpower.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.320
 - Were they named funnies because they're unusual?

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.160
 - Yeah, pretty much.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.960
 - That was a sort of nickname they were given.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.160
 There was one whose sole job was

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.560
 to carry massive bundles of sticks.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.240
 - Ah, fash skis.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.080
 - Fash skis, exactly.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.440
 It was called the faskine carrier.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.080
 And it basically, if you came to a ramp

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.720
 that was too steep or a hole in the ground

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.560
 that you needed to fill in,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.080
 it just dropped a few massive bundles of,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.640
 and these were enormous bundles of sticks.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.640
 - And that's where the name fashism comes from.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.480
 - Exactly.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.800
 So it was using the faskine carrier to defeat fashism.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.640
 - Yeah.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.480
 - Ah.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.760
 - They were the first ones actually.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.040
 The first armoured vehicle launch bridges,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.800
 were the ones that just carried a big bunch of sticks

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.720
 and then tip them into a ditch.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.120
 - It can't assume very scary.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.080
 If those were the first things

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.440
 the Germans saw on the horizon.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.280
 (laughing)

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.080
 - The least scary robot was robots.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.240
 - Yeah.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.720
 - But you would think that the like in the end of Macbeth,

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.200
 spoiler alert, trees, the trees are coming towards you.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.040
 - Oh yeah, that's true.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.640
 Yeah, I guess any German soldiers

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.160
 who had done the English PTSD wouldn't be frightened.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
 - Did you guys know that,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.920
 and I'm not sure that this is true.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.720
 So I'm sort of asking, as well as saying,

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.800
 that in France, Camembert is the translated equivalent

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.240
 of our pie chart.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.080
 - It is.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.920
 - Is it?

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.760
 - Camembert.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.600
 - Camembert charts.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.000
 - Let's take a look at this Camembert for a pie chart.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.840
 - That's awesome.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.000
 - Yeah, and that's because the correct way to eat

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.960
 Camembert is to slice it into pie shapes, really.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.040
 - And then the people who think trees

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.320
 may be a better prime minister,

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.960
 get one bit of the cheese.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.120
 - They got tiny little slither of cheese.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.160
 (laughing)

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.120
 And they don't know who's just getting massive of the cheese.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.880
 And actually on Reddit, I think it was this year,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.640
 or it was late last year, they had a big argument

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.080
 where somebody showed a picture of a Camembert

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.840
 that their mum had cut.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.760
 And their mum had cut it in not a slicey way.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.400
 And this was a French lady,

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.120
 and they were all saying she should be kicked out

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.560
 the country for that.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.160
 - I've got to say, I wouldn't cross my mind

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.880
 not to slice it up like a pie.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.480
 Who's doing it in a slicey way?

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.320
 That's insane.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.160
 - This lady.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.000
 - Well, this lady.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.240
 - We would have a kicked out.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.440
 - Well, they didn't kick her out.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.480
 I don't think in the end.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.200
 But someone said, oh, there's a cause

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.640
 for loss of nationality.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.000
 And another commenter said,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.320
 "Take her to the British border immediately."

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.120
 (laughing)

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.440
 - I actually cut off the top of the Camembert,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.440
 the whole thing.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.280
 - Just the mold.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.640
 - I just eat that.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.440
 - 'Cause that is just solid bacteria, isn't it?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.440
 Basically, I think so.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.120
 - The rind of the Camembert, the edible liquid.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.200
 A solid mat of mold.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.320
 - And then the bacteria is a little brownie bits,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.000
 and you should have some brown bits on it,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.880
 but not too much.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.720
 - Like a banana?

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.280
 - Yes, like a banana.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.240
 That depends what you like in a banana.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.880
 - That also probably depends what you like in a Camembert.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.640
 - No, this is objective facts.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.400
 (laughing)

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.520
 - So I've been to Pompeii.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.920
 I went last year, and there was a lot of brothels there

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.520
 that they found which were still standing.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.040
 In particular, there's one called Lupinar,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.080
 and the Latin for that is she-wolf,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.920
 which was slang for prostitutes.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.560
 And it was two levels, had five rooms,

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.120
 and you know that it's a brothel because on the walls,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.600
 there was still depictions of people in various positions,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.360
 having sex, and they think the idea behind that

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.720
 was it was almost like porn material to be watching

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.960
 while you were having sex.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.240
 It was the equivalent of having a pornographic movie

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.200
 on in the background for them.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.040
 Isn't that weird?

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.600
 They had porn on their walls in the brothel.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.080
 - It might have been like one of those menus,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.120
 where if you don't speak the language,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.440
 you just point at the thing you want.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.720
 But yeah, no, it's an extraordinary place.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.600
 Highly recommend, if you go there.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.800
 - They also, one of the things I find amazing about Pompeii,

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.680
 it might be Herculenium, which was the place

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.480
 nearby, the same thing happened to it,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.000
 is the scrolls that were found.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.560
 So 800 scrolls were found, perfectly preserved,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.120
 as everything there was.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.880
 And it's, you know, one of the ancient world's

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.480
 best surviving libraries, most extensive surviving libraries,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.680
 and we can't read it, or we can't read a huge amount of it,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.520
 because they're in such a delicate state

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.360
 that we can't touch them.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.760
 So we've got all these rolled up scrolls,

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.440
 and we don't know what they say,

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.080
 and they're sitting in museums and stuff,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.080
 and we're just developing the X-ray technology

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.200
 to try and read bits of them, and they've just found out

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.120
 that they use lead sometimes in the ink,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.960
 and now X-rays can see what the lead shapes are,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.040
 and work out what they read.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.320
 But how annoying is that?

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.560
 Wouldn't you just, if I saw that, I'd try an Unreal one.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.120
 - Is that case? - Oh, well, they did try,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.120
 but every time they tried, they would just fall apart.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.600
 - Oh, so they did sample that for the time. - Yeah, they tried it,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.720
 and they'd fall apart, and then I read an article,

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.720
 I don't know how this would work, but one time they said,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.200
 they tried to open it and explode it.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.720
 - Wow. - Can I just open it and explode?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.280
 That don't know how that works. - Wow.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.440
 But yeah, this X-ray stuff is really interesting, isn't it?

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.760
 Because they convertually unroll scrolls,

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.680
 which is just unbelievable. - It's so cool.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.280
 - So they kind of get the X-ray scan of it,

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.400
 and then they go, okay, now we're gonna take off the first layer,

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.840
 and they can unroll it, and they can see what's on the next layer,

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.040
 which is just outrageous. - Yeah, that's super cool.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.600
 - Amazing. - How many scrolls do you think they ruined

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.680
 that turned a dust in their hand before they went,

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.680
 "You know what, this isn't working?"

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.160
 - I would have stopped after about 50.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.320
 - I simply... (laughing)

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.840
 - In the 1930s, sociologist Norbert Elias walked around Europe

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.680
 with his shoelaces on tie to see what people would say to him.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.200
 - No. - He did.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.680
 - What was his real name, though?

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.000
 (laughing)

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.120
 - Oh, very good. - Yeah.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.960
 - That sounds like alias.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.440
 (laughing)

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.760
 - That's good.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.760
 He found that in England, most old men won that he might fall over.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.880
 When he was in Germany, the old men would look at him with contempt.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.440
 - Wow. - And he was walking around

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.960
 a Spanish fishing village with his shoelaces untied,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.240
 and he felt that he was being warned that his laces were untied,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.440
 but he felt that it was helping him to be included

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.120
 in the village community.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.600
 - Really? - Yeah, I think I read about this guy.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.960
 There's something about, I don't know what country he was walking,

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.360
 and a bunch of girls were giggling at him,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.920
 little girls were giggling at him because of the untying

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.520
 of the shoelaces, and then he tied them up,

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.520
 and that really transformed how he felt about his connection

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.720
 to the places that he was in, when he realized who he was, yeah.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.960
 - That's weird because if I saw someone walking around

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.960
 with the shoelaces untied, I think my instinct would be

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.040
 to go and try and step on one and to trip them over.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.680
 So you not find that, happened a lot?

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.000
 (laughing)

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.560
 - Or to wait until they stop and then to tie them together.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.280
 - Yeah, definitely. - Oh, wow, yeah.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.120
 - If you've got enough time for that, that's the dream.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.120
 (laughing)

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.640
 - Do you guys know about the orangutan that can tie knots,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.320
 and we don't know why, and this sounds like a,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.120
 it's a bullshit animal fact,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.320
 but it's genuinely true and it's bizarre.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.640
 So there's this orangutan called Watana.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.520
 She was born, I think it's a she.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.040
 Yeah, she was born in 1995 in Belgium,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.840
 and this guy called Chris Hertz,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.320
 who's written a book about her,

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.840
 but she ties knots and no one's ever taught her to do it,

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.160
 and she just finds two threads or two finds or whatever,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.520
 then she ties them together.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.000
 - I think she's trying to escape.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.080
 (laughing)

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.520
 - Is she kept in a very high zoo?

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.760
 (laughing)

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.000
 - She's, she's never tried to climb up out of them

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.560
 or hand herself from them.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.400
 - She's.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.240
 - Sorry.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.360
 (laughing)

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.360
 - Are you hosting her?

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.960
 - That got dark, very quickly.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.960
 (laughing)

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.880
 - That was my instinct when he said she was trying to escape,

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.160
 and I realized that I'd got it wrong.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.280
 - Escape from the monotony of life.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.040
 (laughing)

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.480
 - There was an article in The New York Times from 1976,

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.120
 which reports an occasion where there was an exhibition game

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.800
 of football between a team from China and a team from Athens,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.480
 and over the loudspeaker, a tune started blaring,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.080
 and both teams stood up and put hands on hearts,

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.040
 because you know, they seemed it was the other ones,

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.160
 national hook of them, and it turned out it was a toothpaste

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.160
 advert.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.000
 (laughing)

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Everyone, the stadium stood up, and respectfully.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.840
 - That was amazing.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.680
 That's really good.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.560
 - Do you know what the rules are about singing the anthem?

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.800
 The government have said that you should dress appropriately.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.640
 - Right.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.360
 - Also that you should stand still.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.200
 - Right.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.520
 - And that you should be full of energy.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.680
 (laughing)

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.520
 - Okay.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.520
 - That's interesting.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.440
 - Yeah.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.680
 - Stand still, so you're ready to go, basically.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.160
 - Yeah, I think you have to be quivering, basically.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.000
 (laughing)

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.280
 - That's not still.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.280
 - No, you're right, you're right.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.280
 I don't know how do you say that.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.800
 - As soon as they finish, everyone's just gonna explode

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.280
 in some kind of--

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.640
 - Yeah, and you're not allowed to whisper during it.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.640
 You're not allowed to talk on the phone during it.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.720
 - But lots of countries have weird rules, don't they?

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.560
 - That's true.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.800
 - I think Philippines, in the Philippines,

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.640
 their national anthem has to be between 120 beats per minute.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.960
 The Star Spangled Banner, when that was first written,

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.640
 it was supposed to be Conspirito, which means with spirit.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.960
 - Oh, I thought you meant it was meant to be called?

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.800
 - No.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.800
 - Conspirito.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.120
 - It sounds like a magician.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:06.960
 - Yeah.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.800
 (laughing)

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.280
 - And also, the God saved the Queen.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.240
 George the Fifth, he thought he was an expert

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.640
 'cause he'd listened to it so many times.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.480
 And he said.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.840
 (laughing)

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.760
 - It was called God Save the King then as well.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.600
 - Yeah.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.920
 - He was desperate pleading for some kind of skill.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.680
 How many times have you listened to it?

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.480
 (laughing)

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.640
 - If that is for, he is like,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.280
 I'm the person who has to hear this more than any of you.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.120
 - That's true.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.200
 - Please, can you sing it right?

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.720
 - But if he sings it, it's called God Save Me.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.440
 - I'm sorry, that doesn't scam.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.640
 - God save our gracious me.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.800
 It was like Prince Philip's joke.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.200
 He jokes that he's the world's best plaque on Vaila.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.040
 - Oh yeah.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.200
 - And there's a great cut of him saying it repeatedly.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.600
 - It's still a good joke.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.960
 - Anyway, he said that the opening section,

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.440
 you should set your metronome to 60.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.120
 And then later on it goes down to 52.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.560
 Well, that's pretty slow, that.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.640
 (laughing)

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.600
 - What sort of as everyone loses energy?

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.880
 - No, no, that's always a big ending

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.840
 of an American national anthem.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.840
 - No, you're talking about God Save Me.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.680
 - I'm talking about God Save the King.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.520
 - I'm sorry, I'm talking about God Save the King.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.040
 - So the American national anthem was supposed to be quite,

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.680
 you know, conspirator with spirit

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.720
 was supposed to be kind of quite upbeat

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.560
 and whatever.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.680
 Of course, these days, if you watch the Super Bowl,

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.320
 you can bet on how long it's gonna be

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.960
 and the average is usually about one minute,

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.680
 50 or something I think.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.720
 - Is that slow?

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.680
 - Yeah.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.360
 So they put loads of extra notes in like,

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.800
 they're on American Idol, don't they?

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.400
 (laughing)

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.840
 - Other things that are being played at the wrong tempo?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.680
 - Oh yeah.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.080
 - A lot of bait hoven.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.040
 So this is a theory that bait hoven's metronome

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.880
 was broken.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.160
 (laughing)

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.360
 - That just says like a sick bird from the review.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.360
 I just, wait, so he wrote his songs at the wrong tempo?

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.080
 - No, he wrote them at the wrong tempo

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.160
 'cause his metronome was wrong.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.080
 So this is some research that's been done by...

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.240
 - He's been by Brahms.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.720
 (laughing)

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.560
 - Because he has...

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.440
 - He's not playing like, whoa, this is fast.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.600
 - No, no, no, no, that's not...

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.080
 So he played it at a tempo that doesn't sound fast.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.360
 But he ever went through a phase of writing

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.760
 pieces of music that are unplayably fast.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.640
 So between 1850 and 1820, the timing that he writes,

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.000
 the time he says he should play it in

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.760
 is like unplayably fast, it's impossible.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.520
 So no one plays it at that tempo

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.440
 and everyone thinks, well, why not, that he write this?

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.360
 It sounds awful.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.600
 It's frantic and mad.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.640
 And it turns out this guy called Peter Stadlin,

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.400
 who's a pianist, did some in-depth research

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.000
 and some mathematical analysis

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.560
 and worked out that the metronome he had

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.160
 was weighted slightly wrong.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.040
 So Beethoven was just writing down the wrong stuff

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.400
 because his metronome was ticking wrong.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.800
 So when his metronome was saying,

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.720
 yeah, you're playing a 60 beats a minute,

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.520
 he was actually playing at 90 beats a minute.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.360
 - That is brilliant.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.920
 - That's amazing to know he wrote to a metronome.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.040
 I'd never...

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.960
 - Well, he actually owned the first ever metronome, I think,

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.520
 or he owned a metronome that was made

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.120
 by the inventor of the metronome.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.960
 He was really excited by this new technology.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.960
 Turns out it wasn't actually quite developed for the end.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.920
 - I suppose it's plausible that you could have a pianist

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.720
 who writes music and all of his keys are out of tune

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.080
 and then when he writes it down,

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.880
 it's just a completely different tune

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.560
 to what he thought it was.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.520
 Like every single time Beethoven thought

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.720
 he was writing Happy Birthday or something,

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.960
 but then his keys just kept going out of tune.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.680
 - Do you think Beethoven's 9th is actually Happy Birthday?

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.520
 - Yeah.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.360
 - Miss Written.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.400
 - I don't really think that.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.560
 - There's a really creepy ant colony

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.400
 that they've just discovered in Poland,

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.760
 which lives in old Soviet nuclear bunker.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.760
 And basically, there's this Anson S on top of a ventilation pipe

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.880
 outlet that comes up from the nuclear bunker,

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.960
 but a lot of ants are falling through this ventilation pipe

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.720
 and they're falling into the bunker below,

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.240
 which is about three meters underground,

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.400
 and then they can't get out,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.480
 so they can't climb up the walls and get back out.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.680
 And they do what ants do, so they build nests

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.600
 and they operate as ants, but they have no food, obviously,

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.960
 so they die eventually, but they constantly are being replenished.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.520
 So there's this deadly community where new ants keep falling

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.200
 down onto what is now about a few centimeters thick layer

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.240
 of their dead comrades, and then they just keep working

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.560
 and building at their nests, and they die,

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.720
 and then their stock is replenished.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.760
 - Oh my god, that's like six sci-fi films.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.600
 - It is, isn't it?

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.640
 - It sounds like a metaphor for the Soviet times.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.600
 (laughs)

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.440
 - It does.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.080
 I was thinking it's kind of like a metaphor for life, isn't it?

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.560
 - Yeah. - That's really just what we're doing.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.560
 - Yeah, just falling into a life and dying

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.360
 on top of our dead comrades.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.520
 - And on that note.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.800
 (laughs)

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.720
 - In 1850, there's an article that I found it

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.480
 in the English Civil Engineer and Architects Journal,

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.240
 and it states that the Academy of Sciences in France

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.320
 was considering an idea for a suspension bridge

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.120
 between England and France, so going from Dove to Calais.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.160
 Four barges would be sunk at equal distances

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.400
 apart across the channel, and then they'd have chains

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.240
 going up from the barges to the surface,

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.440
 and then the chains would be fixed to the bridge,

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.920
 which would run from England to France,

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.440
 and then above the bridge would be these huge balloons.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.080
 It describes them as giant balloons of elliptical form

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.000
 and firmly secured, which would support in the air

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.120
 the extremity of these chains.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.440
 In my head, I'm imagining it like the big red balls

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.920
 in total wipeout, and you could just bounce from balloon

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.760
 to balloon.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.360
 - Now, I can see that working.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.800
 What I think about those big plastic balls

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.360
 is they're in South America somewhere, aren't they?

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.560
 If mankind kind of collapses quite soon,

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.000
 and then all of the world just kind of becomes grown over

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.600
 by plants and stuff like that,

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.480
 they're made of plastic, so they won't really buy or degrade.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.800
 So if aliens come along, all they'll see

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.480
 really is these big plastic things around.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.600
 - No, no, I don't think that's true.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.720
 - No, I think that's true.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.840
 - If they landed in South America,

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.840
 all of the concrete and stuff would go before the plastic,

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.680
 surely.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.160
 - But we've got a lot more plastic than just the balls

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.800
 that are used in this weird TV show.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.640
 - Sure, sure, sure.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.200
 But they'd probably think that that was the center

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.720
 of human civilization or something.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.520
 This is where they built their greatest table.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.880
 - Exactly, you were probably looking at it,

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.040
 and they probably, there may be north-south aligned

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.200
 or something like that, or they'd probably work out

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.160
 that they're aligned with the sun or something,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.640
 and they think that it was a temple.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.720
 - Yeah, although they think it's a model of the planners,

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.920
 they think it's an early human attempt

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.520
 to understand the solar system,

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.560
 and that the different sizes represent the different things.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.160
 - They're all the same size, though.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.840
 So they'd be like, you idiotic humans.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.640
 - They thought that Mars and Jupiter were the same size.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.320
 - Actually, James, you make a very compelling argument.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.000
 Think of all the temples, the step pyramids in South America.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.600
 Think of what game show they probably were.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.440
 (all laughing)

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.840
 - And we're in Gladiators, they used to have a thing

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.520
 where you had to climb up a pyramid.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.720
 - That was probably it.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.560
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.760
 - You get to the top and at the top.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.760
 You're sacrifice.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.520
 (all laughing)

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.360
 - I think we all know that they'll assume

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.360
 the Disney plastic castle in Paris is our ultimate temple.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.200
 - That's true.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.800
 - We're gonna lose such a weird stuff behind it.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:51.880
 I was reading an article the other day,

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.240
 about what happens first,

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.760
 when if all humans disappeared,

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.840
 the rough running order of how things wind down.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.560
 (all laughing)

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.400
 It's fascinating,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.560
 'cause it was talking about actually concrete

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.160
 last a lot less time than you would think,

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.160
 because freezing and thawing in, let's say, New York,

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.800
 actually in about 10 years,

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.360
 lots of plants will have grown

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.760
 in between the cracks in the concrete

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.760
 and it'll all be working loose.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.760
 And actually, it's quite quickly that you end up with.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.080
 - In 10 years?

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.200
 (all laughing)

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.200
 - It's like a bit more than that.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.040
 - Well, I did think so.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.200
 - 'Cause you know, just rebuild New York every 10 years today.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.280
 - If I mean, if this is predicting the apocalypse

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.240
 and they're like, well, the concrete's gonna disappear

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.480
 in 10 years, that shouldn't have been headline.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.480
 I can't believe they buried the news.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.640
 - But it is a fair point, perhaps,

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.120
 that in 1,500 years or 2,000 years,

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.640
 that only the Disney Tower in Paris,

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.640
 the one in Disneyland, the one in Disney World,

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.360
 these are gonna be the only buildings left,

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.680
 'cause they made a plastic.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.520
 - Yeah.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.560
 - Are they made a plastic?

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.400
 (all laughing)

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.240
 - We assume.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.240
 - Or just Wendy Houses.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.240
 (all laughing)

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.240
 - Big wheel lift.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.000
 - A tiny race of polypockets.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.840
 (all laughing)

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.560
 - All the exhibits in their museums

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.440
 will be, you know, little Play-Mobile dolls and Lego people.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.280
 (all laughing)

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.720
 We think that these were the life forms themselves

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.480
 frozen when they disaster came.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.800
 - What are we talking about bridges?

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.640
 - You don't know.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.240
 - Absolutely, you lost it.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.280
 How does Dan keep this thing together?

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.280
 - So hard to know.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.720
 - So much fun when teachers away.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.280
 (all laughing)

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.240
 - They used to, in the medieval times,

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.400
 draw elephants with actual trumpets for trunks.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.240
 - Did they?

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.080
 - Yeah.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.160
 So the idea they think is not that they actually thought

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.480
 this was the case, but it was kind of an allegorical way

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.320
 of drawing.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.560
 - It would be very weird if they thought

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.520
 it was like, if they'd seen an elephant

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.640
 and they saw a trumpet.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.400
 - And the idea being that they did make loud noises

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.760
 and they thought their noises came from the trunks

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.440
 and the only way you can show them on a picture is

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.600
 by showing the trunk as natural trumpet.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.440
 - Oh, cool.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.240
 - And they think maybe a lot of medieval pictures

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.080
 are like this.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.960
 They're more allegorical than actually literal.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.800
 - Oh, that's kind of what I said,

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.760
 whenever you put anything that has notes coming out of it.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.040
 Like, to symbolize music.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.880
 - Yeah.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.720
 - Like, a bit like that, yeah.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.400
 - It's not a notation, it's not actually, yeah.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.480
 - Yeah.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.720
 - Wait, you said they thought that the noise came out

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.560
 of the trunks.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.400
 - It does, doesn't it?

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.240
 - I don't know.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.080
 - Yeah, they do.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.160
 - It sounds very nasal, the noise.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.560
 I think it comes out of the trunk.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.400
 - Sure.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.880
 - You're basing this off your own...

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.240
 - I just tried doing it, yeah.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.520
 - And it sounded very elephant time

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.640
 when I did it out of the nose.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.480
 - I think you're right.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.720
 (laughing)

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.160
 - And now with the mouth?

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.160
 - Ha!

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.160
 It's not the same.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.400
 - Actually, did you read about that woman?

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.720
 I think it was in this country.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.080
 This week or last week, who ordered a takeaway,

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.000
 and she put a note on the takeaway,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.680
 when it said, "Are there any delivery instructions?"

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.400
 Saying, "I feel so ill, I've got terrible flu.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.400
 "Can't get out of bed, please.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.680
 "Could you stop there chemist on the way

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.920
 "and bring me some Benadryl?

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.240
 "I don't even want the takeaway.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.960
 "I'm only ordering this, so you can do that."

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.800
 (laughing)

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.440
 And so this restaurant brought her her medication.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.680
 (laughing)

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.040
 - There was a Chinese restaurant near me

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.880
 that used to deliver cigarettes as well.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.040
 So people just used to order a bag of prawn crackers

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.400
 and tin boxes of cigarettes.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.000
 (laughing)

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.160
 I've got a whole business school who did a study

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.920
 and came up with this thing called the Ikea effect,

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.640
 which is that you place more value on Ikea

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.000
 for self-assembled furniture, which is what Ikea furniture used for you.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.160
 - Yeah, because you made it yourself.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.600
 - Yeah, and you kind of get attached to it

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.920
 and fall in love with it as you're building.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.920
 And then by the end of it, you've got a shitty book,

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.640
 so it doesn't really stand out right, but you use yours.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.840
 - But you fall in love with it.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.680
 Is that, I think that's--

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.440
 - He said fall in love with those at his will, that's not why.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.280
 - All right, okay.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.040
 Because that would be like a good argument

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.480
 in favor of a robotic wife, for instance, that you build yourself--

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.200
 - Oh, yeah.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.200
 - Or a Lego wife.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.520
 - Yeah, either of those.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.040
 - But she's too tiny for you.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040
 - She will be tiny.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.240
 (laughing)

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.400
 - You get massive Lego people, though, don't you?

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.240
 - Do you?

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.480
 - Yeah, Lego Latin, Lego Latin.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.640
 - Not like a Lego Latin.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.120
 - But you'd have to get married at Lego Latin, wouldn't you?

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.280
 But I think if you're going as far as getting a Lego wife,

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.560
 I think that's probably not an issue.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.520
 - No, it's gonna be like, no, it's not really my scene.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.280
 (laughing)

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.600
 - You've put on a lot of bricks since we married.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.560
 (laughing)

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.800
 - Have you guys ever heard of the National Fruit Collection?

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.640
 - No.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.760
 - I saw this, I was reading about apples, and I just saw it.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.000
 And I've never heard of it, so I don't know anything about it,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.840
 apart from what I saw in this article.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.080
 But apparently it's in Brockdale in Kent,

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.680
 and they have a living collection of apples,

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.720
 presumably old trees.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.720
 They have 2,300 traditional varieties of apple.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.000
 - Wow.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.840
 - Really?

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.200
 - Apparently they get 40,000 visitors a year.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.200
 - That's so cool.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.040
 So you get a chance to taste all those varieties

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.400
 that have gone out of public use.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.240
 - Isn't that the name of said you can eat them?

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.800
 - Yeah, I know, I'm not sure if you're allowed to eat them.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.640
 (laughing)

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.480
 - I don't know.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.640
 - I'm assuming it's like anything in a museum.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.080
 - The National Fruit Collection was demolishing this scene.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.480
 (laughing)

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.800
 - It's not hearing, there's a zoo,

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.960
 with the most rare and fun-looking animals in all the world.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.920
 And you can try all of them in our restaurant.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.160
 - You're the reason they don't have the,

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.240
 please don't eat the penguins I know.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.400
 (laughing)

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.400
 - Yeah, but isn't that cool?

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.240
 Apparently it's been this, it's 1952,

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.400
 and I've never heard of it.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.840
 - I really want to go and visit that, that sounds so fun.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.840
 - I found it, I think we should visit actually.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.840
 - Yeah, let's go.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.680
 - Let's go.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.520
 - Cool.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.520
 - If you're listening to this and you work

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.000
 at the National Fruit Collection,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 why not invite us?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.840
 (laughing)

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.680
 - Give us a discount.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.600
 - Do you know what was the company that was a huge boon

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.200
 for Apple eating in the world over the last 15 years?

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.040
 - Strong boon.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.160
 - Close, but they're major in Apple drinking.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:31.960
 - Apple eating, is it an Apple Tart company?

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.800
 - Like Mr. Kippling.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.080
 - It is not Mr. Kippling.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.560
 The answer is, oh, I think we can get it.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.400
 - I know, I know.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.560
 - So I'll give you some clues.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.400
 - I can lolly company, it was like a flavoring thing.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.680
 - Smoothie makers.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.720
 - I'll give you some clues.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.920
 - I will give you some clues.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.720
 - So, basically, when sliced apples started being a thing,

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.600
 consumption suddenly went massively up.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.240
 - Sorry, I missed that memo.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.680
 - That sliced apples are fake.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.920
 - I have one of my lunch box.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.280
 Pretty much every day of school.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.400
 - I'm still stuck on avocado toast.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.160
 (laughing)

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.120
 - You know, when you buy Apple in the supermarket,

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.920
 some people do, and it's sliced, and it's in a packet.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.000
 - I didn't know of that, no.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.680
 - Have you never seen those in the food section?

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.520
 - I have seen that.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.360
 I think it's very weird.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.000
 - I've never met anyone who's done this,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.880
 but you can go to McDonald's and exchange your fries

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.080
 for sliced apples or carrots.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.480
 - Oh, those.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.320
 - That's right, why?

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.160
 - You can't see that.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.000
 - It's the McDonald's, Emma.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:19.840
 - There you go.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.320
 (laughing)

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.200
 - I can't even, I wasn't told you, I get points.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.040
 There are no points.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.600
 - Well, I'm gonna wear this out, what you just said.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.440
 (laughing)

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:31.400
 - It is McDonald's, so they introduced sliced apples

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.840
 in the 1980s into their restaurant fair.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.120
 I think it was the 1980s.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.960
 And overall, Apple consumption tripled within 10 years.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.320
 And it's because children, especially,

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.680
 but all of us, we are more willing to eat more of an apple.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.360
 If it's sliced, it's just easier to eat.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.640
 And Apple consumption shoots up.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.240
 And it's also really helped in schools across Britain.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.600
 - People before that were just having

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.480
 one bite of an apple and throwing it away, weren't they?

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.560
 - But I think it's also, as I'm partly to the,

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.480
 just the size of McDonald's as a franchise,

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.640
 because when they started giving away free books

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.760
 on in Happy Meals one year,

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.280
 they became the largest literary producer

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.280
 in the world for a lifetime.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.200
 - Literacy tripled in America.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.120
 (laughing)

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.280
 - Yeah, so it's 10% of apples sold in the US

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.960
 are of sliced apples sold in the US up from McDonald's.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.800
 - But exactly the same thing happened in the UK

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.280
 when they introduced them into schools.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.360
 Then Apple consumption went up by almost 100%.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.840
 - Wow, easy in schools though,

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.320
 'cause they can just make you eat stuff.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.160
 - Oh, sorry.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.000
 - But they tried to make you eat full apples

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.840
 and it didn't work.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.240
 And then when you get sliced apples.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.440
 - I had an apple this morning.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.280
 - Did you?

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.840
 - And I'm amazed at my bravery in getting through it

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.400
 without having it sliced for me.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.400
 (laughing)

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.440
 James has an apple peeling machine by his desk.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.320
 - I do, I've never used it.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.360
 I bought it for QI because for the opening show,

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.560
 I was gonna put it in there as a weird opening thing

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.760
 and then I bought it and everyone went,

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.120
 "That's not weird."

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.760
 - Everyone has one of those.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.600
 - I think you can have one.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.440
 - What the hell?

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.280
 I've never heard of that.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.120
 Does it actually work?

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:52.960
 - It looks like a little torture device.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.000
 It's made of metal and you basically skewer the apple

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.600
 and you put it on a skewer and then you turn it

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.360
 so it's being like spit roasted, essentially.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.200
 And then there's a kind of little arm that comes down

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.040
 with a little knife on it and you sort of turn it

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.640
 and it peels it off the, it takes off the peel

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.560
 like a little big, big little spiral.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.080
 - It's also for oranges.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.440
 - I only really like an apple on a skewer

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.760
 when it's got a suckling pig wrapped around it.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.040
 (laughing)

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.720
 - So there is a shaving brush manufacturer

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.600
 around at the moment called Penn Halligan's.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.200
 I think they're quite an old,

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.760
 an old one with a lot of history.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.200
 On their website, they're asked,

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.160
 "Do you use badger hair on your shaving brushes?"

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.960
 And they say, "Yes, we do."

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.120
 But they take them from parts of the world

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.960
 where badgers are not endangered

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.320
 and in fact are primarily farmed for their meat.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.600
 - Wow, that's good.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.880
 - And I don't know where that is

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.160
 'cause I can't see really many places in the world

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.120
 where they farm badgers for meat.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:46.960
 (laughing)

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.320
 But presumably they must do.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.320
 - Well, I was on a forum.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.560
 I think it was a Gillette forum about whether the badger hair

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.760
 on brushes was ethically farmed

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.560
 and they got theirs from China.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.320
 So I think it was Gillette wrote a really good email

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.680
 saying, "You know, we make sure that we source

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.000
 only the most ethical badger hair."

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 - So do you think they farm badger for meat in China?

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.320
 Maybe they do. - Maybe.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.560
 - They used to eat badger in Europe

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.800
 and old European recipes for badger would tell you

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.520
 to lay it in running water for several days

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.000
 to get rid of its rink of flavor.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 - Several days.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.240
 (laughing)

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.280
 - You just have to tie it up in the river, I guess.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.120
 - Yeah.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.560
 - But rink flavor is a lot of the most.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.560
 (laughing)

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.080
 Or just eat beef.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.440
 - Well badgers, they don't make a noise though.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.280
 Do they?

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.120
 - Do they not?

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:33.960
 - Well, do they?

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.800
 - They must.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.560
 - Yeah, depending on what you do to them.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.840
 (laughing)

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.480
 - Old McDonald had a badger, EIO.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.560
 - Yes. - With a...

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.040
 - What?

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.880
 - Do they?

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.120
 - I don't know, do they fuff like ferrets do?

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.480
 Like fuff?

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.840
 - Maybe. - I don't like that.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.880
 I imagine squealing.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.360
 I reckon they squeal if you run away.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.880
 (laughing)

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.600
 - That'd be a great quiz, by the way.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.880
 Just sing the old McDonald's song

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.040
 and put in a new animal and the person has to respond

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.680
 and if they're wrong, they're out of the quiz.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.520
 - That is good.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.520
 - How many animals can you get down the line?

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.280
 - Big ships.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.120
 - Yeah.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.760
 - The sea-wise giant is pretty much the biggest ship.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.920
 I think it is the biggest.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.840
 It's longer than the Empire State Building is tall.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.160
 - Wow.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:22.320
 - It goes at about 16.5 knots, which is about 30 kilometers an hour

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.200
 and it's stopping distance is nine kilometers.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.360
 - Nine kilometers?

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.200
 - Wow.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.720
 - If it's going at that speed.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.560
 And it's turning circle in clear weather is three kilometers.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.520
 - So that's like, imagine we're standing outside our office

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.880
 facing south and we wanted to face north.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.200
 We had to go all the way around to around

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.640
 where Madame Tussauds is, before we were facing north.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.480
 - Wow.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.280
 We're like quite close to Trafalgar Square, aren't we?

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.720
 - Imagine in an emergency, like in the way you would in a car

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:58.720
 hitting the brakes on a boat, but nine kilometers away.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.320
 Because if you did it just one kilometer too late,

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.600
 you'd be like, we're screwed.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.880
 - We just have to watch ourselves plow into this island.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.200
 - I have a fact about banning songs and rude songs.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.200
 - Okay.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.040
 - So it's about parental advisory lyrics.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.280
 You know that sticker that you see on albums?

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.040
 Do you know who those are partly thanks to?

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:17.880
 You may do.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.280
 - Can I actually have a genuine guest?

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.760
 - Cypress Hill, or now one of the early people to have it.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.080
 - Okay, that's not what I've got, although that might be part of the NWA.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:26.920
 - Is it a rap group?

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.920
 - It's Al Gore's wife.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.920
 (laughing)

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.000
 - I thought you were close.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.240
 - Is she part of a rap group?

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.720
 - Yeah, she is, yeah.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.240
 No, she was listening to Prince with her young daughter.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.960
 And she heard some very explicit lyrics.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.320
 They were things like, I guess you could say she was a sex fiend.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.720
 I met her in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.440
 And she was very angry about this because she was listening

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.480
 with her daughter and she thought it was very inappropriate.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.000
 So she wrote a book called Raising PG Kids in an X-rated Society.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.640
 And as part of this drive, she set up the parents music

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.640
 that was all sent to.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.480
 And they released the list of artists called The Filthy 15.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.520
 So this contributed to the rise of the parental advisory.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.400
 - Filthy 15 is a great name.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.640
 - Yeah, it's equal to the dirty dozen.

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.120
 (laughing)

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.720
 - But there was an album once that got a parental advisory label

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.240
 in spite of the fact that it was completely instrumental.

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.080
 - Why?

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.640
 - Did it have sex noises?

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.880
 - No, it didn't, no, it was completely instrumental.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.000
 It's by Frank Zapper, it's a Frank Zapper album.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.080
 It was called G-Spot tornado.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.280
 (laughing)

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.440
 - What are the other bits of trivia from the movie Twister?

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.760
 It was because there's a cow which goes through at some point.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.600
 - Yeah.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.960
 - That was a sort of early CGI cow.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.600
 - Supposedly, I haven't backed this up yet though.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.040
 Supposedly, that cow was originally one of the zebras

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.040
 from Jumanji.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.120
 (laughing)

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.120
 - That's quite a career change, is there?

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.280
 I tried to be typecast it as a zebra.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.520
 (laughing)

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.440
 - I also like that you say I haven't backed this up yet.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.600
 Like, as soon as we stop this podcast,

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.600
 you're gonna be out there.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.000
 - I think this zebra's CV, it says,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.840
 oh, it says here you can also do cow.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.080
 (laughing)

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.640
 - You need two zebra's, one in the front

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.040
 and one in the back of the cow.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.640
 (laughing)

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.480
 Yeah, no, you're right.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.320
 After every podcast and I go through verifying everything.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.160
 (laughing)

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.800
 - What did they, what do you mean by that?

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.000
 Did they paint the stripes off the zebra

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.600
 or did they paint stripes onto a zebra for Jumanji?

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.520
 - I think maybe, 'cause Jumanji came out first,

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.480
 maybe they had the design of a zebra going round

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.480
 in a tornado.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.560
 - Yeah, and so they just use that footage,

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.760
 not the footage, but you don't, I mean,

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.680
 that little computer generator thing to be the cow.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.880
 I don't, as I say, have them backed it up yet.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.360
 Gonna do it as soon as the podcast ends.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.120
 - So my friend, Dan, who works in CGI,

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.120
 told me he, a fact, he learned to London film school.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.320
 And again, I haven't been able to back this up.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.560
 So possibly if someone CGI is listening,

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.160
 - If you guys have thought of your research

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.280
 before the podcast, I'm pretty sure that would be ideal.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.840
 - No, but this is, it's one of those things

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.160
 where it's been said, but don't know where the proof is.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.160
 Any time CGI's been used, I don't know if it's now,

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.400
 but let's say movies of the last 10 years,

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.240
 roughly the last, maybe five years predominantly,

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.440
 CGI has been using, if they have a person in it,

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.160
 they've been using Brad Pitt.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.520
 Because when Benjamin Button was made,

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.600
 they made a full DNA, as it were,

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.840
 CGI of Brad Pitt, the full motion of him.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.520
 And rather than needing to replicate that,

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.440
 you just use that.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.120
 So the company that built that sells Brad Pitt

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.440
 to all these different movies that need a body.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.280
 - That's cool, CGI.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.560
 - You can use all the different ages of man as well.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.400
 - Exactly.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.800
 So theoretically, in World War Z, the zombie film,

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.480
 would all the zombies that they used

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.800
 have also been Brad Pitt.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.640
 - Wow.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.240
 - I hope they paid him well for that.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.240
 (all laughing)

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.080
 - I bet they did.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.320
 (all laughing)

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.520
 - What if someone really overweight or something?

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.920
 Was there a bit in Benjamin Buttonway,

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.760
 put on lots of weight?

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.600
 - Two Brad Pitt's.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.120
 - One of the proofs, what in the back?

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.720
 (all laughing)

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.320
 Have you seen the new thing that Ikea is doing

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.200
 where they're using augmented reality?

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.400
 This is pretty cool.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.400
 So if you wanna get, let's say you wanna get a sofa

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.720
 and you wanna have it in your front room,

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.240
 but you wanna know what it looks like,

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.040
 they've got a new app where you can take a photo of your room,

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.080
 and then you can kind of augment a sofa

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.640
 in the place where it would be.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.360
 So you can see what the room would look like

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.200
 with that sofa.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.040
 - That is so cool.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:17.880
 - That's amazing.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.720
 - Clever, isn't it?

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.960
 - 'Cause they already had, they had like,

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.040
 a build your own kitchen in your website.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.400
 It was like a budget version of the Sims

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.680
 but without the people in it, which had hours of fun.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.680
 - We did that for our new house, it was amazing.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.520
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.360
 - We didn't go with them at the end.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.400
 - But we've got pictures of what it might've looked like.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.520
 - This thing, you've got a happy ending

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.600
 if you think it's public kitchen,

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.200
 whereas I'm just like, well, I can't do this.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.520
 (all laughing)

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.280
 - Don't ask the owner anywhere for the kitchen to see.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.120
 - Ah, but there is a video game as well.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.800
 You'll love this then.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.400
 It's basically a, it simulates you building Ikea furniture

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.840
 but on a computer and there's no end to it.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.120
 You know, you don't win.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.800
 - No, you just, you don't even end up with the furniture.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.400
 - No, yeah, and the idea is that it basically simulates

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.080
 the frustration of what it's like to build Ikea furniture

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.640
 and you can do it with up to four friends.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.440
 It's a game called Home Improvisation.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.840
 So Home Improvisation.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.000
 (all laughing)

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.960
 - Thanks for the translation, dad.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.120
 - What language are you from?

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:12.360
 - I googled that, turns out it translates as Home Improvisation.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.160
 And it lets you, yeah, basically through virtual reality,

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.520
 exactly what you're doing, Alex.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.360
 So if you want to build stuff outside of kitchens,

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.200
 that's there for you.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.960
 - That's fine.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.000
 - There is a thing that's happening at the moment.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.280
 People keep having sleepovers in Ikea shops and Ikea.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.800
 I'm not relaxed about it.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.440
 They are really annoying.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.280
 - Well, surely they could just stop people

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.640
 like as in kick them out.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.920
 - Well, people go in and they hide in cupboards at the end.

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.320
 - So they can't go through at the end of every working day

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.480
 checking every cupboard in the shop.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.680
 - There's an old status and there's something like,

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.640
 it might be 1% as well of people in Europe

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.360
 were conceived in an Ikea bed.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.440
 - So you're one in ten.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.680
 - One in ten is it, wow.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.480
 And were they all in the shop?

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.600
 (laughing)

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.720
 - Somebody filmed the soap opera set entirely in Ikea

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.160
 and they did it without Ikea's knowledge

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.280
 and yeah, it was a web series.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.120
 Yeah.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:03.960
 - That's amazing.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.120
 - That's awesome.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.400
 So they were in the physical shop

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.640
 that they just never staffed, never called onto.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.240
 They were always filming with sort of handheld cameras

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.560
 and things and presumably they must have got asked

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.400
 to leave a few times,

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.240
 but isn't they filmed in an entire web series?

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.640
 And you know, it was just they were just like living

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.480
 in the holes and so on.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.920
 - Oh, 'cause yeah, 'cause if it's a kitchen set,

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.240
 yeah, they're like doing a set.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.800
 - I think the only other thing is that in every scene

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.520
 you've got random people walking around your house

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.320
 and just like, you're picking up your kids

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.960
 and you're tensed up and taking them away.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.840
 - So the whole concept of the sitcom

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.920
 has to be about a place where you live

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.080
 where there's a lot of burglars.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:35.920
 - Yeah.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.560
 (laughing)

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.720
 - Do you know if we ever said that when Nelson died

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.720
 and he famously had a hardy next to him

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.120
 and cradling him and his arms

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.480
 and the person who wrote the account

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.920
 who was there at the time said that,

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.800
 Nelson said kiss me hardy and then hardy kissed him.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.960
 And then we ever mentioned that for about 80 years

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.560
 during the Victorian era, that story was changed

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.760
 so that he said kiss me hardy

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.160
 because they were too squeamish

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.800
 about the idea of two men kissing each other

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.320
 and kiss me was a Turkish for fate.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.160
 And so they said that he'd said kiss me hardy.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.440
 And this guy must have misheard it.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.840
 No one would have said kiss me hardy.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.800
 - Why do you say kiss me hardy?

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.640
 Isn't that?

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.440
 (laughing)

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.120
 'Cause he wasn't a fake pirate.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.280
 - Right.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.680
 - It's a missed opportunity, I think.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.320
 - I bet hardy got a load of those jokes

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.480
 all the way through his name.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.320
 - Yeah.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:28.400
 - But if the story was that Nelson said kiss me hardy,

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.960
 how do they explain away the bit where hardy

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.800
 then kisses me?

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.360
 (laughing)

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.080
 Do they say, oh Nelson said, oh get off me you weirdo.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.880
 (laughing)

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.840
 - Can I throw in one Nixon fact before we move on?

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.840
 Can anyone tell me what Richard Nixon's middle name

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.680
 is Mill House?

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.600
 - Yeah, it's a Mill House.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.440
 - Yeah, so it is Mill House.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:54.440
 However, I'm gonna put forward the reviewed fact

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.320
 that it's in fact a double barrel surname.

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.160
 - Okay.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.520
 - Because it is his mother's maiden name.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.440
 Mill House was his mum.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.280
 - Okay.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.600
 - So he took that on and I would say that that's not a--

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.480
 - That's quite, so my brother has the same thing

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.680
 with my mother's maiden name.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.600
 That's quite common.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.320
 And I would say that's not double barrelled

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:16.640
 because it's not the mother's name anymore, is it?

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.720
 - Well, it can still be her name.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.640
 She might, yeah.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.120
 - What's her name still Mill House?

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.360
 - I don't know, but it's taken

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.760
 because it's his mother's maiden name.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.600
 - Interesting.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.640
 - Yeah, I just, I didn't know that connection in any case.

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.600
 - It's a huge, huge news if true though,

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.800
 that Richard Nixon's middle name isn't Mill House.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.600
 It might just be a part of it, sir.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.400
 - Yeah, well that's what I'm trying to put forward here, yeah.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.800
 - It is a relatively common thing.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.200
 I think especially in Scotland, they do that a lot, don't they?

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.320
 - They use mothers maiden name for middle names.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.160
 - I don't.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:45.160
 - If that is took correct,

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.880
 then there will presumably a lot of times

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.200
 his name has been carved into stone,

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.040
 but they're gonna have to go back

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.440
 and do a really botched squeeze

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.320
 of the word Mill House into it.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.440
 I don't know how many times his name's been written in stone.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.680
 (laughing)

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.680
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.320
 - I mean, he's not, I don't think he's one

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.760
 of Mount Rushmar, is he Nixon?

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.000
 (laughing)

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.160
 - No, no.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.000
 - But it should be a shit rush more with Andrew Jackson

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.080
 and Nixon and you know--

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:07.920
 - Calvin Coolidge.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.520
 - Calvin Coolidge, Trump, yeah.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.720
 - That's just another thing about his name.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.640
 He was named after a British king.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:17.040
 So there's a thought that his family tree actually goes back

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.200
 and he descends from King Edward III of England.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.160
 That's a sort of an idea that was put out there.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.040
 But he's named after Richard the Lionheart

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.760
 and he is one of four brothers

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.040
 and all of them also carry English king names.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:28.880
 - Really?

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.720
 - Yeah. - What do you have the names?

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.560
 - Well, there are only about three other names.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.400
 - Sorry, sorry, three of them carried it

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.280
 and then there was Francis who was name of his dad,

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.360
 who carried his dad's name.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.880
 - Isn't rich the Lionheart far back enough

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.600
 that everyone is directly descended from him?

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.960
 I think he is.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.280
 I think Edward III is.

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.160
 So everyone on earth is directly descended.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.000
 - What?

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.800
 - 'Cause everyone in Britain,

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.960
 everyone pretty much everyone in Western Europe's.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.880
 - But everyone in America as well, 'cause--

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.680
 - But Danny Dyer did who do you think you are

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.320
 and they found that he is related to Edward III

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.160
 and it's this huge story.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.000
 And actually, the odds of him not being related,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.480
 it would have been an amazing new story

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.760
 if he had not been related to Edward III.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.480
 - I don't think that's gonna sell many papers, is it?

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.520
 - Danny Dyer, they're not related to it.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.200
 - By the odds, the odds are that 99% of everyone

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.200
 is related to Edward III.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.960
 It's suddenly a very interesting story.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.960
 - I see that, but then people don't usually go

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.320
 much past their headlines, are they?

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.680
 - And if their headline is Danny Dyer,

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.280
 isn't related to Edward III.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.960
 But that's an interesting story

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.920
 because the odds of 99% that he would be.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.080
 I'm my newspaper, it's gonna have very long headlines

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.120
 that are really short articles.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.600
 - Country music has the most intelligent lyrics, apparently,

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.840
 because one of the measures,

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.200
 which sounds like not a great measure,

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.040
 is the number of syllables in words.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.280
 And it doesn't have filler words,

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.640
 so you don't get a lot of, oh yeah, yeah, oh,

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.080
 you know, that kind of stuff you get.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:46.920
 - I see what you mean.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.920
 - But if you say that the most advanced songs,

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.200
 are the ones with more syllables,

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.560
 then the most advanced song in history

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.080
 is Supercalifragilistique Spialidosius.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.640
 - Yeah, it takes years of study to understand that.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.640
 (laughing)

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.360
 The study example the study used was,

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.200
 country music uses more syllables,

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.440
 using words such as cigarettes,

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.360
 tackle box and hillbilly.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.840
 - tackle box.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:09.840
 (laughing)

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.960
 - Apparently.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.480
 So that's too advanced for an eight-year-old, obviously.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.360
 - Yeah, fair enough.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.200
 - Also on Too Big To Fit,

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:23.200
 I googled Too Big To Fit and Dwayne, The Rock Johnson,

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.040
 is Too Big To Fit in a lot of the cars

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.960
 in the latest Fast and the Furious.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.800
 - Wow.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.440
 - So there is an interview with him

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.880
 and they're asking him why you always in trucks

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:36.000
 not in the little cars,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.840
 and he's like, "I'm too big to fit in there."

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.160
 - Oh my God.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.000
 - Wow.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.200
 - That makes sense, yeah.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.080
 - You should drill a hole in the ceiling or something.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.880
 Is he too tall or too?

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.280
 - He's very muscular.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.200
 - He's muscular, yeah.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.560
 - But that is extraordinary.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.400
 - He's good that, isn't it?

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.360
 - Could they have an adapted one

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.920
 where he's just got one seat in the middle,

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.560
 so there's not a two-seater?

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.760
 - I guess they could, although they'd have to write that

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.520
 into the story line of the film.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.360
 - Yeah.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.600
 - What story line there is in the film?

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.600
 (laughing)

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.240
 If you wanna collect semen from Macax, it's quite hard.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.080
 - Macax.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.280
 - Macax, little primates, little monkey things.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.120
 - Oh yeah.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.200
 - What they used to do is they would stimulate

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.480
 their genitals with electricity.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.600
 Sometimes a little weak jolt,

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.920
 but it would make them ejaculate.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.400
 But one researcher realized that actually

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.840
 they were ejaculating quite a lot anyway,

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.760
 because they do it like four times an hour

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.600
 or something like that.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.600
 - Wow.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.920
 - Yeah, they average four times an hour ejaculating

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.960
 when they're just having fun and just on their own.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:37.840
 - Watch all the time.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.760
 - Not for the rest of the time.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.760
 - Not for the rest of the time.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.520
 - But whether it's sleep now, it just keeps going.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.920
 (laughing)

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.760
 But do they ejaculate 40 times a day?

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.600
 You know?

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.600
 - Yeah, I think they do.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.160
 - I'm seeing on, so what I'm seeing here

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.440
 on this bit of paper is on the island,

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.240
 the male's masturbate on average four times an hour.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.080
 So that's on average four times an hour.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.680
 They could have some better hours than that.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.160
 - In a good hour.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:05.400
 - And so what she realized this researcher is what she could do

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.840
 is just kind of hang around,

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.240
 'cause it happens so frequently.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.320
 And then when it happens, just quickly get in there

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.080
 with the pipette and suck it up.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.600
 And she does that.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.520
 The main problem being that they often lick the ground

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.600
 or their hands clean before she can get close

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.120
 because semen happens to be highly nutritious

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:24.280
 and they don't want to waste the nutrients.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.920
 - Devious, devious mechanics.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.200
 - Yeah, they all randy though, they're randy.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.560
 Um, you can have so many more times an hour.

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:35.080
 - Yeah, they'd like to masturbate.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.760
 - Look, we all like to masturbate,

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.000
 but they should get a job.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.880
 (laughing)

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.160
 - You know when crocodiles die,

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.440
 they bloat and float.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.320
 They're bloaters and floaters.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.040
 Because of all these gasses being released,

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.200
 they keep them afloat.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.280
 And they float for over a month without thinking.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.120
 - Wow.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.840
 - So I don't understand why we don't see crocodiles

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.080
 floating down.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:57.920
 - Well, we must do.

00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.760
 - We must do.

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.360
 - Maybe we do in countries with crocodiles.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.400
 - Just think they're lugs.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.240
 - Yeah.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.600
 - Or crocodiles because they're very stealth, aren't they?

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.440
 - That's true.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.280
 - They're very stealthy.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.120
 - They don't do much movement.

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.880
 So if you saw one going like that,

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.560
 you'd think, oh, he's on a cheeky mission.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.200
 - Cockroaches go on the back, don't they?

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.240
 When they die, famously.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.080
 - Oh, yes.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:15.920
 - Yeah.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:19.360
 - The reason being that they have long legs for an insect

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.040
 and they have a high sensor of gravity.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.040
 The sensor of gravity is quite near that bone kind of thing.

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.600
 And as they get older,

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:31.040
 they kind of start to get weighed down to their bump side.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.520
 And then when they kind of eventually die,

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.600
 they flip over and they don't have enough energy

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.440
 in their arms.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.160
 They don't have enough strength in their legs

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.000
 to put them back over.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.720
 And the same thing happens if you give them kind of pesticides,

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.600
 they spasm and they'll flip over

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.200
 and then they won't have the energy left

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.280
 in their legs to flip them back.

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.560
 - So they're flipping over their head.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.320
 They're not rolling over sideways.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.360
 - They're flipping over vertically

00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.720
 because their bones weigh down.

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.240
 - Exactly, they do that flip.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.200
 - Well, I don't know if it's exactly like that.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.480
 It could be a slightly sideways, slightly back flippy thing.

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:06.880
 I don't know about that.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.480
 But basically, you're walking around with a heavy bump

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.080
 and as you get older, you're less able to deal with it.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.560
 - We know it feels.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:19.920
 - Tortuses have that same problem.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:20.760
 - Do they?

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.760
 - Obviously, they've got round shells.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.360
 But they have this really weird balancing act

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.400
 that they need to strike

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.440
 because bigger animals obviously do better

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.760
 because they're stronger and they can fight other males

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.160
 and they can compete more.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.800
 But also, if they get too big,

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:40.640
 a bigger shell means that it's hard to write yourself again.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.360
 So you have all the advantages of being big,

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.720
 but if you lose one fight

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.200
 and you then get rolled over onto your back,

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.440
 it's much likely that you won't be able to

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.440
 write yourself again.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.520
 - Oh, yeah.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.360
 - It's a trade-off.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.840
 - It's basically putting all your eggs in one basket.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.000
 It'll be really big.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.840
 There's a really interesting thing about tortoises

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.640
 which we covered on QI years and years ago.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.880
 And that is that it's possible to invent a shape

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.200
 that you put it on a table

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.280
 and it always flips over to a certain side.

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.520
 - I just chewed to the shape of the thing.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.760
 It's felt like a gumbok,

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.080
 but I think it's pronounced more like gumbots.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:16.000
 Anyway, so this shape has been invented by computer scientists

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.640
 and it took us decades to do it

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.240
 and they managed to do it through using computers.

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:24.520
 But tortoises, some tortoises have this exact same shape.

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.840
 And so if they flip over,

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:29.000
 they naturally kind of roll back onto their feet.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:29.840
 - Oh wow.

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.680
 - That's so cool.

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:31.520
 - That's awesome.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.680
 Was the inventor of the gumbok inspired by totals

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.040
 or with tortoises, or is that?

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.400
 - I believe he was.

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.480
 I've met him and I can't remember.

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.800
 - Oh, was it vice versa?

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.280
 You're going to watch the turtles?

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.080
 We went to one of his shows and thought, guys,

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.320
 we should try that.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.840
 - Yeah, I was so proud of myself

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.960
 for not finishing the set so you can clearly do

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.040
 where I was going with that.

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.800
 I was like, no, 'cause James started talking.

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.880
 I thought, ah, that looks like a clever question now.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.240
 - I wasn't gonna let him save you.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.160
 - Diamonds are the hardest substance in the world.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.960
 I read a, whoop, they're not James.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.960
 - James is in diesel.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.800
 - In diesel.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.280
 - They're not, what is that?

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.640
 - They're the hardest naturally occurrence.

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.960
 - Sorry, that's what I meant to say.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.120
 Yes, the hardest naturally occurrence substance.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.560
 You can't scratch a diamond,

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:21.560
 except with another diamond you can.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.400
 - Yeah.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.000
 - So you can scratch a diamond with a diamond.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:24.840
 - That's what it means.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.600
 - That's what hardness means in this sense.

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.120
 It means that you can scratch something with something.

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.000
 - So hardness is whether something can be scratched

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.720
 and toughness is whether it shatters into a thousand pieces

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.880
 if you hit it with something.

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:38.640
 So diamonds, because the layers of carbon are very tough,

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.600
 you know, internally, but do you hit it with a hammer?

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.600
 Bang, smash it.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.760
 - Right.

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:43.600
 - So don't try that.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:44.440
 - Don't do that.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.280
 - Yeah.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.000
 - And that's, I think we may have said this before,

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.720
 that's what traders used to do.

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:51.760
 If someone had mined a diamond,

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.200
 there was someone's group, there's people who'd say,

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.200
 well, okay, let's have a look.

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.400
 And we'll just give it a quick test to see

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.840
 if it's a real diamond.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.520
 I'll just hit it with this hammer, bang, smash it.

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.720
 And then he says, I'm so sorry,

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.880
 it wasn't a real diamond after all.

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.720
 It was something else.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.800
 - But I'll keep the shards.

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.480
 - I'll keep the shards and I'll pay you a nominal sum

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.320
 for them.

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.800
 I'll pay you a tiny bit to keep yourself going, you know?

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:10.080
 And then they'd just sell off a load of smaller diamonds.

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:10.920
 - A very clever.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.240
 - Very clever, yeah.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.520
 - Or you could groom back together

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.040
 and make a bigger diamond again.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:15.880
 - Oh god.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.720
 - I think that's where the imperfections come in.

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.080
 - Come on down to Hannah's shitty diamond store.

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:23.160
 (all laughing)

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.760
 We got loads of rubbish diamonds full of glue.

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.760
 (all laughing)

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.600
 - I've got some stuff on quarantine.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.440
 - Oh, right.

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:32.280
 - Yeah.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.520
 Comes from the Italian for 40.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.720
 Quarantee, which...

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.400
 - Because you used to have to stay 40 days in quarantine.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.800
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.320
 - Incubation period of the Black Death

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.160
 supposedly.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.000
 - Oh, okay.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 - They put astronauts in quarantine.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:47.840
 - That's right.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.480
 - When they come back down.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.520
 Do you know why?

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:55.000
 - Yeah, because of radiation and in case in space

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.840
 they were given some sort of flu disease.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.480
 It was to do with diseases, wasn't it?

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.000
 - Well, it is a little bit.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.120
 - Aliens with smallpox.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.760
 - Yeah, so you might think if you were a sci-fi fan

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.880
 that it was to stop alien diseases coming to Earth.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.800
 But it's actually because their immune system

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.880
 is lessened due to them being in space.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.600
 So when they come back down, they need to go in quarantine

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.080
 so they don't pick up bugs on Earth.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.080
 - Is that so amazing?

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.960
 - Technically that you're putting the entire rest

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.360
 of the world in quarantine.

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.200
 - Yeah.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:22.040
 - Yes.

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.560
 - That's just true of all quarantine.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.440
 Just flip around the exit mentions.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.280
 - That's fine.

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.760
 (laughing)

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.560
 - Yeah, I suppose that is true.

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:32.680
 - There was, you know, just picking up on that quickly.

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.920
 When the Apollo 11 astronauts came down,

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.920
 they had to do that.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.920
 They had to be in quarantine in this room

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.680
 where they had a sort of kitchen in there

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.080
 and living quarters and so on.

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.080
 They had to stay in there for ages

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.480
 before they could do any of their parades around the world.

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.320
 - Wow.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:50.440
 - And what ended up happening was if a scientist accidentally

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:54.520
 kind of was infected as it were with the room

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.560
 that they were kept in because they were delivering stuff

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.920
 and so on, I guess, in suits.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.360
 - And then it was for possible space cooties, wasn't it?

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.360
 - Yes, yes.

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.600
 Those scientists then had to move in with them.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.640
 So there was a whole batch of people

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.960
 that subtly got, or might have been infected.

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.640
 So therefore needed to be quarantined.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.520
 - It's people came along to give them some food

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.360
 and they got infected.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.200
 - Exactly.

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.040
 - It's like a horror film.

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.360
 It's like, oh, where's Sarah?

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.520
 I better go and find out.

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.360
 Oh no, what's Bernard gone now?

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.520
 - It's a bit like a game of sardines.

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:22.120
 - It is, it is, exactly.

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.320
 And there was a suggestion, and I'm not saying this is true,

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.480
 but there was a suggestion that some of the people

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.840
 who accidentally had to go into the quarantine

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.120
 looked like ladies of the night,

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.640
 who made their way into there and had to live out.

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:38.480
 - I don't even know what the implication you're making is.

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.320
 - Prostitutes.

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.680
 - Was it postitutes?

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.920
 - No, 'cause it's back on Earth now.

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.080
 (laughing)

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.160
 - And also, space prostitutes don't exist.

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.480
 - Oh yeah, it's like, yeah.

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:49.920
 - But it was another time, wasn't it, the '60s?

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.920
 - Yeah.

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.560
 - I mean, it literally was, yes, to you know.

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:55.280
 (laughing)

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.160
 - I looked at some skillful number people,

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.280
 and I was looking at like the world record

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.680
 for memorizing numbers and stuff like that.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:04.680
 - Okay.

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.080
 - And the world record for most digits memorized

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.040
 in one minute has two different sections,

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.840
 one with the light on and one with the light off.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.400
 'Cause apparently, it's miles easier when the lights off.

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.000
 - That makes sense, 'cause there's no distractions.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.120
 - I guess so, right?

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.480
 But you can close your eyes.

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.640
 - How do you see the number to memorize?

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:23.640
 (laughing)

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.280
 - Maybe that's another reason.

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:27.200
 But yeah, maybe you're allowed a little torch

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.360
 or something, I don't know.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.200
 - All right.

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.120
 - But perhaps I'll give you an audio recording of it.

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.320
 - Maybe, I don't know.

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.360
 So this is for binary digits, so it's zeros and ones.

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.680
 - Okay, the one, the specific one I'm looking at.

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:41.520
 And the record for most zeros and ones memorized

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:46.520
 in one minute with the light on is 107.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:50.040
 With the light off, it's 273.

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.360
 - Oh, wow.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.200
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.200
 That makes that much difference.

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:54.160
 - That's incredible.

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.720
 - So all mass exams should be held in the dark, shouldn't they?

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.680
 - I guess so, if they were all in binary.

00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.760
 (laughing)

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.960
 - Mine, mine are worse.

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.960
 (laughing)

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.680
 - Did you just quickly one thing on chocolate?

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:05.880
 I think it's quite funny.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:09.640
 Bernie Madoff, remember him, is now running a chocolate racket

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.000
 in prison.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.480
 So... - Who's he again, sorry?

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.240
 - You know, he's the guy who...

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.640
 - He ran a massive Ponzi screen, didn't he?

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.480
 - Ponzi screen.

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.480
 (laughing)

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:21.840
 Yeah, so he was a business man who it turned out

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.440
 was stealing lots of people's investments.

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.000
 So he got millions and millions of pounds

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.600
 and stole lots of money.

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.160
 And he's running this chocolate racket.

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:30.480
 And in prison in America now, he's really respected

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.720
 'cause he stole a more money than anyone else in there.

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.040
 So he wrote this letter to his daughter

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.200
 saying he's quite the celebrity in there.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.160
 Other inmates treat him like a mafia don

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.800
 and call him Uncle Bernie.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.480
 I can't walk anywhere without people shouting their greetings

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:44.560
 and encouragement.

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:45.800
 It's really quite sweet.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:48.120
 And he's brought up all the chocolate in the prison.

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.640
 And now he runs this racket

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.200
 where the only person you can get it from is him.

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.240
 And so he makes a big profit.

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.080
 - How's it work?

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.320
 'Cause it sounds like that should be illegal, right?

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.160
 - Hi.

00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.400
 - It's unusual to have people committing

00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.800
 a very similar crime in prison

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:00.960
 to the one they were put in there.

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:01.800
 - Yeah.

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.280
 - And then to announce it, I mean,

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.200
 do prison guards not read news or?

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.120
 - But that's not illegal.

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.120
 - It's not illegal.

00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:09.200
 - No, what, just to buy up to get in there first

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.720
 and buy up all the stuff so you can sell it

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.040
 on for a profit, that's okay.

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.200
 - It's immoral.

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.040
 - Right.

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.640
 - It's a bit of a monopoly, but I don't think there's

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.520
 like anti-monopoly rules in prisons.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.920
 - It's touting.

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:20.400
 - It is touting, yeah.

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.240
 - Okay.

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.080
 - Well, good luck to him.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.800
 I think that's what you're saying.

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.520
 - Couldn't have happened to a nice guy.

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:29.040
 - God, I'd love to know where the boxes are

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.160
 from, Dealer, no deal.

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.360
 (laughing)

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:34.120
 - Your notice, I said nothing in that whole bit

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.160
 'cause I was busy thinking,

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.440
 "Gaddy, yeah, did they wear no diamonds

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:38.360
 "just got them in his house?"

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.200
 - Yeah.

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:43.960
 He probably, I reckon he uses them to wrap Christmas presents.

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:46.880
 - That would be such a good idea if he doesn't

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:47.720
 and he's listening.

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:48.720
 - But that's a great Christmas present.

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.720
 So you unwrap it.

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.400
 There's a box, you open the boxes, nothing inside.

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.440
 And you're like, oh, this is terrible.

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.040
 And he says, actually, it's one of the boxes

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:54.960
 from Dealer, no deal.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.360
 And you're like, that's the best present ever,

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.440
 no-leadment and Christmas is saved.

00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.280
 - Hmm, yeah.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.320
 - I would be still unhappy with Dealer, no deal.

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.240
 - Box is my Christmas present, just the two of you

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.080
 who's thinking about it.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.560
 - If it was a real one that was used on the show.

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:09.320
 - I really intentionally did not want that as a present.

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:10.160
 - Great.

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.000
 (laughing)

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.200
 I'm sure someone else will have it.

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.680
 - Yeah, I bought it now.

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.040
 - Sorry, no, we thought she'd love it.

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.480
 - Or he might use it for storage.

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:20.320
 - Yeah.

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.560
 - Or if he goes shopping, putting his shopping in the boxes.

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.200
 - Yeah, he just goes everywhere.

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.640
 If you look at every phone of him these days,

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.000
 he's actually got a box with him.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.600
 - If he gets fired, once he got fired from a job,

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.440
 do you think he'd clear this desk in those boxes?

00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.320
 - Yeah, when he got cats or, yeah.

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.360
 - Yeah, how do you move in there?

00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.800
 Has he put handles on them or wheels?

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.560
 - Yeah, 'cause they don't have handles today.

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.280
 - No, very easy to carry.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.240
 - How many items of check-in luggage really have today?

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.640
 So I've got 15.

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.240
 (laughing)

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.760
 - I read a thing.

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.200
 There's a basketball player called Jimmy Butler.

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.640
 He plays for the Chicago Bulls.

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.880
 I think he's just been traded, but I'm not sure to wear.

00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:58.000
 But he, I read it article, this is the, in the headline,

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.920
 it says that Jimmy Butler took out his car rear-view mirror

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.240
 as a reminder to never look back.

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.400
 (laughing)

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:06.840
 - That was awesome.

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:08.480
 - It was promptly arrested.

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.440
 (laughing)

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:13.160
 - Have you heard of the North American Walnut Sphinx caterpillar?

00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.560
 - No, that's a goody.

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.640
 (laughing)

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.520
 It pretends to be a bird to freak birds out.

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.240
 - A bird's freak's out to other birds.

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.080
 - Yeah.

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.480
 (laughing)

00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.400
 - That's one thing they most used to.

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.240
 (laughing)

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:26.520
 They used to hang it around with birds.

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.720
 - Sorry, I should clarify.

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:30.000
 - They make a noise like a freaked out bird.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.000
 - Oh, no.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.200
 - I'll just scare the other incoming birds away.

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.120
 - Exactly, so what they do, it's amazing.

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:39.000
 They, to make the noise, they have not quite lungs

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.640
 in the sense that we understand they have these holes

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:43.120
 along their sides called spiracles, exactly.

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.720
 And to make the noise, they squeeze themselves shut

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.880
 like an accordion.

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:49.120
 (laughing)

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.320
 It's amazing.

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:52.520
 And that, when they do that, it makes a noise that goes,

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.360
 "Eee!"

00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:56.440
 And it sounds exactly like a bird's alarm call saying,

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.800
 "There is a bird of prey nearby,"

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.520
 or, "Get out of here, we're under attack."

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.360
 And so the other birds all fly off as soon as

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.200
 this caterpillar makes a noise.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.920
 - No, they do it to scare the birds away.

00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:05.920
 - They do it to scare the birds away,

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.960
 because the birds would prey on them.

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.520
 - Is that, is that evolution or is that coincidence

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.960
 at the note, the specific note?

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.760
 - That's everything's evolution, doesn't it?

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:15.600
 - Yeah.

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:16.560
 (laughing)

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:19.320
 - That's what we all are, the product of.

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:20.720
 - What was the other option,

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.560
 of it that could even happen?

00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.400
 - Coincidence.

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.240
 - Coincidence.

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:24.080
 (laughing)

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:25.400
 - Well, yeah.

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.840
 It could be evolution by coincidence.

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.280
 - Yeah, at least, it probably started as a bit of a coincidence.

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.280
 - That's what I was looking at.

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.560
 - But that's how evolution works.

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.880
 Evolution always starts as a coincidence,

00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.800
 which then evolves into being a pattern.

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:37.640
 - That's it.

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.480
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.440
 (laughing)

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:42.000
 - No, but if you were an animal

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.640
 and you were living on the Galapagos

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.080
 and the trees were too high,

00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.640
 and the leaves were too high on the tree,

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:49.240
 it's not coincidence for you to grow your neck to try and...

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.080
 - Yes, it is.

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:51.880
 It's a coincidence that there was someone

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.280
 who was born with a really long neck.

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.920
 - No, but don't you grow your neck?

00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.520
 - No, oh my god.

00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:58.600
 - That's Lemarkism.

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.880
 - That's Lemarkism, the original evolution.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.240
 And in some people's eyes are the best.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.560
 (laughing)

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.200
 - One individual gets born with a slightly longer neck.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.240
 Slightly, not one individual is born with 50 per cent.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.080
 (laughing)

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.880
 - That's a coincidence.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.200
 - That has a million children

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.120
 'cause it's got all the leaves.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.160
 Slightly longer neck and then can get one or two more leaves

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.520
 and then it's a bit more likely to pass on its genes.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.200
 - Yes, I knew that bit.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.200
 - Right, did you though?

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.600
 (laughing)

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.960
 It just sounded a lot like he didn't.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:39.920
 - Yeah, when I was reading about caterpillars,

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.280
 I read this statement that said that basically

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.880
 all they're doing is collecting food

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.680
 for the moment where they go into their chrysalis stage.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.480
 So their whole life as a caterpillar

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.800
 is just to feed themselves in order for that.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.440
 Like how I moved house the other day,

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.400
 it'd be like as if my whole life was just collecting boxes

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.240
 for the mood.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.920
 - For the food, I mean in order to live and breathe

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.240
 and for their processes to work,

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.160
 they have to be metabolizing some of the food.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.320
 They can't just all be, I mean they're just creating

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.760
 as well. - No, yeah, they're effectively

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.120
 just like I just need to just eat

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:12.960
 and get myself ready.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.280
 - They are also using the food a little bit

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.920
 for energy as a caterpillar.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.600
 - Yes, totally, yeah, no but it's.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.280
 - But what's the point of using all that energy

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.080
 so that you can turn into a butterfly?

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.720
 - Exactly, it's the same as Dan saving up for his new house.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.360
 Like he has spent some of the money on, you know,

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.400
 co-comprostedutes and whatever.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.680
 But eventually he's been saving up for this house.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.520
 - Got it.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.360
 They're putting something aside is what you're saying.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.680
 They've got a little savings account on the side.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.120
 - Yeah, but it defines their whole existence.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:39.960
 - Right.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.400
 - Because then there a new thing.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.080
 There a new, it's a whole new account.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.360
 - Who would you just say what defines

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.880
 the existence of a caterpillar?

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.960
 - I didn't know I read it in an article.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.200
 - I don't know if a caterpillar would agree with that.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.360
 - They probably wouldn't be able to argue me to try to.

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.200
 - Totally agree.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.360
 - Even though they're caterpillars.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.360
 (all laughing)

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:06.000
 - Do you know Auctioneers watch videos

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.480
 of other Auctioneers at their best?

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.600
 Sort of like the greatest hits of auctioneering.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.640
 - Do you mean like auctioneers have to do that

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.480
 as part of their training?

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.720
 - No, no, they watch it to marvel at the complexity

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.360
 of what certain Auctioneers have done.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.640
 So there's a guy called Chris Birch

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.360
 who's acknowledged as Christie's greatest Auctioneer.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.640
 Some people acknowledge him as the greatest Auctioneer

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.160
 of all time.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.000
 - What do I think?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.160
 - What do I think?

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.320
 (all laughing)

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.760
 - I think I've slightly made that up.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:39.320
 - He basically, so he joined Christie's in 1970

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.560
 and he averaged, now I'm just gonna read this sentence

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.840
 as it's written, I didn't fully understand it

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.200
 'cause I can't believe it's true.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.480
 Averaging more than $1 million a minute in sales

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.840
 up to his retirement in 2012.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:52.840
 - No, can't be true.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.680
 - Can't be true, right?

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.520
 - Can't be true, right?

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.360
 - No, very fast.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:59.840
 - That's his, that's per minutes across his sales, isn't it?

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.360
 So if an Auction takes 50 minutes,

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.760
 then his average was 1 million a minute.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.240
 - Ah, in the 30 minutes.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.200
 - So you've got a 50 million auctioneer.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.640
 - So she sells one painting for $25 million in one minute.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.040
 He can then sit around for 24 minutes.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:13.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.720
 - Really not try.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.840
 - He does, that makes it interesting.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.000
 - But so there's a video of him

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.720
 that Auctioneers love to watch.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.480
 And he sold the 10 most expensive works

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.560
 ever sold at Auction in the world.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.400
 - Wow.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.240
 - Yeah.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.400
 And the video is of him selling Monae's water lilies in New York.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.280
 And in it, he's taking bids from three people in the room

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.720
 and two people on the phone.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.360
 And what they're watching is the magic of him

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.520
 being able to juggle between it all be charming and witty

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.560
 and it's a sort of master class in auctioneering videos.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.360
 - Well, I mean, I listen to other podcasts.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.200
 So it's the same kind of thing.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.520
 - Yeah, I mean, you want to, yeah,

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.560
 if you do love auctioneering and you're an auctioneer,

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.200
 of course, you're going to watch videos.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.560
 I just didn't know that they existed

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.760
 that there's a greatest hits out there.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.600
 - Yeah.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.920
 - There are DVDs and things you can get.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.440
 The most greatest auctioneers.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.520
 Yeah, the most we are.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.760
 - I don't think that's the biggest auction

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.560
 of all time though, even the walking is one.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.000
 I've got one that was bigger.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:08.840
 - Go on.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:09.680
 - Yeah.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.240
 - The entire Roman Empire was auctioned.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.280
 It was auctioned off in 193 AD.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.640
 Yeah, it was auctioned off by the Praetorian Guard

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.320
 who took bids from a couple of people.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.640
 It was a closed auction, there wasn't anyone could bid.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:25.120
 And this is according to Cassie's deal

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.480
 who wrote a history of Rome.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.720
 And two people were bidding saw Pikianas

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.400
 and Marcus Didier's Salvia's Julianas

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.600
 and he made the maximum bid.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.800
 Supposedly, it was the equivalent

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.400
 of about five million quid in today's money,

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.760
 which I think surely someone else could have stumped up more.

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.920
 - It was past its best in 193 AD.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.760
 - Yeah, it was true.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.600
 - Yeah.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.360
 - Some, some damage.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.040
 (laughing)

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.520
 But then several careless owners.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.600
 (laughing)

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.800
 - So at the moment, British police are investigating

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.920
 a caterpillar thief who has stolen

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.680
 from a nature reserve in Norfolk

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.280
 some milk parsley plants, right?

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.080
 Now there is a kind of butterfly in Britain

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.080
 called the Swallowtail.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.640
 It's the largest native British butterfly

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.080
 and the caterpillars only eat milk parsley.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:14.640
 And these plants in Norfolk had Swallowtail caterpillars

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.680
 on them.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.400
 So the police think that they've been stolen

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.280
 and the plants will be kept alive

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.960
 and then eventually the caterpillars will turn into butterflies

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.160
 and then collectors will kill the butterflies.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.440
 And they're very rare these butterflies

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.520
 'cause they only feed on these plants, right?

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.360
 - So wait, so someone's thrown the plants

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.400
 in order to get the caterpillars

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.640
 that they can sell to collectors?

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:33.480
 - Yes.

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:35.520
 - Well, no, to turn the caterpillars into butterflies

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.840
 to be killed for collectors, yeah.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.760
 - Yeah, but then you're breeding caterpillars, I suppose.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.240
 So you want to make more of the species?

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.920
 - Then you're immediately killing the butterflies

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.040
 as soon as it comes out of the thing.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:43.880
 - Right.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.200
 - Yeah, kind of swings around about this.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.440
 - No, it's all swigs.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.000
 (laughing)

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
 - Craft playground.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.080
 (laughing)

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.520
 - Do you know that they're used to play cricket

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.600
 on the ice in the fins?

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.240
 And this was in North, in what's it called,

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.240
 in East Anglia, in England?

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.120
 - Was that not quite confusing

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.480
 if they were wearing their wipes?

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.520
 (laughing)

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:09.920
 - No, this would take place in the 18th,

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.600
 in the 19th century.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.360
 And I read one account saying that the fielding

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.640
 and batting of many of the players was considered

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.200
 to be far superior and more graceful

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.240
 than any cricketing on the green.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.080
 - Really?

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.480
 - So apparently playing cricket on ice is better.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.160
 - Were they in skates or were they just running around with me?

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.840
 - I think they were on skates, yeah.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.120
 - That must be amazing.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.120
 - Yeah, I mean, the ball will go so far.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.920
 If you hit it, it goes up, yeah, yeah.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.720
 - Standing on skates to bat.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.440
 - Hang on, why would the ball go far?

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:38.800
 - 'Cause it was skid on the ice.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.400
 - Oh, once it hit the ground,

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.080
 if we were going to give you superhuman power

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.200
 of hitting on the ice.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.400
 (laughing)

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.560
 - Just quickly on the dutch

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.160
 and how good they are at skating.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.960
 - Oh, they're amazing at speed skating, aren't they?

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.800
 - This is the thing, okay.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.200
 So they're now so good that other countries

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.800
 are refusing to play against the moment.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.640
 (laughing)

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.480
 There's no point.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.280
 In Sotchi, in 2014, the Norwegians dropped out

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.200
 of the 10,000 meter speed skating race,

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.400
 ostensibly because they said,

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.040
 we want to focus on the team event, actually,

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.000
 just 'cause they knew they get marmalized by the dutch.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.600
 And so, annoying, love skating as well.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.720
 So that's a big thing.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.120
 So the women's 1,500 meter team,

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.520
 they came first, second, third, and fourth in that event.

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.880
 And out of 36 medals, the dutch got 23.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.480
 No other team got more than three.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:25.120
 - Maybe it's on fur, 'cause they're the tallest nation, aren't they?

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.240
 So perhaps it's on fur, 'cause they're legs are too long.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:32.400
 - But they will have a higher center of gravity, meaning.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.400
 - Sure.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.800
 - That is easier than to fall over.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.440
 - Are we sure that being tall is an advantage in ice skating, I think.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.680
 - We are certainly not sure of that.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.760
 - Really long legs might help, I guess, if you're

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.400
 trying to, if you're pelling yourself forward,

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.080
 'cause you can go further from each stroke, maybe,

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.080
 and it's like a more efficient use of energy, perhaps.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:48.920
 - I don't know, I guess.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:53.600
 - I would suggest that if Jamaica were to take part in this event,

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.880
 they might be as good as, if not better, than the dutch.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.920
 - I think we've just come with a sequel to cool runnings.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.520
 (laughing)

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.160
 - But the fastest skater, the world record holder

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.560
 for the fastest skater is a Russian,

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:11.680
 called Pavel Kuliznikov, and he, whatever,

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.040
 how would you say it then, James?

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:13.880
 - Kolesnikov.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.720
 - Kolesnikov, yeah, they go.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:15.560
 (laughing)

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.840
 Pavel Kolesnikov, and to be fair,

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.760
 I didn't even read the name until just now.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.880
 I should have written the phonetic spelling down.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.720
 And he went at, he was registered going at,

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.680
 53 kilometres an hour, registered going,

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.880
 not well, like a police camera, but like,

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.360
 he, I just think that's astonishingly fast for a skater,

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.800
 and he was in a 500 metre rate, so he picked up speed fast.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.280
 - How many is that in Malzana, please?

01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.760
 I don't know, I can't be bothered with this.

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.480
 - It's going to be 32.91, yeah.

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.320
 - Yeah.

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.080
 - Is that, that's fast, isn't it?

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.040
 - Yeah. - Can you say in both run of 30 miles an hour?

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.840
 He's not, it doesn't normally happen in Malzana,

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.680
 does it?

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.120
 They do it in seconds per 100 metres.

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:50.960
 (laughing)

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.560
 - I think it'll be nice if it was Malzana for the spectators.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:57.560
 - He can run at approximately 9.9 seconds per 100 metres.

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.480
 - I'm not sure what that is in Malzana.

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.480
 - Someone at home can work it out.

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.120
 - I think it's less, I think it's about 20 that he runs, isn't it?

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.480
 - Oh, that's not very, that's like a built-up area.

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:09.240
 (laughing)

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:11.840
 - I was looking up lonely insects,

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.120
 and I was looking up cockroaches,

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.680
 and they suffer from isolation syndrome,

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.120
 if they're left on their own, and they die,

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.280
 so, or they are not able to mature properly,

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:25.240
 and this is really weird, so the way that cockroaches

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.800
 are really affectionate physically,

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.600
 so you know, if you see them, they're always crawling

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.400
 all over each other and stuff, and touching each other,

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.880
 and it turns out all this physical contact stimulates them

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.240
 to grow, so if you isolate a cockroach,

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.920
 even if you give it food and water, then it won't grow,

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.240
 and it won't melt properly, and it won't mature,

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.840
 but you can make it mature by poking it with a feather.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.960
 (laughing)

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.520
 So, yeah, and that convinces them

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.800
 that they're having this physical contact

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.520
 with their fellow cockroaches, and they grow properly mature.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.520
 - That's amazing.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.120
 Does it have to be a feather, or?

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.680
 - It can probably actually be any kind of slightly

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.680
 ridiculous device.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.000
 - Is there a limit to how big a cockroach grows?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:58.840
 - Yes.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.680
 - 'Cause they can maintain it, right?

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.200
 Like, if they were touching another cockroach,

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.600
 they're like, "I just want to grow a bit today,"

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.840
 and so they touch a cockroach.

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.640
 - So, you're saying, if you get a cockroach,

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.920
 and you tickle it for, like, let's say, seven weeks,

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.560
 yeah, it might be the size of a dog.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.200
 - Exactly, that's my question.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.320
 - Maybe, try it.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.640
 - I think Andy's skeptical.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.360
 - I'm skeptical, and I'm surprised I know

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.640
 that you're encouraging this life of a coward, isn't it?

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.040
 - And we've cli-bottled a lot of the stupid things

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.640
 he said today, I thought we'd just let this go.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.880
 (laughing)

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:32.120
 - So, for many years, in many places, collecting flies

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.400
 and giving them to the government has gotten you money.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:39.920
 So, in China, officials in Luai Yang

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.920
 offered $125 per 2,000 dead flies during a campaign.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:48.920
 Each fly was worth about $0.7.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.480
 - Was that a massive amount for a fly?

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.880
 - This recently, sorry.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.800
 - I know, it's quite recently, yeah.

01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:57.880
 - The scent is quite a lot bigger than a fly as well.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.000
 - Yeah, that's not really how money works.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:00.840
 (laughing)

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.240
 - It's interesting that usually,

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.840
 the money's less than the thing that you made.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.160
 - Don't touch it at all, actually.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.000
 - That's not true at all.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.200
 - That goes to the shop with loads of flies,

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.480
 so they say, you can't pay with that,

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.400
 and you're like, well, it's heavier than a pound note.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.480
 - Oh, it's weird, 'cause the sandwich

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.920
 weighs a lot more than 20 pounds,

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.880
 but the 20 pound note is heavier.

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.920
 (laughing)

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.960
 - It doesn't really make sense.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:17.800
 - It doesn't really.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.600
 - It doesn't really, I completely retry that.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.280
 - It's ridiculous thing to say.

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.520
 - So, in...

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.280
 - 'Cause then you wouldn't be able to buy anything.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.120
 (laughing)

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.440
 - You're not gonna learn that diamonds, are you?

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.880
 - I just bought my first house.

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.160
 - Oh, man, that must be tough.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.960
 Yeah, I'd find a coin as big as a house.

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.360
 (laughing)

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.920
 - That's what happens on the island of Yap in Micronesia,

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.760
 'cause they have massive stone coins with holes in them,

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.560
 and the bigger the better, really.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.760
 - Yeah, that's what I was doing with that.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:42.600
 - It's embarrassing.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.560
 (laughing)

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:48.880
 - Salvador Dali, he was obsessed with breasts,

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.000
 wasn't he, as in a lot of his art depicts breasts,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.280
 but his ultimate obsession was with the other,

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.640
 'cause he said it's a very weird sexual thing.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.240
 It's half penis and half other.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.080
 - Well, sorry.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:01.920
 - Sorry, sorry.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.480
 (laughing)

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.080
 It's half penis, half breast, all other.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.160
 - It more sense is an utter half penis.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.360
 - It's incorrect, Salvador Dali is the correct.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.640
 He went out on a limb, he was wrong.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:17.760
 - A UFC fighter called Justine Kish,

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.960
 she was in a fight,

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.240
 and halfway through the match,

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.280
 she was held in, I think, in a stranglehold,

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.280
 and as a result, she put herself midfights in the octagon.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.120
 - Nice.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.280
 - Still won the match,

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.240
 and she got offered a bum-wiping product

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.480
 as her sponsor for future- - Do you mean Tyler Mesa?

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.680
 - No, it's, it's wipes.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:40.320
 - She goes, I'll shop your wipes.

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:43.440
 - Yes, can I have some bum-wiping products, please?

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.520
 (laughing)

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.840
 - Yeah, this is how the test goes.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.040
 It's quite equivalent when they're not allowed to call it

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.240
 a jaffa cake, so they can call it filled biscuits

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.520
 with chocolate on top.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.240
 (laughing)

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.440
 - Without the chocolate on chocolate,

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.280
 it's just one.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.280
 (laughing)

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.200
 - But actually, this wasn't Tyler pay for you.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.920
 - No, no, it's wipes, it's bum-wipes.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.760
 - Yes, wipes.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.560
 - Wet wipes for adults as opposed to babies.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.200
 So yeah, so she thought she was gonna do it,

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:10.040
 and she was really good,

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.200
 'cause she won the match anyway,

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.200
 and she came off and they asked her about it,

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.800
 and she said, "Shit, it happens."

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.800
 - Did she go, it's very nice.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.120
 - Did she use it as a weapon in the fight?

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.640
 I mean, in no holds barred.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.440
 - There's no weapons in UFC.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.640
 - But there's no rules, right?

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:24.480
 - Yeah.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.320
 - There's no rules, that's true.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.160
 - It's not eye-gouging if you rub your shit

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.000
 in some space.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:28.840
 - That's true.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.760
 Oh, do you mean did she use the poo in the fight?

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:31.960
 - Not her wipes.

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.600
 (laughing)

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:34.440
 - Right.

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.440
 - I'll wipe the floor with you.

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:38.280
 (laughing)

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:41.120
 - Have you heard of the, in Holland,

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.200
 there's a race in Holland called the Elf Staden Tocht.

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.240
 The Leven Skirer told me about this, actually.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.800
 So it's this race that happens,

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.480
 well, it happens whenever it's able to happen.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.840
 So sometimes it doesn't happen for 20 years,

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.160
 sometimes it'll happen in consecutive years,

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.520
 and it's apparently a massive event in Holland

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.360
 when it does happen.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.240
 And it is a ice skating tour

01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.920
 that is about 200 kilometers long

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.040
 and goes to 11 cities,

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:01.880
 and that's what the name is,

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.880
 it's the 11th city tour.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.520
 And apparently it's just a massive event.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.320
 And what happens is, every year,

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.040
 everything gets cold and freezes in winter,

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.920
 and they go around the race track

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.080
 and these go along the network and come out.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:15.920
 Yeah, exactly.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.440
 And they have to make sure that the ice is sticking off,

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.800
 'cause it's an amateur contest,

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.720
 and the professionals and amateurs take part.

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:24.600
 And so they're loads and loads of people take part in it,

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.680
 and then pretty much the rest of the country,

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.880
 all cool and sick, and watch it on television.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.240
 And no, apparently that's like a thing.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.000
 It's like, so they stay home, like watch it.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.240
 It's a bit like, I know, the Grand National here,

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.560
 but everybody watches it or something.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.400
 - Yeah, all of them.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.560
 (laughing)

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.560
 - Or any sports event.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.400
 - A massive sports event,

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.560
 but everyone watches it, yeah, absolutely.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.760
 - Yeah, I have heard of that,

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:44.440
 but I think global warming means it hasn't happened for a while.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.280
 - Yeah, it hasn't happened for a while.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.040
 There was one that was going to happen in 2012,

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.200
 and they called it, and what happens is,

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.280
 they decide they're gonna call it,

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.960
 and then it has to happen in the next 48 hours,

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.480
 so everyone has to rush to get prepared.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.280
 But then it didn't happen even though they called it,

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.280
 because the ice just wasn't thick and--

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.280
 - It's so exciting.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.960
 - And there was actually speaking of ice preparation,

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:00.600
 they do this thing called ice transplanting,

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.360
 which is taking thick ice from one place,

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.880
 and moving it to say a bit under a bridge,

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.080
 where the ice isn't very thick,

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.200
 and to kind of fusing it to the ice.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.480
 It's like a skin transplant,

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:11.960
 but yeah, isn't that really cool?

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:14.440
 - 'Cause it has to be six inches thick

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:18.520
 along the entire 200 kilometers of the course,

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:21.240
 and obviously that's very seldom gonna happen.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:22.080
 - Yeah.

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.400
 - Why aren't the climate change lobby using this more

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.440
 in their PR?

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:28.080
 I really think that might persuade the likes of Donald Trump

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.160
 and another such people, surely.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:33.440
 If we know that this canal ice race is gonna end,

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.480
 - It's on track and people would step up to the plate.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.200
 - Yeah, it's on track as a secret passion

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.360
 for ice, it's getting race racing.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.200
 I don't think he does.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.160
 - Who would it for this?

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.680
 - Yeah, it is incredible.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.080
 It's so cool.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.680
 - Do you mind if I ask why people are monitoring

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.880
 the koala populations?

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:48.920
 Do we know that?

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.560
 - Yeah, I think more--

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.400
 - Do you mind if I ask?

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.520
 - It wasn't that person on the course, you know?

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.600
 (laughing)

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.680
 - Sorry, it's not me finding really invasive.

01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.640
 (laughing)

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:04.320
 - Did you guys see that photo from March of this year?

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.280
 There was a guy sitting at a train station.

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.920
 He looked up, and he just couldn't believe what he saw.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:11.200
 He took a photo to prove it.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:14.800
 He was stopped at Seven Sisters Station,

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:18.800
 sitting right there on the platform with seven nuns.

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:22.240
 Seven nuns, seven sisters.

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.520
 And he took a photo of it, yeah.

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:27.480
 - Do you think an eighth nun wanted to come on that trip,

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.760
 but they were like, "Guys, we can't."

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.720
 - No, this is like the moon landing's being fake.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.320
 If you look in the photo, there is an eighth nun.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.920
 - Well, there's an eighth man--

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.880
 - No, there's one man, but--

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:40.040
 - No, he's an eighth in the party.

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:43.400
 - Oh, I thought I saw an eighth nun when I looked at the photo.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.240
 - Oh, really?

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:46.440
 - So was there an eighth nun behind the other nuns?

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.760
 - You're right, there's an eighth nun!

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.560
 - Oh my God, ruined.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:53.320
 - Oh, man, I'm sorry, I feel like I've killed Christmas.

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:56.160
 - God, did you do it that easy with the moon landing's as well?

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.160
 (laughing)

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.320
 - Have you heard of open-source seeds?

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.000
 No. - No.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:03.840
 - Okay, so--

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:06.280
 - Is that seeds that don't charge you to read them?

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.120
 - Kind of.

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:07.960
 - Okay.

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:11.120
 - I think these are the seeds that are in these libraries,

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:11.960
 these open-source seeds.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:16.640
 - Well, so in the 1930s, the USA started applying patent law

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.360
 to plants.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:21.520
 So there are various plants where the intellectual property

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.600
 is owned.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.680
 - Like, you can own an avocado?

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:26.080
 - Well, you can own an avocado,

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:29.000
 but you can own the whole avocado.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.200
 - The whole concept of the avocado.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.800
 - The whole species of the, yeah.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.480
 They've got this new kind of rice that's called golden rice,

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.320
 which is hardier and it grows faster and better

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.320
 and therefore is prevented starvation.

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:43.080
 That is owned by someone, the intellectual property for it.

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.920
 - Does that mean you're not allowed to grow it

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.760
 or you're not allowed to give it the name?

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:49.760
 - I think you're not allowed to then, I'm not sure about this,

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:52.200
 I think you're then not allowed to breed it, develop it,

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.080
 and then make money selling your own ex for strain of it,

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.120
 but I'm not certain.

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.760
 So anyway-- - No commercial use, basically.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.880
 And I think that's because that specific breed of rice

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.800
 was growing in space.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.960
 And it was like the means that it took to do that

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.000
 and then means, well, therefore,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.680
 those people deserve a kind of a cut of any profits.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.720
 - Well, I don't think it's the specific of the space thing,

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.360
 but I just think-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the specific

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:14.200
 I see, yeah.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.960
 - The effort went into making that new breed of rice.

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.160
 - Yeah, so if you, it's kind of like developing a medicine,

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.200
 in some ways, that if you develop the medicine,

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.280
 you then get the rights to it

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.040
 because you've spent money developing it,

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.560
 but they've now got this thing called open-source seeds.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.480
 German breeders are experimenting with it.

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.720
 You're not allowed to patent anything

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.720
 that you get out of it, any new great strains

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.600
 that you get, but you don't have to pay anybody

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:35.520
 to do the developing and--

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.840
 - Okay. - Isn't that weird?

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.080
 - Yeah, that's truly bizarre.

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:42.480
 And it doesn't seem morally great, surely.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.520
 If you're not allowed to let anyone grow

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.320
 this thing that could be a great food source,

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.160
 that you can probably-- - Right.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.080
 It might not incentivise people to develop new strains

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.240
 if you can't own it.

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.560
 So there's a bit of a-- - That's it.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.400
 - That sort of capitalism.

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.480
 - This is cognitiveism.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.360
 (laughing)

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.360
 So I'm getting one simple sentence.

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.300
 (laughing)

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.480
 - Imagine you'd like everybody to have an off-to-eat anna.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.920
 - Well, well, I'm sorry.

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.040
 (laughing)

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.680
 - I suppose it's not a million miles away

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.160
 from patenting a Mars bar.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.240
 - Or a strain of Apple,

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.880
 that isn't like a granny's myth or something.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.720
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.800
 - A fan I was in charge.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.360
 Just be formless lumps of chocolate

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.240
 and new garlic we'd be eating now.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.720
 - And everyone would get one, wouldn't they?

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.080
 It's a better world.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.660
 (upbeat music)

01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:26.240
 (upbeat music)

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:31.920
 (upbeat music)

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:41.920
