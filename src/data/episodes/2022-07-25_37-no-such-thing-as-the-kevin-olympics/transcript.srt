1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 We run it on qi a few years ago. Yeah. Which was there's no such thing as a fish.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,920
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,640
 He says it right there, first paragraph. No such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:22,960
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,280
 coming to you from the qi offices in Covenant Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber and sitting here

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,480
 with Anna Chazinski, Andy Murray and James Harkin and once again we've gathered around the microphone

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:46,400
 Starting with fact number one and that is Chazinski. Yeah, my fact this week is that in 1874 there was

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,920
 a plan to transport dead bodies from all over Europe to mount Vesuvius and throw them in.

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,000
 Was this the plan of a supervillain? Well, maybe, maybe. So it's reported in a couple of

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,080
 newspaper articles from the time there's one article in the Daily Gazette for Middlesbrough

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:11,120
 which describes how an American company has got some capital to erect railways or

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,440
 like have trains running all over Europe and it takes people who have died who want to be

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,320
 cremated in Mount Vesuvius and it runs them up Mount Vesuvius and then it tosses them into the

15
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:28,880
 burning lava below. And this, so I can't find any proof of the history. I can't find that the

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,280
 company ever happened but seems strange that it would only be reported in the Middlesbrough Gazette.

17
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,680
 It's also reported in the New York Times in the same year. Okay, so it just tilts you in

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,040
 as the train passes, it just sort of tips the carriages over the edge and then they tilt back on.

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,320
 Well, I think the train probably stops at the top because the other article it mentions that there

20
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,400
 would be some sort of a chapel built at the top of Mount Vesuvius where you could have a small

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,920
 funeral service before you. Oh yeah. Reward tipping your family member into the. Be better if the

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,120
 tracks went actually over the Caldera and then just tip them out as it was. Or just like the if the

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,000
 bottom just opened up, you just dropped them out. Is there always lava at the bottom? No, there's not.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
 See, that's, that's a weird thing that they always say with throwing people into volcanoes.

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,560
 I like that. This is what they always say. It's what they always say. If there's an active volcano,

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,160
 yeah, the fumes from a volcano are enough to kill you. So anyone trying to throw someone into a volcano

27
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,560
 would die immediately purely just off the back of the view. No, no, you could do it at a certain point.

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,600
 So there was one more source, which from 1878, which was just before Vesuvius had an eruption,

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:40,160
 I think, and it was like Vesuvius was getting ready. The West Lothian butte. It was very European,

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,280
 the local vapors. And I think it was sort of bubbling and waiting to erupt. And that's the ideal

31
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,120
 moment. That's when you want to catch it. There's a really funny letter that was written to

32
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,320
 the New York Times around this time about this idea. And it says it's recently occurred to

33
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,800
 certain thoughtful and genius persons that the constant fire maintained in the crater of Vesuvius

34
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,280
 generates an enormous amount of heat, which is wholly wasted. Occasionally, a native Italian has

35
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,640
 inadvertently slipped into the volcano and has vanished so suddenly and completely that not even

36
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,040
 a trace of garlic could be sent in the air. And nothing but a silent hand organ and a brave monkey

37
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,720
 remained to recall the fact that a citizen of free Italy has flashed into flame and dissipated

38
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,680
 in the gases. And it goes on because it's not just racist against the Italians. This is the New York

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,720
 Times. Even the stoutist British tourist who has toppled into the crater while searching for a good

40
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,920
 place to boil a tea kettle has disappeared before he could fairly mention his purpose of writing to

41
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,080
 the Times newspaper and denouncing the neglect of the local authorities to rail in the crater.

42
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,720
 Well, to be fair, they've got us to a tea, haven't they? Yeah.

43
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,880
 You've nailed us, yeah. Tea drinking and whining. I know sometimes we think journalism's always

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,760
 getting worse, but I think there we have definite proof that it sometimes gets better as well.

45
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,920
 I don't know. I think it's quite amusingly reported. Garlic has been an Italian trope, an Italian

46
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,840
 felon and not even his baguette and stripy jersey remain on the outside. I thought his trademark

47
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,660
 beret. And there's just one more part from this letter which is good and which the New

48
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,160
 Saper article reports as well, which is one of the advantages of this service, this funeral service,

49
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,520
 is that mornas have seen the remains of their loved ones comfortably cremated in the finest

50
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,920
 natural furnace in Europe can straight away distract their minds and delay their grief by enjoying

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,760
 the view from the summit of the mountain and making a subsequent visit to all points of interest

52
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,360
 in Naples and the vicinity. And the news paper actually reports that you'd get the train ride would

53
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,280
 come with a voucher to spend in Naples once you got out. I think this is really cool speaking of

54
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,280
 magma. So there's a new project to drill. See if we can drill further than we've drilled before

55
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:52,720
 into the earth and see if we can get basically to where the magma starts. And isn't it weird that

56
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,480
 the furthest we've ever sent an object away from this earth is 20 billion miles. So now I think

57
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,160
 it's the Voyager wasn't it. There was sent out in the 70s. It's now 20 billion miles away.

58
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,120
 The furthest we've ever got into the earth and it's not for want of trying is 12 kilometers.

59
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,880
 It's really hot down there. I mean it's really cold in space. Yeah. It's just as there's stuff there

60
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,960
 though. The geologist is just saying in space you got no stuff. People like it's such a big deal,

61
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,360
 but actually it's mostly space. There are a couple of molecules per cubic meter in space. That's

62
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,280
 true. But that's much much fewer than in the ground. Where there are loads of molecules literally

63
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,560
 every centimeter. That's more than you'll probably know. The Slates.com official explainer question of

64
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,200
 the year for 2007 was why don't we drop medical waste and nuclear waste into active volcanoes.

65
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,440
 Okay. And what was the answer? They'll blow up nuclear waste all over southern Italy.

66
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,640
 Oh, it will wrap it. It's basically put it in. It wouldn't. It's not hot enough to start

67
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,120
 pit from being radioactive, but it would just kind of fire it straight back into the atmosphere.

68
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,280
 So we don't have a nuclear volcanic eruption. Sorry, and I got a question of the year.

69
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,960
 I think that's one of the silliest questions I've ever heard. I read though that one of the issues

70
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,320
 with a volcano eruption is that obviously over the months after it, lava can just still travel

71
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,080
 towards towns and they don't know how to stop it. They don't know what to do. Right. One of the things

72
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,480
 that they tried back long time ago was they bombed the lava. So they literally bombed the area

73
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,960
 of where the lava was going into. Oh wow. George Patton did that. The idea was to divert

74
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,720
 the direction of the. If you can get it all in a channel. Yeah. So he launched a bombing attack

75
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,720
 on lava. Wow. There's a volcanic island called Ferdinandia, which is off the coast of Sicily.

76
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,720
 And it is only above sea level when it's erupting. So normally it's not. So it's not on very many maps.

77
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:50,000
 And so in 1986, the US Air Force flew over and bombed it thinking it was a Libyan submarine.

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,400
 Oh really? Yeah. There's that volcano in Tanzania, isn't there? The erupt's black lava.

79
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,880
 Oh yeah. It's the only example of of volcano erupting that substance in the world. And it's just

80
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,240
 because it's made of a carbon and titan instead of silicate silicate materials. But yeah, the lava is

81
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,200
 right. So it's called a very normal lava. Exactly. It can run at about 500 degrees Celsius, which is

82
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:17,200
 much cooler than normal lava. This is really cool. Sicilians used to use the slopes of Mount Etna to

83
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,440
 keep their food cold. Okay. Because there's snow all over the slopes of Mount Etna. So they used the

84
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,920
 caves in the side of the mountain to keep fruit cold and things like that in lemons. And yeah.

85
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,240
 Didn't Nero take snow down there and make like an ice cream kind of thing? He probably took credit

86
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,080
 for it, isn't he? You know Nero. He tramples over intellectual property rights of others.

87
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:48,640
 The land speed record on a bicycle was set on a, on a volcano. Was it? Yeah. It was on Ciro Negro,

88
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,400
 which is in Nicaragua, I think. And it's like a really steep slope. And so people go down there

89
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,640
 quite often for fun. And this was done by a Frenchman called Eric Baron, known as the Red Baron.

90
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,840
 And he reached 107 miles per hour before his carbon fiber mountain bike snapped into,

91
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,160
 sending him tumbling down the last section of the mountain. He broke five ribs.

92
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,360
 This locates a shoulder and tall muscles in his hands. Oh. But got the record.

93
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,080
 The record worth it. Do we know? Yeah. The thing I always see is when people are trying to break

94
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,480
 speed records and that, for example, cycling, you cycle along, but you cycle along with an enormous

95
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,680
 truck driving ahead of you really, and you're really close behind it. So you have to assess the speed

96
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,360
 quite carefully. And it's to get rid of the air resistance and all that. So that's if you're,

97
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,600
 if you're peddling, whereas this guy's just going down a massive mountain. It's a free railing. Yeah,

98
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,400
 it's more like plummeting really. Yeah, yeah. It feels like cheating as well. It's true. I was actually

99
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,880
 going to say this factful later in the podcast because my facts about running, but running is easier.

100
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,520
 Supposedly, I read this earlier today. I can believe it. Running is easier at about 20 degrees Celsius

101
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,160
 when the air temperature is there or higher, because there are fewer molecules to get in your way

102
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,720
 as you run much easier in space, much more difficult when you're going through the

103
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,200
 I don't believe that much different. I only lost that one because I think there are a lot of

104
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
 molecules out today. Yeah, my lane was full of molecules to be fair.

105
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:24,000
 Okay, time for back number two and that is Harkin. Okay, my fact this week is that in 2010, an

106
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,960
 abandoned wastewater treatment plant in Baltimore was found to be home to an estimated 107 million

107
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:39,520
 spiders with a density of 35,176 spiders per cubic meter. I just feel sorry for the work experience boy

108
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:46,000
 who had to count them. He didn't have a fear of spiders before, but he does now. Yeah, it wasn't

109
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,040
 estimated number and then they've kind of extrapolated that to get the number. And they were all alive.

110
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,800
 They're all alive, yeah. They are great though. Some of them can catch and eat fish. I think they've

111
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,080
 just found out. They found spiders can. They found out there are at least five species of spider,

112
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,280
 which one of them is the Dolomedy spider, which can catch fish. The fish are on average twice their

113
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,120
 size and they anchor their hind legs to like a stone in a lake or a river and then they grab the fish

114
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,000
 with their front legs. That's amazing. It's pretty impressive. Yeah, that is really cool. I read that

115
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,640
 they found not too long ago the oldest spider web ever. Okay, and it was in it was in East Sussex, I

116
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,480
 think, and it was in it was in amber. Oh yeah, it was like from dinosaur days and they they were

117
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,200
 studying it. Can I ask a definitely very stupid question? By all means. Yeah, all right, cool. Yeah,

118
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,880
 I'm learning to ask now. Why are we not for the things that we want to preserve, let's say for

119
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,640
 a long time in the future, just coating it in amber? You know, like imagine if dinosaurs

120
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,200
 cover themselves in amber, we might have a full dinosaur. No, no, I actually think that's brilliant.

121
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,120
 Do you? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know where we would get enough amber because obviously it's

122
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,760
 low quantities. I'm sure we have better ways of keeping things like I'm sure I just I'm

123
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,480
 older. But just from history, the only things that have survived through that are in a perfect

124
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,560
 state are things in amber. Yeah. And that just seems like an obvious time capsule of a thing.

125
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:18,240
 Okay, cool. Hey, yeah, I'm completely told. So why do spiders not get stuck on their own

126
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,920
 webs? Do you know that? Do they have some kind of lubrication around their legs? Well, nobody is

127
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,880
 at 100% sure, but what it seems like is that they leave their glue on the webs in only little blobs

128
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,360
 all the way around, and they just simply tip to around it so they don't stand on their own bits of

129
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,080
 glue. And if they do stand on it, then it's a little bit of a pain like getting, you know, chewing gum

130
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,960
 on your shoe or whatever, but it's not that bad. But when a fly comes into it, he hits like 50 blobs

131
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,080
 at once. And so that's what makes them stuck. Oh, I think it's such a big amount. So it's kind of like

132
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,240
 in a Bond film or something where you have to avoid all the lasers if you're a fly. Like Catherine

133
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,520
 Zeta Jones in that film has to creep around them. Amazing glue. Entrapment. Yeah. Maybe great film. Yeah.

134
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,120
 So the Ogreface spider called as such because it has massive eyes, which means it can't go out in

135
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,160
 daylight because it's much too bright for it. But anyway, it is pretty ugly and it does this really

136
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,240
 clever thing. So you reminded me when you said the spiders dropped little droplets on their web.

137
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,000
 First of all, it spins a web between its front legs. So acts as a sort of like a fly catcher.

138
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,760
 So it will hang down from its back legs above wherever it wants to stay to catch the flies. And then

139
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,960
 it swings this web or net that it's made between its front legs at its prey and catches them. And

140
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,520
 the way that it knows when to swing is it creates a target by doing a little white poo on the ground.

141
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,680
 And it leaves a little white blob of feces as a target. And as soon as it's in the dark, as soon as

142
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,360
 it sees an insect of some sort, cross this bit of poo, drops down upon it, gets it in its net. Wow.

143
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:55,040
 It consumes it. Very clever. What do you reckon the lifespan of a spider is 10 years?

144
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:02,800
 So I don't know the answer. What I do know is I know the, as so far as we know, the oldest living

145
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,120
 spider. So the spider with the longest lifespan. Okay. 28 years. It's in Mexico. They had one that was

146
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,160
 captured in 1935. It's the world's oldest spider. And it's 28. And what's its secret? Does it drink a lot of

147
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,240
 milk or bird eating? Bird eating. Okay. I eat birds. I smoke twenty cigarettes a day. I don't

148
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,880
 exercise. I don't know how I do it. There was, I was reading about the oldest recorded person

149
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,600
 who lived to be 122nd star in 1997. Yeah. I'll there. Yeah. And she quit smoking I think five years

150
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,200
 before she died. So she was 117. She went, okay, come on, this has been enough. But I quite enjoyed,

151
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,080
 I put dip at this on Twitter the other day. She was born in the year that Edison made the first

152
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:53,440
 sound transmission. And she died in the year that Hanson released... Was that what did for her in

153
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,000
 the end? Yep. But she was the one who said that I only have one wrinkle and I'm sitting on it.

154
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,840
 Yeah. Oh, that's for her. She was cracking. So just put the original fact in context, which is that

155
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:12,160
 there were 107 million spiders here with a density of 35,000 per cubic meter. The standard amount

156
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,160
 of spiders that we think are in like a British field would be about 49 per square meter.

157
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,600
 That's quite a lot though. It's still quite a lot. It turns. Yeah. That was a study done in 1958

158
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,880
 in Sussex, Meadow. In the 1950s, if you look at photos, they were actually overwhelmed with spiders

159
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,320
 all those films. That's why everyone's got their mouths shut in early photographs is to stop the

160
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:41,840
 spiders getting in. So is this a case of, you know, when they say if you leave rats and they

161
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,320
 breed in the root or any, is this a case of just a total isolated sort of spider farm? I think they're

162
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,760
 just... Oh, the Baltimore one. Yeah. Yeah, that's basically it. They had no predators there. They were

163
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,480
 allowed to just create as much as they wanted and eventually there was a hundred and seven million of them.

164
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,160
 It's extraordinary. You need a massive class. Wouldn't you to put that out? Yeah. Big shoe. What have

165
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,160
 they done with it? Do we know? The way it was worded, I think, I glanced at our article. They said

166
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,080
 the people at the Baltimore waste water treatment plant put out a call for extreme spider help.

167
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:23,040
 There's an understatement. I think the grammar's different. Stream spider, semi-colon help.

168
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,920
 Do you think spider-bad ever got any false calls of people wanting him to just get rid of the spider?

169
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,760
 Guys, I'm dealing with some proper growing here. Batman, bat, same thing. That's true. Yeah.

170
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:43,840
 Catwoman are still not married. Okay, time for fact number three and that's my fact. My fact this week

171
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,720
 is that according to the Vatican, the greatest pop album of all time is revolver by the Beatles.

172
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,920
 I would have thought they would choose Abbey Road, personally, but treasurer I know. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

173
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:05,680
 It's greeted with the devotional hum. What, according to the Vatican? Well, it's the Vatican newspaper

174
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,160
 who did a, they published a list of what they consider to be the best albums of all time. Is the Vatican

175
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:20,400
 newspaper called the Prairie Mail? It's called Losevatar Romano, I can't pronounce it. Which is a very

176
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:27,920
 funny pun in Italian. The weird thing is, first off, the Beatles were the ones who were more famous

177
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,120
 than any band in the world for having an association with a fight with the church when John Lennon said

178
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,600
 that the Beatles were bigger than Christianity. Oh, he's a bigger than Jesus, but I thought he said it.

179
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,720
 Sorry, then Jesus. But he also said Christianity would shrink and fade away in that very same

180
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,880
 piece. But I thought he said it despairingly. I think it wasn't, I didn't think he was

181
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,960
 celebrating the fact that they're bigger than Jesus. He was just talking about it. It was the very

182
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,520
 notion of what he said. I mean, it led to people were burning their records in the streets throwing

183
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,680
 all their merchandise. It was a huge backlash. Huge backlash. It was one of the biggest

184
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,920
 sort of moments of their career that they had to recover from. Wow. But so it's interesting. They

185
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,640
 given him a pardon now. They've pardoned him for saying what he said. They said the Beatles were

186
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,840
 satanic music. But the list is just, I mean, it's pretty, it's just a mismatch. You don't expect the

187
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:20,880
 Vatican to be saying the Beatles, David Crosby, Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, Donald Fagan. Donald Fagan

188
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,840
 is the lead singer, Steeley Dan. So not even a Steeley Dan album. A solo work. Yeah, spin-off.

189
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,880
 Yeah, spin-off. It's like the equivalent of like nominating a John Bon Jovi solo album and not a

190
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,480
 Bon Jovi album. Like it's just a very obscure choice. So I think this newspaper is trying to

191
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,760
 hip up, isn't it? I've read the Vatican thought it was getting a bit dated. All this, we still

192
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,000
 love the hymns. We like our big long robes and our cross necklaces. I think there was a movement

193
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,720
 in within this newspaper to say, look, we're with it, guys. And so now they report, they so they

194
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,120
 review Harry Potter, which is again, that has had issues with the church. And they said that the

195
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,080
 Half Blood Prince was good because it showed a clear line of demarcation between good and evil.

196
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,640
 That's interesting, because the Vatican's exorcist really didn't like it. He came out here. No, he says

197
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,200
 it's satanic. Yeah. He also thinks that yoga is satanic. I think he needs to, he needs to get with it.

198
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:23,680
 He's 89. There was a big feature about this paper in the Guardian, and it said that until 2007,

199
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:30,080
 this was kind of the old days for Lose Vittore, there were two kinds of articles. The first one was

200
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,440
 those in which a Vatican department had definitely directly intervened in. And they had a code for

201
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,520
 that, which was three asterisks placed above or near the article. But the other kind,

202
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,000
 the Comich didn't have the asterisks on, with those which have been written by Lose Vittore's stuff.

203
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,160
 But they were so careful not to embarrass anyone that these articles were totally unreadably boring.

204
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,760
 You got a choice of reading either propaganda or tedium. But that's kind of changed now. I believe

205
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,400
 they've shaken it up a bit. But it's not the, it's not exactly the official voice of the church,

206
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,520
 is it? It's in a weird place between yeah, official and unofficial. It's allowed, it's allowed in

207
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,880
 the Vatican. It's a paper that's kind of seen as a daily paper there. Yeah. And it seems to have a

208
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,280
 lot of, it's, it's the place where if the Pope had something to say, there'll be the people to publish it.

209
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:22,400
 Very much the Middlesbrough Gazette. Do you guys know about the Apostolic Penitentiary system?

210
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,200
 Been through it mate. Yeah. That's on the title of our spin-off podcast.

211
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:34,480
 20 years in. No, what is it? So it's this tribunal. It's the oldest,

212
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,720
 it's the oldest established body of the Holy See. It's existence 1179. And it's where you go when

213
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,560
 you've committed a sin that's too heinous to be forgiven by a priest. So if you've got to confess

214
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,240
 something, you go to confession, the priest is like, whoa, out of my pay grade. Then you go to the

215
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,000
 Apostolic Penitentiary Tribunal and there are five sins that are too evil. Should we guess what they are?

216
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,800
 Yeah, go on. I'll go for murder. Oh no, murder is easy. Genocide even is, you can get genocide

217
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:07,520
 forgiven by a standard priest. Yeah. What? Yeah. What your local, how many Hail Mary's do you have to

218
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,560
 say for that? Look, it takes a couple of weeks, reciting in your roots. So three of them are.

219
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,120
 Cushing the Pope. What's Cushing in? Putting your finger up his bum.

220
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:27,840
 Defacing his ring. So most of the same, killing the Pope, you can't kill the Pope. That is understandable.

221
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,920
 Yeah. So there are three which just apply to people who want to work for the church. So if you're

222
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,360
 a priest and you've been in any way involved in an abortion, then you have to go here to confess it.

223
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,400
 Right. To directly to the Pope. And if you're a priest who's been confessed to and then you've broken

224
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,200
 your oath not to share your confession. And then the only other one that normal people like us can

225
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,280
 commit and we'd have to be sent to the Vatican is if we deface the Eucharist. What you mean at local

226
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,200
 church, if I get body of Christ and I drop it, I think dropping it is right. You can play the five second rule

227
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:04,160
 on it. That's probably the three-day rule of gaffling church. So it's more if you're doing it

228
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,240
 intentionally. There was a scientist in America recently, for instance, who drove a rusty nail

229
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,080
 through a bit of communion wafer. And I think the church was pretty pissed off with him about that.

230
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,200
 I like that. I just like the idea of the Pope listening to pop music. I don't think he does. It's

231
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,280
 obviously just this paper that's saying it. But there are a lot of, I like when you read about people

232
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,000
 who are in high power of positions and they admit to liking certain things. So the Dalai Lama is

233
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,480
 very good mates with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Beastie Boys, which is just such a weird

234
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,680
 mismatch, but he recognized that he could put free Tibet concerts on, use the power of these pop stars.

235
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,840
 And he realized that the people who spoke to people, so he became very good mates with them. David

236
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,040
 Cameron, do you know what his favorite album is? Coldplay? Coldplay album? No, he said that it was

237
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,640
 "Dark Side of the Moon" by Paul Floyd. But everyone knows that that's a lie because everyone knows

238
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,200
 that his favorite album is "The Queen is Dead" by The Smiths. But he can't say that now that he's

239
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,480
 prime minister, though he had constantly said that before becoming prime minister. Then when he did say

240
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,320
 he loves the Smith, both Marcy and Johnny Marr came out saying, "You are not allowed to like us."

241
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,280
 Like, "Band, David Cameron." Yeah, that's ridiculous. It's not really up to them. I know, I just like

242
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,600
 them coming out and saying, "It's ours. You're not allowed to like this." All musicians come out and

243
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,280
 band politicians from liking their music. After a certain age, you shouldn't have a favorite album,

244
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,520
 you should have a favorite. I don't know. Symphony. What's your favorite symphony, Andy? I haven't

245
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,400
 reached that age yet. It's my favorite album. It's my favorite album.

246
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:40,880
 On niche newspapers, can I tell you about my favorite one, which is "Jail Mail," which is a

247
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,360
 relatively new magazine, and it's for everyone in the prison system. There are two others which

248
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:52,080
 are called "Inside Time and Converse," as in "Convict and Verse," so "Converse." I think the daily

249
00:22:52,080 --> 00:23:00,000
 jail would have been better, but I'm not going to. I think it's a weekly anyway. Anyway, it was hugely

250
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 popular. It's had to double its print run for its next edition. It has advice on what to do

251
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,960
 when you're up before the governor and details of reading projects and how to find employment.

252
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,040
 Is it written by people in by prisoners? I think a lot of it is, yeah.

253
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:26,080
 Form and use of the world. I just think that's cool. Can I just on the Beatles? I didn't realise

254
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,280
 that apparently their concerts all just smelled of urine, and if you looked around the aisles,

255
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,000
 you saw women's P and Bob Geldof as tested to this. This is a room because women used to turn up

256
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,480
 and wet themselves so excited to make. These days of Rolling Stones gig smell of urine, but that's the

257
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:49,360
 act that's nothing. Okay, let's move on to our final fact, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray. My fact is

258
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,600
 that for the first 50 years of the Olympics, the only event was the 200-meter sprint, which must have

259
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,720
 made the two weeks of the competition extremely boring in the most part. It's just the modern Olympics.

260
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,360
 No, this is the ancient Greek Olympics. All right, so this is from a book I've just got called

261
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,880
 Eureka. Everything you always wanted to know about the ancient Greeks, but were afraid to ask

262
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,240
 by a guy called Peter Jones, and it looks like it's full of good things, and it basically says,

263
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,800
 for the first 50 years, it was the Olympic game, not the Olympic games, which is a nice way of putting

264
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,520
 it. And then after 50 years there, did the 400-meter race. But the cool thing is, if you want it,

265
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,520
 the entire Olympiad was named after you for the next four years, so it would become the Kevin

266
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,280
 Olympics or whatever that was, instead of the Athens Olympics. It's not great. It's really cool.

267
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,680
 The Usain Bolt Olympics. Yeah, and then they started adding funcier things later, like boxing,

268
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,560
 wrestling, and chariot racing. After a couple, after 200 years, they added a racing armor.

269
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:46,320
 Oh, that sounds good. Yeah, that's great. I read that that was the racing armor. The only body

270
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,280
 coverings was a helmet and shin guards. Wow. That was what the race and the rest of it was completely

271
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,160
 naked. Okay, I wasn't imagining that at all. I was thinking big heavy plates of armor, so it's

272
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,240
 a challenge, like American football or whatever. But the 200 meters wasn't even 200 meters, was it?

273
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,080
 I think it was 192. Yeah, that's true. Did they call it the 200 meters, if we just called it that?

274
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,680
 We've said approximation. It was called a stadium, which is where we get the word stadium from,

275
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,160
 and there was a measurement of a stage based on that. Okay, cool. And there were other games as well.

276
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,080
 I didn't realize this. There was the Pythian Games in Delphi. It was really short games.

277
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:28,000
 And the Nomean Games. And if you wanted the games at Delphi, you got Laurel, obviously at the

278
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,960
 Olympics, you got Olive, at the ISP3 in Games, you got Pine. And at the Nomean Games, it was Celery,

279
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,400
 which you won, which I find very pleasing. Where the Olympics were held in 2012 in London,

280
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,960
 that Burra Newham is the most physically in active Burra in the whole of the UK. Wow. That's good.

281
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,040
 Yeah. That's where I live. Is it? Yeah. I live in Hackney, but I'm literally, I'm 10 minutes away

282
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,760
 from Stratford. 39.17% of people in Newham take no exercise at all. Where's Newham?

283
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,080
 Stratford. It's time it's away from where you live. Yeah, but I've never heard anything. He could be

284
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:10,800
 asked to go there. In the 1932 Olympics, 3,000 meter steeple chase, it was actually run over 3,400 meters

285
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,960
 because an official lost count of the number of laps. That's so good. That's so good. Yeah.

286
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,360
 And you'd be, you'd realize soon after you'd forgotten, I don't know how many they've done.

287
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,600
 And you'd wonder if anyone else would spot you. Yeah. Oh, the poor guy. Well, the runners,

288
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,800
 is they coming in? Is they going to the final? Yeah. Well, he wasn't looking at you and you're not

289
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,200
 saying anything. You're like, why? And another one? Well, you just try and bluff it out, wouldn't you?

290
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,040
 Because you'd know if you stop them too early, you think, I definitely don't want to stop them too early,

291
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,960
 because they'll really know. But if I make them do another lap, it'll look like it's their fault

292
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,000
 for being slow. Yeah. Was the one, the person who crossed the boundary at the right time,

293
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,520
 or the person who finished at the wrong end time? I think it was the same person, but it would have

294
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,760
 been at the end when... Oh, my gosh. Because you must start. And everyone must have put on a real bus

295
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,960
 to get to the finishing line, and then no whistle, no crowds cheering, just... That would be a great

296
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:12,160
 Olympic race, though we're not telling you how many laps. That's really a lot. Sometimes it's one,

297
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,360
 sometimes it's 95. Yeah, that's a really good idea. Okay, so that... I'm the torture. And then we put

298
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:25,040
 them all in amber at the end. It's a really good idea. So there's no adequate training for it. Yeah,

299
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,240
 cool. Well, that is the spirit of amateurism, which they would want. They wouldn't, they weren't,

300
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,360
 they weren't amateurs from the start in the Olympic race. No, they weren't. They got loads of money,

301
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,480
 didn't they? Yeah. In their engine Greek limits. I think someone's worked out that,

302
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,920
 Gaius Appelius Diocles was extremely good at winning money, I think, in his Olympic games,

303
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,000
 and he won a lot of events. And it's been worked out that he won what would be the equivalent today

304
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,760
 of over 15 billion dollars in modern day cash. Wow, 15 billion. Just been winning in

305
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,280
 under the Olympic events. I think they work out on the percentage against, like, say, for instance,

306
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,880
 someone in the army, or something that we can... Yes. It's really hard, though. It's so hard doing that.

307
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,840
 There are three or four different ways of calculating it. Anyway, sorry, it was enough to... So he earned

308
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,240
 enough to pay the entire salary of the whole Roman army for more than two months, so they were like,

309
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,040
 "Wow, which he didn't do." They got... They asked him in the classic, "What are you going to do with all your

310
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:25,200
 money?" "What are you going to do?" Do you want to hear an Olympic-steamed joke? Yes, please.

311
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,720
 Marcus was so slow in the races that the groundsman locked him in for the night because he thought he

312
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:41,440
 was a statue. Isn't that good? Is that from... That's an ancient athletics joke. Yeah, yeah.

313
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,160
 Oh, I was going to say, in 1908, when we hosted the London Olympics. First of all, we did... So that was

314
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,400
 obviously the first time we hosted it, and we weren't supposed to host it. The reason, in fact,

315
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,280
 fitting me in this podcast that we didn't was because I think somewhere in Italy was supposed to host

316
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,920
 it, and Vesuvius erupted in 1906, so they couldn't... So we stepped in like the heroes that we are. We

317
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:05,440
 then copped it up in a number of ways. So we included... We had all the flags up on polls around the stadium,

318
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,440
 as you do. That was the first year that became tradition. We had the Chinese and Japanese flag up,

319
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,560
 neither of which countries competed. We forgot to include the Swedish and American flags, which

320
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,480
 were competing. So obviously the Swedes were really polite about that, and we're like, oh no,

321
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,680
 don't worry about it. So we'll just never mind. And America brought their own flag and their own poll,

322
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:29,280
 and hoisted it up themselves. Of course they did. It was sponsored by Oxo, by the way,

323
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,360
 for 1908 Olympic Games. Yeah, it was actually sponsored by Oxo, Indian foot powder,

324
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:40,000
 an old doll mouthwash. Fantastic things to be sponsored by. Was that Oxo, comma, Indian foot powder?

325
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,240
 I don't think it was used for that. Oxo was originally used to cure athletes.

326
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:52,640
 No. And we are announcing actually that today is our first podcast that's sponsored by Oxo Indian

327
00:29:52,640 --> 00:30:00,160
 foot powder. In India they have a thing called the Rural Olympics, and they have three types of

328
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:05,200
 competitions in there. They have rural games, such as Kabadi or wrestling, modern sports,

329
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,360
 such as athletics and football, and performing sports, such as acrobatics, twisting an iron rod

330
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,440
 by placing it on the other example, passing a tractor over the rib cage, and cracking a big stone

331
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,400
 by placing it on the chest, etc. Would you mean letting a tractor go over your chest?

332
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,640
 Yeah, that's just one of the sports. How can you win at letting something happen?

333
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,840
 It's more of not losing. It's more of a disappointment after the tractor drives over your chest,

334
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,080
 and you look up and you see a judge giving you a five. Five?

335
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,760
 My lungs have collapsed. Come on. That's why you got a five.

336
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:49,680
 I have a fact, this is really fun. They think that the starting position for running races

337
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,240
 at the ancient Greek Olympics was just standing up next to each other, and with your arms stretched

338
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,240
 out in front of you, as opposed to the crunching. What a funny way of starting a race, it's not brilliant.

339
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,480
 Well, it might work if you then push your arms backwards, and it might give you some momentum.

340
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,680
 Yeah, it's a good point. It's the greatest.

341
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:15,440
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thanks so much for listening everyone.

342
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,120
