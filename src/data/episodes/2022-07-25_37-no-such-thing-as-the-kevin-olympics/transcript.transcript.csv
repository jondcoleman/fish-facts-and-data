00:00:00,00:00:04,We run it on qi a few years ago. Yeah. Which was there's no such thing as a fish.
00:00:04,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:12,"He says it right there, first paragraph. No such thing as a fish."
00:00:12,00:00:22,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:22,00:00:27,coming to you from the qi offices in Covenant Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber and sitting here
00:00:27,00:00:32,"with Anna Chazinski, Andy Murray and James Harkin and once again we've gathered around the microphone"
00:00:32,00:00:36,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:46,"Starting with fact number one and that is Chazinski. Yeah, my fact this week is that in 1874 there was"
00:00:46,00:00:51,a plan to transport dead bodies from all over Europe to mount Vesuvius and throw them in.
00:00:52,00:00:58,"Was this the plan of a supervillain? Well, maybe, maybe. So it's reported in a couple of"
00:00:58,00:01:02,newspaper articles from the time there's one article in the Daily Gazette for Middlesbrough
00:01:02,00:01:11,which describes how an American company has got some capital to erect railways or
00:01:11,00:01:15,like have trains running all over Europe and it takes people who have died who want to be
00:01:15,00:01:20,cremated in Mount Vesuvius and it runs them up Mount Vesuvius and then it tosses them into the
00:01:20,00:01:28,"burning lava below. And this, so I can't find any proof of the history. I can't find that the"
00:01:28,00:01:33,company ever happened but seems strange that it would only be reported in the Middlesbrough Gazette.
00:01:33,00:01:39,"It's also reported in the New York Times in the same year. Okay, so it just tilts you in"
00:01:39,00:01:45,"as the train passes, it just sort of tips the carriages over the edge and then they tilt back on."
00:01:45,00:01:48,"Well, I think the train probably stops at the top because the other article it mentions that there"
00:01:48,00:01:52,would be some sort of a chapel built at the top of Mount Vesuvius where you could have a small
00:01:52,00:01:57,funeral service before you. Oh yeah. Reward tipping your family member into the. Be better if the
00:01:57,00:02:03,tracks went actually over the Caldera and then just tip them out as it was. Or just like the if the
00:02:03,00:02:08,"bottom just opened up, you just dropped them out. Is there always lava at the bottom? No, there's not."
00:02:08,00:02:11,"See, that's, that's a weird thing that they always say with throwing people into volcanoes."
00:02:11,00:02:16,"I like that. This is what they always say. It's what they always say. If there's an active volcano,"
00:02:16,00:02:22,"yeah, the fumes from a volcano are enough to kill you. So anyone trying to throw someone into a volcano"
00:02:22,00:02:26,"would die immediately purely just off the back of the view. No, no, you could do it at a certain point."
00:02:26,00:02:31,"So there was one more source, which from 1878, which was just before Vesuvius had an eruption,"
00:02:31,00:02:40,"I think, and it was like Vesuvius was getting ready. The West Lothian butte. It was very European,"
00:02:40,00:02:45,the local vapors. And I think it was sort of bubbling and waiting to erupt. And that's the ideal
00:02:45,00:02:49,moment. That's when you want to catch it. There's a really funny letter that was written to
00:02:49,00:02:56,the New York Times around this time about this idea. And it says it's recently occurred to
00:02:56,00:03:00,certain thoughtful and genius persons that the constant fire maintained in the crater of Vesuvius
00:03:00,00:03:05,"generates an enormous amount of heat, which is wholly wasted. Occasionally, a native Italian has"
00:03:05,00:03:10,inadvertently slipped into the volcano and has vanished so suddenly and completely that not even
00:03:10,00:03:17,a trace of garlic could be sent in the air. And nothing but a silent hand organ and a brave monkey
00:03:17,00:03:22,remained to recall the fact that a citizen of free Italy has flashed into flame and dissipated
00:03:22,00:03:27,in the gases. And it goes on because it's not just racist against the Italians. This is the New York
00:03:27,00:03:32,Times. Even the stoutist British tourist who has toppled into the crater while searching for a good
00:03:32,00:03:37,place to boil a tea kettle has disappeared before he could fairly mention his purpose of writing to
00:03:37,00:03:42,the Times newspaper and denouncing the neglect of the local authorities to rail in the crater.
00:03:42,00:03:44,"Well, to be fair, they've got us to a tea, haven't they? Yeah."
00:03:44,00:03:50,"You've nailed us, yeah. Tea drinking and whining. I know sometimes we think journalism's always"
00:03:50,00:03:55,"getting worse, but I think there we have definite proof that it sometimes gets better as well."
00:03:55,00:04:01,"I don't know. I think it's quite amusingly reported. Garlic has been an Italian trope, an Italian"
00:04:01,00:04:07,felon and not even his baguette and stripy jersey remain on the outside. I thought his trademark
00:04:07,00:04:11,beret. And there's just one more part from this letter which is good and which the New
00:04:11,00:04:16,"Saper article reports as well, which is one of the advantages of this service, this funeral service,"
00:04:16,00:04:21,is that mornas have seen the remains of their loved ones comfortably cremated in the finest
00:04:21,00:04:25,natural furnace in Europe can straight away distract their minds and delay their grief by enjoying
00:04:25,00:04:29,the view from the summit of the mountain and making a subsequent visit to all points of interest
00:04:29,00:04:35,in Naples and the vicinity. And the news paper actually reports that you'd get the train ride would
00:04:35,00:04:41,come with a voucher to spend in Naples once you got out. I think this is really cool speaking of
00:04:41,00:04:45,magma. So there's a new project to drill. See if we can drill further than we've drilled before
00:04:45,00:04:52,into the earth and see if we can get basically to where the magma starts. And isn't it weird that
00:04:52,00:04:58,the furthest we've ever sent an object away from this earth is 20 billion miles. So now I think
00:04:58,00:05:02,it's the Voyager wasn't it. There was sent out in the 70s. It's now 20 billion miles away.
00:05:02,00:05:07,The furthest we've ever got into the earth and it's not for want of trying is 12 kilometers.
00:05:07,00:05:12,It's really hot down there. I mean it's really cold in space. Yeah. It's just as there's stuff there
00:05:12,00:05:16,"though. The geologist is just saying in space you got no stuff. People like it's such a big deal,"
00:05:16,00:05:21,but actually it's mostly space. There are a couple of molecules per cubic meter in space. That's
00:05:21,00:05:27,true. But that's much much fewer than in the ground. Where there are loads of molecules literally
00:05:27,00:05:34,every centimeter. That's more than you'll probably know. The Slates.com official explainer question of
00:05:34,00:05:41,the year for 2007 was why don't we drop medical waste and nuclear waste into active volcanoes.
00:05:41,00:05:45,Okay. And what was the answer? They'll blow up nuclear waste all over southern Italy.
00:05:45,00:05:50,"Oh, it will wrap it. It's basically put it in. It wouldn't. It's not hot enough to start"
00:05:50,00:05:55,"pit from being radioactive, but it would just kind of fire it straight back into the atmosphere."
00:05:55,00:05:59,"So we don't have a nuclear volcanic eruption. Sorry, and I got a question of the year."
00:05:59,00:06:04,I think that's one of the silliest questions I've ever heard. I read though that one of the issues
00:06:04,00:06:10,"with a volcano eruption is that obviously over the months after it, lava can just still travel"
00:06:10,00:06:14,towards towns and they don't know how to stop it. They don't know what to do. Right. One of the things
00:06:14,00:06:20,that they tried back long time ago was they bombed the lava. So they literally bombed the area
00:06:20,00:06:24,of where the lava was going into. Oh wow. George Patton did that. The idea was to divert
00:06:24,00:06:30,the direction of the. If you can get it all in a channel. Yeah. So he launched a bombing attack
00:06:30,00:06:36,"on lava. Wow. There's a volcanic island called Ferdinandia, which is off the coast of Sicily."
00:06:36,00:06:42,And it is only above sea level when it's erupting. So normally it's not. So it's not on very many maps.
00:06:42,00:06:50,"And so in 1986, the US Air Force flew over and bombed it thinking it was a Libyan submarine."
00:06:50,00:06:56,"Oh really? Yeah. There's that volcano in Tanzania, isn't there? The erupt's black lava."
00:06:56,00:07:00,Oh yeah. It's the only example of of volcano erupting that substance in the world. And it's just
00:07:00,00:07:06,"because it's made of a carbon and titan instead of silicate silicate materials. But yeah, the lava is"
00:07:06,00:07:11,"right. So it's called a very normal lava. Exactly. It can run at about 500 degrees Celsius, which is"
00:07:11,00:07:17,much cooler than normal lava. This is really cool. Sicilians used to use the slopes of Mount Etna to
00:07:17,00:07:23,keep their food cold. Okay. Because there's snow all over the slopes of Mount Etna. So they used the
00:07:23,00:07:27,caves in the side of the mountain to keep fruit cold and things like that in lemons. And yeah.
00:07:27,00:07:32,Didn't Nero take snow down there and make like an ice cream kind of thing? He probably took credit
00:07:32,00:07:38,"for it, isn't he? You know Nero. He tramples over intellectual property rights of others."
00:07:40,00:07:48,"The land speed record on a bicycle was set on a, on a volcano. Was it? Yeah. It was on Ciro Negro,"
00:07:48,00:07:54,"which is in Nicaragua, I think. And it's like a really steep slope. And so people go down there"
00:07:54,00:08:00,"quite often for fun. And this was done by a Frenchman called Eric Baron, known as the Red Baron."
00:08:00,00:08:05,"And he reached 107 miles per hour before his carbon fiber mountain bike snapped into,"
00:08:05,00:08:10,sending him tumbling down the last section of the mountain. He broke five ribs.
00:08:10,00:08:15,This locates a shoulder and tall muscles in his hands. Oh. But got the record.
00:08:15,00:08:20,The record worth it. Do we know? Yeah. The thing I always see is when people are trying to break
00:08:20,00:08:24,"speed records and that, for example, cycling, you cycle along, but you cycle along with an enormous"
00:08:24,00:08:29,"truck driving ahead of you really, and you're really close behind it. So you have to assess the speed"
00:08:29,00:08:33,"quite carefully. And it's to get rid of the air resistance and all that. So that's if you're,"
00:08:33,00:08:37,"if you're peddling, whereas this guy's just going down a massive mountain. It's a free railing. Yeah,"
00:08:37,00:08:42,"it's more like plummeting really. Yeah, yeah. It feels like cheating as well. It's true. I was actually"
00:08:42,00:08:46,"going to say this factful later in the podcast because my facts about running, but running is easier."
00:08:46,00:08:53,"Supposedly, I read this earlier today. I can believe it. Running is easier at about 20 degrees Celsius"
00:08:53,00:08:58,"when the air temperature is there or higher, because there are fewer molecules to get in your way"
00:08:58,00:09:02,"as you run much easier in space, much more difficult when you're going through the"
00:09:05,00:09:09,I don't believe that much different. I only lost that one because I think there are a lot of
00:09:09,00:09:13,"molecules out today. Yeah, my lane was full of molecules to be fair."
00:09:13,00:09:24,"Okay, time for back number two and that is Harkin. Okay, my fact this week is that in 2010, an"
00:09:24,00:09:30,abandoned wastewater treatment plant in Baltimore was found to be home to an estimated 107 million
00:09:30,00:09:39,"spiders with a density of 35,176 spiders per cubic meter. I just feel sorry for the work experience boy"
00:09:39,00:09:46,"who had to count them. He didn't have a fear of spiders before, but he does now. Yeah, it wasn't"
00:09:46,00:09:51,estimated number and then they've kind of extrapolated that to get the number. And they were all alive.
00:09:51,00:09:54,"They're all alive, yeah. They are great though. Some of them can catch and eat fish. I think they've"
00:09:54,00:10:00,"just found out. They found spiders can. They found out there are at least five species of spider,"
00:10:00,00:10:05,"which one of them is the Dolomedy spider, which can catch fish. The fish are on average twice their"
00:10:05,00:10:11,size and they anchor their hind legs to like a stone in a lake or a river and then they grab the fish
00:10:11,00:10:16,"with their front legs. That's amazing. It's pretty impressive. Yeah, that is really cool. I read that"
00:10:16,00:10:22,"they found not too long ago the oldest spider web ever. Okay, and it was in it was in East Sussex, I"
00:10:22,00:10:28,"think, and it was in it was in amber. Oh yeah, it was like from dinosaur days and they they were"
00:10:28,00:10:35,"studying it. Can I ask a definitely very stupid question? By all means. Yeah, all right, cool. Yeah,"
00:10:35,00:10:40,"I'm learning to ask now. Why are we not for the things that we want to preserve, let's say for"
00:10:40,00:10:44,"a long time in the future, just coating it in amber? You know, like imagine if dinosaurs"
00:10:44,00:10:49,"cover themselves in amber, we might have a full dinosaur. No, no, I actually think that's brilliant."
00:10:49,00:10:55,Do you? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know where we would get enough amber because obviously it's
00:10:55,00:10:59,low quantities. I'm sure we have better ways of keeping things like I'm sure I just I'm
00:10:59,00:11:04,"older. But just from history, the only things that have survived through that are in a perfect"
00:11:04,00:11:10,state are things in amber. Yeah. And that just seems like an obvious time capsule of a thing.
00:11:10,00:11:18,"Okay, cool. Hey, yeah, I'm completely told. So why do spiders not get stuck on their own"
00:11:18,00:11:23,"webs? Do you know that? Do they have some kind of lubrication around their legs? Well, nobody is"
00:11:23,00:11:30,"at 100% sure, but what it seems like is that they leave their glue on the webs in only little blobs"
00:11:30,00:11:35,"all the way around, and they just simply tip to around it so they don't stand on their own bits of"
00:11:35,00:11:40,"glue. And if they do stand on it, then it's a little bit of a pain like getting, you know, chewing gum"
00:11:40,00:11:44,"on your shoe or whatever, but it's not that bad. But when a fly comes into it, he hits like 50 blobs"
00:11:44,00:11:50,"at once. And so that's what makes them stuck. Oh, I think it's such a big amount. So it's kind of like"
00:11:50,00:11:54,in a Bond film or something where you have to avoid all the lasers if you're a fly. Like Catherine
00:11:54,00:12:01,Zeta Jones in that film has to creep around them. Amazing glue. Entrapment. Yeah. Maybe great film. Yeah.
00:12:01,00:12:05,"So the Ogreface spider called as such because it has massive eyes, which means it can't go out in"
00:12:05,00:12:10,"daylight because it's much too bright for it. But anyway, it is pretty ugly and it does this really"
00:12:10,00:12:14,clever thing. So you reminded me when you said the spiders dropped little droplets on their web.
00:12:14,00:12:20,"First of all, it spins a web between its front legs. So acts as a sort of like a fly catcher."
00:12:20,00:12:25,So it will hang down from its back legs above wherever it wants to stay to catch the flies. And then
00:12:25,00:12:30,it swings this web or net that it's made between its front legs at its prey and catches them. And
00:12:30,00:12:37,the way that it knows when to swing is it creates a target by doing a little white poo on the ground.
00:12:37,00:12:41,"And it leaves a little white blob of feces as a target. And as soon as it's in the dark, as soon as"
00:12:41,00:12:47,"it sees an insect of some sort, cross this bit of poo, drops down upon it, gets it in its net. Wow."
00:12:47,00:12:55,It consumes it. Very clever. What do you reckon the lifespan of a spider is 10 years?
00:12:55,00:13:02,"So I don't know the answer. What I do know is I know the, as so far as we know, the oldest living"
00:13:02,00:13:09,spider. So the spider with the longest lifespan. Okay. 28 years. It's in Mexico. They had one that was
00:13:09,00:13:16,captured in 1935. It's the world's oldest spider. And it's 28. And what's its secret? Does it drink a lot of
00:13:16,00:13:22,milk or bird eating? Bird eating. Okay. I eat birds. I smoke twenty cigarettes a day. I don't
00:13:22,00:13:28,"exercise. I don't know how I do it. There was, I was reading about the oldest recorded person"
00:13:28,00:13:35,who lived to be 122nd star in 1997. Yeah. I'll there. Yeah. And she quit smoking I think five years
00:13:35,00:13:41,"before she died. So she was 117. She went, okay, come on, this has been enough. But I quite enjoyed,"
00:13:41,00:13:46,I put dip at this on Twitter the other day. She was born in the year that Edison made the first
00:13:46,00:13:53,sound transmission. And she died in the year that Hanson released... Was that what did for her in
00:13:53,00:13:58,the end? Yep. But she was the one who said that I only have one wrinkle and I'm sitting on it.
00:13:58,00:14:03,"Yeah. Oh, that's for her. She was cracking. So just put the original fact in context, which is that"
00:14:03,00:14:12,"there were 107 million spiders here with a density of 35,000 per cubic meter. The standard amount"
00:14:12,00:14:18,of spiders that we think are in like a British field would be about 49 per square meter.
00:14:18,00:14:23,That's quite a lot though. It's still quite a lot. It turns. Yeah. That was a study done in 1958
00:14:23,00:14:28,"in Sussex, Meadow. In the 1950s, if you look at photos, they were actually overwhelmed with spiders"
00:14:28,00:14:34,all those films. That's why everyone's got their mouths shut in early photographs is to stop the
00:14:34,00:14:41,"spiders getting in. So is this a case of, you know, when they say if you leave rats and they"
00:14:41,00:14:48,"breed in the root or any, is this a case of just a total isolated sort of spider farm? I think they're"
00:14:48,00:14:55,"just... Oh, the Baltimore one. Yeah. Yeah, that's basically it. They had no predators there. They were"
00:14:55,00:15:00,allowed to just create as much as they wanted and eventually there was a hundred and seven million of them.
00:15:00,00:15:06,It's extraordinary. You need a massive class. Wouldn't you to put that out? Yeah. Big shoe. What have
00:15:06,00:15:10,"they done with it? Do we know? The way it was worded, I think, I glanced at our article. They said"
00:15:11,00:15:16,the people at the Baltimore waste water treatment plant put out a call for extreme spider help.
00:15:16,00:15:23,"There's an understatement. I think the grammar's different. Stream spider, semi-colon help."
00:15:23,00:15:27,Do you think spider-bad ever got any false calls of people wanting him to just get rid of the spider?
00:15:27,00:15:33,"Guys, I'm dealing with some proper growing here. Batman, bat, same thing. That's true. Yeah."
00:15:33,00:15:43,"Catwoman are still not married. Okay, time for fact number three and that's my fact. My fact this week"
00:15:43,00:15:48,"is that according to the Vatican, the greatest pop album of all time is revolver by the Beatles."
00:15:48,00:15:55,"I would have thought they would choose Abbey Road, personally, but treasurer I know. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:15:58,00:16:05,"It's greeted with the devotional hum. What, according to the Vatican? Well, it's the Vatican newspaper"
00:16:05,00:16:12,"who did a, they published a list of what they consider to be the best albums of all time. Is the Vatican"
00:16:12,00:16:20,"newspaper called the Prairie Mail? It's called Losevatar Romano, I can't pronounce it. Which is a very"
00:16:20,00:16:27,"funny pun in Italian. The weird thing is, first off, the Beatles were the ones who were more famous"
00:16:27,00:16:33,than any band in the world for having an association with a fight with the church when John Lennon said
00:16:33,00:16:37,"that the Beatles were bigger than Christianity. Oh, he's a bigger than Jesus, but I thought he said it."
00:16:37,00:16:42,"Sorry, then Jesus. But he also said Christianity would shrink and fade away in that very same"
00:16:42,00:16:46,"piece. But I thought he said it despairingly. I think it wasn't, I didn't think he was"
00:16:46,00:16:50,celebrating the fact that they're bigger than Jesus. He was just talking about it. It was the very
00:16:50,00:16:55,"notion of what he said. I mean, it led to people were burning their records in the streets throwing"
00:16:55,00:16:59,all their merchandise. It was a huge backlash. Huge backlash. It was one of the biggest
00:16:59,00:17:03,sort of moments of their career that they had to recover from. Wow. But so it's interesting. They
00:17:03,00:17:08,given him a pardon now. They've pardoned him for saying what he said. They said the Beatles were
00:17:08,00:17:13,"satanic music. But the list is just, I mean, it's pretty, it's just a mismatch. You don't expect the"
00:17:13,00:17:20,"Vatican to be saying the Beatles, David Crosby, Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, Donald Fagan. Donald Fagan"
00:17:20,00:17:25,"is the lead singer, Steeley Dan. So not even a Steeley Dan album. A solo work. Yeah, spin-off."
00:17:25,00:17:30,"Yeah, spin-off. It's like the equivalent of like nominating a John Bon Jovi solo album and not a"
00:17:30,00:17:36,Bon Jovi album. Like it's just a very obscure choice. So I think this newspaper is trying to
00:17:36,00:17:41,"hip up, isn't it? I've read the Vatican thought it was getting a bit dated. All this, we still"
00:17:41,00:17:48,love the hymns. We like our big long robes and our cross necklaces. I think there was a movement
00:17:48,00:17:52,"in within this newspaper to say, look, we're with it, guys. And so now they report, they so they"
00:17:52,00:17:57,"review Harry Potter, which is again, that has had issues with the church. And they said that the"
00:17:57,00:18:02,Half Blood Prince was good because it showed a clear line of demarcation between good and evil.
00:18:02,00:18:08,"That's interesting, because the Vatican's exorcist really didn't like it. He came out here. No, he says"
00:18:08,00:18:15,"it's satanic. Yeah. He also thinks that yoga is satanic. I think he needs to, he needs to get with it."
00:18:15,00:18:23,"He's 89. There was a big feature about this paper in the Guardian, and it said that until 2007,"
00:18:23,00:18:30,"this was kind of the old days for Lose Vittore, there were two kinds of articles. The first one was"
00:18:30,00:18:35,those in which a Vatican department had definitely directly intervened in. And they had a code for
00:18:35,00:18:41,"that, which was three asterisks placed above or near the article. But the other kind,"
00:18:41,00:18:46,"the Comich didn't have the asterisks on, with those which have been written by Lose Vittore's stuff."
00:18:46,00:18:50,But they were so careful not to embarrass anyone that these articles were totally unreadably boring.
00:18:50,00:18:55,You got a choice of reading either propaganda or tedium. But that's kind of changed now. I believe
00:18:55,00:19:00,"they've shaken it up a bit. But it's not the, it's not exactly the official voice of the church,"
00:19:00,00:19:05,"is it? It's in a weird place between yeah, official and unofficial. It's allowed, it's allowed in"
00:19:05,00:19:10,the Vatican. It's a paper that's kind of seen as a daily paper there. Yeah. And it seems to have a
00:19:10,00:19:15,"lot of, it's, it's the place where if the Pope had something to say, there'll be the people to publish it."
00:19:15,00:19:22,Very much the Middlesbrough Gazette. Do you guys know about the Apostolic Penitentiary system?
00:19:22,00:19:27,Been through it mate. Yeah. That's on the title of our spin-off podcast.
00:19:27,00:19:34,"20 years in. No, what is it? So it's this tribunal. It's the oldest,"
00:19:34,00:19:40,it's the oldest established body of the Holy See. It's existence 1179. And it's where you go when
00:19:40,00:19:44,you've committed a sin that's too heinous to be forgiven by a priest. So if you've got to confess
00:19:44,00:19:50,"something, you go to confession, the priest is like, whoa, out of my pay grade. Then you go to the"
00:19:50,00:19:56,Apostolic Penitentiary Tribunal and there are five sins that are too evil. Should we guess what they are?
00:19:56,00:20:00,"Yeah, go on. I'll go for murder. Oh no, murder is easy. Genocide even is, you can get genocide"
00:20:00,00:20:07,"forgiven by a standard priest. Yeah. What? Yeah. What your local, how many Hail Mary's do you have to"
00:20:07,00:20:12,"say for that? Look, it takes a couple of weeks, reciting in your roots. So three of them are."
00:20:12,00:20:17,Cushing the Pope. What's Cushing in? Putting your finger up his bum.
00:20:17,00:20:27,"Defacing his ring. So most of the same, killing the Pope, you can't kill the Pope. That is understandable."
00:20:27,00:20:31,Yeah. So there are three which just apply to people who want to work for the church. So if you're
00:20:31,00:20:35,"a priest and you've been in any way involved in an abortion, then you have to go here to confess it."
00:20:35,00:20:40,Right. To directly to the Pope. And if you're a priest who's been confessed to and then you've broken
00:20:40,00:20:45,your oath not to share your confession. And then the only other one that normal people like us can
00:20:45,00:20:51,commit and we'd have to be sent to the Vatican is if we deface the Eucharist. What you mean at local
00:20:51,00:20:57,"church, if I get body of Christ and I drop it, I think dropping it is right. You can play the five second rule"
00:20:57,00:21:04,on it. That's probably the three-day rule of gaffling church. So it's more if you're doing it
00:21:04,00:21:08,"intentionally. There was a scientist in America recently, for instance, who drove a rusty nail"
00:21:08,00:21:12,through a bit of communion wafer. And I think the church was pretty pissed off with him about that.
00:21:12,00:21:17,I like that. I just like the idea of the Pope listening to pop music. I don't think he does. It's
00:21:17,00:21:21,"obviously just this paper that's saying it. But there are a lot of, I like when you read about people"
00:21:21,00:21:28,who are in high power of positions and they admit to liking certain things. So the Dalai Lama is
00:21:28,00:21:32,"very good mates with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Beastie Boys, which is just such a weird"
00:21:32,00:21:37,"mismatch, but he recognized that he could put free Tibet concerts on, use the power of these pop stars."
00:21:37,00:21:41,"And he realized that the people who spoke to people, so he became very good mates with them. David"
00:21:41,00:21:47,"Cameron, do you know what his favorite album is? Coldplay? Coldplay album? No, he said that it was"
00:21:47,00:21:52,"""Dark Side of the Moon"" by Paul Floyd. But everyone knows that that's a lie because everyone knows"
00:21:52,00:21:57,"that his favorite album is ""The Queen is Dead"" by The Smiths. But he can't say that now that he's"
00:21:57,00:22:02,"prime minister, though he had constantly said that before becoming prime minister. Then when he did say"
00:22:02,00:22:08,"he loves the Smith, both Marcy and Johnny Marr came out saying, ""You are not allowed to like us."""
00:22:08,00:22:13,"Like, ""Band, David Cameron."" Yeah, that's ridiculous. It's not really up to them. I know, I just like"
00:22:13,00:22:17,"them coming out and saying, ""It's ours. You're not allowed to like this."" All musicians come out and"
00:22:17,00:22:21,"band politicians from liking their music. After a certain age, you shouldn't have a favorite album,"
00:22:21,00:22:25,"you should have a favorite. I don't know. Symphony. What's your favorite symphony, Andy? I haven't"
00:22:25,00:22:30,reached that age yet. It's my favorite album. It's my favorite album.
00:22:30,00:22:40,"On niche newspapers, can I tell you about my favorite one, which is ""Jail Mail,"" which is a"
00:22:40,00:22:45,"relatively new magazine, and it's for everyone in the prison system. There are two others which"
00:22:45,00:22:52,"are called ""Inside Time and Converse,"" as in ""Convict and Verse,"" so ""Converse."" I think the daily"
00:22:52,00:23:00,"jail would have been better, but I'm not going to. I think it's a weekly anyway. Anyway, it was hugely"
00:23:00,00:23:08,popular. It's had to double its print run for its next edition. It has advice on what to do
00:23:08,00:23:12,when you're up before the governor and details of reading projects and how to find employment.
00:23:12,00:23:17,"Is it written by people in by prisoners? I think a lot of it is, yeah."
00:23:17,00:23:26,Form and use of the world. I just think that's cool. Can I just on the Beatles? I didn't realise
00:23:26,00:23:31,"that apparently their concerts all just smelled of urine, and if you looked around the aisles,"
00:23:31,00:23:36,you saw women's P and Bob Geldof as tested to this. This is a room because women used to turn up
00:23:36,00:23:40,"and wet themselves so excited to make. These days of Rolling Stones gig smell of urine, but that's the"
00:23:40,00:23:49,"act that's nothing. Okay, let's move on to our final fact, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray. My fact is"
00:23:49,00:23:55,"that for the first 50 years of the Olympics, the only event was the 200-meter sprint, which must have"
00:23:55,00:24:00,made the two weeks of the competition extremely boring in the most part. It's just the modern Olympics.
00:24:00,00:24:05,"No, this is the ancient Greek Olympics. All right, so this is from a book I've just got called"
00:24:05,00:24:08,"Eureka. Everything you always wanted to know about the ancient Greeks, but were afraid to ask"
00:24:08,00:24:14,"by a guy called Peter Jones, and it looks like it's full of good things, and it basically says,"
00:24:14,00:24:18,"for the first 50 years, it was the Olympic game, not the Olympic games, which is a nice way of putting"
00:24:18,00:24:23,"it. And then after 50 years there, did the 400-meter race. But the cool thing is, if you want it,"
00:24:23,00:24:27,"the entire Olympiad was named after you for the next four years, so it would become the Kevin"
00:24:27,00:24:31,"Olympics or whatever that was, instead of the Athens Olympics. It's not great. It's really cool."
00:24:31,00:24:35,"The Usain Bolt Olympics. Yeah, and then they started adding funcier things later, like boxing,"
00:24:35,00:24:40,"wrestling, and chariot racing. After a couple, after 200 years, they added a racing armor."
00:24:40,00:24:46,"Oh, that sounds good. Yeah, that's great. I read that that was the racing armor. The only body"
00:24:46,00:24:51,coverings was a helmet and shin guards. Wow. That was what the race and the rest of it was completely
00:24:51,00:24:56,"naked. Okay, I wasn't imagining that at all. I was thinking big heavy plates of armor, so it's"
00:24:56,00:25:00,"a challenge, like American football or whatever. But the 200 meters wasn't even 200 meters, was it?"
00:25:00,00:25:06,"I think it was 192. Yeah, that's true. Did they call it the 200 meters, if we just called it that?"
00:25:06,00:25:11,"We've said approximation. It was called a stadium, which is where we get the word stadium from,"
00:25:11,00:25:16,"and there was a measurement of a stage based on that. Okay, cool. And there were other games as well."
00:25:16,00:25:20,I didn't realize this. There was the Pythian Games in Delphi. It was really short games.
00:25:20,00:25:28,"And the Nomean Games. And if you wanted the games at Delphi, you got Laurel, obviously at the"
00:25:28,00:25:32,"Olympics, you got Olive, at the ISP3 in Games, you got Pine. And at the Nomean Games, it was Celery,"
00:25:32,00:25:38,"which you won, which I find very pleasing. Where the Olympics were held in 2012 in London,"
00:25:38,00:25:44,that Burra Newham is the most physically in active Burra in the whole of the UK. Wow. That's good.
00:25:44,00:25:51,"Yeah. That's where I live. Is it? Yeah. I live in Hackney, but I'm literally, I'm 10 minutes away"
00:25:51,00:25:57,from Stratford. 39.17% of people in Newham take no exercise at all. Where's Newham?
00:25:57,00:26:02,"Stratford. It's time it's away from where you live. Yeah, but I've never heard anything. He could be"
00:26:02,00:26:10,"asked to go there. In the 1932 Olympics, 3,000 meter steeple chase, it was actually run over 3,400 meters"
00:26:10,00:26:16,because an official lost count of the number of laps. That's so good. That's so good. Yeah.
00:26:16,00:26:23,"And you'd be, you'd realize soon after you'd forgotten, I don't know how many they've done."
00:26:24,00:26:29,"And you'd wonder if anyone else would spot you. Yeah. Oh, the poor guy. Well, the runners,"
00:26:29,00:26:32,"is they coming in? Is they going to the final? Yeah. Well, he wasn't looking at you and you're not"
00:26:32,00:26:37,"saying anything. You're like, why? And another one? Well, you just try and bluff it out, wouldn't you?"
00:26:37,00:26:41,"Because you'd know if you stop them too early, you think, I definitely don't want to stop them too early,"
00:26:41,00:26:44,"because they'll really know. But if I make them do another lap, it'll look like it's their fault"
00:26:44,00:26:50,"for being slow. Yeah. Was the one, the person who crossed the boundary at the right time,"
00:26:50,00:26:53,"or the person who finished at the wrong end time? I think it was the same person, but it would have"
00:26:53,00:26:57,"been at the end when... Oh, my gosh. Because you must start. And everyone must have put on a real bus"
00:26:57,00:27:04,"to get to the finishing line, and then no whistle, no crowds cheering, just... That would be a great"
00:27:04,00:27:12,"Olympic race, though we're not telling you how many laps. That's really a lot. Sometimes it's one,"
00:27:12,00:27:17,"sometimes it's 95. Yeah, that's a really good idea. Okay, so that... I'm the torture. And then we put"
00:27:17,00:27:25,"them all in amber at the end. It's a really good idea. So there's no adequate training for it. Yeah,"
00:27:25,00:27:30,"cool. Well, that is the spirit of amateurism, which they would want. They wouldn't, they weren't,"
00:27:30,00:27:33,"they weren't amateurs from the start in the Olympic race. No, they weren't. They got loads of money,"
00:27:33,00:27:36,"didn't they? Yeah. In their engine Greek limits. I think someone's worked out that,"
00:27:36,00:27:41,"Gaius Appelius Diocles was extremely good at winning money, I think, in his Olympic games,"
00:27:41,00:27:46,and he won a lot of events. And it's been worked out that he won what would be the equivalent today
00:27:46,00:27:51,"of over 15 billion dollars in modern day cash. Wow, 15 billion. Just been winning in"
00:27:51,00:27:57,"under the Olympic events. I think they work out on the percentage against, like, say, for instance,"
00:27:57,00:28:02,"someone in the army, or something that we can... Yes. It's really hard, though. It's so hard doing that."
00:28:02,00:28:07,"There are three or four different ways of calculating it. Anyway, sorry, it was enough to... So he earned"
00:28:07,00:28:12,"enough to pay the entire salary of the whole Roman army for more than two months, so they were like,"
00:28:12,00:28:17,"""Wow, which he didn't do."" They got... They asked him in the classic, ""What are you going to do with all your"
00:28:17,00:28:25,"money?"" ""What are you going to do?"" Do you want to hear an Olympic-steamed joke? Yes, please."
00:28:25,00:28:30,Marcus was so slow in the races that the groundsman locked him in for the night because he thought he
00:28:30,00:28:41,"was a statue. Isn't that good? Is that from... That's an ancient athletics joke. Yeah, yeah."
00:28:41,00:28:46,"Oh, I was going to say, in 1908, when we hosted the London Olympics. First of all, we did... So that was"
00:28:46,00:28:50,"obviously the first time we hosted it, and we weren't supposed to host it. The reason, in fact,"
00:28:50,00:28:55,fitting me in this podcast that we didn't was because I think somewhere in Italy was supposed to host
00:28:55,00:28:59,"it, and Vesuvius erupted in 1906, so they couldn't... So we stepped in like the heroes that we are. We"
00:28:59,00:29:05,"then copped it up in a number of ways. So we included... We had all the flags up on polls around the stadium,"
00:29:05,00:29:09,"as you do. That was the first year that became tradition. We had the Chinese and Japanese flag up,"
00:29:09,00:29:14,"neither of which countries competed. We forgot to include the Swedish and American flags, which"
00:29:14,00:29:18,"were competing. So obviously the Swedes were really polite about that, and we're like, oh no,"
00:29:18,00:29:23,"don't worry about it. So we'll just never mind. And America brought their own flag and their own poll,"
00:29:23,00:29:29,"and hoisted it up themselves. Of course they did. It was sponsored by Oxo, by the way,"
00:29:29,00:29:33,"for 1908 Olympic Games. Yeah, it was actually sponsored by Oxo, Indian foot powder,"
00:29:33,00:29:40,"an old doll mouthwash. Fantastic things to be sponsored by. Was that Oxo, comma, Indian foot powder?"
00:29:40,00:29:44,I don't think it was used for that. Oxo was originally used to cure athletes.
00:29:44,00:29:52,No. And we are announcing actually that today is our first podcast that's sponsored by Oxo Indian
00:29:52,00:30:00,"foot powder. In India they have a thing called the Rural Olympics, and they have three types of"
00:30:00,00:30:05,"competitions in there. They have rural games, such as Kabadi or wrestling, modern sports,"
00:30:05,00:30:11,"such as athletics and football, and performing sports, such as acrobatics, twisting an iron rod"
00:30:11,00:30:17,"by placing it on the other example, passing a tractor over the rib cage, and cracking a big stone"
00:30:17,00:30:22,"by placing it on the chest, etc. Would you mean letting a tractor go over your chest?"
00:30:22,00:30:26,"Yeah, that's just one of the sports. How can you win at letting something happen?"
00:30:29,00:30:33,"It's more of not losing. It's more of a disappointment after the tractor drives over your chest,"
00:30:33,00:30:36,and you look up and you see a judge giving you a five. Five?
00:30:36,00:30:41,My lungs have collapsed. Come on. That's why you got a five.
00:30:41,00:30:49,"I have a fact, this is really fun. They think that the starting position for running races"
00:30:49,00:30:54,"at the ancient Greek Olympics was just standing up next to each other, and with your arms stretched"
00:30:54,00:31:00,"out in front of you, as opposed to the crunching. What a funny way of starting a race, it's not brilliant."
00:31:00,00:31:04,"Well, it might work if you then push your arms backwards, and it might give you some momentum."
00:31:04,00:31:07,"Yeah, it's a good point. It's the greatest."
00:31:07,00:31:15,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thanks so much for listening everyone."
00:31:15,00:31:19,If you want to get in contact with any of us about the things we've said over the course
