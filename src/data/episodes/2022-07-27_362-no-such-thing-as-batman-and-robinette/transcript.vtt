00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.560
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.960
 four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshensky,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.920
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.720
 our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here we go. Starting

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.560
 with fact number one that is Andy. My fact is there is a scientist at Imperial College who's been

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.000
 studying the same bag of dust for 15 years. Are you are you grusting him up now for being lazy is

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.800
 that what's happening here? Yeah that's right he's clearly taking his time over it you know I'm

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.680
 not accusing him of swinging the lead outright but then again he is analysing every single speck

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.800
 of dust in his bag so I can see why it's taken time. He's called Matthew Genge, he's a planetary

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.320
 scientist at Imperial College and he specialises in micrometeorites which is basically grains of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.280
 dust from other worlds and they land on earth all the time. He's got a bag which he collected in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.120
 Antarctica in 2006, it took him five minutes to collect but that was the easy bit because then he

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.920
 has to go through it speck by speck and just work out which specks are micrometeorites which is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.760
 the exciting ones and which ones are just dust and yeah. He's got 3,000 of them so far, 3,000

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.160
 particles he's really good at picking out of this bag yeah. That's not good going at all.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.480
 Wait he's been doing 15 years and he's only managed to get a 3,000. Look he's got other

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.920
 stuff on I mean he's got to eat you know he's probably got a bit of work on. I think I could

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.080
 count 3,000 grains of dust within a couple of days max. No you couldn't. Absolutely not.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.640
 It's not okay sorry he's not counting to 3,000. That would assume that every single grain of dust

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.640
 was a winner, he has to go through everyone and analyse it. There's a lot of regular dust in there

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.560
 as well so he's separating it, it's not as if it's a big bag of cosmic dust he's going well

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.400
 he's not the count from Sesame Street, he's analysing every single dust particle that comes

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.280
 out of there. How does he work out the difference between meteorite and a non-meteorite, a meteorong

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.240
 like we've called them before? Glad you asked. Andy? Well thanks Dan. Anna do you have anything

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.200
 to add on this? Well I was going to say you two seem so sure about how difficult this work is

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.680
 and yeah when I ask you how it's done. You need a microscope that's guaranteed if you're not doing

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.840
 it with the naked eye. I mean you can clearly identify what they're made of with the microscope

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.840
 and I think that's how he does it. Well definitely because it's the way that they're made isn't it?

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.960
 When you get a micrometeorite it's made in space and it comes down through the Earth's atmosphere

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.440
 and it goes really really hot so they tend to be really really round with like filaments coming

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.880
 off them and also they're made of something slightly different aren't they because they've

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.600
 come from space so they tend to be metallic so there's lots of different ways that you can tell

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.440
 I think. Yeah you can just skim a magnet around a random surface right? That's how Anna does it.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.760
 That's how I spend my weekends. This is actually a tip that I read for if you want to find your

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.120
 own and this is from this amazing guy that I'm sure you've read about this Norwegian jazz musician

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.280
 called John Larson who doubles up as a scientist and he basically has proven that ordinary plebs

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.520
 like us are able to collect our own little bits of space dust and yeah he does his with a magnet

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.920
 so he went all across the roofs of a city magnetizing bits of space dust up. I love this guy. His

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.200
 band were called Hot Club de Norvige. In fact I still called that but he's retired and he was

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.080
 one of the best known jazz musicians in the whole of Norway and then whenever he was on tour he would

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.480
 go around looking for micrometer rights just collecting dust and looking for them and then

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.520
 he would keep sending them to this guy professor Genj say here's another one here's another one

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.000
 and Genj would just be like oh for god's sake mate I don't tell you how to play the jazz trumpet

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.480
 or whatever why are you doing this and eventually he was like okay fine I'll look at it and he

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.320
 looked at it and he realized that this guy John Larson was actually doing really good work and

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.520
 between them they were the first people to ever announce that you can find micrometer rights

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.440
 like Hannah says just in your gutter or wherever. Well I do know as a lockdown project Matt Parker

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.960
 our buddy whose festival has spoken known he went up into his roofs guttering and he grabbed a bunch

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.840
 of stuff and he's been doing this as well he's been trying to find cosmic dust yeah landing in his gutter.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.320
 Very dangerous don't try it at home really I mean they're very weak gutters aren't they

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.720
 but the good thing if you can get up to them is that they have the newest dust it's the most

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.680
 up-to-date space dust you'll get because apparently they get cleaned relatively often

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.320
 compared to most surfaces you're bombed into and so that's dust that has recently landed

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.920
 and if you want really fresh dust check the weather forecast but for space and find out when

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.440
 the next meteor shower is you know the space weather forecast. Press the red button when

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.160
 the normal weather forecast is on it takes you to the secret space forecast. Any aliens who are

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.320
 watching the BBC now press the red button and we'll tell you what the weather's like in your

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.640
 solar system. Anyway look look for a meteor shower on your alien weather forecast and then wash your

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.040
 roof because that'll get rid of all the old past it space dust and then when the meteor shower comes

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.920
 then and this is another one of Rockstar John Larson's tips he says then you'll just get the

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.400
 debris from that exact meteor shower so you'll know exactly which space dust you're getting.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.960
 Yeah that is really cool. Do you know that Matt Genge might one day find a particle of a meteorite

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.000
 also named Matt Genge? Oh yeah. Isn't that cool? How will he know though? Like it's not gonna have his

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.080
 name on it is it? No I guess maybe it just have the M if it's so small. But you've got to be careful

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.720
 because M and M's have an M on them as well. I don't want to mix them up. Imagine that that'd be a great

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.360
 frank, couldn't it? Just put some M and M's in his dust and he's like oh my god I found one of my

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.400
 meteorites. Well he's the big deal in the cosmic dust world and such a big deal that there is actually

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.520
 an eight kilometer wide asteroid near Mars that has been named in his honor for his contributions

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.520
 to the science. So one day he could yeah he could pull out. Is it the more famous you are the bigger

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.280
 the comet that would be named after you is? Does it? No I don't think so because then like whatever

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.760
 meteorites about to hit the earth is necessarily going to be named after either the queen or Mick

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.920
 Jagger which doesn't really seem fair does it? It'd be cool if it was a Mick Jagger. I wouldn't

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:32.320
 mind her being wiped out by Mick Jagger's meteorite. More of a flying stone than a rolling one.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:39.360
 Have you heard of Penelope Vozniakiewicz? So she is another space dust expert and she went to

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.600
 the Marshall Islands to find space dust because every square meter of earth gets about 10 particles

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.520
 a year of space dust. That's the average right? 10 particles? I don't fancy Matt Parker's chances

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.560
 of finding them. You're right. It's every once a month a square meter will get one particle

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.680
 and it's quite a lot in aggregate. It's 30,000 tons in aggregate but obviously that's because

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.600
 the world is quite big. But problem as you guys have all been saying is that it's really hard to

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.480
 find it among normal dust and there is so much dust in most places all sort of random dirt.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.400
 But if you go to places with zero dust you have a much better chance and the Marshall Islands are

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.880
 a thousand miles away from the nearest land so there is you know wind blows less random crud

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.160
 into the land and so that is a really good place to find the dust. It's obviously a long way to

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.760
 go. It's not like you're gutter but once you get there you have better chances. Okay. And the way

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.720
 you find it is you get a brush and you have a single hair on that brush. It's like a paint brush

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.600
 but with one hair and some scientists even use a single eyelash. They just take one of their

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.160
 eyelashes and they strap it to a brush handle and they use that to pick up the micrometeorite

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:50.640
 and look at it under the microscope. How do you strap an eyelash onto anything? Yeah so do all

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.000
 these micrometeologists have no eyelashes? That's how you spot a really successful one. Yeah.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.600
 We should say with micrometeorites is they're not the same as a small meteorite because a

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.960
 micrometeorite is made of different stuff than meteorites. So meteorites we think come from

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.320
 asteroid belts but it looks like micrometeorites probably come from comets because they contain

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.680
 little bits of water which meteorites don't contain. And what's interesting about that is there is a

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:24.000
 hypothesis that all of the earth's oceans came from these tiny, tiny, tiny meteorites just millions

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 and millions and billions and billions of them landing on earth over years and years and years

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.800
 and years and years and eventually tiny bits of water becoming more water becoming more water

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.480
 becoming our oceans. That's incredible. Isn't that cool? That's incredible. So Matt Parker's

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:46.240
 gutter might flood. Yeah. Well, that matter if you're listening. Well the next 4.5 billion years.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.000
 That must have been so boring at the early stages when you're just looking into the

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.880
 beds of the world's oceans waiting for it to fill up. Like you know when you're trying to

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.520
 fill a paddling pool and it's taking a really long time. Exactly. But it's amazing isn't it?

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.320
 How much enters our planet every day? In fact what's actually peculiar is we're not quite

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.160
 sure how much it is but it could be up to 300 tons a day. It could be as little as five as well

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.160
 as the other calculations. So it's somewhere in between but it's an extraordinary amount and

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.120
 it's really important for our planet particularly our oceans. Like not only did it as you say James,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.160
 maybe seed the oceans all together but also a lot of animals, a lot of organisms actually

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.360
 rely on these micrometeorites because of the iron and so on in them. They sort of feed them.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.160
 They feed their nature. There is one theory that if there's anything that lives on Mars which we

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.760
 don't think there is but if there's anything that lives in the soil of Mars then they probably eat

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.640
 these micrometeorites because they contain bits of like you say nickel and metals and things like

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:48.480
 that. It's really wild. Just a thing about dust? Dust. There is a dust library in Ohio State University.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.200
 Now all libraries are quite dusty aren't they? That's a good point but those ones have books and

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:59.360
 this one has no books it just has the pieces of dust. This was from a new scientist piece in 2011

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.560
 and they were studying the different bits of dust because when you look at them that you know

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.120
 depending on whether it's a bit of a thread of cotton or a piece of soot or carbon or whatever

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.760
 they look really different on the microscope. Anyway it only had 63 particles in 2011 so I

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:18.560
 don't know if they've got way more now. Sorry this library has 63 grains of dust in it but then

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:24.400
 every other library has way more. I know but I think these are categorised and then it's not a

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.600
 lending library. This library has the fewest bits of dust in the whole world of all the libraries

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.520
 and yet it has the goal to call itself a dust library. Is it being stalked by this Matt and

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:42.720
 Hench character by any chance? One bit of dusty here. Do you know Nasa has a problem with fake

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:49.760
 fake space dust? So fake space dust is a thing which is space dust that's simulated it's actually

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.880
 called simulant that's made on earth for scientists to do experiments on so if you are going to land

00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:00.000
 a rover on Mars or if you're thinking about you know astronauts going and living on a asteroid or

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.560
 whatever then you've got to order in some fake space dust to see how that would work with that

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.400
 all around it and so companies manufacture this but there's an issue because there's lots of dodgy

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:16.800
 space dusts out there so for instance there are about 30 moon simulants available but some of them

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.360
 are below par some of them are based on old models some of them are specifically for one thing that

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.640
 won't work for another and this is a proper issue and Nasa's finally got this company who

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:32.160
 mines asteroids to get actual dust off asteroids bring it back and exactly replicate it.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.600
 I know you say there are 30 companies that make fake dust I mean that's just fake moon dust.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.680
 Sorry that is mind-blowing isn't it. Did they make money do you think because I reckon there

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:48.080
 might be 31 after this podcast the way Andy's looking. Moon dust by the way was a real worry for

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:54.160
 Nasa when the Apollo 11 astronauts came back because they weren't sure if they were bringing back

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.840
 an alien dust form that was going to you know send a plague around the planet so once Aldrin and

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.320
 Collins and Armstrong got back they were quarantined in a room but they weren't on their own they were

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:10.160
 also quarantined with a bunch of animals that were in surrounding areas so they basically they fed

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:16.000
 lunar dust that they brought back to German cockroaches no to yeah to Japanese quail brown

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.080
 shrimps oysters shellfish horse flies and they were injecting it into mice and they had to watch

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.280
 how they reacted to the lunar dust to see if there was anything that went wrong because if anything

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.040
 went wrong yeah how close were the quail and the shrimp to the guys were they in the same trailer

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.280
 because they were quarantined. I assume that it must have been in surrounding areas because I think

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:42.320
 they quarantined everything into one place but everything survived except for the oysters but

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.600
 they don't think it was to do with the moon dust they think it was more to do with the fact

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.080
 they were being tested during mating season and I guess it was stress levels that got to them and

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.720
 they died but um yeah they were really worried about that and they kept doing that until I

00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:02.000
 think Apollo 14 I believe it was. So some spaced us in future might be dead people and so this is

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.880
 about how we would dispose of corpses in space if ever we produced them and so for instance if

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.160
 you're on the ISS you sometimes have to do drills as to you know what happens if someone dies where

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.920
 you put them and actually NASA hasn't really worked out how to deal with dead bodies at the ISS

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.400
 and so they've come up with a number of ideas and they commissioned a company to figure out how

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:28.000
 best to dispose of them and the idea the company came up with was the body bag that is that you put

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.120
 the body once the astronaut dies you put a body in an airtight bag and you send it out into space

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.280
 but on a lead from the International Space Station so you still got hold of it so the whole body

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.520
 freezes over the course of about an hour like putting a bottle of wine in the freezer or something

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:48.000
 and then you you reel it back in and then the bag gets vigorously vibrated and that makes the body

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 shatter into a fine powder and then you store it in a container just outside the ISS you bring it

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.360
 back in on re-entry and then you can present back to the family there to be fair in powder form but

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.080
 still body of their deceased loved one and that's what they think they might do. I don't leave it

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.720
 too long like a bottle of wine if you leave a bottle of wine overnight in the freezer. That's

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.200
 that body explodes all over the ISS yeah I think but part of the idea is that they think people

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.320
 would find it emotionally taxing to spend you know six months on the ISS with a dead body just there

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.720
 in body form. But just if you're looking out the window and you're seeing Steve bobbing along on

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:40.400
 his lead that's probably also emotionally taxing. Okay there's time for fact number two and that

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:46.160
 is Anna. My fact this week is that every year power line repair workers have to pass a test

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:53.360
 where they rescue a 12 stone dummy from the top of a telegraph pole. Wow. Being a line worker is a

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.240
 lot more fun than I imagined turns out so this is people who they're like outdoor electricians so

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:04.400
 that the guys who work on telegraph lines, electricity lines, cables, pylons all those things

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:12.800
 and I was reading in Kent online an article about Rod Lurie who's been a power line worker for 56 years

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.360
 and he said yeah every year you have to do the pole rescue test so he's in his 70s now

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:23.120
 still does it. You climb a 15 meter pole there's a 12 stone dummy sitting at the top and you have

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.600
 to carry it down and as if you're up there with your co-worker and they get an electric shock

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.880
 or they have a heart attack or they fall asleep and you have to carry them down so it's to prepare

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.440
 you for that. Yeah it makes sense. What if they're more than 12 stone? I mean 12 stone is not that

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.960
 much. I mean do you have to strip them nude to take them down to get them as light as possible?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.520
 Yes. The problem is all those meteorites landing on them all the time it gets heavier and heavier

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:53.680
 doesn't it? Old Matt Gend would be there for 40 years. Matt Gend is a really eminent scientist I don't

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:59.440
 like the way he's become a byword for hanging around doing things like that. Anna did you read the

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.440
 name of the dummy? I think it's the right dummy that I'm thinking about because this is a US one

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.560
 as well which is called Rescue Randy. Yeah that's it. There's no way the English one is called Rescue

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:14.240
 Randy. He's like a whole Barbie. He's like a Ken doll. There are all these different versions.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.440
 And accessories. You can get accessories there as well. Exactly. Oh you can put earrings on him

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:25.600
 and a cat. You can buy a shredded rubber to stuff inside him. You can buy special overalls and he's

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:31.280
 got this whole family so there's Rescue Jennifer, there's Rugged Randy and there's Trauma Randy.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.960
 Rugged Randy. It's not like the particularly attractive co-worker you have.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.920
 You have to carry him down but you have to hide your enormous erection as you're doing so because

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:47.440
 he's so fit. But which pole do I climb? Anna did you read about Trauma Randy though?

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.640
 No what does Trauma Randy do? Trauma Randy is what I call you, have the...

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:59.280
 Randy Andy for me. Trauma Randy comes with four bleeding wounds.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.560
 Wow. I know but I think the top of the range is Casualty Care Rescue Randy

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:10.240
 who costs 19 grand which is a lot. He holds four litres of blood and you can do actual

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:15.520
 surgery on him and he has a, I'm quoting here, a manual foot operated pumping system which allows

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:21.840
 three wounds to bleed simultaneously. These guys they must be used for other things. They can't

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:27.520
 be a company that just sells these dolls just to go up telephone. It is! James there are 30 companies

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:33.200
 which make fake dolls. We don't know the world anymore. Telegraph poles. Yeah there's loads of

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.760
 them in America isn't there which is why I kind of think that I can accept that this company is

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.720
 selling all of these things because in America like obviously all the places are quite spread out

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.960
 compared to Britain for instance there's a lot more of them but they weren't even supposed to be

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:52.160
 there the first ones because Samuel Moss who invented the telegraph he wanted to show that

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.560
 he could get a message from Washington DC to Baltimore which is about 40 miles or something

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.600
 like that but he wanted to go under the ground with his telegraph wires. He did that but it didn't

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.520
 work and they had to kind of really quickly think oh shit what are we going to do and they erected

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:11.200
 all these poles to put the telegraphs across and then when he did his famous like what have God

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.600
 wrought telegraph message that he did that was going through the air that was going through the air

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.920
 yeah I guess it's not obvious yeah under the ground is a much better place for them well that's what

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.600
 some people think for sure they couldn't sell them in France you know the telegraph system

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.560
 that Moss invented because they already had an optical telegraph which is like where you go on

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.560
 top of the hill and you have a big sort of stick which does a semaphore and someone's on another

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.400
 hill who can see it and they pass that message on to someone else on to someone else on to someone

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:42.000
 else and that was really massive in France at the time it was invented by a French chap called Claude

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:52.080
 Chap he was French until the 1850s it was the main way of sending messages in France and it was so

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.120
 good and so useful that you couldn't sell anything better to them you could but they decided that

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.360
 they wouldn't accept it so right we've already brought the technology to its absolute peak

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:08.720
 haven't guys you're waving flags from mountaintop BT open reach they have a telegraph pole training

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:14.080
 academy which is so cool it's just a big field in Peterborough which is full of dozens of nine

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:21.840
 metre poles and that's the sort of dojo where their engineers train they seem like a vaguely fun

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:27.200
 company actually open reach this is based on some of their PR materials so they released an article

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:33.280
 where they said that their 500 strong team of engineers in 2020 climbed more than 11.5 million

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:38.880
 meters close to a round trip from London to the North Pole no Anna hang on it doesn't they're

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.880
 comparing apples and oranges there because walking to the North Pole is obviously very hard but it's

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.920
 not as hard as climbing 10 million meters up into the air which would be really hard so I read that

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:54.240
 article and I thought let's compare apples with apples and so I reckon that the open reach engineers

00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:00.880
 every two weeks do the equivalent of climbing to the ISS that's really good wow that's pretty cool

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.720
 but that's that's between them right so there's only one person who gets there there's one person

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:11.200
 on the very bottom hold their weight um you know we were saying about um whether sometimes you want

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.880
 to transmit these signals above ground and sometimes underground and obviously today it's

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.960
 preferable to do it underground and in fact it always has been but it's just that it's really

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:24.320
 much more expensive to install wires underground than in poles but if you go to New York well if

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.960
 you're in Manhattan at least you don't see a single electricity pole or a single radio

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.080
 transmission pole and that is because in the 1880s when Edison was working on electric transmission

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:40.000
 and New York was kind of his test case New York became this huge mass of wires and it looks insane

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 you can't see the sky it's just you know thousands of wires above your head and there was a blizzard

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.280
 in 1888 this great blizzard of New York and the whole city went into blackout because it brought

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:57.920
 down the wires and the mayor in 1889 who came in after that who was Mayor Hugh Grant uh in his

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:13.680
 in a charmingly stammering speech that's what he did and he taught them into it and they brought

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:19.600
 them all down um and so now it doesn't have any they're all underground thanks to Hugh Grant nice

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:25.920
 in bits of Africa and South Africa there is a height restriction on how low you can have

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.960
 your electricity poles do you know why that is well do you mean like they have to be a certain

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.520
 height so that you don't yeah so that people well actually i've just heard Anna say giraffes and that

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:43.440
 sounds good that is correct oh my answer i was gonna come up with a bit of a bit of whimsy there but

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:50.240
 never mind sorry wow so for giraffes yeah they got to make sure that they don't get tangled up

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:54.000
 because that did happen a few times in a few of the country so a restriction of height was put

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.200
 into it so yeah the lines will always be taller than the tallest giraffe the lions will be taller

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:05.200
 the lines the power lines oh lines sorry that's a frightening dystopia the world's exactly the same

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.680
 except all the lions are bigger than giraffes i suppose in Africa you have lines men but also

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:14.400
 lions men and you don't want to get that mixed up these in the old days you could calculate how

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.600
 fast your train was going between Birmingham and Derby because the telegraph poles were exactly

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.960
 the same distance apart so oh my god i've just imagined he'd be sat next to you on a train now

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:31.760
 andy jesus christ they were 352 feet apart each exactly and you could count how many you passed

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.320
 in a minute and that would help you calculate the speed of the train i always prove for this

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.880
 conversation is how unpleasant it would have been to sit with you on a train

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:45.920
 anytime anytime in history we've all been there and it's not nice

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:52.080
 look andy i think i know somewhere that you'll fit in and that is the telegraph pole appreciation

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:59.440
 society oh and i've bought your membership it's free it was it's founded in 1997 i spent a long

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:05.040
 time on their website their motto is very catchy if it's tall wooden sticky upy and got wires coming

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:12.480
 out of the top then we appreciate it do you see the pole of the month section and i had a look at

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:17.120
 pole of the month yeah did you appreciate it i loved it november's pole of the month was particularly

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.200
 beautiful and they really like to give a good description of the pole of the month so it was

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.960
 november 2020 uh this sumptuous right angle double stack of three cross armed pole i would

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:32.320
 hazard a guess is on the road between bidford and elmscott it's uh and then they have beautiful

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:38.240
 photos and they have people who send in all their polls um you know there's a pylon appreciation

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.200
 society as well what yeah you didn't find it anna you should check it out it's run by a lady called

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.720
 flash bristo she lives in east london and she's one of the pylon spotters of the uk and she's got

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:55.760
 530 photos 36 different countries absolutely obsessed with it and there is the famous pink

00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:02.480
 pylon which has actually its own appreciation website pinkpylon.co.uk don't go on that website

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.280
 if you're listening to this yeah rugged randy's pink pylon i think i've read that okay actually

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.880
 we're so appreciative in the uk this is what i've learned in this podcast

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:22.960
 pylons onto the real meat pylons pylons oh my goodness well don't call them pylons don't call

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.760
 them pylons why don't call them pylons because they're not called pylons i read this on the

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:33.200
 science museum website it was a guy who works in the industry who says major faux pas so pylon

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.640
 in engineering is a structure that holds something that's suspended from another structure to it

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.240
 so the pylons on a pylon are actually the bits of metal that hold the wires up

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.720
 a pylon itself is actually called a steel lattice tower so if you really want to impress

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.520
 your friends when you see one say that's a nice steel lattice tower isn't it because the name

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:57.280
 actually comes from ancient egypt doesn't it pylon so when they first started going up they

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:02.960
 were just called whatever lattice structure you called the manner but they just found toot and

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.520
 camoon and a few other mummies quite recently and egyptology was really really fashionable

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.880
 and so they were looking for a name and they just thought oh if you go to a pyramid they have these

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.680
 obelisk shaped towers on either side of the doors and they thought well you know what a great thing

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.240
 to name it after they're called pylons let's call them pylons but i really like the egyptology

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.200
 connection because i think in ancient egypt they were a gateway to the sun well that's maybe what

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.960
 the word means and that's kind of what an electrical pylon is you know you're harnessing power and it's

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.760
 kind of like a gateway to the sun you get light and you know okay everyone's going with that cool

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:45.440
 it was such an absurd statement i think we just chose something to go i just feel and the i've been

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.680
 picking on you a little bit too much in this section and i feel like i can give you a few passes

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:57.280
 now thank you and i outright just believe that so yeah so um just have a few things on electricity

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:02.560
 poles right they can be used and this is a tip for anyone who gets stuck out in the wild and

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:08.000
 they're thinking have no way of sending an sos to anyone they can be used for you to be tracked down

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.840
 so there was a guy in saskatchewan who was rescued after having disappeared for a few days by noticing

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.400
 that there were power poles around him so he had an ax on him because he got lost in his boat and he

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:26.160
 chopped four of them down by chopping four of them down hang on there's just a slight break in logic

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.920
 he had an ax on him because he was lost in his boat of course not he had an oar on him or he

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:36.640
 had a sail on him or a life jacket he was out in the wild he was obviously doing some chopping at

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.920
 certain points he was in his boat and he got lost he got lost in a storm so he was no idea where he

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:48.000
 was and he found these four poles so he chopped them down and then the local power source people

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.360
 were alerted to these poles because it took out an entire town um the surrounding communities

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.880
 were all all their electricity was knocked down so hundreds of people died yeah yeah

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.440
 Dan I thought you were going to say because he had his ax on him he chopped down the poles and

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:08.480
 he arranged them in the ground into the shape of the word help he only chopped down four though so

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:15.680
 he's got h and the first part of an e it just looks like he's saying hi then the helicopter comes down

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:27.600
 it just goes hi that flies up again okay it is time for fact number three and that is james

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:35.360
 okay my fact this week is that the most expensive cow in the uk is called posh spice rude it's just

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:42.320
 the name of the cow no aspersions on anyone else who has that name it's really hard to google because

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.760
 you keep finding stories about victoria beckham saying i'm not a moody cow and

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:53.920
 well this is an organism who's proud to be a cow i don't know what her mood is like but she was

00:27:53.920 --> 00:28:02.560
 sold very recently for 250 000 guineas which is 265 000 pounds but they still insist these farmers

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.440
 on saying that everything was sold in guineas i don't know why they do that that really confused

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:13.120
 me are they accepting pounds or is guine the currency that they get paid in it's in pounds a

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:19.440
 guine is a pound in a shilling so it's just like uh it's another way of saying 265 000 pounds it's

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:25.040
 really weird i think you read this and you think am i in the 18th century again yeah why is this news

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.160
 come through a time tunnel it's so bizarre yeah but what's interesting about this cow is that actually

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:35.440
 in the past and still at the moment but it's usually the bulls as in the male cows that get

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:40.960
 sold for the most amount of money but recently due to breakthroughs in ivf methods a lot of cows

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:46.720
 are starting to get sold for a lot more because due to ivf they can have lots more children whereas

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:51.280
 normally you would just get your bull and it would be able to have as many youngsters as you like

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:57.360
 but now that's also true to a slightly lesser extent but still true of the female cows and so

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:03.600
 yeah they've sold it for just over 200 grand and the reason that you buy it is because it's such a

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:09.120
 good cow for breeding that even the embryos of posh spice will be able to sell for several thousands

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:15.280
 of pounds if you if you're just tuning in at this point then go back maybe a couple of minutes to

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.760
 know what i'm talking about when i say that she's not especially if you're posh spice fashion line

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:26.000
 and the reason uh this cow is called posh spice is because her mother was called ginger spice and

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.200
 they never acknowledged that in the band did they they never acknowledged that they were actually

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:35.920
 mother and daughter i think we should not keep making hilarious mistakes and get this cow and

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:41.120
 this single mixed up but she's a limousin heifer and i didn't know that limousin is where you get

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:46.800
 the best cows in france it's a place it's in the foothills of the massive central and um

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.760
 and that's where the limousine come from yeah and that's where limousines come from i think they

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.480
 were named after a carriage weren't they and the carriage was named after maybe a monk because it

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.520
 had a hood over the top these monks would have hoods i think and they lived in limousine i think

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:07.280
 that that's very cool that's a cool link remember that so i think that this might currently be the

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:12.400
 most expensive cow in the whole world but certainly historically it isn't because there have been cows

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:18.960
 in the past that have been sold for over a million dollars in the us in fact in the 1980s there was

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:24.560
 kind of a fashion for buying cows for more than a million dollars sorry what's that in guineas

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:33.920
 these new fangled americans honestly uh there was a tax loop hole that came in in the 80s that

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.480
 meant if you bought some really expensive cows you wouldn't have to pay as much tax and so you

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:44.720
 had hollywoodic stars and wall street bankers just buying these cows they wouldn't keep them in there

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.400
 like hollywood homes they would own a part of them and they would live in the farm if you know

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.440
 i mean it's like an investment yeah they weren't like on the red carpet for all the previous everything

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.960
 right pits showed up with his legs down

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:02.800
 david beckham's brought the wrong posh buys he always confuses them

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:09.360
 and then there was one called missy who was a bit after that maybe in the late 80s early 90s i can't

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:14.080
 remember exactly when it was but she sold for well over a million dollars but the people who bought

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:21.840
 her they'd already had 3.23 million dollars worth of pre-signed contracts for the embryos of this cow

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:27.120
 so you bought it knowing that assuming it you know nothing goes wrong you'll be able to definitely

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.800
 recoup two three four times that amount of money that you paid for it wow i read about missy there

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.080
 was a kind of slightly weird press release about what a great cow missy was it said she's extremely

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:43.840
 tall long and stylish she walks on great feet and legs and has a great mammary system it does

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:49.840
 sound like it's been copy pasted from page three doesn't it and um posh buys of course they did

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:56.560
 describe her as well she has a larger loin depth reduced fat cover and a greater meat tenderness

00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:02.960
 and again if you're just tuning in at this point please do go to the start of this fact

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.120
 James who are these people you imagine who are just tuning in it's not a radio show

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:11.760
 a classic listener let's start 20 minutes into the show

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.960
 i love their third and fourth facts but i've always hated the first two

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:24.320
 um i was looking into cows that were sold for lots of money so i found a really odd

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.640
 wand that i just want to quickly mention and this was a cow that wasn't actually particularly

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:33.280
 special it was a cow that was designated to be slaughtered it was a cow called mini-moo

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:40.000
 and mini-moo was a cow that had a very odd pattern on the side that looked exactly like

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.320
 mini mouse's head so the little three the two ears and the and the head

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:50.800
 so the niece of the owners of this cow wrote to disney and said this cow is due for slaughter but

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.720
 we think you might like it and they saw her and went yes so they bought it for an undisclosed

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.600
 amount we don't actually know and mini was taken over to the magic kingdom where she was in the

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:05.040
 petting farm she was later moved to another petting zoo that disney owns and she was really big and

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:10.320
 she kind of for disney sparked off a really big moment where people started sending in pictures

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:15.840
 of their pigs and dogs that had little patterns on them some people had potatoes that had a little

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.800
 witty mouse wicky mouse look at it yeah and so they were inundated that must have really turned

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:27.440
 around the fortune of the disney company don't sound like a big moment you can just imagine mini

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.760
 as she was being driven away turning around to giving her two middle fingers up at the cow she

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:39.120
 was leaving behind can't you because she did live then until 2001 she's insane all the other cows

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:45.680
 she was with right by 15 years yeah the most expensive pig ever sold was a yorkshire bore

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:54.400
 which went for $270,000 in 2014 and it was raised by the western illinois university

00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:01.120
 school of agriculture professor mark hoagie and his family and the name hoagie comes from an old

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:07.680
 anglo saxon word meaning someone who keeps pigs oh that's so good isn't that what that's what we

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:12.160
 get hog presumably yeah exactly and herd as well hogs and herds all come from that old word

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:18.720
 chickens can be very expensive another expensive farm animal are we going to guess oh no i don't

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.560
 actually have a specific price so you could i would be able to tell you i was more going to talk

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:27.760
 about the chicken bubble of the 1840s do you guys know about this no this is when chicken suddenly

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.800
 became incredibly sought after it's when i think in the west we suddenly discovered loads of asian

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:38.320
 breeds of chicken and imported them queen victoria got obsessed with chickens she built an aviary

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:43.360
 she used to spend hours sitting in there with her chickens talking to them she used to send

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:48.960
 individual eggs to her royal relatives all over europe and so this got really fashionable to collect

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.920
 chickens and their price went through the roof it's so weird isn't it all these things that go in

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:59.920
 bubbles and just become really expensive for no reason like tulips and chickens and yeah like

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:04.880
 it's almost worth just having one of every random thing in your house just in case

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:12.800
 one cosmic dust particle you never know one bit kind and that would have worked that would have

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:17.840
 worked so did she partly start the poultry craze then Anna was it she started the poultry craze

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.800
 yeah well very much fired it people used to hire bodyguards to protect their chicken coops

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:30.160
 but then suddenly bubble burst as these bubbles do and the good thing about that is that there

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:35.600
 was this enormous number of very exotic weirdo chickens which now no one could tell for anything

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.560
 and so darwin bought them all up and this was 1855 and he bought them and he interbred and

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:45.360
 interbred and interbred them and this was how he developed loads of his theories about interbreeding

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.160
 and this is how he showed that actually they still had a shared ancestor and they went it's

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:56.080
 not handy that's really good yes you saw these bubbles you know it's worth it um I looked up the

00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:01.520
 term because I was thinking cows are now turning into cash cows like with this new IVF program

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.360
 that you were mentioning oh yeah so I just thought cash cow where does that come from do we know who

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.640
 came up with that and turns out we do it was a guy called Peter F Drucker and Peter F Drucker was

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:16.000
 sort of the father of management thinking he wrote lots of books where he talked about how to run

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.680
 companies and how to do management and so on and one of his words which he came up with in the 1960s

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:27.360
 was cash cow and he's a guy who sort of he wrote so many books and he wrote a couple of novels

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.000
 but I guess to the public he's kind of dropped out of he was he was a big name back in the day

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:39.840
 we don't really know him now except for in Japan where he is quite a big name because in 2009

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.720
 a novel was written which was called what if the female manager of a high school baseball team

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:51.360
 read Drucker's management and it was massive it sold 1.8 million copies in its first year

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:57.920
 it was the year's best-selling novel in Japan and it has since been turned into a live action film

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:03.360
 it's been turned into an anime he's sort of a household name there in Japan at the moment and

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:08.640
 yeah that's the guy who came up with the term cash cow there's another famous cow or bull rather

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:14.880
 it happened in February this year a Texan beef company started giving out free semen from one

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:21.520
 of their cows because and James will know about this because James knows about the Super Bowl

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:27.920
 and this year the Tampa Bay Buccaneers they won the Super Bowl they did Tom Brady plays for them

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:35.760
 and the Texan beef company owns a bull named Tom Brady and to celebrate the win of the team

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.200
 which contained the player after whom their cow is named or bull rather they gave out free orders

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:50.080
 of semen to anyone who had requested it okay wow yeah yeah wow who was it to anyone could I call

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:54.320
 up and said like some semen I don't think it could have been to anyone I think you must have to say

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.320
 it's going to a good cow I don't think they'd just send you some bull semen in the post

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.240
 well you could say it's going to a good cow and how they're going to check very good point

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:11.280
 just send a photo of a random cow can I just say for anyone who's just tuned in

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:29.200
 okay it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact my fact this week is that the

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:35.840
 person who has acted in more batman movie reboots than anyone else is also the third in line to be

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:41.600
 president of the united states this is a weird system where the person who's acted in more batman

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:47.440
 movie reboots gets to be the third in line isn't it so it goes the succession of line into the

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:54.080
 presidency is Kamala Harris Nancy Pelosi and then batman uberfan Patrick Leahy he has other

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:58.880
 titles doesn't he's not just he does have other titles yeah yeah he's an amazing senator

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:06.480
 he is a massive batman fan and he has appeared in five different batman movies but he's appeared

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.520
 in batman movies that have stretched across the whole modern cinematic history of batman so his

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:17.200
 first cameo was in batman forever which was the movie that starred val kilmer and then he was in

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.600
 batman and robin when it was george cluny and then he went into the christa van oland series

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.520
 where he starred in two of the movies the dark night and the dark sorry you've got to stop saying

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:33.760
 starred in i haven't seen any of these movies so maybe he does he gets menaced by the joker the

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.360
 heath ledger joker i mean it's pretty that's high values green time it's not just he's a

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:41.200
 guy in the background or anything so he has lines does he have lines he does he has a line he says

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.480
 to heath ledger's joker we're not intimidated by thugs and then he replies you know you remind

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.000
 me of my father and he said it was really scary because i don't know if you remember but heath

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.320
 ledger really went method on the acting of the movie there and he had a knife in his hand and it

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.800
 was pressed up against the senator's face and he thought this guy's pretty unhinged so he was a

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:04.800
 bit scared but he loves it he loves doing it um this guy lehi patrick lehi he's not only a batman

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:10.320
 superfan but it's incredibly sweet the story because he started reading the batman comics when

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.320
 he was a little boy and he's he's roughly the same age as batman batman's just about 80 now and

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:19.840
 he's a bit younger than that but all of his fees from the films or as he calls them his bat earnings

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:27.040
 they they go they go to the library where he first read the stories when he was a little boy

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:33.600
 himself and he financed a children's wing of the library okay fine fine i'll let him off his

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:39.200
 bat earnings if he's given it all to children's charities he worked with dc comics uh because

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.840
 they were making a batman comic about landmines and that was used as part of a campaign uh when

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:48.400
 there was a bill coming up to ban landmines and he distributed it among the the other senators so

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:54.720
 yeah he said that he um he decided not to be in the reboot which with robert patternson which

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:59.760
 i think is coming out maybe this year um and he explained that the reason is that he just doesn't

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:05.440
 have time with covid and appropriation bills and the like although i'm not totally clear that anyone

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:11.840
 asked him to be in it there was never he was requested well in the last one he was in he was

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:17.600
 blown up it was in batman versus superman so it's possible he's not in a new reboot because

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.760
 they finally killed off his character because he does play himself in a couple of the movies

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:26.880
 does he sometimes not play himself yeah he sometimes plays a different so how do you explain

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:31.920
 in this batman universe that you've got someone who looks just like a senator who's in a different

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.680
 movie batman says he actually has a line at one point he says oh it's funny you look just like

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.920
 another senator i bet he's practically but you're not him are you and then he says no

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:45.520
 is he i mean he's pretty cool do you think they might as well bump him up a couple of his places

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:51.440
 in the mind of succession no you can't you can't do that you can't have batman in charge of the

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:56.000
 white house and the reason i say that is because i was looking into seeing if joe biden had been

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.960
 in any movies he hasn't really but what i did find out which i didn't know and a lot of people might

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:11.120
 do is that his middle name is robinette isn't that cool robinette joe robinette yeah joe robinette's

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:17.920
 biden so it's robin as in the sidekick of batman with e double te at the end and apparently um

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:24.320
 the robinettes came over to america with lafayette um you know during the late 18th century and they

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:30.000
 never went home and so he is descended from there and it was his mother's maiden name and he took

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.560
 it as a middle name wow do you know the robinettes they actually only came over to america because

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:42.560
 lafayette said he might need a rhyme for him in musical hamilton so batman is apparently the batman

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:47.200
 that i like the most is the one that everyone hates i learned and i guess it's just the one

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.960
 that you've seen in your childhood when you were a kid which i appreciate as a six-year-old i probably

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:57.760
 wasn't the best judge but do you know it's batman forever and people blame its badness on mcdonald's

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:02.640
 so apparently it's all mcdonald's fault that it's not as good and this is because so the first two

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:08.480
 batmans which were batman and batman returns were thimburton making them and they are good

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:13.680
 and i have seen them so they are excellent and they are well tune in next week for another movie review

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:24.640
 both good films very dark very violent and mcdonald's decided to promote them in their happy meals

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:29.040
 because they were like batmans this long-running tv series very happy clappy and fun and so they

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.480
 signed this big old contract saying we'll put all these characters in our happy meals

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.720
 the films came out and the films were going to be like 18 adult rated they had to really

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.680
 fight and cut loads of scenes to get them down to pg 13 now mcdonald's happy meals are targeting

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:47.600
 exclusively the one to ten age range so they were promoting a film that they were all too young to see

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:52.720
 and basically they were appalled the films came out and mcdonald's went to burton and the filmmakers

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:56.480
 and said look like the penguin what's this gross black stuff coming out of his mouth we can't

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:01.840
 promote any of this and after that there was this controversy about how they were too dark and too

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:07.440
 depressing and burton was given the boot and then who was brought in to direct i think it was

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.760
 joel schumacher joel schumacher who got a lot of stick basically had to make them more child

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:15.760
 friendly not too friendly to include nipples that was the main talking point of the film

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:20.400
 with joel schluny is that there are bat nipples on the front of his bat costume yes but the reason

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:26.320
 for that is that i read about this because i haven't watched any of these movies despite them all being

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:34.720
 good now i know they're good i might watch them but in the original batmans the suits were made

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:40.800
 by a guy called bob ringwood but when they made the new suits the techniques of being able to mold

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:45.920
 rubber were way way more advanced and so they wanted to show off how advanced they were

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.840
 so they decided the way they were going to do that was to make them more anatomical

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:55.200
 and so how do you make a chest more anatomical apart from putting nipples on it on the nibs

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.760
 and that was they were made by um joe zay finandez or jose finandez i can't remember how to say his

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:06.720
 first name but um he is the guy also who did the helmets for that punk that punk yeah he does those

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:12.960
 helmets he's done loads of like stuff for hollywood over the years and he also designed the spacesuits

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:20.400
 for space x yeah do you remember ilan musk wanted some sexy spacesuits and they were invented by

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.160
 joe zay finandez i'm not sure if they have nipples on them or not because i haven't seen them but i

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:29.600
 think it's really unfair to slam the bat nipples because bats are mammals yeah point is that they

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:36.640
 have nipples yeah and so batman accurately he'd have loads of nipples yes are they angry there's

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.560
 not enough nipples he should have them in his crotch like where don't bats have them in their

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.640
 their armpits yeah crotch is an armpits are two very different things they're landing i don't know

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.800
 i must see my taylor i always wonder why you wore your trousers like that

00:45:50.800 --> 00:46:00.880
 so batman first appeared in 1939 march 30th and as you were saying andy very close to the birth of

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:08.720
 patrick lehi who was born a year and a day later and it was created by bob cain and bill finger um

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:13.120
 bob cain being the person who's taken all the credit for it bill finger sort of in the background

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:18.160
 no one really knows much about him but he lost all the credit but they um they both went to the same

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:22.880
 high school in the bronx in new york which was called de wid clinton high school and another

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:29.280
 student who went to that school was stan lee the creator of spider man and so around the same time

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.760
 was it or it was about a six year difference so they might have been there at the same time yeah

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.960
 it's quite possible wow that's amazing bill finger create batman as you say and he was completely

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:44.640
 uncredited until after he died when uh he was almost reluctantly put in some of the memoirs

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:50.400
 but he came up with the name bruce wane i think apparently it was him who decided to do that

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.720
 and bruce based on robert bruce or robert the bruce as you may incorrectly know him

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:59.760
 as in scottish patrick king warrior and that was because they thought he should have noble blood

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:06.320
 and he his ashes were scattered in the shape of a bat wow they could have done it in the shape

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:14.960
 of a finger as well couldn't they if they wanted much easier um so yeah no one knew when he was alive

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:20.640
 so that was kind of his secret identity you could say you could say the real batman

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:27.920
 um guys do you know how many batmans batman ways uh what i'd say one and i don't understand the

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:37.040
 question i i i do i'm trying to work it out um i'm gonna say 16 it's 29 and what are you talking

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:43.600
 about sorry so batman is a unit of measurement and it was an old ottoman unit of weight in

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:49.600
 ottoman and kind of the steps area you still get the batman region in turkey as the batman river

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.840
 and yeah it's actually been in fact dan might have been working it out based on one of the

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:59.520
 different weights it had because throughout time it's been cited as being you know various

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:05.120
 different weights but in 1599 in english it was seven pounds and five ounces and the comic books say

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:11.920
 that batman weighs 210 pounds so i believe he weighs a prox 29 batmans in case you're wondering

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:17.120
 okay in batman weight terms would you be able to rescue him from the top of a telegraph pole

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:22.240
 if you were a trained open reach engineer he must be heavier than 12 stone is what anna was saying

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:28.080
 yeah you definitely have to get him naked i mean if batman can't get down from a telegraph pole

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:34.640
 something's gone really wrong oh just speaking of other uses of what batman could mean so in the

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:39.600
 batman movies and in the whole series generally batman obviously has his trusty butler alfred

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:45.280
 with him who's a key part of every single movie and comic and so on but interestingly during wars

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:50.800
 they're like world war one for example you used to have a batman by your side who was your butler

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:57.280
 the batman in war was the alfred of the lieutenants of war and the idea was yeah you

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:04.320
 would be assigned a batman who would go and they would make sure that you had your personal equipment

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:09.280
 they worked as a valet if you had to go into combat they acted as a bodyguard so i think they

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:15.840
 would sort of stand in front of him there's no way in a war that is a waste of mud power if every

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:21.120
 soldier has to have a bodyguard well what it said is acting as the officer's bodyguard in combat

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:25.520
 so i assume that's what it is that you sort of yeah they would dig they would dig the officer's

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:30.960
 foxholes and sometimes and this was particularly for the british once the war was over if you had a

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:36.000
 batman during war they would continue on as your butler in real life they would they would be hired

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.440
 by you and go on that is so insane i try to find some notable batmans um peter eustonov was a batman

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.640
 the famous actor peter eustonov and he was a batman to david niven during the war

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:52.240
 so the word bat means it's like a bag that a horse carries uh that's why your batman would be the

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:57.840
 person who put all the stuff like kept all your stuff together and so you would have a batman

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:03.040
 and he would also have a bat horse and the bat horse would be the thing that carried the bags on

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.800
 it and the bat horse might carry the guy's bat money which is what you would pay a batman so

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:14.080
 in war you might have a batman with a bat horse containing his bat money that's so cool

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:21.600
 there was bat woman of course or there is bat woman uh bat woman first appeared in the dc comics

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:28.160
 as a love interest for batman to dispel suggestions that he was homosexual um because he kept kind of

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:33.040
 i think this is a meme in batman that he keeps almost getting married and then never quite gets

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:39.760
 married uh and anyway there was a lot of um kind of suggestions that he was homosexual and in the

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:44.560
 senate at the time this was in the 50s there was lots of worries that comic books were causing

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:49.280
 problems with children causing juvenile delinquency and various things like that and so they brought

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:55.360
 bat woman in as kind of a way to show that batman was not gay but then bat woman has since openly

00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:02.080
 come out she is now gay since 2006 she was introduced as a lesbian of jewish descent uh

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:09.920
 who found love interest in former goffin police detective renae montaya in your face the 1950s

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:14.560
 yes it's quite funny saying well oh we're terribly worried batman might be gay so let's give him a

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.480
 normal relationship with a woman who is also obsessed with dressing up as a bat like that

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:26.720
 is that family values uh just quickly i was watching a youtube clip of from a dc official

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:30.720
 site and on it they say this thing which i find hilarious because they haven't put this in the

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:36.320
 movies but batman is always signaled to by commissioner gordon by the bat signal the

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:42.320
 famous bat signal goes into the sky now apparently according to dc the reality behind it is is that

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:47.920
 commissioner gordon or any police officer is not allowed to turn that on because by doing that that

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:52.880
 would be qualifying an official endorsement of the city's government for this vigilante that was

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:58.880
 going around he's not allowed to do it so apparently the police office has a civilian on site at all

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:03.920
 times so that as soon as gordon needs to switch it on he goes you get up here and they have to go

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:08.000
 up and switch it on on his behalf so that he's had no hand he's still giving an instruction yeah

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.200
 exactly that is not even a loophole yeah what you need is someone to to be in the office and

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.160
 you say gosh i wish someone would call batman but really subtle so it's deniable yeah yeah

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:22.640
 and then you go out for see you like i'm going out for lunch i'll be back in exactly five minutes

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:29.600
 i'm gonna have my lunch on the roof just one more thing that was sent into the podcast email

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:35.600
 actually about a year ago a couple of years ago fan called daniel braga who i believe is brazilian

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:43.520
 and he informed me that in 2019 police arrested in one go batman spider man and green lantern

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:48.960
 so was it like people on a stag do who were all dressed like this or was it i don't know

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.560
 it actually wasn't it's this really interesting thing i didn't know they had which is in brazilian

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:58.240
 towns they have fun trains which is people are paid to dress up on these fun trains that's any

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:04.960
 train when you're sat next to adi absolutely as long as there's a telegraph pole within 300 feet

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:09.120
 and we're between birmingham and darby they were arrested for assault but they were led off because

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:14.640
 they were assaulting a man who kept banging on about telegraph no they were so there are these

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:20.080
 people who are paid to dress up as superheroes and like knock off some cheap versions of famous

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:25.200
 kids characters to entertain children and a police officer ended up arresting three of them

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:30.320
 who dressed up as spider man green lantern and batman and they were put in prison for

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:35.360
 vandalism and possession of loads of firearms and stuff like that but the person who arrested them

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:40.800
 was a female police officer called thanos no way

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:50.640
