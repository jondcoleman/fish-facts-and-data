00:00:14,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from"
00:00:20,00:00:26,"four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshensky,"
00:00:26,00:00:31,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with
00:00:31,00:00:38,our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here we go. Starting
00:00:38,00:00:44,with fact number one that is Andy. My fact is there is a scientist at Imperial College who's been
00:00:44,00:00:52,studying the same bag of dust for 15 years. Are you are you grusting him up now for being lazy is
00:00:52,00:00:56,that what's happening here? Yeah that's right he's clearly taking his time over it you know I'm
00:00:56,00:01:01,not accusing him of swinging the lead outright but then again he is analysing every single speck
00:01:01,00:01:06,"of dust in his bag so I can see why it's taken time. He's called Matthew Genge, he's a planetary"
00:01:06,00:01:12,scientist at Imperial College and he specialises in micrometeorites which is basically grains of
00:01:12,00:01:17,dust from other worlds and they land on earth all the time. He's got a bag which he collected in
00:01:17,00:01:23,"Antarctica in 2006, it took him five minutes to collect but that was the easy bit because then he"
00:01:23,00:01:27,has to go through it speck by speck and just work out which specks are micrometeorites which is
00:01:27,00:01:35,"the exciting ones and which ones are just dust and yeah. He's got 3,000 of them so far, 3,000"
00:01:35,00:01:40,particles he's really good at picking out of this bag yeah. That's not good going at all.
00:01:40,00:01:44,"Wait he's been doing 15 years and he's only managed to get a 3,000. Look he's got other"
00:01:44,00:01:49,stuff on I mean he's got to eat you know he's probably got a bit of work on. I think I could
00:01:49,00:01:56,"count 3,000 grains of dust within a couple of days max. No you couldn't. Absolutely not."
00:01:56,00:02:02,"It's not okay sorry he's not counting to 3,000. That would assume that every single grain of dust"
00:02:02,00:02:06,"was a winner, he has to go through everyone and analyse it. There's a lot of regular dust in there"
00:02:06,00:02:10,"as well so he's separating it, it's not as if it's a big bag of cosmic dust he's going well"
00:02:10,00:02:16,"he's not the count from Sesame Street, he's analysing every single dust particle that comes"
00:02:16,00:02:21,"out of there. How does he work out the difference between meteorite and a non-meteorite, a meteorong"
00:02:21,00:02:26,like we've called them before? Glad you asked. Andy? Well thanks Dan. Anna do you have anything
00:02:26,00:02:31,to add on this? Well I was going to say you two seem so sure about how difficult this work is
00:02:31,00:02:35,and yeah when I ask you how it's done. You need a microscope that's guaranteed if you're not doing
00:02:35,00:02:39,it with the naked eye. I mean you can clearly identify what they're made of with the microscope
00:02:39,00:02:43,and I think that's how he does it. Well definitely because it's the way that they're made isn't it?
00:02:43,00:02:48,When you get a micrometeorite it's made in space and it comes down through the Earth's atmosphere
00:02:48,00:02:53,and it goes really really hot so they tend to be really really round with like filaments coming
00:02:53,00:02:56,off them and also they're made of something slightly different aren't they because they've
00:02:56,00:03:01,come from space so they tend to be metallic so there's lots of different ways that you can tell
00:03:01,00:03:07,I think. Yeah you can just skim a magnet around a random surface right? That's how Anna does it.
00:03:07,00:03:13,That's how I spend my weekends. This is actually a tip that I read for if you want to find your
00:03:13,00:03:19,own and this is from this amazing guy that I'm sure you've read about this Norwegian jazz musician
00:03:19,00:03:25,called John Larson who doubles up as a scientist and he basically has proven that ordinary plebs
00:03:25,00:03:31,like us are able to collect our own little bits of space dust and yeah he does his with a magnet
00:03:31,00:03:37,so he went all across the roofs of a city magnetizing bits of space dust up. I love this guy. His
00:03:37,00:03:43,band were called Hot Club de Norvige. In fact I still called that but he's retired and he was
00:03:43,00:03:48,one of the best known jazz musicians in the whole of Norway and then whenever he was on tour he would
00:03:48,00:03:52,go around looking for micrometer rights just collecting dust and looking for them and then
00:03:52,00:03:57,he would keep sending them to this guy professor Genj say here's another one here's another one
00:03:57,00:04:04,and Genj would just be like oh for god's sake mate I don't tell you how to play the jazz trumpet
00:04:04,00:04:08,or whatever why are you doing this and eventually he was like okay fine I'll look at it and he
00:04:08,00:04:12,looked at it and he realized that this guy John Larson was actually doing really good work and
00:04:12,00:04:17,between them they were the first people to ever announce that you can find micrometer rights
00:04:17,00:04:23,like Hannah says just in your gutter or wherever. Well I do know as a lockdown project Matt Parker
00:04:23,00:04:28,our buddy whose festival has spoken known he went up into his roofs guttering and he grabbed a bunch
00:04:28,00:04:33,of stuff and he's been doing this as well he's been trying to find cosmic dust yeah landing in his gutter.
00:04:33,00:04:38,Very dangerous don't try it at home really I mean they're very weak gutters aren't they
00:04:38,00:04:42,but the good thing if you can get up to them is that they have the newest dust it's the most
00:04:42,00:04:45,up-to-date space dust you'll get because apparently they get cleaned relatively often
00:04:45,00:04:50,compared to most surfaces you're bombed into and so that's dust that has recently landed
00:04:50,00:04:55,and if you want really fresh dust check the weather forecast but for space and find out when
00:04:55,00:04:59,the next meteor shower is you know the space weather forecast. Press the red button when
00:04:59,00:05:04,the normal weather forecast is on it takes you to the secret space forecast. Any aliens who are
00:05:04,00:05:08,watching the BBC now press the red button and we'll tell you what the weather's like in your
00:05:08,00:05:14,solar system. Anyway look look for a meteor shower on your alien weather forecast and then wash your
00:05:14,00:05:19,roof because that'll get rid of all the old past it space dust and then when the meteor shower comes
00:05:19,00:05:23,then and this is another one of Rockstar John Larson's tips he says then you'll just get the
00:05:23,00:05:28,debris from that exact meteor shower so you'll know exactly which space dust you're getting.
00:05:28,00:05:34,Yeah that is really cool. Do you know that Matt Genge might one day find a particle of a meteorite
00:05:34,00:05:40,also named Matt Genge? Oh yeah. Isn't that cool? How will he know though? Like it's not gonna have his
00:05:40,00:05:46,name on it is it? No I guess maybe it just have the M if it's so small. But you've got to be careful
00:05:46,00:05:50,because M and M's have an M on them as well. I don't want to mix them up. Imagine that that'd be a great
00:05:50,00:05:55,"frank, couldn't it? Just put some M and M's in his dust and he's like oh my god I found one of my"
00:05:55,00:06:00,meteorites. Well he's the big deal in the cosmic dust world and such a big deal that there is actually
00:06:00,00:06:05,an eight kilometer wide asteroid near Mars that has been named in his honor for his contributions
00:06:05,00:06:11,to the science. So one day he could yeah he could pull out. Is it the more famous you are the bigger
00:06:11,00:06:17,the comet that would be named after you is? Does it? No I don't think so because then like whatever
00:06:17,00:06:21,meteorites about to hit the earth is necessarily going to be named after either the queen or Mick
00:06:21,00:06:25,Jagger which doesn't really seem fair does it? It'd be cool if it was a Mick Jagger. I wouldn't
00:06:25,00:06:32,mind her being wiped out by Mick Jagger's meteorite. More of a flying stone than a rolling one.
00:06:32,00:06:39,Have you heard of Penelope Vozniakiewicz? So she is another space dust expert and she went to
00:06:39,00:06:45,the Marshall Islands to find space dust because every square meter of earth gets about 10 particles
00:06:45,00:06:51,a year of space dust. That's the average right? 10 particles? I don't fancy Matt Parker's chances
00:06:51,00:06:56,of finding them. You're right. It's every once a month a square meter will get one particle
00:06:56,00:06:59,"and it's quite a lot in aggregate. It's 30,000 tons in aggregate but obviously that's because"
00:06:59,00:07:03,the world is quite big. But problem as you guys have all been saying is that it's really hard to
00:07:03,00:07:08,find it among normal dust and there is so much dust in most places all sort of random dirt.
00:07:08,00:07:12,But if you go to places with zero dust you have a much better chance and the Marshall Islands are
00:07:12,00:07:18,a thousand miles away from the nearest land so there is you know wind blows less random crud
00:07:18,00:07:24,into the land and so that is a really good place to find the dust. It's obviously a long way to
00:07:24,00:07:29,go. It's not like you're gutter but once you get there you have better chances. Okay. And the way
00:07:29,00:07:34,you find it is you get a brush and you have a single hair on that brush. It's like a paint brush
00:07:34,00:07:39,but with one hair and some scientists even use a single eyelash. They just take one of their
00:07:39,00:07:44,eyelashes and they strap it to a brush handle and they use that to pick up the micrometeorite
00:07:44,00:07:50,and look at it under the microscope. How do you strap an eyelash onto anything? Yeah so do all
00:07:50,00:07:56,these micrometeologists have no eyelashes? That's how you spot a really successful one. Yeah.
00:07:56,00:08:01,We should say with micrometeorites is they're not the same as a small meteorite because a
00:08:01,00:08:06,micrometeorite is made of different stuff than meteorites. So meteorites we think come from
00:08:06,00:08:12,asteroid belts but it looks like micrometeorites probably come from comets because they contain
00:08:12,00:08:17,little bits of water which meteorites don't contain. And what's interesting about that is there is a
00:08:17,00:08:24,"hypothesis that all of the earth's oceans came from these tiny, tiny, tiny meteorites just millions"
00:08:24,00:08:28,and millions and billions and billions of them landing on earth over years and years and years
00:08:28,00:08:32,and years and years and eventually tiny bits of water becoming more water becoming more water
00:08:32,00:08:38,becoming our oceans. That's incredible. Isn't that cool? That's incredible. So Matt Parker's
00:08:38,00:08:46,"gutter might flood. Yeah. Well, that matter if you're listening. Well the next 4.5 billion years."
00:08:46,00:08:50,That must have been so boring at the early stages when you're just looking into the
00:08:50,00:08:52,beds of the world's oceans waiting for it to fill up. Like you know when you're trying to
00:08:52,00:08:57,fill a paddling pool and it's taking a really long time. Exactly. But it's amazing isn't it?
00:08:57,00:09:02,How much enters our planet every day? In fact what's actually peculiar is we're not quite
00:09:02,00:09:08,sure how much it is but it could be up to 300 tons a day. It could be as little as five as well
00:09:08,00:09:12,as the other calculations. So it's somewhere in between but it's an extraordinary amount and
00:09:12,00:09:17,"it's really important for our planet particularly our oceans. Like not only did it as you say James,"
00:09:17,00:09:22,"maybe seed the oceans all together but also a lot of animals, a lot of organisms actually"
00:09:22,00:09:27,rely on these micrometeorites because of the iron and so on in them. They sort of feed them.
00:09:27,00:09:32,They feed their nature. There is one theory that if there's anything that lives on Mars which we
00:09:32,00:09:35,don't think there is but if there's anything that lives in the soil of Mars then they probably eat
00:09:35,00:09:40,these micrometeorites because they contain bits of like you say nickel and metals and things like
00:09:40,00:09:48,that. It's really wild. Just a thing about dust? Dust. There is a dust library in Ohio State University.
00:09:48,00:09:53,Now all libraries are quite dusty aren't they? That's a good point but those ones have books and
00:09:53,00:09:59,this one has no books it just has the pieces of dust. This was from a new scientist piece in 2011
00:09:59,00:10:02,and they were studying the different bits of dust because when you look at them that you know
00:10:02,00:10:07,depending on whether it's a bit of a thread of cotton or a piece of soot or carbon or whatever
00:10:07,00:10:11,they look really different on the microscope. Anyway it only had 63 particles in 2011 so I
00:10:11,00:10:18,don't know if they've got way more now. Sorry this library has 63 grains of dust in it but then
00:10:18,00:10:24,every other library has way more. I know but I think these are categorised and then it's not a
00:10:24,00:10:29,lending library. This library has the fewest bits of dust in the whole world of all the libraries
00:10:29,00:10:35,and yet it has the goal to call itself a dust library. Is it being stalked by this Matt and
00:10:35,00:10:42,Hench character by any chance? One bit of dusty here. Do you know Nasa has a problem with fake
00:10:42,00:10:49,fake space dust? So fake space dust is a thing which is space dust that's simulated it's actually
00:10:49,00:10:54,called simulant that's made on earth for scientists to do experiments on so if you are going to land
00:10:54,00:11:00,a rover on Mars or if you're thinking about you know astronauts going and living on a asteroid or
00:11:00,00:11:04,whatever then you've got to order in some fake space dust to see how that would work with that
00:11:04,00:11:10,all around it and so companies manufacture this but there's an issue because there's lots of dodgy
00:11:10,00:11:16,space dusts out there so for instance there are about 30 moon simulants available but some of them
00:11:16,00:11:21,are below par some of them are based on old models some of them are specifically for one thing that
00:11:21,00:11:26,won't work for another and this is a proper issue and Nasa's finally got this company who
00:11:26,00:11:32,mines asteroids to get actual dust off asteroids bring it back and exactly replicate it.
00:11:32,00:11:37,I know you say there are 30 companies that make fake dust I mean that's just fake moon dust.
00:11:37,00:11:41,Sorry that is mind-blowing isn't it. Did they make money do you think because I reckon there
00:11:41,00:11:48,might be 31 after this podcast the way Andy's looking. Moon dust by the way was a real worry for
00:11:48,00:11:54,Nasa when the Apollo 11 astronauts came back because they weren't sure if they were bringing back
00:11:54,00:11:59,an alien dust form that was going to you know send a plague around the planet so once Aldrin and
00:11:59,00:12:04,Collins and Armstrong got back they were quarantined in a room but they weren't on their own they were
00:12:04,00:12:10,also quarantined with a bunch of animals that were in surrounding areas so they basically they fed
00:12:10,00:12:16,lunar dust that they brought back to German cockroaches no to yeah to Japanese quail brown
00:12:16,00:12:22,shrimps oysters shellfish horse flies and they were injecting it into mice and they had to watch
00:12:22,00:12:27,how they reacted to the lunar dust to see if there was anything that went wrong because if anything
00:12:27,00:12:33,went wrong yeah how close were the quail and the shrimp to the guys were they in the same trailer
00:12:33,00:12:37,because they were quarantined. I assume that it must have been in surrounding areas because I think
00:12:37,00:12:42,they quarantined everything into one place but everything survived except for the oysters but
00:12:42,00:12:45,they don't think it was to do with the moon dust they think it was more to do with the fact
00:12:45,00:12:50,they were being tested during mating season and I guess it was stress levels that got to them and
00:12:50,00:12:54,they died but um yeah they were really worried about that and they kept doing that until I
00:12:54,00:13:02,think Apollo 14 I believe it was. So some spaced us in future might be dead people and so this is
00:13:02,00:13:06,about how we would dispose of corpses in space if ever we produced them and so for instance if
00:13:06,00:13:12,you're on the ISS you sometimes have to do drills as to you know what happens if someone dies where
00:13:12,00:13:17,you put them and actually NASA hasn't really worked out how to deal with dead bodies at the ISS
00:13:17,00:13:22,and so they've come up with a number of ideas and they commissioned a company to figure out how
00:13:22,00:13:28,best to dispose of them and the idea the company came up with was the body bag that is that you put
00:13:28,00:13:33,the body once the astronaut dies you put a body in an airtight bag and you send it out into space
00:13:33,00:13:37,but on a lead from the International Space Station so you still got hold of it so the whole body
00:13:37,00:13:41,freezes over the course of about an hour like putting a bottle of wine in the freezer or something
00:13:41,00:13:48,and then you you reel it back in and then the bag gets vigorously vibrated and that makes the body
00:13:48,00:13:54,shatter into a fine powder and then you store it in a container just outside the ISS you bring it
00:13:54,00:13:59,back in on re-entry and then you can present back to the family there to be fair in powder form but
00:13:59,00:14:04,still body of their deceased loved one and that's what they think they might do. I don't leave it
00:14:04,00:14:08,too long like a bottle of wine if you leave a bottle of wine overnight in the freezer. That's
00:14:08,00:14:13,that body explodes all over the ISS yeah I think but part of the idea is that they think people
00:14:13,00:14:18,would find it emotionally taxing to spend you know six months on the ISS with a dead body just there
00:14:18,00:14:22,in body form. But just if you're looking out the window and you're seeing Steve bobbing along on
00:14:22,00:14:40,his lead that's probably also emotionally taxing. Okay there's time for fact number two and that
00:14:40,00:14:46,is Anna. My fact this week is that every year power line repair workers have to pass a test
00:14:46,00:14:53,where they rescue a 12 stone dummy from the top of a telegraph pole. Wow. Being a line worker is a
00:14:53,00:14:58,lot more fun than I imagined turns out so this is people who they're like outdoor electricians so
00:14:58,00:15:04,"that the guys who work on telegraph lines, electricity lines, cables, pylons all those things"
00:15:04,00:15:12,and I was reading in Kent online an article about Rod Lurie who's been a power line worker for 56 years
00:15:12,00:15:17,and he said yeah every year you have to do the pole rescue test so he's in his 70s now
00:15:17,00:15:23,still does it. You climb a 15 meter pole there's a 12 stone dummy sitting at the top and you have
00:15:23,00:15:27,to carry it down and as if you're up there with your co-worker and they get an electric shock
00:15:27,00:15:32,or they have a heart attack or they fall asleep and you have to carry them down so it's to prepare
00:15:32,00:15:37,you for that. Yeah it makes sense. What if they're more than 12 stone? I mean 12 stone is not that
00:15:37,00:15:42,much. I mean do you have to strip them nude to take them down to get them as light as possible?
00:15:42,00:15:47,Yes. The problem is all those meteorites landing on them all the time it gets heavier and heavier
00:15:47,00:15:53,doesn't it? Old Matt Gend would be there for 40 years. Matt Gend is a really eminent scientist I don't
00:15:53,00:15:59,like the way he's become a byword for hanging around doing things like that. Anna did you read the
00:15:59,00:16:03,name of the dummy? I think it's the right dummy that I'm thinking about because this is a US one
00:16:03,00:16:08,as well which is called Rescue Randy. Yeah that's it. There's no way the English one is called Rescue
00:16:08,00:16:14,Randy. He's like a whole Barbie. He's like a Ken doll. There are all these different versions.
00:16:14,00:16:19,And accessories. You can get accessories there as well. Exactly. Oh you can put earrings on him
00:16:19,00:16:25,and a cat. You can buy a shredded rubber to stuff inside him. You can buy special overalls and he's
00:16:25,00:16:31,"got this whole family so there's Rescue Jennifer, there's Rugged Randy and there's Trauma Randy."
00:16:31,00:16:34,Rugged Randy. It's not like the particularly attractive co-worker you have.
00:16:34,00:16:39,You have to carry him down but you have to hide your enormous erection as you're doing so because
00:16:39,00:16:47,he's so fit. But which pole do I climb? Anna did you read about Trauma Randy though?
00:16:47,00:16:50,"No what does Trauma Randy do? Trauma Randy is what I call you, have the..."
00:16:50,00:16:59,Randy Andy for me. Trauma Randy comes with four bleeding wounds.
00:17:00,00:17:04,Wow. I know but I think the top of the range is Casualty Care Rescue Randy
00:17:04,00:17:10,who costs 19 grand which is a lot. He holds four litres of blood and you can do actual
00:17:10,00:17:15,"surgery on him and he has a, I'm quoting here, a manual foot operated pumping system which allows"
00:17:15,00:17:21,three wounds to bleed simultaneously. These guys they must be used for other things. They can't
00:17:21,00:17:27,be a company that just sells these dolls just to go up telephone. It is! James there are 30 companies
00:17:27,00:17:33,which make fake dolls. We don't know the world anymore. Telegraph poles. Yeah there's loads of
00:17:33,00:17:37,them in America isn't there which is why I kind of think that I can accept that this company is
00:17:37,00:17:42,selling all of these things because in America like obviously all the places are quite spread out
00:17:42,00:17:46,compared to Britain for instance there's a lot more of them but they weren't even supposed to be
00:17:46,00:17:52,there the first ones because Samuel Moss who invented the telegraph he wanted to show that
00:17:52,00:17:56,he could get a message from Washington DC to Baltimore which is about 40 miles or something
00:17:56,00:18:01,like that but he wanted to go under the ground with his telegraph wires. He did that but it didn't
00:18:01,00:18:05,work and they had to kind of really quickly think oh shit what are we going to do and they erected
00:18:05,00:18:11,all these poles to put the telegraphs across and then when he did his famous like what have God
00:18:11,00:18:15,wrought telegraph message that he did that was going through the air that was going through the air
00:18:15,00:18:19,yeah I guess it's not obvious yeah under the ground is a much better place for them well that's what
00:18:19,00:18:23,some people think for sure they couldn't sell them in France you know the telegraph system
00:18:23,00:18:28,that Moss invented because they already had an optical telegraph which is like where you go on
00:18:28,00:18:32,top of the hill and you have a big sort of stick which does a semaphore and someone's on another
00:18:32,00:18:36,hill who can see it and they pass that message on to someone else on to someone else on to someone
00:18:36,00:18:42,else and that was really massive in France at the time it was invented by a French chap called Claude
00:18:42,00:18:52,Chap he was French until the 1850s it was the main way of sending messages in France and it was so
00:18:52,00:18:57,good and so useful that you couldn't sell anything better to them you could but they decided that
00:18:57,00:19:01,they wouldn't accept it so right we've already brought the technology to its absolute peak
00:19:01,00:19:08,haven't guys you're waving flags from mountaintop BT open reach they have a telegraph pole training
00:19:08,00:19:14,academy which is so cool it's just a big field in Peterborough which is full of dozens of nine
00:19:14,00:19:21,metre poles and that's the sort of dojo where their engineers train they seem like a vaguely fun
00:19:21,00:19:27,company actually open reach this is based on some of their PR materials so they released an article
00:19:27,00:19:33,where they said that their 500 strong team of engineers in 2020 climbed more than 11.5 million
00:19:33,00:19:38,meters close to a round trip from London to the North Pole no Anna hang on it doesn't they're
00:19:38,00:19:42,comparing apples and oranges there because walking to the North Pole is obviously very hard but it's
00:19:42,00:19:47,not as hard as climbing 10 million meters up into the air which would be really hard so I read that
00:19:47,00:19:54,article and I thought let's compare apples with apples and so I reckon that the open reach engineers
00:19:54,00:20:00,every two weeks do the equivalent of climbing to the ISS that's really good wow that's pretty cool
00:20:00,00:20:04,but that's that's between them right so there's only one person who gets there there's one person
00:20:04,00:20:11,on the very bottom hold their weight um you know we were saying about um whether sometimes you want
00:20:11,00:20:14,to transmit these signals above ground and sometimes underground and obviously today it's
00:20:14,00:20:18,preferable to do it underground and in fact it always has been but it's just that it's really
00:20:18,00:20:24,much more expensive to install wires underground than in poles but if you go to New York well if
00:20:24,00:20:28,you're in Manhattan at least you don't see a single electricity pole or a single radio
00:20:28,00:20:34,transmission pole and that is because in the 1880s when Edison was working on electric transmission
00:20:34,00:20:40,and New York was kind of his test case New York became this huge mass of wires and it looks insane
00:20:40,00:20:46,you can't see the sky it's just you know thousands of wires above your head and there was a blizzard
00:20:46,00:20:51,in 1888 this great blizzard of New York and the whole city went into blackout because it brought
00:20:51,00:20:57,down the wires and the mayor in 1889 who came in after that who was Mayor Hugh Grant uh in his
00:21:01,00:21:13,in a charmingly stammering speech that's what he did and he taught them into it and they brought
00:21:13,00:21:19,them all down um and so now it doesn't have any they're all underground thanks to Hugh Grant nice
00:21:19,00:21:25,in bits of Africa and South Africa there is a height restriction on how low you can have
00:21:25,00:21:30,your electricity poles do you know why that is well do you mean like they have to be a certain
00:21:30,00:21:35,height so that you don't yeah so that people well actually i've just heard Anna say giraffes and that
00:21:35,00:21:43,sounds good that is correct oh my answer i was gonna come up with a bit of a bit of whimsy there but
00:21:43,00:21:50,never mind sorry wow so for giraffes yeah they got to make sure that they don't get tangled up
00:21:50,00:21:54,because that did happen a few times in a few of the country so a restriction of height was put
00:21:54,00:21:59,into it so yeah the lines will always be taller than the tallest giraffe the lions will be taller
00:21:59,00:22:05,the lines the power lines oh lines sorry that's a frightening dystopia the world's exactly the same
00:22:05,00:22:09,except all the lions are bigger than giraffes i suppose in Africa you have lines men but also
00:22:09,00:22:14,lions men and you don't want to get that mixed up these in the old days you could calculate how
00:22:14,00:22:19,fast your train was going between Birmingham and Derby because the telegraph poles were exactly
00:22:19,00:22:24,the same distance apart so oh my god i've just imagined he'd be sat next to you on a train now
00:22:24,00:22:31,andy jesus christ they were 352 feet apart each exactly and you could count how many you passed
00:22:31,00:22:36,in a minute and that would help you calculate the speed of the train i always prove for this
00:22:36,00:22:38,conversation is how unpleasant it would have been to sit with you on a train
00:22:38,00:22:45,anytime anytime in history we've all been there and it's not nice
00:22:45,00:22:52,look andy i think i know somewhere that you'll fit in and that is the telegraph pole appreciation
00:22:52,00:22:59,society oh and i've bought your membership it's free it was it's founded in 1997 i spent a long
00:22:59,00:23:05,time on their website their motto is very catchy if it's tall wooden sticky upy and got wires coming
00:23:05,00:23:12,out of the top then we appreciate it do you see the pole of the month section and i had a look at
00:23:12,00:23:17,pole of the month yeah did you appreciate it i loved it november's pole of the month was particularly
00:23:17,00:23:21,beautiful and they really like to give a good description of the pole of the month so it was
00:23:21,00:23:26,november 2020 uh this sumptuous right angle double stack of three cross armed pole i would
00:23:26,00:23:32,hazard a guess is on the road between bidford and elmscott it's uh and then they have beautiful
00:23:32,00:23:38,photos and they have people who send in all their polls um you know there's a pylon appreciation
00:23:38,00:23:43,society as well what yeah you didn't find it anna you should check it out it's run by a lady called
00:23:43,00:23:48,flash bristo she lives in east london and she's one of the pylon spotters of the uk and she's got
00:23:48,00:23:55,530 photos 36 different countries absolutely obsessed with it and there is the famous pink
00:23:55,00:24:02,pylon which has actually its own appreciation website pinkpylon.co.uk don't go on that website
00:24:02,00:24:07,if you're listening to this yeah rugged randy's pink pylon i think i've read that okay actually
00:24:07,00:24:12,we're so appreciative in the uk this is what i've learned in this podcast
00:24:13,00:24:22,pylons onto the real meat pylons pylons oh my goodness well don't call them pylons don't call
00:24:22,00:24:27,them pylons why don't call them pylons because they're not called pylons i read this on the
00:24:27,00:24:33,science museum website it was a guy who works in the industry who says major faux pas so pylon
00:24:33,00:24:38,in engineering is a structure that holds something that's suspended from another structure to it
00:24:38,00:24:42,so the pylons on a pylon are actually the bits of metal that hold the wires up
00:24:42,00:24:46,a pylon itself is actually called a steel lattice tower so if you really want to impress
00:24:46,00:24:51,your friends when you see one say that's a nice steel lattice tower isn't it because the name
00:24:51,00:24:57,actually comes from ancient egypt doesn't it pylon so when they first started going up they
00:24:57,00:25:02,were just called whatever lattice structure you called the manner but they just found toot and
00:25:02,00:25:07,camoon and a few other mummies quite recently and egyptology was really really fashionable
00:25:07,00:25:12,and so they were looking for a name and they just thought oh if you go to a pyramid they have these
00:25:12,00:25:17,obelisk shaped towers on either side of the doors and they thought well you know what a great thing
00:25:17,00:25:22,to name it after they're called pylons let's call them pylons but i really like the egyptology
00:25:22,00:25:27,connection because i think in ancient egypt they were a gateway to the sun well that's maybe what
00:25:27,00:25:32,the word means and that's kind of what an electrical pylon is you know you're harnessing power and it's
00:25:32,00:25:37,kind of like a gateway to the sun you get light and you know okay everyone's going with that cool
00:25:37,00:25:45,it was such an absurd statement i think we just chose something to go i just feel and the i've been
00:25:45,00:25:49,picking on you a little bit too much in this section and i feel like i can give you a few passes
00:25:49,00:25:57,now thank you and i outright just believe that so yeah so um just have a few things on electricity
00:25:57,00:26:02,poles right they can be used and this is a tip for anyone who gets stuck out in the wild and
00:26:02,00:26:08,they're thinking have no way of sending an sos to anyone they can be used for you to be tracked down
00:26:08,00:26:13,so there was a guy in saskatchewan who was rescued after having disappeared for a few days by noticing
00:26:13,00:26:18,that there were power poles around him so he had an ax on him because he got lost in his boat and he
00:26:18,00:26:26,chopped four of them down by chopping four of them down hang on there's just a slight break in logic
00:26:26,00:26:31,he had an ax on him because he was lost in his boat of course not he had an oar on him or he
00:26:31,00:26:36,had a sail on him or a life jacket he was out in the wild he was obviously doing some chopping at
00:26:36,00:26:41,certain points he was in his boat and he got lost he got lost in a storm so he was no idea where he
00:26:41,00:26:48,was and he found these four poles so he chopped them down and then the local power source people
00:26:48,00:26:53,were alerted to these poles because it took out an entire town um the surrounding communities
00:26:53,00:26:58,were all all their electricity was knocked down so hundreds of people died yeah yeah
00:26:58,00:27:03,Dan I thought you were going to say because he had his ax on him he chopped down the poles and
00:27:03,00:27:08,he arranged them in the ground into the shape of the word help he only chopped down four though so
00:27:08,00:27:15,he's got h and the first part of an e it just looks like he's saying hi then the helicopter comes down
00:27:15,00:27:27,it just goes hi that flies up again okay it is time for fact number three and that is james
00:27:27,00:27:35,okay my fact this week is that the most expensive cow in the uk is called posh spice rude it's just
00:27:35,00:27:42,the name of the cow no aspersions on anyone else who has that name it's really hard to google because
00:27:42,00:27:45,you keep finding stories about victoria beckham saying i'm not a moody cow and
00:27:45,00:27:53,well this is an organism who's proud to be a cow i don't know what her mood is like but she was
00:27:53,00:28:02,sold very recently for 250 000 guineas which is 265 000 pounds but they still insist these farmers
00:28:02,00:28:07,on saying that everything was sold in guineas i don't know why they do that that really confused
00:28:07,00:28:13,me are they accepting pounds or is guine the currency that they get paid in it's in pounds a
00:28:13,00:28:19,guine is a pound in a shilling so it's just like uh it's another way of saying 265 000 pounds it's
00:28:19,00:28:25,really weird i think you read this and you think am i in the 18th century again yeah why is this news
00:28:25,00:28:30,come through a time tunnel it's so bizarre yeah but what's interesting about this cow is that actually
00:28:30,00:28:35,in the past and still at the moment but it's usually the bulls as in the male cows that get
00:28:35,00:28:40,sold for the most amount of money but recently due to breakthroughs in ivf methods a lot of cows
00:28:40,00:28:46,are starting to get sold for a lot more because due to ivf they can have lots more children whereas
00:28:46,00:28:51,normally you would just get your bull and it would be able to have as many youngsters as you like
00:28:51,00:28:57,but now that's also true to a slightly lesser extent but still true of the female cows and so
00:28:57,00:29:03,yeah they've sold it for just over 200 grand and the reason that you buy it is because it's such a
00:29:03,00:29:09,good cow for breeding that even the embryos of posh spice will be able to sell for several thousands
00:29:09,00:29:15,of pounds if you if you're just tuning in at this point then go back maybe a couple of minutes to
00:29:15,00:29:19,know what i'm talking about when i say that she's not especially if you're posh spice fashion line
00:29:19,00:29:26,and the reason uh this cow is called posh spice is because her mother was called ginger spice and
00:29:26,00:29:29,they never acknowledged that in the band did they they never acknowledged that they were actually
00:29:29,00:29:35,mother and daughter i think we should not keep making hilarious mistakes and get this cow and
00:29:35,00:29:41,this single mixed up but she's a limousin heifer and i didn't know that limousin is where you get
00:29:41,00:29:46,the best cows in france it's a place it's in the foothills of the massive central and um
00:29:46,00:29:51,and that's where the limousine come from yeah and that's where limousines come from i think they
00:29:51,00:29:56,were named after a carriage weren't they and the carriage was named after maybe a monk because it
00:29:56,00:30:01,had a hood over the top these monks would have hoods i think and they lived in limousine i think
00:30:01,00:30:07,that that's very cool that's a cool link remember that so i think that this might currently be the
00:30:07,00:30:12,most expensive cow in the whole world but certainly historically it isn't because there have been cows
00:30:12,00:30:18,in the past that have been sold for over a million dollars in the us in fact in the 1980s there was
00:30:18,00:30:24,kind of a fashion for buying cows for more than a million dollars sorry what's that in guineas
00:30:25,00:30:33,these new fangled americans honestly uh there was a tax loop hole that came in in the 80s that
00:30:33,00:30:38,meant if you bought some really expensive cows you wouldn't have to pay as much tax and so you
00:30:38,00:30:44,had hollywoodic stars and wall street bankers just buying these cows they wouldn't keep them in there
00:30:44,00:30:48,like hollywood homes they would own a part of them and they would live in the farm if you know
00:30:48,00:30:53,i mean it's like an investment yeah they weren't like on the red carpet for all the previous everything
00:30:53,00:30:56,right pits showed up with his legs down
00:30:56,00:31:02,david beckham's brought the wrong posh buys he always confuses them
00:31:02,00:31:09,and then there was one called missy who was a bit after that maybe in the late 80s early 90s i can't
00:31:09,00:31:14,remember exactly when it was but she sold for well over a million dollars but the people who bought
00:31:14,00:31:21,her they'd already had 3.23 million dollars worth of pre-signed contracts for the embryos of this cow
00:31:21,00:31:27,so you bought it knowing that assuming it you know nothing goes wrong you'll be able to definitely
00:31:27,00:31:32,recoup two three four times that amount of money that you paid for it wow i read about missy there
00:31:32,00:31:38,was a kind of slightly weird press release about what a great cow missy was it said she's extremely
00:31:38,00:31:43,tall long and stylish she walks on great feet and legs and has a great mammary system it does
00:31:43,00:31:49,sound like it's been copy pasted from page three doesn't it and um posh buys of course they did
00:31:49,00:31:56,describe her as well she has a larger loin depth reduced fat cover and a greater meat tenderness
00:31:56,00:32:02,and again if you're just tuning in at this point please do go to the start of this fact
00:32:02,00:32:07,James who are these people you imagine who are just tuning in it's not a radio show
00:32:07,00:32:11,a classic listener let's start 20 minutes into the show
00:32:12,00:32:16,i love their third and fourth facts but i've always hated the first two
00:32:16,00:32:24,um i was looking into cows that were sold for lots of money so i found a really odd
00:32:24,00:32:28,wand that i just want to quickly mention and this was a cow that wasn't actually particularly
00:32:28,00:32:33,special it was a cow that was designated to be slaughtered it was a cow called mini-moo
00:32:33,00:32:40,and mini-moo was a cow that had a very odd pattern on the side that looked exactly like
00:32:40,00:32:44,mini mouse's head so the little three the two ears and the and the head
00:32:44,00:32:50,so the niece of the owners of this cow wrote to disney and said this cow is due for slaughter but
00:32:50,00:32:54,we think you might like it and they saw her and went yes so they bought it for an undisclosed
00:32:54,00:32:59,amount we don't actually know and mini was taken over to the magic kingdom where she was in the
00:32:59,00:33:05,petting farm she was later moved to another petting zoo that disney owns and she was really big and
00:33:05,00:33:10,she kind of for disney sparked off a really big moment where people started sending in pictures
00:33:10,00:33:15,of their pigs and dogs that had little patterns on them some people had potatoes that had a little
00:33:15,00:33:20,witty mouse wicky mouse look at it yeah and so they were inundated that must have really turned
00:33:20,00:33:27,around the fortune of the disney company don't sound like a big moment you can just imagine mini
00:33:27,00:33:31,as she was being driven away turning around to giving her two middle fingers up at the cow she
00:33:31,00:33:39,was leaving behind can't you because she did live then until 2001 she's insane all the other cows
00:33:39,00:33:45,she was with right by 15 years yeah the most expensive pig ever sold was a yorkshire bore
00:33:45,00:33:54,"which went for $270,000 in 2014 and it was raised by the western illinois university"
00:33:54,00:34:01,school of agriculture professor mark hoagie and his family and the name hoagie comes from an old
00:34:01,00:34:07,anglo saxon word meaning someone who keeps pigs oh that's so good isn't that what that's what we
00:34:07,00:34:12,get hog presumably yeah exactly and herd as well hogs and herds all come from that old word
00:34:12,00:34:18,chickens can be very expensive another expensive farm animal are we going to guess oh no i don't
00:34:18,00:34:22,actually have a specific price so you could i would be able to tell you i was more going to talk
00:34:22,00:34:27,about the chicken bubble of the 1840s do you guys know about this no this is when chicken suddenly
00:34:27,00:34:32,became incredibly sought after it's when i think in the west we suddenly discovered loads of asian
00:34:32,00:34:38,breeds of chicken and imported them queen victoria got obsessed with chickens she built an aviary
00:34:38,00:34:43,she used to spend hours sitting in there with her chickens talking to them she used to send
00:34:43,00:34:48,individual eggs to her royal relatives all over europe and so this got really fashionable to collect
00:34:48,00:34:53,chickens and their price went through the roof it's so weird isn't it all these things that go in
00:34:53,00:34:59,bubbles and just become really expensive for no reason like tulips and chickens and yeah like
00:34:59,00:35:04,it's almost worth just having one of every random thing in your house just in case
00:35:04,00:35:12,one cosmic dust particle you never know one bit kind and that would have worked that would have
00:35:12,00:35:17,worked so did she partly start the poultry craze then Anna was it she started the poultry craze
00:35:17,00:35:22,yeah well very much fired it people used to hire bodyguards to protect their chicken coops
00:35:22,00:35:30,but then suddenly bubble burst as these bubbles do and the good thing about that is that there
00:35:30,00:35:35,was this enormous number of very exotic weirdo chickens which now no one could tell for anything
00:35:35,00:35:40,and so darwin bought them all up and this was 1855 and he bought them and he interbred and
00:35:40,00:35:45,interbred and interbred them and this was how he developed loads of his theories about interbreeding
00:35:45,00:35:50,and this is how he showed that actually they still had a shared ancestor and they went it's
00:35:50,00:35:56,not handy that's really good yes you saw these bubbles you know it's worth it um I looked up the
00:35:56,00:36:01,term because I was thinking cows are now turning into cash cows like with this new IVF program
00:36:01,00:36:05,that you were mentioning oh yeah so I just thought cash cow where does that come from do we know who
00:36:05,00:36:10,came up with that and turns out we do it was a guy called Peter F Drucker and Peter F Drucker was
00:36:10,00:36:16,sort of the father of management thinking he wrote lots of books where he talked about how to run
00:36:16,00:36:21,companies and how to do management and so on and one of his words which he came up with in the 1960s
00:36:21,00:36:27,was cash cow and he's a guy who sort of he wrote so many books and he wrote a couple of novels
00:36:27,00:36:32,but I guess to the public he's kind of dropped out of he was he was a big name back in the day
00:36:32,00:36:39,we don't really know him now except for in Japan where he is quite a big name because in 2009
00:36:39,00:36:44,a novel was written which was called what if the female manager of a high school baseball team
00:36:44,00:36:51,read Drucker's management and it was massive it sold 1.8 million copies in its first year
00:36:51,00:36:57,it was the year's best-selling novel in Japan and it has since been turned into a live action film
00:36:57,00:37:03,it's been turned into an anime he's sort of a household name there in Japan at the moment and
00:37:03,00:37:08,yeah that's the guy who came up with the term cash cow there's another famous cow or bull rather
00:37:08,00:37:14,it happened in February this year a Texan beef company started giving out free semen from one
00:37:14,00:37:21,of their cows because and James will know about this because James knows about the Super Bowl
00:37:21,00:37:27,and this year the Tampa Bay Buccaneers they won the Super Bowl they did Tom Brady plays for them
00:37:27,00:37:35,and the Texan beef company owns a bull named Tom Brady and to celebrate the win of the team
00:37:35,00:37:41,which contained the player after whom their cow is named or bull rather they gave out free orders
00:37:41,00:37:50,of semen to anyone who had requested it okay wow yeah yeah wow who was it to anyone could I call
00:37:50,00:37:54,up and said like some semen I don't think it could have been to anyone I think you must have to say
00:37:54,00:37:58,it's going to a good cow I don't think they'd just send you some bull semen in the post
00:37:58,00:38:02,well you could say it's going to a good cow and how they're going to check very good point
00:38:02,00:38:11,just send a photo of a random cow can I just say for anyone who's just tuned in
00:38:11,00:38:29,okay it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact my fact this week is that the
00:38:29,00:38:35,person who has acted in more batman movie reboots than anyone else is also the third in line to be
00:38:35,00:38:41,president of the united states this is a weird system where the person who's acted in more batman
00:38:41,00:38:47,movie reboots gets to be the third in line isn't it so it goes the succession of line into the
00:38:47,00:38:54,presidency is Kamala Harris Nancy Pelosi and then batman uberfan Patrick Leahy he has other
00:38:54,00:38:58,titles doesn't he's not just he does have other titles yeah yeah he's an amazing senator
00:38:59,00:39:06,he is a massive batman fan and he has appeared in five different batman movies but he's appeared
00:39:06,00:39:11,in batman movies that have stretched across the whole modern cinematic history of batman so his
00:39:11,00:39:17,first cameo was in batman forever which was the movie that starred val kilmer and then he was in
00:39:17,00:39:21,batman and robin when it was george cluny and then he went into the christa van oland series
00:39:21,00:39:25,where he starred in two of the movies the dark night and the dark sorry you've got to stop saying
00:39:25,00:39:33,starred in i haven't seen any of these movies so maybe he does he gets menaced by the joker the
00:39:33,00:39:37,heath ledger joker i mean it's pretty that's high values green time it's not just he's a
00:39:37,00:39:41,guy in the background or anything so he has lines does he have lines he does he has a line he says
00:39:41,00:39:46,to heath ledger's joker we're not intimidated by thugs and then he replies you know you remind
00:39:46,00:39:50,me of my father and he said it was really scary because i don't know if you remember but heath
00:39:50,00:39:54,ledger really went method on the acting of the movie there and he had a knife in his hand and it
00:39:54,00:39:58,was pressed up against the senator's face and he thought this guy's pretty unhinged so he was a
00:39:58,00:40:04,bit scared but he loves it he loves doing it um this guy lehi patrick lehi he's not only a batman
00:40:04,00:40:10,superfan but it's incredibly sweet the story because he started reading the batman comics when
00:40:10,00:40:14,he was a little boy and he's he's roughly the same age as batman batman's just about 80 now and
00:40:14,00:40:19,he's a bit younger than that but all of his fees from the films or as he calls them his bat earnings
00:40:20,00:40:27,they they go they go to the library where he first read the stories when he was a little boy
00:40:27,00:40:33,himself and he financed a children's wing of the library okay fine fine i'll let him off his
00:40:33,00:40:39,bat earnings if he's given it all to children's charities he worked with dc comics uh because
00:40:39,00:40:43,they were making a batman comic about landmines and that was used as part of a campaign uh when
00:40:43,00:40:48,there was a bill coming up to ban landmines and he distributed it among the the other senators so
00:40:49,00:40:54,yeah he said that he um he decided not to be in the reboot which with robert patternson which
00:40:54,00:40:59,i think is coming out maybe this year um and he explained that the reason is that he just doesn't
00:40:59,00:41:05,have time with covid and appropriation bills and the like although i'm not totally clear that anyone
00:41:05,00:41:11,asked him to be in it there was never he was requested well in the last one he was in he was
00:41:11,00:41:17,blown up it was in batman versus superman so it's possible he's not in a new reboot because
00:41:17,00:41:21,they finally killed off his character because he does play himself in a couple of the movies
00:41:21,00:41:26,does he sometimes not play himself yeah he sometimes plays a different so how do you explain
00:41:26,00:41:31,in this batman universe that you've got someone who looks just like a senator who's in a different
00:41:31,00:41:35,movie batman says he actually has a line at one point he says oh it's funny you look just like
00:41:35,00:41:39,another senator i bet he's practically but you're not him are you and then he says no
00:41:39,00:41:45,is he i mean he's pretty cool do you think they might as well bump him up a couple of his places
00:41:45,00:41:51,in the mind of succession no you can't you can't do that you can't have batman in charge of the
00:41:51,00:41:56,white house and the reason i say that is because i was looking into seeing if joe biden had been
00:41:56,00:42:00,in any movies he hasn't really but what i did find out which i didn't know and a lot of people might
00:42:00,00:42:11,do is that his middle name is robinette isn't that cool robinette joe robinette yeah joe robinette's
00:42:11,00:42:17,biden so it's robin as in the sidekick of batman with e double te at the end and apparently um
00:42:17,00:42:24,the robinettes came over to america with lafayette um you know during the late 18th century and they
00:42:24,00:42:30,never went home and so he is descended from there and it was his mother's maiden name and he took
00:42:30,00:42:34,it as a middle name wow do you know the robinettes they actually only came over to america because
00:42:34,00:42:42,lafayette said he might need a rhyme for him in musical hamilton so batman is apparently the batman
00:42:42,00:42:47,that i like the most is the one that everyone hates i learned and i guess it's just the one
00:42:47,00:42:50,that you've seen in your childhood when you were a kid which i appreciate as a six-year-old i probably
00:42:50,00:42:57,wasn't the best judge but do you know it's batman forever and people blame its badness on mcdonald's
00:42:57,00:43:02,so apparently it's all mcdonald's fault that it's not as good and this is because so the first two
00:43:02,00:43:08,batmans which were batman and batman returns were thimburton making them and they are good
00:43:08,00:43:13,and i have seen them so they are excellent and they are well tune in next week for another movie review
00:43:13,00:43:24,both good films very dark very violent and mcdonald's decided to promote them in their happy meals
00:43:24,00:43:29,because they were like batmans this long-running tv series very happy clappy and fun and so they
00:43:29,00:43:32,signed this big old contract saying we'll put all these characters in our happy meals
00:43:32,00:43:36,the films came out and the films were going to be like 18 adult rated they had to really
00:43:36,00:43:41,fight and cut loads of scenes to get them down to pg 13 now mcdonald's happy meals are targeting
00:43:41,00:43:47,exclusively the one to ten age range so they were promoting a film that they were all too young to see
00:43:47,00:43:52,and basically they were appalled the films came out and mcdonald's went to burton and the filmmakers
00:43:52,00:43:56,and said look like the penguin what's this gross black stuff coming out of his mouth we can't
00:43:56,00:44:01,promote any of this and after that there was this controversy about how they were too dark and too
00:44:01,00:44:07,depressing and burton was given the boot and then who was brought in to direct i think it was
00:44:07,00:44:11,joel schumacher joel schumacher who got a lot of stick basically had to make them more child
00:44:11,00:44:15,friendly not too friendly to include nipples that was the main talking point of the film
00:44:15,00:44:20,with joel schluny is that there are bat nipples on the front of his bat costume yes but the reason
00:44:20,00:44:26,for that is that i read about this because i haven't watched any of these movies despite them all being
00:44:27,00:44:34,good now i know they're good i might watch them but in the original batmans the suits were made
00:44:34,00:44:40,by a guy called bob ringwood but when they made the new suits the techniques of being able to mold
00:44:40,00:44:45,rubber were way way more advanced and so they wanted to show off how advanced they were
00:44:45,00:44:49,so they decided the way they were going to do that was to make them more anatomical
00:44:49,00:44:55,and so how do you make a chest more anatomical apart from putting nipples on it on the nibs
00:44:55,00:44:59,and that was they were made by um joe zay finandez or jose finandez i can't remember how to say his
00:44:59,00:45:06,first name but um he is the guy also who did the helmets for that punk that punk yeah he does those
00:45:06,00:45:12,helmets he's done loads of like stuff for hollywood over the years and he also designed the spacesuits
00:45:12,00:45:20,for space x yeah do you remember ilan musk wanted some sexy spacesuits and they were invented by
00:45:20,00:45:24,joe zay finandez i'm not sure if they have nipples on them or not because i haven't seen them but i
00:45:24,00:45:29,think it's really unfair to slam the bat nipples because bats are mammals yeah point is that they
00:45:29,00:45:36,have nipples yeah and so batman accurately he'd have loads of nipples yes are they angry there's
00:45:36,00:45:40,not enough nipples he should have them in his crotch like where don't bats have them in their
00:45:40,00:45:44,their armpits yeah crotch is an armpits are two very different things they're landing i don't know
00:45:46,00:45:50,i must see my taylor i always wonder why you wore your trousers like that
00:45:50,00:46:00,so batman first appeared in 1939 march 30th and as you were saying andy very close to the birth of
00:46:00,00:46:08,patrick lehi who was born a year and a day later and it was created by bob cain and bill finger um
00:46:08,00:46:13,bob cain being the person who's taken all the credit for it bill finger sort of in the background
00:46:13,00:46:18,no one really knows much about him but he lost all the credit but they um they both went to the same
00:46:18,00:46:22,high school in the bronx in new york which was called de wid clinton high school and another
00:46:22,00:46:29,student who went to that school was stan lee the creator of spider man and so around the same time
00:46:29,00:46:33,was it or it was about a six year difference so they might have been there at the same time yeah
00:46:33,00:46:38,it's quite possible wow that's amazing bill finger create batman as you say and he was completely
00:46:38,00:46:44,uncredited until after he died when uh he was almost reluctantly put in some of the memoirs
00:46:44,00:46:50,but he came up with the name bruce wane i think apparently it was him who decided to do that
00:46:50,00:46:54,and bruce based on robert bruce or robert the bruce as you may incorrectly know him
00:46:54,00:46:59,as in scottish patrick king warrior and that was because they thought he should have noble blood
00:46:59,00:47:06,and he his ashes were scattered in the shape of a bat wow they could have done it in the shape
00:47:06,00:47:14,of a finger as well couldn't they if they wanted much easier um so yeah no one knew when he was alive
00:47:14,00:47:20,so that was kind of his secret identity you could say you could say the real batman
00:47:20,00:47:27,um guys do you know how many batmans batman ways uh what i'd say one and i don't understand the
00:47:27,00:47:37,question i i i do i'm trying to work it out um i'm gonna say 16 it's 29 and what are you talking
00:47:37,00:47:43,about sorry so batman is a unit of measurement and it was an old ottoman unit of weight in
00:47:43,00:47:49,ottoman and kind of the steps area you still get the batman region in turkey as the batman river
00:47:49,00:47:53,and yeah it's actually been in fact dan might have been working it out based on one of the
00:47:53,00:47:59,different weights it had because throughout time it's been cited as being you know various
00:47:59,00:48:05,different weights but in 1599 in english it was seven pounds and five ounces and the comic books say
00:48:05,00:48:11,that batman weighs 210 pounds so i believe he weighs a prox 29 batmans in case you're wondering
00:48:11,00:48:17,okay in batman weight terms would you be able to rescue him from the top of a telegraph pole
00:48:17,00:48:22,if you were a trained open reach engineer he must be heavier than 12 stone is what anna was saying
00:48:22,00:48:28,yeah you definitely have to get him naked i mean if batman can't get down from a telegraph pole
00:48:28,00:48:34,something's gone really wrong oh just speaking of other uses of what batman could mean so in the
00:48:34,00:48:39,batman movies and in the whole series generally batman obviously has his trusty butler alfred
00:48:39,00:48:45,with him who's a key part of every single movie and comic and so on but interestingly during wars
00:48:45,00:48:50,they're like world war one for example you used to have a batman by your side who was your butler
00:48:50,00:48:57,the batman in war was the alfred of the lieutenants of war and the idea was yeah you
00:48:57,00:49:04,would be assigned a batman who would go and they would make sure that you had your personal equipment
00:49:04,00:49:09,they worked as a valet if you had to go into combat they acted as a bodyguard so i think they
00:49:09,00:49:15,would sort of stand in front of him there's no way in a war that is a waste of mud power if every
00:49:15,00:49:21,soldier has to have a bodyguard well what it said is acting as the officer's bodyguard in combat
00:49:21,00:49:25,so i assume that's what it is that you sort of yeah they would dig they would dig the officer's
00:49:25,00:49:30,foxholes and sometimes and this was particularly for the british once the war was over if you had a
00:49:30,00:49:36,batman during war they would continue on as your butler in real life they would they would be hired
00:49:36,00:49:41,by you and go on that is so insane i try to find some notable batmans um peter eustonov was a batman
00:49:42,00:49:46,the famous actor peter eustonov and he was a batman to david niven during the war
00:49:46,00:49:52,so the word bat means it's like a bag that a horse carries uh that's why your batman would be the
00:49:52,00:49:57,person who put all the stuff like kept all your stuff together and so you would have a batman
00:49:57,00:50:03,and he would also have a bat horse and the bat horse would be the thing that carried the bags on
00:50:03,00:50:08,it and the bat horse might carry the guy's bat money which is what you would pay a batman so
00:50:08,00:50:14,in war you might have a batman with a bat horse containing his bat money that's so cool
00:50:14,00:50:21,there was bat woman of course or there is bat woman uh bat woman first appeared in the dc comics
00:50:21,00:50:28,as a love interest for batman to dispel suggestions that he was homosexual um because he kept kind of
00:50:28,00:50:33,i think this is a meme in batman that he keeps almost getting married and then never quite gets
00:50:33,00:50:39,married uh and anyway there was a lot of um kind of suggestions that he was homosexual and in the
00:50:39,00:50:44,senate at the time this was in the 50s there was lots of worries that comic books were causing
00:50:44,00:50:49,problems with children causing juvenile delinquency and various things like that and so they brought
00:50:49,00:50:55,bat woman in as kind of a way to show that batman was not gay but then bat woman has since openly
00:50:55,00:51:02,come out she is now gay since 2006 she was introduced as a lesbian of jewish descent uh
00:51:02,00:51:09,who found love interest in former goffin police detective renae montaya in your face the 1950s
00:51:09,00:51:14,yes it's quite funny saying well oh we're terribly worried batman might be gay so let's give him a
00:51:14,00:51:18,normal relationship with a woman who is also obsessed with dressing up as a bat like that
00:51:18,00:51:26,is that family values uh just quickly i was watching a youtube clip of from a dc official
00:51:26,00:51:30,site and on it they say this thing which i find hilarious because they haven't put this in the
00:51:30,00:51:36,movies but batman is always signaled to by commissioner gordon by the bat signal the
00:51:36,00:51:42,famous bat signal goes into the sky now apparently according to dc the reality behind it is is that
00:51:42,00:51:47,commissioner gordon or any police officer is not allowed to turn that on because by doing that that
00:51:47,00:51:52,would be qualifying an official endorsement of the city's government for this vigilante that was
00:51:52,00:51:58,going around he's not allowed to do it so apparently the police office has a civilian on site at all
00:51:58,00:52:03,times so that as soon as gordon needs to switch it on he goes you get up here and they have to go
00:52:03,00:52:08,up and switch it on on his behalf so that he's had no hand he's still giving an instruction yeah
00:52:08,00:52:13,exactly that is not even a loophole yeah what you need is someone to to be in the office and
00:52:13,00:52:18,you say gosh i wish someone would call batman but really subtle so it's deniable yeah yeah
00:52:18,00:52:22,and then you go out for see you like i'm going out for lunch i'll be back in exactly five minutes
00:52:22,00:52:29,i'm gonna have my lunch on the roof just one more thing that was sent into the podcast email
00:52:29,00:52:35,actually about a year ago a couple of years ago fan called daniel braga who i believe is brazilian
00:52:35,00:52:43,and he informed me that in 2019 police arrested in one go batman spider man and green lantern
00:52:43,00:52:48,so was it like people on a stag do who were all dressed like this or was it i don't know
00:52:48,00:52:52,it actually wasn't it's this really interesting thing i didn't know they had which is in brazilian
00:52:52,00:52:58,towns they have fun trains which is people are paid to dress up on these fun trains that's any
