 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,120
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Shepfield!

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anish Zinsky, Andrew Huntson Murray,

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,680
 and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,240
 from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,000
 My fact is, as a child, the naturalist Frank Buckland learned to differentiate different kinds

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,880
 of animal urine by taste alone. [laughter]

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,400
 What a guy! How did this happen? Well, so he was the son of another naturalist,

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,000
 a guy called William Buckland, this is with Victorian, we're talking here, 19th century,

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,200
 and William Buckland was an amazing guy, and he, you know, taught his children lots,

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
 and they grew up surrounded by animals, so instead of having a hobby horse to ride on,

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,440
 they had a dead crocodile. And as part of his education, he learned about different kinds of

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,280
 animal urine. And is that so you know which pet to tell off when someone we's on the floor?

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,280
 Oh, yeah. Who did that? I'm just going to check.

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,840
 Freddie? That's a very good idea, yeah, because they had loads of animals around the house.

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,400
 So like, for instance, William Buckland, he wasn't naturalist like you say, he liked experiments,

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,040
 he likes to do that kind of thing, so there was one time he was in bed, and he was thinking about

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
 fossil footprints, because they just found all these new footprints, and he came up with an idea

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,880
 of how they might be formed, so he woke up his sleeping wife, and asked her to prepare a slab of dough

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,920
 in the kitchen, so he could get his pet tortoise to walk across it, so he could have a look at the

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,000
 footprints that it made. That's so cool. And so Frank's house, William's son, Frank's house,

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,120
 seems like it was riddled with animals, there was an account from 1877 of a journalist who went to

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,280
 physics, he was quite famous, and he said they open the door, and they immediately retreated because

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,360
 there was a jaguar in the doorway with monkeys seizing its tail and denuding it of fur, and

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,680
 the buckles were like, don't worry, he won't hurt you, it'll be fine. There was a jackass, laughing jack

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,760
 ass, which I think is a cookaburra, their word for a cookaburra, chasing live mice up and down a

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,720
 glass jar with a battalion of cats waiting underneath, and there was a battalion, and there was a parrot

34
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,040
 that kept on calling cabs from the front window as soon as they arrived, but apparently was equally

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,040
 ready to hail an omnibus if they so desired. Yeah, I read a story of a guest, I believe it was with

36
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,520
 Frank, might have been with William, but they tripped over in the night down the staircase over

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,640
 a hippopotamus, they weren't expecting, yeah. What? Yeah, I'm not, was it alive or dead, the hippo?

38
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,360
 It was a dead baby hippopotamus, and it was a small child, and she fell all the way down the stairs,

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,360
 and he was like, be careful, you could have damaged that. It sounds like the whole life was just

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,920
 incredible adventures with animals, because Buckland, both Buckland's really were popularizers

41
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,280
 of science, as well as actual researchers and scientists, but he wrote lots of memoirs and lots

42
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,280
 of exciting books, which sold hundreds of thousands of copies. So for example, one account he gave,

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,880
 he was trying to make a cast of a three-meter sturgeon, but he could only borrow it for one night,

44
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:46,320
 so he had to do it really fast, and he had to get, he woke his wife up. He had to get it downstairs

45
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,480
 and into the kitchen, so what he did was he tied a rope around its tail, because it was really heavy,

46
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,680
 it was three meters long, he'd let it slide downstairs in front of him and sort of pulled the rope

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,480
 tall, and unfortunately, obviously, sturgeons are very, very slippery, and it got away from him,

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,440
 and it crashed down the stairs, and it smashed into the kitchen, and these are his words. He said,

49
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,160
 "This sudden and unexpected appearance of the armour-clad sea monster bursting open the door,

50
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,400
 instantly created a sensation." The cook screamed, the house made fainted, the cat jumped on the

51
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,880
 dresser, the dog retreated behind the copper and barked, the monkeys went mad with fright,

52
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,320
 and the sedate parrot has never spoken a word since.

53
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:33,280
 I will just couldn't get a taxi from that on. He used to chase the cook around the house with a

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,680
 dead goose squeezing its voice box to make it squawker her. Was this in childhood? No, no, as a grown-up.

55
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,000
 Oh, what's a grown-up? Yeah, as an adult, yeah. We should say that you've already mentioned that

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,360
 these guys were scientists, but these were like proper scientists. These two guys really were,

57
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,680
 they were sharing notes with Darwin about ideas, they were properly famous in their time.

58
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,000
 Although Frank didn't believe in evolution, actually neither of them did, but Frank especially

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,400
 didn't believe in evolution, and to prove it, he did a lot of interviews with Pongo, the guerrilla,

60
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,680
 after which he deduced that the creator had drawn a fast line between human and monkey,

61
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,280
 so he wasn't getting much out of the interview, I don't think.

62
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,800
 I reckon Pongo went away and thought the same thing. But he did like to eat animals as well,

63
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,000
 didn't he, Frank? So he deliberately moved closer to London zoos so that he could eat them as

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,960
 soon as they died in the zoo because he liked to eat animals that were all different animals,

65
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,840
 not just like, you know, meat that we might do so. Frank unvolume, didn't they? Oh, yes, they did, yeah.

66
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,560
 When he was living near the zoo, they, a panther, had died, and so that for him was like,

67
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,720
 I've never had panther, I really want to try that. So he wrote this is from his writings.

68
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,440
 He said, I wrote at once to tell his friend who worked at the zoo, to tell him to send me down

69
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,720
 some chops. It had, however, been buried a couple of days, but I got them to dig it up.

70
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,360
 It was not very good. Culinary advice, no one needed.

71
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,520
 But he kind of had also, he was obviously doing this before lots of animals became endangered,

72
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,400
 so slightly different times. It's still gross. It's still gross. I'm not saying it's not gross,

73
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,960
 I'm just, but he, but he, there was a purpose behind all this mad eating that he was doing,

74
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,080
 because he helped to found this thing called the acclimatisation society, and they said, well,

75
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,920
 people need food to eat, they need protein, turkeys and fessons are not native to Britain,

76
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,920
 they were introduced, and they've been a brilliant success. What else can we introduce that will be tasty?

77
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,880
 Because they were worried that the population was going up and we won't be able to feed ourselves.

78
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,480
 Exactly. So they just had banquets every year when they tried all sorts of stuff and said,

79
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,320
 what can we introduce? Because after Brexit, we'll all be digging up the panthers, won't we?

80
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,640
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinsky.

81
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,720
 My fact this week is that in the 1980s, Romania lifted up and relocated dozens of buildings,

82
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,480
 often with their residents still inside them. So why did they do that?

83
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,160
 Well, so this was in the 1980s in Romania and many in Bucharestka. It was under child Chescu,

84
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,520
 who wanted, as a plastic dictator, fashion to create this enormous palace for the people,

85
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,320
 which involved bulldozing basically the entire city, and he destroyed hundreds of buildings.

86
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,680
 It was very devastating, because it was a really picturesque town, which was sort of flattened,

87
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,280
 but there were a few heroes who thought, okay, rather than let him destroy these buildings,

88
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,640
 let's quickly move them. And so they got to work, and they moved, almost a dozen churches,

89
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,320
 and they moved lots of other buildings, including a hospital, a bank, and sometimes whole apartment buildings,

90
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:42,320
 which they just move like pick up and shift a few hundred yards with the people still inside them.

91
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
 They must have told the people inside, mustn't they?

92
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,040
 They did. Although there was one occasion where people have been told that they were going to be

93
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,360
 moving their buildings at 9 a.m., and so most of the residents thought, I'll just pack my suitcases

94
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,680
 and get out for that little period. And it turned out it was 6 a.m., so they all got up at 9,

95
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,040
 looked out their windows and was like, oh my god.

96
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,520
 This was mainly one guy, it wasn't it, who came up with the idea, who passed away just this year.

97
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,120
 I'll attempt to say his name, and then Anna can say it correctly after me.

98
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,320
 Eugenio Lodal Shokku.

99
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,040
 Wow, wow. I mean, he got the first letter of his name completely wrong.

100
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,480
 It's an I, not an L.

101
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,160
 Oh, that's an I.

102
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,800
 Okay, you ordered Chesku?

103
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,560
 Yeah, you ordered Chesku. Eugenio, you ordered Chesku.

104
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,280
 That's who I said, and so he died this year very sadly, and he got the idea for it,

105
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,600
 because he hated the idea that this was a rescue mission, these were meant to be demolished,

106
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 and he thought that's unacceptable. A lot of these were very beautiful churches that he wanted

107
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,960
 to survive. And so he was sitting in a restaurant one day, and he saw a waiter passing by,

108
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,680
 carrying on a tray, the drinks that he was bringing to a table, and he looked at that tray system,

109
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,560
 and he thought, that's how we could be doing this.

110
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,160
 And then he started a search for the largest waiter in the world.

111
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,520
 Yeah. He sounded so much like Jeremy Clarkson.

112
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,520
 He didn't do that. He built some rail tracks.

113
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,840
 He basically built one mini railways, didn't he, so he could sort of roll them along into their new

114
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,160
 areas. So if you go to Bucharest now, then you can see these old buildings sort of hiding

115
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,080
 behind the huge ugly new Soviet ones. They'll be a lovely little church, suddenly.

116
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,120
 So actually, that parliament that was built, you know, that everything else was being

117
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,360
 demolished and moved to Maywayful. It wiped out one-fifth of the historic centre of the entire city.

118
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,080
 That's how big it is. And it took a third of the country's budget for several years,

119
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,040
 a third of the budget of the whole country. And it was so it was planned by Chachescu,

120
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:54,560
 but the chief architect, Anker Patrescu, was only 28, and the BBC described her as arguably the world's

121
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,840
 worst architect. Oh, I've seen that. It's not like that. I think it looks quite nice, actually.

122
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:06,400
 One of the buildings that they did destroy and didn't move was Brent Covinesk Hospital.

123
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,280
 And the reason they did that is quite long-winded. So basically, David Steele, who is the leader of

124
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:18,560
 the Liberal Party in England, gave Chachescu a pet dog, who Chachescu absolutely loved, okay.

125
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:26,160
 So he made the dog a corporal in the army. I mean, he was a dictator. He did crazy shit like that.

126
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,240
 And then they went to this hospital and the hospital had problems with rats. And so they got cats

127
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,600
 in the hospital to chase after the rats. And then the dog came in and got in a big fight with one

128
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,280
 of the cats. And then because he'd been injured by a cat, Chachescu went, I'm afraid this hospital

129
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,960
 has to go. And the very next day, the order came in for the hospital to be demolished,

130
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,720
 all because this corporal dog had been beaten up by a cat.

131
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,800
 At what point do you realise you are the bad guy when you're... Wow.

132
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,200
 I mean, this dog was called Corbu. He was really loved by Chachescu. So much so that the

133
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,280
 Romanian ambassador in London used to go to Sainsbury's every week to buy winelot prime to send

134
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:18,960
 back to Bucharest in a diplomatic bag. Wow. Yeah, he was crazy. He used, and in fact, the guy

135
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,520
 Yoruchescu got permission to move all of these buildings. But Chachescu was so impatient to knock them

136
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,720
 down that he knocked a lot of them down even though they were supposed to be moved. And there was one

137
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,880
 that he wanted to knock down, but all the workers refused to do it. It was this beautiful old church.

138
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,520
 I think it was medieval. And so he had to release people from prison to employ them to knock down

139
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,360
 this building. But his palace was incredible. So his palace, which he called the People's Palace,

140
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,240
 I think, or Palace of the People, which is one of those ironic titles, it's Union Hall

141
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,680
 featured two huge spiral staircases. And that was so that he and his wife Elena could descend

142
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,040
 simultaneously from different sides of it. And also he made them rebuild the staircase twice

143
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,440
 that he was supposed to walk down, because he was really short and very paranoid about his height.

144
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,840
 So as soon as they made the steps a bit too hard for him to stretch down, he was like, no, get rid of it.

145
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,560
 It makes me feel small. Wait, how short was he? Wasn't a borrower.

146
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,440
 There were a thousand steps to descend one meter. I mean, that's still there as well, isn't it?

147
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,840
 Yeah, God, yeah. I've got one more factor actually about Chachesky. So, as we've said, not a nice guy

148
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,520
 had 20,000 political prisoners. Really, just such a bad guy. He ruled that you had to have at least

149
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:40,160
 five children or face a fine. Wow, I know five. Five, that's a lot. But so he has had a state visit to

150
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:47,200
 Britain. He had a state visit to Britain in 1978. And it was a big political thing because, you know,

151
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,440
 we were trying to pry, pry Romania away from Soviet Union. And they were kind of semi-independent of that.

152
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,400
 But anyway, it was very embarrassing. And it was, you know, he was the most embarrassing state visit

153
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:04,640
 until last year. Anyway, so that, you know, it was awful. But during that visit is one of my favorite

154
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,480
 and ever anecdotes happened, which is that Queen Elizabeth hid in a bush with her dogs to avoid him.

155
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,480
 She really didn't want to have him. She'd be having a terrible time. And then she was walking her dogs

156
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,200
 in Buckingham Palace Gardens. And she saw him coming the other way and she jumped into a bush. Amazing.

157
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,600
 He was really paranoid that people would poison his clothes. So he only wore clothes that had been

158
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,840
 under constant surveillance. He also, when he met Queen Elizabeth, he washed his hands with alcohol

159
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,560
 immediately after shaking her hands because he was worried that he'd been poisoned. Wow.

160
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,960
 What? You'd have to be pretty top level to recruit the Queen to be an assassin.

161
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:52,640
 It's always a person you least expect. Wow. Just on buildings in Romania. Yeah.

162
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,280
 The word thing about this is, this wasn't the only instance in which people in Romania were in

163
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,640
 buildings that were suddenly moved. So there was also a separate project in Albert Yudia, which is

164
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,760
 another city in Romania, where there was this big Soviet, actually, apartment block. And

165
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,080
 he, Charles Skiu, then wanted to build this huge boulevard. And he happened to want to build it

166
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,400
 right through the middle of this Soviet apartment block. So the only thing to do was cut it in half

167
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,360
 and shift one half to one side of the road and one half to the other. But apparently it was very

168
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,480
 smooth. It took 5,040 minutes and one woman put a glass of water on her balcony throughout the whole

169
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,400
 thing and none of it spilled. Wow. So impressive. But sometimes because they move buildings on rollers

170
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,760
 in other countries too, sometimes it's really, yeah, as rabbit it happened. So in Boston in 1869,

171
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,720
 that long ago they had to widen the street. So they had to say to the hotel on the street,

172
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,960
 can you just move back a bit? And it took three months because obviously it was a 19th century.

173
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:57,120
 And but over that time, the first floor businesses and all lots of residents stayed in place during

174
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,520
 those three months. And the amazing thing was that plumbing and gas services stayed on

175
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:08,480
 because they had flexible tubes. So cool. That's so cool. But it's so confusing if you're going

176
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,320
 to visit your friend who you haven't seen for a couple of months and you find yourself knocking

177
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,640
 on an empty space where the door used to be. Well, that actually happened. There's a place

178
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,440
 called Hibbing in America where they had to move because there was a mine underneath the town. And there

179
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,400
 was a few things that happened. So there was a woman who went into labor in one town and then gave

180
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,120
 birth in the other town because they moved the whole town a little bit. And because they moved the

181
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,200
 entire town house by house to this new place, they put it back not exactly in the same way as they

182
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,720
 left it. And so people who had like grown up there came back 30 years later and they're like,

183
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,960
 I'm sure there used to be a co-op there. That's so good. That's amazing. There was in America in 2016.

184
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:55,280
 They wanted to knock down Rosa Parks House. They wanted to demolish it and no one was really

185
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,960
 sticking up for it. And there was one artist who said, we can't let this happen. So he bought it

186
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:07,200
 for $500 American. And this is in Detroit. And he said, we have to keep this house. So he looked

187
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:13,280
 to people to sell it to to say, can you can you now take on the costs and maybe we can relocate it.

188
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:19,600
 But no one took it. So he had to bring it home with him to Berlin. And Rosa Parks's Detroit House

189
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,640
 was dismantled and rebuilt in Berlin and was sitting there for about two years. And it went back

190
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,040
 to America. And then I think it might have to move back to Berlin because they don't want it again.

191
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,640
 This is absolutely true. So the house was completely dismantled, shipped to Berlin and sat in the

192
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,280
 backyard of this artist's house. Wait, why is it now having to go back there? Surely if they don't

193
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,200
 want it a second time, you just got a chuck at it. She won't mind. He wanted to get it back there.

194
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,880
 So he kept saying, let's get it back there. So a night for a woman who's kind of main claim to

195
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:59,520
 fame and publicity into her big moment was not moving from a spot. I want to witch it.

196
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:07,440
 What is the back of the boss out of Berlin and America? We're going to have to move on very shortly

197
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:13,040
 to our next phase. I just got one little thing. So I was trying to find out what the biggest thing you

198
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:22,720
 can move a thing on is. So do you mean the thing on which the thing is? The lower thing. The thing

199
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,000
 supporting the bigger thing. These are all great Google search terms. So it's just a cool thing.

200
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,880
 So NASA, they have to move sometimes a launch tower. And I didn't know the launch towers ever move,

201
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,200
 but sometimes they have to drag them around. And they've got a thing which is called a crawler,

202
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,760
 a crawler transporter. And it's massive. Okay, so you have to have a degree in engineering just to

203
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:50,400
 drive it. There are only four qualified drivers on the planet. There are really two of these things

204
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,440
 in the whole world. And you only drive it for 35 minutes, even if you are one of the drivers,

205
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,840
 and then you have to swap with someone else, because it's just so mentally exhausted. Driving

206
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,720
 a NASA launch tower, which weighs 5 million kilos, so it's big. One gallon of petrol gets you

207
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,560
 about 15 yards. Is it like a maximum speed limit of like one mile an hour or something? Yeah,

208
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:18,480
 if that is really slow. So there are just petrol stations that she just back to back all the way.

209
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,760
 I can't silly pull it in and out and out and out. And as you just one super quick building removal,

210
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,560
 in 1903 there was a mansion called the Captain Samuel Brown Mansion in Pennsylvania. And it had

211
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,720
 to be demolished because they were building a railway. And a descendant of the original owner said,

212
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,840
 "Would you mind rather than demolishing it, just moving it 160 feet up that massive cliff next to it?"

213
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,960
 That would be really nice. And so they, for some reason, the authorities agreed to this. And so

214
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,440
 160 feet is quite a lot, almost sheer cliff. So they had to excavate the entire cliff and they

215
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,800
 put these giant shelves in it. So they put four enormous shelves and then they lifted it up on

216
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:05,120
 winches, one shelf at a time that were powered by horses. They needed 20,000 beams to do it. So

217
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,480
 pulled it up onto one shelf, plopped it down, horses had a rest, pulled it up onto the next one.

218
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,840
 And it eventually cost more than the original house it cost to build. And then extremely soon

219
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:27,600
 afterwards it was completely destroyed in a fire. Okay, it is time for fact number three. And that is

220
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:34,640
 my fact. My fact this week is when at home Freddie Mercury slept in a queen-size bed.

221
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:44,400
 So nice to know that. This was Freddie Mercury's final home that he lived in. It was in London. He

222
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,360
 bought it from a big banking family called The Horror Family. So he referred to it as The Horror House.

223
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,360
 And his partner, Jim Hutton, who was with him for about the last seven years of his life.

224
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,760
 And he gives a fantastic description in this book he wrote memoir about his time with Freddie

225
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,040
 called Mercury in me, in which he describes the top floor of Freddie's London house, which was

226
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,080
 three rooms that were, the walls were smashed down and made into one big room. There was a big dome

227
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:16,880
 and he said in the corner was Freddie's queen-size bed. And yeah. And do we know if it was deliberately

228
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,480
 chosen for the wordplay? No, it probably wasn't. It's just a nice little detail that is

229
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,120
 get it over as he's describing the room. Yeah, yeah, nice. I have read that book as well. Oh, I got it

230
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:34,480
 on Kindle and then I just searched through it for references to beds. So you read it, yeah, yeah.

231
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,600
 The only other reference I could find to how he liked to sleep was that when they went to Japan,

232
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,840
 he embraced the way of life of the Japanese and liked to sleep on the floor. So he really liked

233
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,560
 sleeping on the floor. But he didn't really embrace it as far as learning the language because he only

234
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,240
 learned two words in Japanese, domo and mushy mushy, which he said at every opportunity.

235
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:01,120
 Freddie Mercury was a very interesting guy. I found that he once had a verbal spat. This is one of

236
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,000
 the famous stories about him. He once had a verbal spat with Sid Vicious from the Sex Pistols and he

237
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,040
 managed to infuriate Sid Vicious by deliberately misnaming him Simon Ferocious.

238
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:19,440
 Did he have four extra teeth? He did, yes. Did he had four extra teeth behind his first teeth?

239
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,480
 Really? Is that what he had such protruding first teeth? Front teeth? Yes, it is. Does he used to be

240
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,960
 called Bucky Balsara? That was his nickname at school because Buktoothed and he was born

241
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,040
 Farok Balsara. He was born in Zanzibar and his parents were originally Indian, weren't they?

242
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:41,280
 And so, yeah, Farok Balsara, Bucky Balsara. Yeah, he never got rid of them because the worry was,

243
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,040
 it would affect his vocal cords. He had such a fantastic range. So his problem in life was,

244
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,360
 do I go for vanity or do I go for what I love music and he went for music? So Queen of

245
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,720
 Very Famous for having big, extravagant parties. And there are lots of lurid stories about, you know,

246
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,600
 dwarves with cocaine on their heads and all this stuff. But Roger Taylor, the drummer, said another

247
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,320
 thing they had at their parties. I can't believe this. They had basically a specific party consultant.

248
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,160
 He said, "We had a man whose job was to find unusual people. And in America, he hired a guy whose

249
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,720
 thing was to lie on the ground, covered in these great big, cold meat collations that Americans love.

250
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,120
 He would be completely covered by meat and then he would shift and make the meats move.

251
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:28,640
 The idea was to freak people out. I can imagine that freaking girl. I had a load of Greg sausage rolls

252
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,280
 on a table and suddenly one of them wiggled around. Wow, they're just draped in salami.

253
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,680
 There's been a line on the ground covering me and this huge part of meat would start sort of

254
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:45,920
 writhing around. I think that's a great party tray. But surely people can tell if I went to get

255
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,760
 meat of something, I think I could tell if I was getting it off a plate or a person.

256
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,760
 Or was it so many of us were so covered in meat. So covered. He was completely covered in meat.

257
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,160
 I can't say that was his thing. How did he breathe? Did he have like a straw coming out through the

258
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,960
 meat? He must have done right. I imagine you would have to have a straw. Always look out for the

259
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,520
 straw. If you see a big pile of meat. Or he could have had a scuba gear on. But with a fault.

260
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,960
 Yeah, with a full time. But then you need even more meat to cover the oxygen tank

261
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:22,720
 and the flippers of course. I would, you'd roll up bits of salami and then breathe through them.

262
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,600
 So do you know that Bohemian Rhapsody, the movie, that's now one of all these Oscars?

263
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
 What do you want to stop talking about meat man?

264
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:40,960
 The single greatest party man. What was I thinking? Sorry, thanks.

265
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,600
 There was apparently there was also a woman who offered for $100,000 to decapitate herself

266
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,480
 with a chainsaw. What? I don't, I'm not sure they had that at the party. I don't think so.

267
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,480
 That's quite a low price for doing that. It's kind of a relatively low price, isn't it?

268
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,240
 Was she going to spend it on? There is some blue tack.

269
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:11,360
 Sorry, sorry, Daniel. Sorry if I could just mention a fact.

270
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,120
 So Bohemian Rhapsody, we, Rami Malik, was the actor playing Freddie Mercury but it was

271
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,040
 originally when it's been in production for many, many years in pre-production rather. And

272
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,280
 Sasha Baron Cohen, Ali G, was meant to play Freddie Mercury and he got fired because he wanted it

273
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,240
 to be the more the meat man party kind of stuff going on and the decapitation and they said no,

274
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,320
 we need to do it differently. But he said this interesting thing which was, he was talking to one

275
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,520
 of the members of the band, didn't name who. But he said the person, the band member said, you know,

276
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,520
 this is such a great movie because it's got such an amazing thing that happens in the middle.

277
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,160
 And Sasha said, well, what happens in the middle of the movie? And he said, well, you know,

278
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:58,080
 Freddie dies. And so Sasha went, but what happens in the second half of the movie then?

279
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,880
 Like, that's why people are there to see it. They're there to see Freddie. And they said, well, you know,

280
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,920
 they then see a band that goes from strength to strength. So the original idea was that we were

281
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:14,480
 going to watch how Queen sort of became who they really were, post-Freddie. And I'm not sure that,

282
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,680
 I mean, they've done some good things but the only real fun thing I could find musically from Brian

283
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,480
 May, who was the guitarist, was that in 2003, he set up a band with Brian Blessed.

284
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,440
 I mean, that's good. Here we go. Yeah. They were a part of an animal rights group to protect the

285
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:40,880
 Badger. Is it good? Yeah. So they were, they were, they were called Team Badger. And they released a

286
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:48,800
 song, which was called Save the Badger, Badger, Badger. And then they formed another band with David

287
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,080
 Attenborough and Slash, the guitarist from Guns and Roses. Oh my god. To create a super group,

288
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,840
 this is Brian May. And they were called The Artful Badger. And they released a song, dedicated to

289
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,280
 Badger, it's called Badger Swagger. I'm going to watch this film. I'm going to find it. We're in the

290
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,320
 second half, Freddie Murk, little vampire Freddie Murkery comes back, but he's got extra teeth. So he's

291
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:17,600
 more of a risk. But we should probably say, isn't Brian May's on topic, that he is a really cool guy

292
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,680
 in his own right. So he finished his thesis, his doctoral thesis. Maybe you guys know that he's a

293
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,520
 physicist. And he wanted to do physics. And then he got involved in this whole queen shenanigan.

294
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:34,320
 But he went back to doing his thesis. And in 2007, then he submitted it. It's a survey of radial

295
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,080
 velocities in the zodiacal dust cloud. And he submitted it 37 years after starting the research,

296
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,160
 which is actually one of the most thesis, because you have to catch up on the intervening 33 years of

297
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,640
 research, which have been quite a lot. But he was studying a super interesting thing. So zodiacal

298
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,520
 light is this, it's a misty cone of light that appears a few hours before sunrise in the east,

299
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,920
 or a few hours after sunset in the west. And it's what we call false dawn. So we've all kind of

300
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,920
 seen it. And you often think it's sort of a town on the horizon or something. It's actually the

301
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,880
 reflected sunlight, sort of shining of scattered bits of dust in the solar system. And they only

302
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,920
 worked out really what it was a few years ago. But yeah, that's what that's what his whole thesis is on.

303
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,200
 And he just did it. Very cool. I prefer his team Badger stuff.

304
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:29,440
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is James.

305
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,720
 Okay, my fact this week is that according to people who make their livings walking on fire and

306
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:45,760
 walking on broken glass, neither is as painful as walking on Lego. Amazing. This is true. So this

307
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,320
 was an article from the Smithsonian. They were talking to a guy called Scott Bell who is a former

308
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,600
 fire walking world record holder. And he now runs a company where they do walking on fire,

309
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,520
 walking on glass and walking on Lego. And he still does the glass and the fire, but he refuses

310
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,120
 to do the Lego stuff. And basically the reason is that walking on fire, as long as you do it quite

311
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,720
 quickly, is not that bad at all because the conductivity of the calls is not so great. The glass,

312
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,960
 if you walk in it, they really make it very, very small. And so when you step on it, it kind of moves

313
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,360
 around underneath your feet, but Lego do not move at all. And they're really hard and they're really

314
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,640
 pointy. And I don't need to tell you guys that it's fucking painful when you stand up. And so when

315
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,400
 you're walking across them, there's nowhere for them to go. They just stay there and they just dig

316
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,280
 into your feet and they're really, really painful. And so he refuses to do it. It's a really good

317
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,360
 article this Smithsonian because they talk about how much mass Lego can withstand before it crumbles

318
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,600
 or goes. And every single brick can withstand a mass of 400 kilos before it even starts moving.

319
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,760
 What it means is that you know that scene in Die Hard where Bruce Willis is crawling over broken

320
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,600
 glass. If he'd been crawling over Lego, that would have been a really exciting scene. Just the glass

321
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,760
 bit in that article, they got that confirmation that it hurt more to go on Lego from a cabaret performer

322
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:14,320
 called Bazoo the Clown spelled K-L-O-U-N. So this is a guy who juggles balls of barbed wire and he

323
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,400
 lets people staple dollar bills to his chest. He also walks on glass and he confirmed Lego is just

324
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,560
 way worse. Have you said, there is a thing called the Lego, well I think there are some crazy

325
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,160
 YouTube people who did a thing where they did a Lego treadmill challenge. So you're running on a

326
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,600
 treadmill, but people in front of the treadmill are pouring Lego from a bucket onto it and I just

327
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,920
 looks like the worst thing in the world. That's a really good prank to play with the gym, isn't it?

328
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:48,960
 So you can't, you can't walk on Lego but you can't swallow it, can't you? So swallowing,

329
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,040
 you're basically fine. That's why if I need to walk into a room where a child's been, I always walk in

330
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:04,800
 on my mouth. This is that they put holes in the legs of Lego, sorry they put holes in the head of

331
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,640
 Lego pieces so that if kids swallow them they can still breathe and in fact to really check this

332
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,280
 is okay. There were six scientists a short while ago in the UK and Australia who swallowed Lego

333
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,920
 pieces themselves to a lay parents fears that it would be a bad thing. So they all swallowed these

334
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,560
 heads and they said that they all had different techniques so you had to swallow the heads and then

335
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,080
 work out how long they took to come out the other end. I mean they didn't work it out, they just

336
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,360
 wasted for it to come out and that was the only time. Well no but the working out is comes from

337
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,760
 the search because we're searching for your own feces can be quite difficult and they said they

338
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,760
 all use different techniques so they use chopsticks or forks. Some of them squashed their poo into a

339
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,800
 ziplock bag so that they could find the Lego piece in it if it was there and it's... Sorry, does

340
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:00,880
 everyone else not put their poo in a ziplock bag? And they always hangs it on a tree as he walks around

341
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:10,800
 must be so confusing if you had corn for dinner the night before. They actually literally said this,

342
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,560
 they said they didn't eat corn because that would be too confusing because there's little yellow

343
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:21,520
 bits down, you're a born scientist. And anyway there were six scientists and for five of them the

344
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:31,360
 Lego head came out within three days. What happened to one of the six? Dead. Yeah but you've got

345
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:38,160
 five and six hours, no it just never came out but we think he didn't look in the bag properly.

346
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,720
 He didn't look in the bag properly but they all survived the experience. Because you won't just be

347
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,640
 picking for the rest of your life. I wonder if it's still in there. The face would gradually get

348
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,080
 sadder and sadder as it stayed in you. Everything is not awesome.

349
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:07,920
 There is one awesome Lego thing. There is a crab who lives in a shell made of Lego

350
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,840
 is the only one known to science. But how did he get the, he won't have built in himself.

351
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:20,480
 He lives at Lego land. So he's called Harry the crab and he's a hermit crab and they

352
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:27,440
 are the ones who move into empty seashells. So the staff there they made him a shell out of Lego

353
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,920
 and they gave him the choice of lots of shells and the Lego one and he chose the Lego one.

354
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,600
 There are videos of him online just scuttling around with his Lego house.

355
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,240
 It's so sweet. If you work at Lego land you're known as a model citizen.

356
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,240
 Nice. So they call themselves? That's great.

357
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,640
 It's good, doesn't it? What if you employ a criminal?

358
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:54,560
 You still call him that? I didn't know where the name Lego actually came from, like the origin of it.

359
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:00,240
 So it means play well in Danish which I think we maybe have mentioned before. But I didn't know that

360
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,080
 it was the result of a competition in 1934 by Ollie Kurt Christianson who's the person who

361
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,080
 basically invented Lego and he came up with a competition to name the new company that he was

362
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,040
 setting up the toy company and he opened it up to lots of friends and family and people in his

363
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,000
 business and employees and he offered up a bottle of his own homemade wine as a prize.

364
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,160
 At the end of it the winning entry was the name Lego and it was his own entry.

365
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,320
 Cheers.

366
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,480
 A weird echo in my head of you saying he offered a bottle of his own urine.

367
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,800
 I think because we've been talking about Frank Buckland and about…

368
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,960
 Did I say his own urine?

369
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,200
 No, you said his own homemade wine. No, but homemade wine is another way of putting it, isn't it?

370
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:57,040
 Very true. This is just I found this quite fascinating because I don't understand maths,

371
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,280
 but if you have, you know what a qualifier.

372
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,440
 How are your Royal Institution Christmas Lecture Series coming on?

373
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:15,120
 So if you have a piece of Lego that has eight studs in it and then you had six of those,

374
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:21,360
 the combination of connecting those six different pieces to an eight studded Lego brick

375
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:27,520
 is over 915 million possibilities of how you can make those combinations.

376
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,760
 Yeah, all the Lego in the world could build you ten towers to the moon if you want to go with

377
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,000
 nine friends that you don't need a tower to reach to get to the moon.

378
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,400
 Hang on, each of you climbing up one piece of Lego.

379
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,560
 One Lego tower.

380
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,960
 Sorry, one Lego tower, but it's one piece wide.

381
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,080
 I believe so, yes.

382
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,520
 I'm not doing that.

383
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,040
 I don't think the integrity would hold.

384
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,600
 I would rather have one tower, ten pieces wide.

385
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,560
 Yeah, and then just have people follow you behind you.

386
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,440
 That makes a lot.

387
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,320
 I'm going to redo my architectural plans for this.

388
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,000
 You do not understand maths.

389
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,280
 So they did a study quite recently, another one where they put a bucket of old Lego bricks

390
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,400
 inside a washing machine and just let it run.

391
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,880
 They let it run for 70 minutes of 40 degrees Celsius and they then took it out to see what had happened.

392
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,640
 And they found that some of the bricks had just automatically stuck together.

393
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,120
 Cool.

394
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,160
 This is really cool, right?

395
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,680
 So they found that quite a lot of two bricks have stuck together,

396
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,440
 but then there were some as many as six or eight of them had stuck together.

397
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,720
 And what people who did this study have said, now it's a bit of a stretch,

398
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,680
 but they said that it was a bit like the primordial soup that happened at the start of life.

399
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,960
 Whoa!

400
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,040
 And the building blocks of life are like the building blocks of Lego

401
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,880
 and maybe all of the RNA and DNA and proteins all came together in the same way as Lego.

402
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,840
 It is bullshit, isn't it?

403
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,360
 Oh, wow.

404
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,640
 In a way, we are all washing machine Legos.

405
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,600
 Yes.

406
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,360
 Imagine if you put a bunch of Lego in the washing machine,

407
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,080
 opened it up an hour later and there was a massive pirate ship or something.

408
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,640
 If you did it enough times, that must happen. That's the new infinite monkeys and infinite

409
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,920
 typewriter in the mess.

410
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,920
 Infinite washing machines with infinite amounts of Lego inside will eventually form a pirate ship.

411
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,200
 We're going to have to wrap up this thing.

412
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,280
 I've just got one more fact about training on things you don't want to tread on.

413
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,840
 Okay, yes, it's a fact from the news this week.

414
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,080
 And weirdly, it involves it block bags.

415
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,920
 So in Cheshire, this week, resident in Middlewich, he was really annoyed about the amount of

416
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,600
 dog poo around and he's 47. He walks his dog and he decided there was too much dog poo about.

417
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,400
 So he said, "I'm going to turn it into a competition."

418
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,920
 And he told the local newspaper, "I had a spare £20 note that I did not need."

419
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,120
 So I put it in a ziplock bag and hit it under some dog poo and then notified his local

420
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,680
 neighbours and community. Oh my god.

421
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,720
 He said, "I posted it on Facebook and a lot of people got back to me."

422
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,360
 The woman who found it essentially had been looking for quite a long time.

423
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,960
 "I did not shake hand."

424
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,240
 Should we wrap up?

425
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,800
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

426
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,480
 Thank you so much for listening.

427
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,920
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said

428
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,040
 over the course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

429
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,880
