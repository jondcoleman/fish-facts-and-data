00:00:14,00:00:18,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:18,00:00:23,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Shepfield!
00:00:23,00:00:30,[saxophone plays]
00:00:30,00:00:36,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anish Zinsky, Andrew Huntson Murray,"
00:00:36,00:00:41,"and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:41,00:00:48,"from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy."
00:00:48,00:00:54,"My fact is, as a child, the naturalist Frank Buckland learned to differentiate different kinds"
00:00:54,00:00:58,of animal urine by taste alone. [laughter]
00:00:58,00:01:04,"What a guy! How did this happen? Well, so he was the son of another naturalist,"
00:01:04,00:01:10,"a guy called William Buckland, this is with Victorian, we're talking here, 19th century,"
00:01:10,00:01:17,"and William Buckland was an amazing guy, and he, you know, taught his children lots,"
00:01:17,00:01:21,"and they grew up surrounded by animals, so instead of having a hobby horse to ride on,"
00:01:21,00:01:27,"they had a dead crocodile. And as part of his education, he learned about different kinds of"
00:01:27,00:01:31,animal urine. And is that so you know which pet to tell off when someone we's on the floor?
00:01:31,00:01:35,"Oh, yeah. Who did that? I'm just going to check."
00:01:35,00:01:41,"Freddie? That's a very good idea, yeah, because they had loads of animals around the house."
00:01:41,00:01:46,"So like, for instance, William Buckland, he wasn't naturalist like you say, he liked experiments,"
00:01:46,00:01:51,"he likes to do that kind of thing, so there was one time he was in bed, and he was thinking about"
00:01:51,00:01:55,"fossil footprints, because they just found all these new footprints, and he came up with an idea"
00:01:55,00:02:00,"of how they might be formed, so he woke up his sleeping wife, and asked her to prepare a slab of dough"
00:02:00,00:02:05,"in the kitchen, so he could get his pet tortoise to walk across it, so he could have a look at the"
00:02:05,00:02:12,"footprints that it made. That's so cool. And so Frank's house, William's son, Frank's house,"
00:02:12,00:02:17,"seems like it was riddled with animals, there was an account from 1877 of a journalist who went to"
00:02:17,00:02:21,"physics, he was quite famous, and he said they open the door, and they immediately retreated because"
00:02:21,00:02:27,"there was a jaguar in the doorway with monkeys seizing its tail and denuding it of fur, and"
00:02:27,00:02:33,"the buckles were like, don't worry, he won't hurt you, it'll be fine. There was a jackass, laughing jack"
00:02:33,00:02:37,"ass, which I think is a cookaburra, their word for a cookaburra, chasing live mice up and down a"
00:02:37,00:02:44,"glass jar with a battalion of cats waiting underneath, and there was a battalion, and there was a parrot"
00:02:44,00:02:51,"that kept on calling cabs from the front window as soon as they arrived, but apparently was equally"
00:02:51,00:02:57,"ready to hail an omnibus if they so desired. Yeah, I read a story of a guest, I believe it was with"
00:02:57,00:03:01,"Frank, might have been with William, but they tripped over in the night down the staircase over"
00:03:01,00:03:06,"a hippopotamus, they weren't expecting, yeah. What? Yeah, I'm not, was it alive or dead, the hippo?"
00:03:06,00:03:11,"It was a dead baby hippopotamus, and it was a small child, and she fell all the way down the stairs,"
00:03:11,00:03:17,"and he was like, be careful, you could have damaged that. It sounds like the whole life was just"
00:03:17,00:03:21,"incredible adventures with animals, because Buckland, both Buckland's really were popularizers"
00:03:21,00:03:27,"of science, as well as actual researchers and scientists, but he wrote lots of memoirs and lots"
00:03:27,00:03:33,"of exciting books, which sold hundreds of thousands of copies. So for example, one account he gave,"
00:03:33,00:03:38,"he was trying to make a cast of a three-meter sturgeon, but he could only borrow it for one night,"
00:03:38,00:03:46,"so he had to do it really fast, and he had to get, he woke his wife up. He had to get it downstairs"
00:03:46,00:03:50,"and into the kitchen, so what he did was he tied a rope around its tail, because it was really heavy,"
00:03:50,00:03:55,"it was three meters long, he'd let it slide downstairs in front of him and sort of pulled the rope"
00:03:55,00:04:00,"tall, and unfortunately, obviously, sturgeons are very, very slippery, and it got away from him,"
00:04:00,00:04:05,"and it crashed down the stairs, and it smashed into the kitchen, and these are his words. He said,"
00:04:05,00:04:10,"""This sudden and unexpected appearance of the armour-clad sea monster bursting open the door,"
00:04:10,00:04:16,"instantly created a sensation."" The cook screamed, the house made fainted, the cat jumped on the"
00:04:16,00:04:20,"dresser, the dog retreated behind the copper and barked, the monkeys went mad with fright,"
00:04:20,00:04:24,and the sedate parrot has never spoken a word since.
00:04:25,00:04:33,I will just couldn't get a taxi from that on. He used to chase the cook around the house with a
00:04:33,00:04:39,"dead goose squeezing its voice box to make it squawker her. Was this in childhood? No, no, as a grown-up."
00:04:39,00:04:44,"Oh, what's a grown-up? Yeah, as an adult, yeah. We should say that you've already mentioned that"
00:04:44,00:04:49,"these guys were scientists, but these were like proper scientists. These two guys really were,"
00:04:49,00:04:55,"they were sharing notes with Darwin about ideas, they were properly famous in their time."
00:04:55,00:05:00,"Although Frank didn't believe in evolution, actually neither of them did, but Frank especially"
00:05:00,00:05:04,"didn't believe in evolution, and to prove it, he did a lot of interviews with Pongo, the guerrilla,"
00:05:04,00:05:09,"after which he deduced that the creator had drawn a fast line between human and monkey,"
00:05:09,00:05:13,"so he wasn't getting much out of the interview, I don't think."
00:05:13,00:05:18,"I reckon Pongo went away and thought the same thing. But he did like to eat animals as well,"
00:05:18,00:05:24,"didn't he, Frank? So he deliberately moved closer to London zoos so that he could eat them as"
00:05:24,00:05:28,"soon as they died in the zoo because he liked to eat animals that were all different animals,"
00:05:28,00:05:33,"not just like, you know, meat that we might do so. Frank unvolume, didn't they? Oh, yes, they did, yeah."
00:05:33,00:05:38,"When he was living near the zoo, they, a panther, had died, and so that for him was like,"
00:05:38,00:05:42,"I've never had panther, I really want to try that. So he wrote this is from his writings."
00:05:42,00:05:47,"He said, I wrote at once to tell his friend who worked at the zoo, to tell him to send me down"
00:05:47,00:05:52,"some chops. It had, however, been buried a couple of days, but I got them to dig it up."
00:05:52,00:05:59,"It was not very good. Culinary advice, no one needed."
00:05:59,00:06:05,"But he kind of had also, he was obviously doing this before lots of animals became endangered,"
00:06:05,00:06:10,"so slightly different times. It's still gross. It's still gross. I'm not saying it's not gross,"
00:06:10,00:06:14,"I'm just, but he, but he, there was a purpose behind all this mad eating that he was doing,"
00:06:14,00:06:20,"because he helped to found this thing called the acclimatisation society, and they said, well,"
00:06:21,00:06:25,"people need food to eat, they need protein, turkeys and fessons are not native to Britain,"
00:06:25,00:06:31,"they were introduced, and they've been a brilliant success. What else can we introduce that will be tasty?"
00:06:31,00:06:34,Because they were worried that the population was going up and we won't be able to feed ourselves.
00:06:34,00:06:38,"Exactly. So they just had banquets every year when they tried all sorts of stuff and said,"
00:06:38,00:06:42,"what can we introduce? Because after Brexit, we'll all be digging up the panthers, won't we?"
00:06:42,00:06:48,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinsky."
00:06:48,00:06:54,"My fact this week is that in the 1980s, Romania lifted up and relocated dozens of buildings,"
00:06:54,00:07:00,often with their residents still inside them. So why did they do that?
00:07:00,00:07:06,"Well, so this was in the 1980s in Romania and many in Bucharestka. It was under child Chescu,"
00:07:06,00:07:11,"who wanted, as a plastic dictator, fashion to create this enormous palace for the people,"
00:07:11,00:07:16,"which involved bulldozing basically the entire city, and he destroyed hundreds of buildings."
00:07:16,00:07:21,"It was very devastating, because it was a really picturesque town, which was sort of flattened,"
00:07:21,00:07:25,"but there were a few heroes who thought, okay, rather than let him destroy these buildings,"
00:07:25,00:07:30,"let's quickly move them. And so they got to work, and they moved, almost a dozen churches,"
00:07:30,00:07:36,"and they moved lots of other buildings, including a hospital, a bank, and sometimes whole apartment buildings,"
00:07:36,00:07:42,which they just move like pick up and shift a few hundred yards with the people still inside them.
00:07:42,00:07:44,"They must have told the people inside, mustn't they?"
00:07:44,00:07:49,They did. Although there was one occasion where people have been told that they were going to be
00:07:49,00:07:53,"moving their buildings at 9 a.m., and so most of the residents thought, I'll just pack my suitcases"
00:07:53,00:07:57,"and get out for that little period. And it turned out it was 6 a.m., so they all got up at 9,"
00:07:57,00:08:01,"looked out their windows and was like, oh my god."
00:08:01,00:08:05,"This was mainly one guy, it wasn't it, who came up with the idea, who passed away just this year."
00:08:05,00:08:11,"I'll attempt to say his name, and then Anna can say it correctly after me."
00:08:11,00:08:14,Eugenio Lodal Shokku.
00:08:14,00:08:19,"Wow, wow. I mean, he got the first letter of his name completely wrong."
00:08:19,00:08:20,"It's an I, not an L."
00:08:20,00:08:22,"Oh, that's an I."
00:08:22,00:08:26,"Okay, you ordered Chesku?"
00:08:26,00:08:30,"Yeah, you ordered Chesku. Eugenio, you ordered Chesku."
00:08:30,00:08:37,"That's who I said, and so he died this year very sadly, and he got the idea for it,"
00:08:37,00:08:41,"because he hated the idea that this was a rescue mission, these were meant to be demolished,"
00:08:41,00:08:45,and he thought that's unacceptable. A lot of these were very beautiful churches that he wanted
00:08:45,00:08:50,"to survive. And so he was sitting in a restaurant one day, and he saw a waiter passing by,"
00:08:50,00:08:55,"carrying on a tray, the drinks that he was bringing to a table, and he looked at that tray system,"
00:08:55,00:08:58,"and he thought, that's how we could be doing this."
00:08:58,00:09:02,And then he started a search for the largest waiter in the world.
00:09:04,00:09:07,Yeah. He sounded so much like Jeremy Clarkson.
00:09:07,00:09:11,He didn't do that. He built some rail tracks.
00:09:11,00:09:17,"He basically built one mini railways, didn't he, so he could sort of roll them along into their new"
00:09:17,00:09:22,"areas. So if you go to Bucharest now, then you can see these old buildings sort of hiding"
00:09:22,00:09:26,"behind the huge ugly new Soviet ones. They'll be a lovely little church, suddenly."
00:09:26,00:09:31,"So actually, that parliament that was built, you know, that everything else was being"
00:09:31,00:09:37,demolished and moved to Maywayful. It wiped out one-fifth of the historic centre of the entire city.
00:09:37,00:09:42,"That's how big it is. And it took a third of the country's budget for several years,"
00:09:42,00:09:47,"a third of the budget of the whole country. And it was so it was planned by Chachescu,"
00:09:47,00:09:54,"but the chief architect, Anker Patrescu, was only 28, and the BBC described her as arguably the world's"
00:09:54,00:09:59,"worst architect. Oh, I've seen that. It's not like that. I think it looks quite nice, actually."
00:09:59,00:10:06,One of the buildings that they did destroy and didn't move was Brent Covinesk Hospital.
00:10:06,00:10:11,"And the reason they did that is quite long-winded. So basically, David Steele, who is the leader of"
00:10:11,00:10:18,"the Liberal Party in England, gave Chachescu a pet dog, who Chachescu absolutely loved, okay."
00:10:18,00:10:26,"So he made the dog a corporal in the army. I mean, he was a dictator. He did crazy shit like that."
00:10:27,00:10:32,And then they went to this hospital and the hospital had problems with rats. And so they got cats
00:10:32,00:10:37,in the hospital to chase after the rats. And then the dog came in and got in a big fight with one
00:10:37,00:10:43,"of the cats. And then because he'd been injured by a cat, Chachescu went, I'm afraid this hospital"
00:10:43,00:10:48,"has to go. And the very next day, the order came in for the hospital to be demolished,"
00:10:48,00:10:52,all because this corporal dog had been beaten up by a cat.
00:10:52,00:10:58,At what point do you realise you are the bad guy when you're... Wow.
00:10:58,00:11:05,"I mean, this dog was called Corbu. He was really loved by Chachescu. So much so that the"
00:11:05,00:11:11,Romanian ambassador in London used to go to Sainsbury's every week to buy winelot prime to send
00:11:11,00:11:18,"back to Bucharest in a diplomatic bag. Wow. Yeah, he was crazy. He used, and in fact, the guy"
00:11:18,00:11:23,Yoruchescu got permission to move all of these buildings. But Chachescu was so impatient to knock them
00:11:23,00:11:28,down that he knocked a lot of them down even though they were supposed to be moved. And there was one
00:11:28,00:11:32,"that he wanted to knock down, but all the workers refused to do it. It was this beautiful old church."
00:11:32,00:11:37,I think it was medieval. And so he had to release people from prison to employ them to knock down
00:11:37,00:11:43,"this building. But his palace was incredible. So his palace, which he called the People's Palace,"
00:11:43,00:11:48,"I think, or Palace of the People, which is one of those ironic titles, it's Union Hall"
00:11:48,00:11:53,featured two huge spiral staircases. And that was so that he and his wife Elena could descend
00:11:53,00:11:59,simultaneously from different sides of it. And also he made them rebuild the staircase twice
00:11:59,00:12:03,"that he was supposed to walk down, because he was really short and very paranoid about his height."
00:12:03,00:12:07,"So as soon as they made the steps a bit too hard for him to stretch down, he was like, no, get rid of it."
00:12:07,00:12:10,"It makes me feel small. Wait, how short was he? Wasn't a borrower."
00:12:13,00:12:19,"There were a thousand steps to descend one meter. I mean, that's still there as well, isn't it?"
00:12:19,00:12:25,"Yeah, God, yeah. I've got one more factor actually about Chachesky. So, as we've said, not a nice guy"
00:12:25,00:12:31,"had 20,000 political prisoners. Really, just such a bad guy. He ruled that you had to have at least"
00:12:31,00:12:40,"five children or face a fine. Wow, I know five. Five, that's a lot. But so he has had a state visit to"
00:12:40,00:12:47,"Britain. He had a state visit to Britain in 1978. And it was a big political thing because, you know,"
00:12:47,00:12:53,"we were trying to pry, pry Romania away from Soviet Union. And they were kind of semi-independent of that."
00:12:53,00:12:58,"But anyway, it was very embarrassing. And it was, you know, he was the most embarrassing state visit"
00:12:58,00:13:04,"until last year. Anyway, so that, you know, it was awful. But during that visit is one of my favorite"
00:13:04,00:13:10,"and ever anecdotes happened, which is that Queen Elizabeth hid in a bush with her dogs to avoid him."
00:13:10,00:13:16,She really didn't want to have him. She'd be having a terrible time. And then she was walking her dogs
00:13:16,00:13:21,in Buckingham Palace Gardens. And she saw him coming the other way and she jumped into a bush. Amazing.
00:13:21,00:13:27,He was really paranoid that people would poison his clothes. So he only wore clothes that had been
00:13:27,00:13:33,"under constant surveillance. He also, when he met Queen Elizabeth, he washed his hands with alcohol"
00:13:33,00:13:38,immediately after shaking her hands because he was worried that he'd been poisoned. Wow.
00:13:38,00:13:42,What? You'd have to be pretty top level to recruit the Queen to be an assassin.
00:13:42,00:13:52,It's always a person you least expect. Wow. Just on buildings in Romania. Yeah.
00:13:52,00:13:57,"The word thing about this is, this wasn't the only instance in which people in Romania were in"
00:13:57,00:14:04,"buildings that were suddenly moved. So there was also a separate project in Albert Yudia, which is"
00:14:04,00:14:09,"another city in Romania, where there was this big Soviet, actually, apartment block. And"
00:14:09,00:14:14,"he, Charles Skiu, then wanted to build this huge boulevard. And he happened to want to build it"
00:14:14,00:14:18,right through the middle of this Soviet apartment block. So the only thing to do was cut it in half
00:14:18,00:14:23,and shift one half to one side of the road and one half to the other. But apparently it was very
00:14:23,00:14:28,"smooth. It took 5,040 minutes and one woman put a glass of water on her balcony throughout the whole"
00:14:28,00:14:34,thing and none of it spilled. Wow. So impressive. But sometimes because they move buildings on rollers
00:14:34,00:14:39,"in other countries too, sometimes it's really, yeah, as rabbit it happened. So in Boston in 1869,"
00:14:39,00:14:44,"that long ago they had to widen the street. So they had to say to the hotel on the street,"
00:14:44,00:14:50,can you just move back a bit? And it took three months because obviously it was a 19th century.
00:14:50,00:14:57,"And but over that time, the first floor businesses and all lots of residents stayed in place during"
00:14:57,00:15:01,those three months. And the amazing thing was that plumbing and gas services stayed on
00:15:01,00:15:08,because they had flexible tubes. So cool. That's so cool. But it's so confusing if you're going
00:15:08,00:15:12,to visit your friend who you haven't seen for a couple of months and you find yourself knocking
00:15:12,00:15:16,"on an empty space where the door used to be. Well, that actually happened. There's a place"
00:15:16,00:15:21,called Hibbing in America where they had to move because there was a mine underneath the town. And there
00:15:21,00:15:26,was a few things that happened. So there was a woman who went into labor in one town and then gave
00:15:26,00:15:31,birth in the other town because they moved the whole town a little bit. And because they moved the
00:15:31,00:15:37,"entire town house by house to this new place, they put it back not exactly in the same way as they"
00:15:37,00:15:42,"left it. And so people who had like grown up there came back 30 years later and they're like,"
00:15:42,00:15:48,I'm sure there used to be a co-op there. That's so good. That's amazing. There was in America in 2016.
00:15:48,00:15:55,They wanted to knock down Rosa Parks House. They wanted to demolish it and no one was really
00:15:55,00:16:00,"sticking up for it. And there was one artist who said, we can't let this happen. So he bought it"
00:16:00,00:16:07,"for $500 American. And this is in Detroit. And he said, we have to keep this house. So he looked"
00:16:07,00:16:13,"to people to sell it to to say, can you can you now take on the costs and maybe we can relocate it."
00:16:13,00:16:19,But no one took it. So he had to bring it home with him to Berlin. And Rosa Parks's Detroit House
00:16:19,00:16:26,was dismantled and rebuilt in Berlin and was sitting there for about two years. And it went back
00:16:26,00:16:31,to America. And then I think it might have to move back to Berlin because they don't want it again.
00:16:31,00:16:36,"This is absolutely true. So the house was completely dismantled, shipped to Berlin and sat in the"
00:16:36,00:16:41,"backyard of this artist's house. Wait, why is it now having to go back there? Surely if they don't"
00:16:41,00:16:45,"want it a second time, you just got a chuck at it. She won't mind. He wanted to get it back there."
00:16:45,00:16:50,"So he kept saying, let's get it back there. So a night for a woman who's kind of main claim to"
00:16:50,00:16:59,fame and publicity into her big moment was not moving from a spot. I want to witch it.
00:16:59,00:17:07,What is the back of the boss out of Berlin and America? We're going to have to move on very shortly
00:17:07,00:17:13,to our next phase. I just got one little thing. So I was trying to find out what the biggest thing you
00:17:13,00:17:22,can move a thing on is. So do you mean the thing on which the thing is? The lower thing. The thing
00:17:22,00:17:28,supporting the bigger thing. These are all great Google search terms. So it's just a cool thing.
00:17:28,00:17:32,"So NASA, they have to move sometimes a launch tower. And I didn't know the launch towers ever move,"
00:17:32,00:17:37,"but sometimes they have to drag them around. And they've got a thing which is called a crawler,"
00:17:37,00:17:43,"a crawler transporter. And it's massive. Okay, so you have to have a degree in engineering just to"
00:17:43,00:17:50,drive it. There are only four qualified drivers on the planet. There are really two of these things
00:17:50,00:17:55,"in the whole world. And you only drive it for 35 minutes, even if you are one of the drivers,"
00:17:55,00:17:59,"and then you have to swap with someone else, because it's just so mentally exhausted. Driving"
00:17:59,00:18:06,"a NASA launch tower, which weighs 5 million kilos, so it's big. One gallon of petrol gets you"
00:18:06,00:18:12,"about 15 yards. Is it like a maximum speed limit of like one mile an hour or something? Yeah,"
00:18:12,00:18:18,if that is really slow. So there are just petrol stations that she just back to back all the way.
00:18:18,00:18:25,"I can't silly pull it in and out and out and out. And as you just one super quick building removal,"
00:18:25,00:18:32,in 1903 there was a mansion called the Captain Samuel Brown Mansion in Pennsylvania. And it had
00:18:32,00:18:36,"to be demolished because they were building a railway. And a descendant of the original owner said,"
00:18:36,00:18:41,"""Would you mind rather than demolishing it, just moving it 160 feet up that massive cliff next to it?"""
00:18:41,00:18:46,"That would be really nice. And so they, for some reason, the authorities agreed to this. And so"
00:18:46,00:18:53,"160 feet is quite a lot, almost sheer cliff. So they had to excavate the entire cliff and they"
00:18:53,00:18:58,put these giant shelves in it. So they put four enormous shelves and then they lifted it up on
00:18:58,00:19:05,"winches, one shelf at a time that were powered by horses. They needed 20,000 beams to do it. So"
00:19:05,00:19:10,"pulled it up onto one shelf, plopped it down, horses had a rest, pulled it up onto the next one."
00:19:10,00:19:15,And it eventually cost more than the original house it cost to build. And then extremely soon
00:19:15,00:19:27,"afterwards it was completely destroyed in a fire. Okay, it is time for fact number three. And that is"
00:19:27,00:19:34,my fact. My fact this week is when at home Freddie Mercury slept in a queen-size bed.
00:19:34,00:19:44,So nice to know that. This was Freddie Mercury's final home that he lived in. It was in London. He
00:19:44,00:19:49,bought it from a big banking family called The Horror Family. So he referred to it as The Horror House.
00:19:49,00:19:55,"And his partner, Jim Hutton, who was with him for about the last seven years of his life."
00:19:55,00:19:59,And he gives a fantastic description in this book he wrote memoir about his time with Freddie
00:19:59,00:20:05,"called Mercury in me, in which he describes the top floor of Freddie's London house, which was"
00:20:05,00:20:10,"three rooms that were, the walls were smashed down and made into one big room. There was a big dome"
00:20:10,00:20:16,and he said in the corner was Freddie's queen-size bed. And yeah. And do we know if it was deliberately
00:20:16,00:20:22,"chosen for the wordplay? No, it probably wasn't. It's just a nice little detail that is"
00:20:22,00:20:27,"get it over as he's describing the room. Yeah, yeah, nice. I have read that book as well. Oh, I got it"
00:20:27,00:20:34,"on Kindle and then I just searched through it for references to beds. So you read it, yeah, yeah."
00:20:34,00:20:39,"The only other reference I could find to how he liked to sleep was that when they went to Japan,"
00:20:39,00:20:43,he embraced the way of life of the Japanese and liked to sleep on the floor. So he really liked
00:20:43,00:20:48,sleeping on the floor. But he didn't really embrace it as far as learning the language because he only
00:20:48,00:20:54,"learned two words in Japanese, domo and mushy mushy, which he said at every opportunity."
00:20:54,00:21:01,Freddie Mercury was a very interesting guy. I found that he once had a verbal spat. This is one of
00:21:01,00:21:06,the famous stories about him. He once had a verbal spat with Sid Vicious from the Sex Pistols and he
00:21:06,00:21:11,managed to infuriate Sid Vicious by deliberately misnaming him Simon Ferocious.
00:21:11,00:21:19,"Did he have four extra teeth? He did, yes. Did he had four extra teeth behind his first teeth?"
00:21:19,00:21:24,"Really? Is that what he had such protruding first teeth? Front teeth? Yes, it is. Does he used to be"
00:21:24,00:21:28,called Bucky Balsara? That was his nickname at school because Buktoothed and he was born
00:21:28,00:21:35,"Farok Balsara. He was born in Zanzibar and his parents were originally Indian, weren't they?"
00:21:35,00:21:41,"And so, yeah, Farok Balsara, Bucky Balsara. Yeah, he never got rid of them because the worry was,"
00:21:41,00:21:45,"it would affect his vocal cords. He had such a fantastic range. So his problem in life was,"
00:21:45,00:21:49,do I go for vanity or do I go for what I love music and he went for music? So Queen of
00:21:49,00:21:54,"Very Famous for having big, extravagant parties. And there are lots of lurid stories about, you know,"
00:21:54,00:21:59,"dwarves with cocaine on their heads and all this stuff. But Roger Taylor, the drummer, said another"
00:21:59,00:22:04,thing they had at their parties. I can't believe this. They had basically a specific party consultant.
00:22:04,00:22:10,"He said, ""We had a man whose job was to find unusual people. And in America, he hired a guy whose"
00:22:10,00:22:16,"thing was to lie on the ground, covered in these great big, cold meat collations that Americans love."
00:22:16,00:22:21,He would be completely covered by meat and then he would shift and make the meats move.
00:22:21,00:22:28,The idea was to freak people out. I can imagine that freaking girl. I had a load of Greg sausage rolls
00:22:28,00:22:35,"on a table and suddenly one of them wiggled around. Wow, they're just draped in salami."
00:22:35,00:22:39,There's been a line on the ground covering me and this huge part of meat would start sort of
00:22:39,00:22:45,writhing around. I think that's a great party tray. But surely people can tell if I went to get
00:22:45,00:22:49,"meat of something, I think I could tell if I was getting it off a plate or a person."
00:22:49,00:22:55,Or was it so many of us were so covered in meat. So covered. He was completely covered in meat.
00:22:55,00:23:00,I can't say that was his thing. How did he breathe? Did he have like a straw coming out through the
00:23:00,00:23:04,meat? He must have done right. I imagine you would have to have a straw. Always look out for the
00:23:04,00:23:11,straw. If you see a big pile of meat. Or he could have had a scuba gear on. But with a fault.
00:23:11,00:23:14,"Yeah, with a full time. But then you need even more meat to cover the oxygen tank"
00:23:14,00:23:22,"and the flippers of course. I would, you'd roll up bits of salami and then breathe through them."
00:23:24,00:23:29,"So do you know that Bohemian Rhapsody, the movie, that's now one of all these Oscars?"
00:23:29,00:23:31,What do you want to stop talking about meat man?
00:23:31,00:23:40,"The single greatest party man. What was I thinking? Sorry, thanks."
00:23:40,00:23:45,"There was apparently there was also a woman who offered for $100,000 to decapitate herself"
00:23:45,00:23:52,"with a chainsaw. What? I don't, I'm not sure they had that at the party. I don't think so."
00:23:53,00:23:58,"That's quite a low price for doing that. It's kind of a relatively low price, isn't it?"
00:23:58,00:24:04,Was she going to spend it on? There is some blue tack.
00:24:04,00:24:11,"Sorry, sorry, Daniel. Sorry if I could just mention a fact."
00:24:11,00:24:19,"So Bohemian Rhapsody, we, Rami Malik, was the actor playing Freddie Mercury but it was"
00:24:19,00:24:23,"originally when it's been in production for many, many years in pre-production rather. And"
00:24:23,00:24:29,"Sasha Baron Cohen, Ali G, was meant to play Freddie Mercury and he got fired because he wanted it"
00:24:29,00:24:34,"to be the more the meat man party kind of stuff going on and the decapitation and they said no,"
00:24:34,00:24:38,"we need to do it differently. But he said this interesting thing which was, he was talking to one"
00:24:38,00:24:43,"of the members of the band, didn't name who. But he said the person, the band member said, you know,"
00:24:43,00:24:47,this is such a great movie because it's got such an amazing thing that happens in the middle.
00:24:47,00:24:52,"And Sasha said, well, what happens in the middle of the movie? And he said, well, you know,"
00:24:52,00:24:58,"Freddie dies. And so Sasha went, but what happens in the second half of the movie then?"
00:24:58,00:25:02,"Like, that's why people are there to see it. They're there to see Freddie. And they said, well, you know,"
00:25:02,00:25:07,they then see a band that goes from strength to strength. So the original idea was that we were
00:25:07,00:25:14,"going to watch how Queen sort of became who they really were, post-Freddie. And I'm not sure that,"
00:25:14,00:25:19,"I mean, they've done some good things but the only real fun thing I could find musically from Brian"
00:25:19,00:25:24,"May, who was the guitarist, was that in 2003, he set up a band with Brian Blessed."
00:25:24,00:25:31,"I mean, that's good. Here we go. Yeah. They were a part of an animal rights group to protect the"
00:25:31,00:25:40,"Badger. Is it good? Yeah. So they were, they were, they were called Team Badger. And they released a"
00:25:40,00:25:48,"song, which was called Save the Badger, Badger, Badger. And then they formed another band with David"
00:25:48,00:25:54,"Attenborough and Slash, the guitarist from Guns and Roses. Oh my god. To create a super group,"
00:25:54,00:25:59,"this is Brian May. And they were called The Artful Badger. And they released a song, dedicated to"
00:25:59,00:26:05,"Badger, it's called Badger Swagger. I'm going to watch this film. I'm going to find it. We're in the"
00:26:05,00:26:10,"second half, Freddie Murk, little vampire Freddie Murkery comes back, but he's got extra teeth. So he's"
00:26:10,00:26:17,"more of a risk. But we should probably say, isn't Brian May's on topic, that he is a really cool guy"
00:26:17,00:26:21,"in his own right. So he finished his thesis, his doctoral thesis. Maybe you guys know that he's a"
00:26:21,00:26:27,physicist. And he wanted to do physics. And then he got involved in this whole queen shenanigan.
00:26:27,00:26:34,"But he went back to doing his thesis. And in 2007, then he submitted it. It's a survey of radial"
00:26:34,00:26:40,"velocities in the zodiacal dust cloud. And he submitted it 37 years after starting the research,"
00:26:40,00:26:44,"which is actually one of the most thesis, because you have to catch up on the intervening 33 years of"
00:26:44,00:26:48,"research, which have been quite a lot. But he was studying a super interesting thing. So zodiacal"
00:26:48,00:26:55,"light is this, it's a misty cone of light that appears a few hours before sunrise in the east,"
00:26:55,00:27:01,or a few hours after sunset in the west. And it's what we call false dawn. So we've all kind of
00:27:01,00:27:05,seen it. And you often think it's sort of a town on the horizon or something. It's actually the
00:27:05,00:27:10,"reflected sunlight, sort of shining of scattered bits of dust in the solar system. And they only"
00:27:10,00:27:15,"worked out really what it was a few years ago. But yeah, that's what that's what his whole thesis is on."
00:27:15,00:27:19,And he just did it. Very cool. I prefer his team Badger stuff.
00:27:19,00:27:29,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is James."
00:27:29,00:27:34,"Okay, my fact this week is that according to people who make their livings walking on fire and"
00:27:34,00:27:45,"walking on broken glass, neither is as painful as walking on Lego. Amazing. This is true. So this"
00:27:45,00:27:50,was an article from the Smithsonian. They were talking to a guy called Scott Bell who is a former
00:27:50,00:27:55,"fire walking world record holder. And he now runs a company where they do walking on fire,"
00:27:55,00:28:01,"walking on glass and walking on Lego. And he still does the glass and the fire, but he refuses"
00:28:01,00:28:07,"to do the Lego stuff. And basically the reason is that walking on fire, as long as you do it quite"
00:28:07,00:28:12,"quickly, is not that bad at all because the conductivity of the calls is not so great. The glass,"
00:28:12,00:28:16,"if you walk in it, they really make it very, very small. And so when you step on it, it kind of moves"
00:28:16,00:28:23,"around underneath your feet, but Lego do not move at all. And they're really hard and they're really"
00:28:23,00:28:28,pointy. And I don't need to tell you guys that it's fucking painful when you stand up. And so when
00:28:28,00:28:32,"you're walking across them, there's nowhere for them to go. They just stay there and they just dig"
00:28:32,00:28:37,"into your feet and they're really, really painful. And so he refuses to do it. It's a really good"
00:28:37,00:28:43,article this Smithsonian because they talk about how much mass Lego can withstand before it crumbles
00:28:43,00:28:49,or goes. And every single brick can withstand a mass of 400 kilos before it even starts moving.
00:28:49,00:28:53,What it means is that you know that scene in Die Hard where Bruce Willis is crawling over broken
00:28:53,00:29:01,"glass. If he'd been crawling over Lego, that would have been a really exciting scene. Just the glass"
00:29:01,00:29:07,"bit in that article, they got that confirmation that it hurt more to go on Lego from a cabaret performer"
00:29:07,00:29:14,called Bazoo the Clown spelled K-L-O-U-N. So this is a guy who juggles balls of barbed wire and he
00:29:14,00:29:20,lets people staple dollar bills to his chest. He also walks on glass and he confirmed Lego is just
00:29:21,00:29:26,"way worse. Have you said, there is a thing called the Lego, well I think there are some crazy"
00:29:26,00:29:32,YouTube people who did a thing where they did a Lego treadmill challenge. So you're running on a
00:29:32,00:29:37,"treadmill, but people in front of the treadmill are pouring Lego from a bucket onto it and I just"
00:29:37,00:29:41,"looks like the worst thing in the world. That's a really good prank to play with the gym, isn't it?"
00:29:41,00:29:48,"So you can't, you can't walk on Lego but you can't swallow it, can't you? So swallowing,"
00:29:48,00:29:55,"you're basically fine. That's why if I need to walk into a room where a child's been, I always walk in"
00:29:55,00:30:04,"on my mouth. This is that they put holes in the legs of Lego, sorry they put holes in the head of"
00:30:04,00:30:10,Lego pieces so that if kids swallow them they can still breathe and in fact to really check this
00:30:10,00:30:17,is okay. There were six scientists a short while ago in the UK and Australia who swallowed Lego
00:30:17,00:30:21,pieces themselves to a lay parents fears that it would be a bad thing. So they all swallowed these
00:30:21,00:30:26,heads and they said that they all had different techniques so you had to swallow the heads and then
00:30:26,00:30:32,"work out how long they took to come out the other end. I mean they didn't work it out, they just"
00:30:32,00:30:37,wasted for it to come out and that was the only time. Well no but the working out is comes from
00:30:37,00:30:41,the search because we're searching for your own feces can be quite difficult and they said they
00:30:41,00:30:47,all use different techniques so they use chopsticks or forks. Some of them squashed their poo into a
00:30:47,00:30:54,"ziplock bag so that they could find the Lego piece in it if it was there and it's... Sorry, does"
00:30:54,00:31:00,everyone else not put their poo in a ziplock bag? And they always hangs it on a tree as he walks around
00:31:00,00:31:10,"must be so confusing if you had corn for dinner the night before. They actually literally said this,"
00:31:10,00:31:14,they said they didn't eat corn because that would be too confusing because there's little yellow
00:31:14,00:31:21,"bits down, you're a born scientist. And anyway there were six scientists and for five of them the"
00:31:21,00:31:31,Lego head came out within three days. What happened to one of the six? Dead. Yeah but you've got
00:31:31,00:31:38,"five and six hours, no it just never came out but we think he didn't look in the bag properly."
00:31:38,00:31:42,He didn't look in the bag properly but they all survived the experience. Because you won't just be
00:31:42,00:31:48,picking for the rest of your life. I wonder if it's still in there. The face would gradually get
00:31:48,00:31:54,sadder and sadder as it stayed in you. Everything is not awesome.
00:31:54,00:32:07,There is one awesome Lego thing. There is a crab who lives in a shell made of Lego
00:32:08,00:32:13,"is the only one known to science. But how did he get the, he won't have built in himself."
00:32:13,00:32:20,He lives at Lego land. So he's called Harry the crab and he's a hermit crab and they
00:32:20,00:32:27,are the ones who move into empty seashells. So the staff there they made him a shell out of Lego
00:32:27,00:32:31,and they gave him the choice of lots of shells and the Lego one and he chose the Lego one.
00:32:31,00:32:35,There are videos of him online just scuttling around with his Lego house.
00:32:35,00:32:40,It's so sweet. If you work at Lego land you're known as a model citizen.
00:32:40,00:32:44,Nice. So they call themselves? That's great.
00:32:44,00:32:46,"It's good, doesn't it? What if you employ a criminal?"
00:32:46,00:32:54,"You still call him that? I didn't know where the name Lego actually came from, like the origin of it."
00:32:54,00:33:00,So it means play well in Danish which I think we maybe have mentioned before. But I didn't know that
00:33:00,00:33:06,it was the result of a competition in 1934 by Ollie Kurt Christianson who's the person who
00:33:06,00:33:12,basically invented Lego and he came up with a competition to name the new company that he was
00:33:12,00:33:17,setting up the toy company and he opened it up to lots of friends and family and people in his
00:33:17,00:33:22,business and employees and he offered up a bottle of his own homemade wine as a prize.
00:33:24,00:33:30,At the end of it the winning entry was the name Lego and it was his own entry.
00:33:30,00:33:34,Cheers.
00:33:34,00:33:40,A weird echo in my head of you saying he offered a bottle of his own urine.
00:33:40,00:33:42,I think because we've been talking about Frank Buckland and about…
00:33:42,00:33:44,Did I say his own urine?
00:33:44,00:33:49,"No, you said his own homemade wine. No, but homemade wine is another way of putting it, isn't it?"
00:33:51,00:33:57,"Very true. This is just I found this quite fascinating because I don't understand maths,"
00:33:57,00:34:01,"but if you have, you know what a qualifier."
00:34:01,00:34:05,How are your Royal Institution Christmas Lecture Series coming on?
00:34:05,00:34:15,"So if you have a piece of Lego that has eight studs in it and then you had six of those,"
00:34:15,00:34:21,the combination of connecting those six different pieces to an eight studded Lego brick
00:34:21,00:34:27,is over 915 million possibilities of how you can make those combinations.
00:34:27,00:34:33,"Yeah, all the Lego in the world could build you ten towers to the moon if you want to go with"
00:34:33,00:34:38,nine friends that you don't need a tower to reach to get to the moon.
00:34:38,00:34:40,"Hang on, each of you climbing up one piece of Lego."
00:34:40,00:34:42,One Lego tower.
00:34:42,00:34:44,"Sorry, one Lego tower, but it's one piece wide."
00:34:44,00:34:46,"I believe so, yes."
00:34:46,00:34:47,I'm not doing that.
00:34:47,00:34:49,I don't think the integrity would hold.
00:34:49,00:34:51,"I would rather have one tower, ten pieces wide."
00:34:51,00:34:54,"Yeah, and then just have people follow you behind you."
00:34:54,00:34:55,That makes a lot.
00:34:55,00:34:58,I'm going to redo my architectural plans for this.
00:34:58,00:35:00,You do not understand maths.
00:35:00,00:35:07,"So they did a study quite recently, another one where they put a bucket of old Lego bricks"
00:35:07,00:35:10,inside a washing machine and just let it run.
00:35:10,00:35:16,They let it run for 70 minutes of 40 degrees Celsius and they then took it out to see what had happened.
00:35:16,00:35:20,And they found that some of the bricks had just automatically stuck together.
00:35:20,00:35:21,Cool.
00:35:21,00:35:22,"This is really cool, right?"
00:35:22,00:35:25,"So they found that quite a lot of two bricks have stuck together,"
00:35:25,00:35:29,but then there were some as many as six or eight of them had stuck together.
00:35:29,00:35:34,"And what people who did this study have said, now it's a bit of a stretch,"
00:35:34,00:35:39,but they said that it was a bit like the primordial soup that happened at the start of life.
00:35:39,00:35:40,Whoa!
00:35:40,00:35:45,And the building blocks of life are like the building blocks of Lego
00:35:45,00:35:50,and maybe all of the RNA and DNA and proteins all came together in the same way as Lego.
00:35:50,00:35:51,"It is bullshit, isn't it?"
00:35:51,00:35:53,"Oh, wow."
00:35:53,00:35:56,"In a way, we are all washing machine Legos."
00:35:56,00:35:57,Yes.
00:35:57,00:36:01,"Imagine if you put a bunch of Lego in the washing machine,"
00:36:01,00:36:04,opened it up an hour later and there was a massive pirate ship or something.
00:36:06,00:36:10,"If you did it enough times, that must happen. That's the new infinite monkeys and infinite"
00:36:10,00:36:11,typewriter in the mess.
00:36:11,00:36:15,Infinite washing machines with infinite amounts of Lego inside will eventually form a pirate ship.
00:36:15,00:36:21,We're going to have to wrap up this thing.
00:36:21,00:36:23,I've just got one more fact about training on things you don't want to tread on.
00:36:23,00:36:25,"Okay, yes, it's a fact from the news this week."
00:36:25,00:36:28,"And weirdly, it involves it block bags."
00:36:28,00:36:33,"So in Cheshire, this week, resident in Middlewich, he was really annoyed about the amount of"
00:36:33,00:36:39,dog poo around and he's 47. He walks his dog and he decided there was too much dog poo about.
00:36:39,00:36:42,"So he said, ""I'm going to turn it into a competition."""
00:36:42,00:36:45,"And he told the local newspaper, ""I had a spare £20 note that I did not need."""
00:36:45,00:36:51,So I put it in a ziplock bag and hit it under some dog poo and then notified his local
00:36:51,00:36:53,neighbours and community. Oh my god.
00:36:53,00:36:56,"He said, ""I posted it on Facebook and a lot of people got back to me."""
00:36:56,00:36:59,The woman who found it essentially had been looking for quite a long time.
00:37:01,00:37:04,"""I did not shake hand."""
00:37:04,00:37:06,Should we wrap up?
00:37:06,00:37:08,"Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts."
