00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Anna Chazinski.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Starting with you, James.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that British warships are so noisy that enemy submarines can hear them from 100 miles away.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 What's going on on board these ships?

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 This go nice.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Yeah, so this basically is the type 45 destroyer, and I think we've mentioned them before, they've had a lot of troubles.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 They were the ones who broke down in warm water.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And they also rattle very loudly, and they used to stop it by putting little wooden wedges between the hatches, and that would stop them from rattling.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 But they've kind of stopped doing that now just because they've run out of patience, and now our warships are rattling around the seas,

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 and anyone who wants to know they're around doesn't even have to use any detection.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Wow, if you're in a submarine, you can't really hear that well underwater.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 You can hear better underwater.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 No, that's what.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Well, only in the soundtracks.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 You've ever tried to have a chat with someone underwater.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Yeah, but sound does move quicker through liquid than through air.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Really?

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Yeah, because the molecules are closer together.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 I guess so.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 But then they're in a tin, so like they're not in the water, they're not using their actual ears to hear it, right?

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 So I would say people in submarines, if you're detecting things through sound, then usually it would be so now, rather than people sticking their ears out of the hatch.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 So I just want to get clarification.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 There is a new submarine that the Swedish are building.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Their building is incredibly advanced submarines, and one of the features they have is there's a pod in it where the submarine can land on the bottom of the sea,

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 and then the pod opens, and special forces can leave the submarine, plant mines, or do whatever they need to do on the bottom of the sea, and then go back in.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 That's very unusual, isn't it?

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Very unusual.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Because first of all, submarines don't really like to actually touch the bottom of their ocean, do they?

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Because then they can get stuck, like their care squung or whatever it is.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Good point. This was just a concept drawing, so maybe I've misunderstood.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Also, mines in the water, you don't tend to dig them underneath the sea.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Otherwise, all you're going to do is blow up some fish and crabs.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Yeah, it's not like the old-school scuba divers with the huge bell and rope thing.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 It does feel to me like you've seen an eight-year-old drawing.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 But it's more effective to catch scuba divers because they're wearing their big flippers on their feet, so they're more likely to tread on a mine.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 That's true.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 But the flippers will mean that there's less pressure because they're wider.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 But there is pressure pushing down from the ocean, so the additional pressure with the flipper.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 But you don't walk along the flui in flippers. You ever try to walk in flippers?

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Never let them touch the ground.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 You could walk on tiptoe on the flippers, which would give you extra height,

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 and which would give you actually less of a surface space than standing on mines.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 There are some fish which have their extended fins, and so they kind of walk on the bottom of the ocean.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Oh, yeah?

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 A tripod fish, they're called, aren't they?

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 So Sweden only has five submarines, but they are incredibly good and incredibly quiet as well. They're so stealthy.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 So, for example, they're mostly used because Sweden doesn't really fight many people,

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 but they are mostly used by the American Navy to play the Russians.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And the last time they did a big war-gaming exercise, the Swedish submarines got through all the American defenses

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 and sort of virtually torpedoed the entire American Navy.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Oh, wow.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Yeah, without being detected.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Is there not a danger that one day, then, Sweden, this lovely peace-making nation is going to think, hang on, we're really good at this.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Well, we try actually not making it again this time.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Sweden used to own sort of a third of Europe. They used to have a massive, massive empire.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 They invaded Russia while simultaneously fighting France, I think.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 They're crazy.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Don't invade Russia while simultaneously fighting other countries.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 No, I know.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 People.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Anyway, there are submarines made by Sab is the main thing I wanted to say.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 So, submarines.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Wow, we reached the pretty high points of puttary quite early on.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I don't know where to go from here.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 So, one way that submarines are hiding themselves or planning on hiding themselves in future is with bubble wrap.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Do you see this?

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Was it wrapping themselves in just bubbles?

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Yeah, but not sea bubbles.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 This is obviously in submarines as a problem of trying to avoid detection

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 by boats and other submarines, sonar and radar.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And so, they've developed this kind of bubble wrap, which is kind of plastic material

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 that they're planning to put on the outside of submarines and it will deflect radar.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Oh, wow.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And they're impossible to spot.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Also, I mean, they're really fun because you just keep popping all the time, wouldn't you?

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 But then you get detected. That's the problem.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 That's true.

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Only by five-year-olds.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 The thing about bubbles that's interesting, I don't know if we've mentioned this before, is that a torpedo when it hits a submarine,

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 the torpedo doesn't hit the submarine, it explodes just before the submarine.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And it's the bubbles that bring down the ship.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Yeah, it's extraordinary.

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 It's like it explodes as a massive vacuum, which is like a bubble and that will force the whole apart.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Wow.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Because it would fool you as well into thinking you were safe when you saw it explode before.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Hey, you'd be like, "Ah, it is."

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I'm trying to get next push.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Is there, you know how airports have flight controllers who sort of shepherd in the planes, you know, in order?

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Plane shepherds.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Yeah, the plane shepherds.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 I think sometimes they call them traffic controllers, but that's just a slang thing.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Yeah, that's a slang term for plane shepherds.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 So are there submarine shepherds?

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Do they?

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Because if you've got, let's say you send out like a fleet of your own submarines

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 and they've all got this amazing invisible detection thing,

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 they'll just be slamming into each other on the way out the harbor, right?

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 So is that a thing?

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I don't think, because we don't have as many submarines as we have commercial planes.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 I don't think we're sending 200 of them out in the space of three hours.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 There must be occasionally where it's like, let's launch them all,

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 because, you know, Sweden's decided to take over every day of the game.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 I think Britain only has one constantly at sea nuclear-drieden submarine.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Uh-huh.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Why isn't it? So it doesn't crash into anything else?

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 No, no, that's it.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 There's one which is being sort of repaired all the time.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 There's one which is being used for training all the time.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 And there's one which is constantly at sea.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And obviously, that's which is around.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 It's not like one of them is constantly being repaired.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Exactly.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 I think they just kind of admit that one's broken.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 It's interesting looking at the numbers of warships.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 So in 1945, I read this article that we had night, this is brilliant,

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 900 warships in the Royal Navy.

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 By the time of the Falkland Wars, it was down to 70 warships.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And they now reckon in 2017 it's half of that.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 So we're looking at about 35 warships.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 And that, I think, includes a lot of smaller craft as well, like frigates in the '35s.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 So warship, can be anything from an aircraft carrier to a speedboat.

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Speedboat?

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Maybe not quite. It's not quite that bad yet that we've only got 35 speedboats.

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 But it's bad.

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 The Japanese Navy is larger than the British and French Navy put together.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 How many speedboats have they got?

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Oh, so many of 75.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Wow.

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 But this is the thing. The Japanese Army, I was reading about this in the economist,

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 has never fired a shot in anger.

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 What have they fired it in?

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 The Griven Chic.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 What do you mean that doesn't... I don't know what you mean by that.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 So the Japanese Army was disbanded after the Second World War?

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So you mean since the Second World War?

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Since the Second World War. Yeah, they fired a load of shots in anger during Second World War.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 But since then, they have never got involved.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And there is a Japanese man who is now suing the government because they're training his son to kill people.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Oh, really?

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Yeah, yeah. The British Navy, at least, having big problems with recruitment.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And they've basically just had to change all the rules.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 So that used to be that you couldn't be recruited if you were over the age of 59.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 And now they're saying, if you're over the age of 59, that is no problem.

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Please come and rejoin the Navy because they're really needed.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Because that does seem relatively old to start your naval training career.

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 I think it's retired.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 It's retired. Yeah, they're saying come back.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 So the current first sea lord, who's named Admiral Philip Jones, he's put this calling out saying we need people to come back.

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 It's codenamed, and I don't know why we know the codenamed, but it's codenamed from street to fleet.

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 And they just don't have enough sailors.

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Basically, they need people back on ships.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And he said he's five speedboats. We need a man.

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Exactly.

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 And this year has been named the year of the Navy.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 And that was named by Michael Fallon, the defence secretary. So it's meant to be pushing it.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I mean, he's the defence secretary. They should all be the year of the Navy to him.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Well, he needs to have a special year for these things.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Well, last year was the year of the emoji.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 So this is defend Britain year, which we prevent people from invading.

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Does everyone know the name of the captain on the US Navy's biggest stealth destroyer?

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Captain Bird's Eye. No, I do know it. Yes, it's so good.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Captain Pugwash. No, but keep on long this line.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Captain Krunch. Yes.

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 It is Captain James Kirk. Sure is.

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 But yeah, Captain James T Kirk runs this destroyer.

169
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And the cool thing about this, and this is true of some of our warships,

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 and related to the fact, which I guess is about how ships need to disguise themselves,

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 is that it looks to radar like a little fishing boat.

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Actually, all of Britain ships look like a little fishing boat.

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Amazing disguise. It's so realistic.

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 They do it by the angles that it's built out.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 So if you look it up, it looks like more like a spaceship than a boat,

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 because it's built a really weird shape.

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 And the angles, again, they deflect the radar in certain ways, which make it appear like a tiny ship.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Can you do the opposite, whereas if I have a tiny ship,

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 I can be in the sub-going, check out my ship over there.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Here's how it works. Imagine you're firing something at an aeroplane,

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 and it bounces back at you. Like a tennis ball, you throw it at it,

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 and it bounces back, and you can tell it's there because it bounces back.

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Okay. Now, imagine these stealth aeroplanes, which are triangular.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 If you fire it exactly at the nose, it'll bounce back at you.

185
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 But if you fire it anywhere on the side, it's going to bounce to the side,

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 so you're not going to see it's there. And that's how the stealth works.

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And so one of these really triangular aeroplanes, they look tiny,

188
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 because the only bit that comes back from the radar is from the little nose bit.

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 But what do they think that they go, "Oh, it must be just a... a burnt side."

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Oh, they think it's a bird?

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Yeah. Is that a bird? No, it's a plane.

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chisensky.

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 My fact is that the first account of European smoking cannabis

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 reported that one hidden a jar for four hours, and another going to a fight with a pillar.

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 So this was, I read this in a book called Penguins, Pineapples, and Pangolins,

196
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 and it's first encounters with the exotic as it's subtitle,

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 and it's all about the first times that people from some parts of the world encountered stuff

198
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 from other parts of the world. So this was a sailor called Thomas Bowery

199
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 and ten of his mates. They were English, actually, this is in the 1670s,

200
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 and they were in Bengal, and so in India at the time, lots of weed was smoked.

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 All over the shop it was called Bang B-H-A-N-G.

202
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And this guy reported, Thomas Bowery reported that it took its operation on most of us,

203
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 but merrily, save upon two of our number.

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 One of them sat himself down upon the floor and wept bitterly all afternoon.

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 The other terrified with fear did run his head into a great jar,

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 and continue in this posture four hours or more.

207
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Okay, so did he have his head in a jar then? He had his head in a jar.

208
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Oh, not his full body. I mean, it's so hard to find a jar that you can fit into these days.

209
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 The plane of jars in Laos? The plane of jars.

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 In Laos. In Laos. Laos Laos Land.

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Yeah, the country of Laos they have a big plane with loads of massive jars,

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 and no one's quite sure what they're there for, but they're probably for burial.

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Or could be for big parties getting stoned and needing somewhere to hide.

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 This was actually specified as a martyr bun jar,

215
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 which I think is a big jar from somewhere in Burma.

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Okay. Who won the fight with the pillar?

217
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Great question. So yeah, this is another guy.

218
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Definitely the pillar based on this.

219
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 So he said one of our number was quarrelsome,

220
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 and a fault with one of the wooden pillars of the porch

221
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 until he'd left himself little skin upon the knuckles of his finger.

222
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And I think the pillar remained intact. So I guess the pillar won.

223
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Is that was the jar made of glass, or was it made of... Still back on the jar.

224
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Just a second. Just a second if it made a glass.

225
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 It's not the best hiding spot. It's only...

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Do you have glass jars, do they?

227
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 I would have been a clay jar.

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 It's a pot. I think we're saying pot here.

229
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Is that why they call it pot?

230
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Here's something about cannabis that I did not know.

231
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Okay. Is that...

232
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 That is a conspiracy theory.

233
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Oh, I know.

234
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 I know. That...

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 The only reason that marijuana is illegal is because...

236
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Have you heard this down?

237
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 No.

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 It's because hemp paper was a rival to wood paper.

239
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Oh, yeah.

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 And so basically big paper got together like A3.

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Yeah, yeah, got together.

242
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And you know, tried to shut down and get it declared illegal.

243
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 It's not true.

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Can I just say your conspiracy theory is way more boring than my ones.

245
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Yeah, that's true. There were no aliens in that.

246
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 I thought it was going to be that lizards are allergic to hemp

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 and the royal family are all lizards.

248
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Kennedy was killed by a bullet of marijuana or something.

249
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 No, sorry. It's just that...

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 That's the theory. If you type in, you know...

251
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 But that's actually plausible.

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 The good thing about Andy's theory is that there is some genuine

253
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 possible substance to it.

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Exactly.

255
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Here's a thing.

256
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Legal indoor growing of marijuana uses 1% of all the electricity

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 in America.

258
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Wow.

259
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Yeah.

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Yeah.

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 It produces the equivalent in carbon dioxide of 3 million cars

262
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 in the industry.

263
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 It's huge.

264
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Wow.

265
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Yeah.

266
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 So it's bad for the environment.

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 It's bad for the environment.

268
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 The hippies are going to hate that.

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Yeah.

270
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Actually hearing that.

271
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Oh man.

272
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 But that was the thing when people were taking laughing gas in balloons.

273
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 I'm sure they still do, but it's very bad for the environment

274
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 because it's a really bad greenhouse gas.

275
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Right.

276
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Yeah.

277
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Yeah.

278
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 So it's hard to be an eco-friendly hippie these days.

279
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Heroines are right.

280
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Try heroin.

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 This week's episode of No Soft Things A Fish is sponsored by heroin.

282
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Yeah.

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 No one's got a good brand name out of it yet that we can use.

284
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 It's just still heroin.

285
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Heroine was a brand.

286
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Yeah.

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 What?

288
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Yeah.

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Heroine was owned by Bayer, the German pharmaceutical company.

290
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Oh my God.

291
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Really?

292
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 So are there other kinds of heroin that we just...

293
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 We don't know the name of.

294
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Yeah.

295
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 It's not my name.

296
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 It's basically the same, but I prefer the brand.

297
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 It's not.

298
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 There was this thing.

299
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 I wanted to put this forward because it sounds to me like it's fake,

300
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 but you guys might have read the story a while ago and known.

301
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Is it that one with a theory about hemp paper?

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Well, it's this new theory.

303
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 It is another theory that Shakespeare was a pot smoker

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 because they found in a pipe which was in the gardens

305
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 or in the area of where he lived.

306
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 They found a pipe that had traces of cannabis in it.

307
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And the suggestion is that he might have been a weed smoker.

308
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 They can't prove that it was his, but it definitely is from the time.

309
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 It's a pipe from the time on the grounds of where he lived.

310
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 So it made it to England, we're saying, by the early 1600s.

311
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Because he died in 1616.

312
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 No.

313
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Because we got it from India in the mid-1600s, really,

314
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 and hardly anyone was smoking it.

315
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 I think we might have uncovered a small hole in your theory.

316
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Yeah.

317
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 It's not, again, not my theory.

318
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 It doesn't make sense if you consider that Shakespeare's plays were all written

319
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 by Samuel Johnson, who lived about 150 years later.

320
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 It must be that.

321
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 It would grow in these kind of climates.

322
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Yeah.

323
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 So, and I think there were Germanic tribes who were using it.

324
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 So theoretically, it could have been around possibly,

325
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 even though there's no evidence that we used it.

326
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Yeah.

327
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 It's very, very unlikely, but he may have been the one person in his country.

328
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 He was getting stunned.

329
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 But that explains why he was such a genius out of his time, right?

330
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 So true.

331
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Yeah.

332
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Can we go back to the jars?

333
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Oh, Jesus.

334
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Thank you, James.

335
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 In 1749, there were efforts all over London

336
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 that you could go and watch a man getting into a jar,

337
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 getting into a quart bottle, actually.

338
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 So a quart bottle's pretty small.

339
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 That's tiny.

340
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Yeah, it's really small.

341
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Well, compared to a man.

342
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Surely it depends on how big the neck is.

343
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Well, which neck?

344
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 It depends if his neck will fit in the neck.

345
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 No, this was a bet between the Duke of Portland

346
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 and the Earl of Chesterfield that they were discussing

347
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 the gullibility of the British public.

348
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And one of them bet the other that if I put signs up saying,

349
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 "A man can climb into a four quart bottle,

350
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 then I bet people will go and see it."

351
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 And the other guy goes, "No, people aren't that stupid."

352
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Anyway, people were that stupid.

353
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And they turned up and they waited for about half an hour

354
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 until it became obvious that this guy and his bottle

355
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 were not going to turn up.

356
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 And then they trashed the place.

357
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 General chaos broke out.

358
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 They ripped up the theatre, threw seats and benches everywhere.

359
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And three pillars had to be hospitalised.

360
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Everything carried a bull was hauled outside

361
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 and thrown into a bonfire.

362
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 People abandoned their hats and wigs in the panic.

363
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Oh, wow!

364
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 The abandoned wig!

365
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 And then people tried to guess who it was.

366
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 No one knew, and it was only about four or five years later

367
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 that the Earl of Chesterfield and the Duke of Portland

368
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 messed up.

369
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 I would absolutely go along to the show.

370
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 I'm with the public eyes on it.

371
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Someone said, "This theatre on this day has been booked."

372
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I would think that's legit.

373
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Up in Covent Garden where they have all the street performers,

374
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 I saw a man, my size, get into a briefcase.

375
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 How big was the briefcase, though?

376
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 It was just like, it was a slightly bigger briefcase,

377
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 but it wasn't quite a suitcase.

378
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 So he just opened it up.

379
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And he did this whole thing.

380
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I'm going to fit myself in this briefcase, and he did.

381
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 He just disappeared.

382
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And then he picked it up from the inside.

383
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 He made his way to the tube.

384
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Wouldn't that be great when you get to a meeting?

385
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Could you put your briefcase on the table?

386
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Have you met my chief strategist?

387
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 So I have one last thing about cannabis.

388
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Which is that in 2008, there was a Japanese customs officer

389
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 who was training his sniffer dog,

390
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 and he planted a pack of cannabis resin

391
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 in a dummy bag.

392
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 A previously agreed dummy bag.

393
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 He decided to give his dog a bit of an extra challenge

394
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 and planted the cannabis resin

395
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 in a random member of the public's bag.

396
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Right.

397
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Unfortunately, the dog did not find the drugs.

398
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 So that's probably because there was a guy inside that bag

399
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 who just immediately smoked it.

400
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 OK, it's time for fact number three.

401
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 That is Andy.

402
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 My factor is that glowworms go fishing with their own urine.

403
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 We've mentioned these guys before, actually.

404
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 They live in caves, and they live on the ceilings of caves,

405
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 really wet caves, and they drop lines down,

406
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 and they dangle them out of their own bodies,

407
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 and they dangle them out of their own mouths.

408
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 So scientists have been analysing the content,

409
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 and it turns out they're mostly water,

410
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 but the thing that makes them so sticky is urea,

411
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 which is one of the ingredients in urine.

412
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 So we think they're taking their early gut urine

413
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 as it's forming and stringing that out of their mouths

414
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 to make these adhesive lines.

415
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 That is disgusting.

416
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And these lines, then things get trapped in them, right?

417
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Exactly. Things get trapped in and they haul them up.

418
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 But they call them back up.

419
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Yeah. They go, "Oh my god."

420
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And then they recycle and digest it,

421
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 and then use the same line again, or the same piece of...

422
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 So all their meals taste of piss?

423
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 You know, a certain degree.

424
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Yeah, wow.

425
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 All the trip advisers refuse.

426
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 One star, taste of the piss.

427
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 No, just one thing they do.

428
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 They build a mucus tube on the ceiling of the cave,

429
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 and they shuttle backwards and forwards along it

430
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 with dozens of lines dangling down,

431
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 so they can keep loads of fishing lines on the go at the same time.

432
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Wow.

433
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 And then whenever an insect gets stuck, they haul it up.

434
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Very cool.

435
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 They look really pretty, don't they?

436
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Yeah, they look lovely.

437
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 For a thing which is vomiting its own piss and then eating it.

438
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Hey, it looks like a Christmas decoration in that cave.

439
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 I am not coming to your house for Christmas.

440
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 You're in seeping for this thing.

441
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 So they're not glowworms like the glowworms we have in Britain,

442
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 which are a type of beetle.

443
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 They're a type of nat, which people only found out relatively recently.

444
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 In Maori, the name is Titiy, which means projected over water.

445
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 When they're doing this thing with the fishing, they are larvae,

446
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 and they're like that for quite a few years.

447
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And then they become an adult,

448
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 and they're only an adult for like a day or so,

449
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 and then they mate, and then they lay the eggs,

450
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 and then they live for a larvae, for ages, and ages, and ages.

451
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And if you get too many of these nuts in a cave,

452
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 then they'll start catching each other,

453
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 and they start eating each other, and they get cannibalistic.

454
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Right, OK.

455
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 So just a few more things about the Titiy.

456
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 So quite a lot of animals seem to use projectiles as fishing rods.

457
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And I think I've seen a claim that one of them is the fastest animal in the world.

458
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Is it a cheetah?

459
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Yeah.

460
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Is it a swift?

461
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 A swift is the fastest. Is it a buffalo falling off a cliff?

462
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Is it a human in a spaceship?

463
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 All of these are strong contenders.

464
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 It really depends on your definition of fast.

465
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 So it's a frogfish, and...

466
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Well, I reckon a human in a spaceship is faster than that.

467
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Well, it depends which bit of the body you're measuring

468
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 when you're talking about speed. So this is specifically its tongue.

469
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 So a frogfish, if you can picture it, they look so weird.

470
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 They look like a weird, gnarly bit of rock with a kind of wobbly face on them.

471
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 That happens to be my wife.

472
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 I do very much.

473
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 And they have one of their dorsal fins is like super modified into this rod.

474
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 So it looks like this really long thin rod that sticks out of them,

475
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 and it has a lure at the end. So it looks like a bit of a maca at the end of it.

476
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 And when it sees a fish coming by or a crustacean or something,

477
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 then it wobbles the lure around.

478
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 So the fish thinks it's a bit of prey.

479
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And then the fish will come, and it'll try to eat it,

480
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 and the speed at which it sucks in, the prey that's landed on its lure,

481
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 is it manages to get it into its mouth, or then 0.006 seconds.

482
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 So another weird thing about them is that so fast that no other animals can see it happen.

483
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 So if you're swimming next to fish, then it's happened, then.

484
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Because the fish is swimming along, and then you may just disappear.

485
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 So that's presumably what happens.

486
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 But where's Jeff gone?

487
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 There's probably conspiracy theories in the fish world about what happens to people like Jeff.

488
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 That is incredible.

489
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 So what humans have done is that fish haven't done his developed high-speed camera.

490
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 On the fish police, probably look at that and see people speeding,

491
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 and they're like, "Ah, man, I wish we had that."

492
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 That's awesome.

493
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 You really do with one of those?

494
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Yeah.

495
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 You catch whatever wobbly-faced Chris is swallowing our names.

496
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And what so we can see it through?

497
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 So we've seen it with our high-speed cameras,

498
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 and they've checked their tongue out, and then they set these things in.

499
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Yeah, it's amazing.

500
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 That'd be such a skill if you're at a restaurant with someone,

501
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 and that's something on the plate that you want to see.

502
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 It just happened to my food.

503
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 It turns to be the manager.

504
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Good meal, good meal.

505
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 All right, nice to see you. Thanks a lot.

506
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Oh, yeah, nice to see you.

507
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 What, that is incredible.

508
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 That is super fun to me.

509
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And also, they can suck stuff in that's bigger than their own bodies.

510
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Okay, I think that it's a bit obvious when you're the shape of Jeff.

511
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Where Jeff comes from.

512
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 The way one of them does it is by opening their mouth to 12 times its original size.

513
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 So it expands its mouth to 12 times as wide as it was.

514
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 And then that creates this suction in the water that pulls the brain.

515
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Oh, they then wow.

516
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Still themselves.

517
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Or are they then another animal completely?

518
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Because they've got a mass of fish in them.

519
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 I think the thing is the thing that still alive.

520
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Because they say that humans have got like 50% bacterial cells.

521
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 So we're almost more bacterial than human.

522
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Now, if you've eaten a fish which is bigger than you,

523
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 then are you actually more fish than human?

524
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Well, this is what they discuss a lot in fish philosophy school.

525
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 When the police give them a break.

526
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 There are salamanders which secrete glue through their skins.

527
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 And then when snakes can't get anywhere.

528
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 It's called the extinct.

529
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 No, it's called, there's one called Batra Coseps, a tenuatus.

530
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And it is accretes from its skin a glue which sticks a snake to itself

531
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 and glues the snake's jaws shut, but doesn't stick to the salamander.

532
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 What?

533
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 So the snake is all glued up next to itself on its own coils

534
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 and its mouth is all glued shut.

535
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 That's terrible.

536
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 And not the salamander.

537
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 No, fantastic for the salamander.

538
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Yeah, obviously.

539
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 You're in.

540
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Yeah.

541
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Yeah.

542
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Monkeys wash themselves with it.

543
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 They've just found out in a new study.

544
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Do they?

545
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Yep, to attract mates.

546
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 So it's male and female monkeys.

547
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 We think of several species.

548
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 They weigh into their hands and then they rub it all over themselves

549
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 like it's shower jealous.

550
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 What is it with animals?

551
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 They're just animals just love pets, don't they?

552
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Yeah, they do.

553
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 They really do.

554
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Loads of them.

555
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Like literally every single time you google animal urine.

556
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 It's always they do this to attract mates.

557
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Yeah, but maybe we've got the wrong attitude.

558
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Maybe, I mean, how many of you have given a chance to your own urine on your body?

559
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 No, well, no, I haven't.

560
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 I haven't.

561
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 No, not on purpose, certainly.

562
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 I can think of a world leader or two who might have done that.

563
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 No, because obviously throughout history, urine's been used as mouthwash.

564
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 I think we've mentioned in the past.

565
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 We've used it for all sorts of medication.

566
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 In battle, Henry VIII, I think his soldiers always wash their wounds in urine.

567
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 So you're saying really that we're unusual, not only in animal world, but also in time.

568
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 This is a very, very unusual part of history when people aren't dousing themselves in urine.

569
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Yeah.

570
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 It's cherished, isn't it?

571
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 It's a really good point.

572
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Robert Boyle, who's often said to be the father of chemistry,

573
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 urine was very much a part of his ideas of medication.

574
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 So he used to say that every morning you should drink a moderate draft of your own urine.

575
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And while it's still warm, warm urine.

576
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Very important, not to let it cool down, that'd be disgusting.

577
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Well, it's the difference.

578
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 If you don't like red wine, have a go at mold wine, because it's very nice.

579
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Even if you don't like red wine, and I imagine that's what hot urine is like.

580
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 So are you saying you should put some cloves into your urine before you drink it?

581
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 I'm just saying heating up urine might take that sort of edge off what was stopping you from drinking the cold version.

582
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Well, I've not come into your place for Christmas.

583
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 And they just mean you.

584
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Just like every year.

585
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 So there is a fantastic article by Guy called Richard Sugg on the Guardian,

586
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 which just lists some of the medieval uses of urine.

587
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Yeah, it's so good. I did read that one as well.

588
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Okay, I haven't read this, so let's...

589
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Yeah, all right.

590
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Well, here we go.

591
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 In 1550, the Italian doctor Leonardo Fioraventi saw a man's nose sliced off in an argument

592
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 and promptly urinated on the fallen organ before stitching it back on.

593
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Wow.

594
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 That was to keep germs at bay and stuff.

595
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 I guess so, yeah.

596
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Yeah.

597
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 They used to say women should gargle urine or drink warm urine to deal with a sore throat,

598
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 which might well work.

599
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 I suppose warm liquids are quite soothing.

600
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Yes, but don't do it with cold urine.

601
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Never do anything with cold urine.

602
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I think that's what we've established today.

603
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 He, Richard Sugg, in this article, he also mentions that there was a pioneering French surgeon, Ambrose Paray.

604
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Itching eyelids. If you had itching eyelids, wash your eyelids in your urine,

605
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 and make sure that the urine that has been provided has been kept all night in a barber's basin.

606
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 So there's something I guess about just getting some air and...

607
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 But why a barber's basin? Why not just any old, like, jar or...?

608
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Well, because someone might put their head in that jar and drown if they've got plans to keep it in their forearms.

609
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And there was no one has ever put their head in a barber's basin.

610
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 This is the only basin people routinely plan to have to do.

611
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Apart from dabbing this B-day.

612
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 A barber's basin has that gateway in it where the urine would spill out.

613
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 We know where you lie your neck down.

614
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 So, actually, wouldn't be up the whole nitty as much urine as a conventional basin.

615
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 What? Which bit?

616
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 You know when you go to a barber and you lie your head back.

617
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 That's a modern barber's basin.

618
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 James and I have spoken about this before. People used to face downwards over a basin,

619
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 which was just like a mini bath or a kitchen sink.

620
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Because it's easier to get your eyelids into the barber's basin into the urine.

621
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 I just want to say that I am so skeptical.

622
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Because, James, you have made the good point that urine was everywhere throughout time in all animals.

623
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 If you read literature from any period fiction,

624
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 it's never mentioned that people were washing in urine, that people were drinking urine.

625
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 I've never seen it in Dickens. It never comes up in Shakespeare.

626
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 But you're not going to have Shakespeare is not going to write a sonnet about bathing your richy eyes in urine, is he?

627
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 All that glitters is not gold. He did write that, though.

628
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Maybe that was about me.

629
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 There are fish. In fact, a lot of fish, they'll go around and they'll urinate at each other.

630
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 And the way that they found out that it's two sand signals is they got two fish

631
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 and they put them in some water and they put a divider between them so they could see each other.

632
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 But the water was separate. And then they put a die inside the fish, which made the urine turn purple.

633
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 You know, like that thing that doesn't exist in swimming pools?

634
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Yeah, that they say that they scare you with.

635
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 They put the fish in the tank and they would urinate at each other.

636
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 But then they couldn't detect it because of this wall.

637
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And so what happened was they would think there was something wrong and they just peed more and more and more.

638
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 And they ended up with tons of pee because they're trying to get their point across to the other guy.

639
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 They're not hearing anything back from him so they just pee even more.

640
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 And that's to prove that it's like a signalling thing.

641
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Yeah, okay.

642
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Oh, wow.

643
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 But we don't know what the point is that they're trying to get across.

644
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 It's just a point. They're trying to make a point.

645
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 It's true. We can't speak fish urine.

646
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Yeah.

647
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 A big wave of the sentence was,

648
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 "I think there's something wrong with my weed."

649
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 "It's a little weird to you."

650
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 I don't think it's meant to be that colour.

651
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 I thought this was a myth about it.

652
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

653
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 And that is my fact.

654
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 My fact this week is that according to the endangered language alliance,

655
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 more languages are spoken in Queens, New York than anywhere else in the world.

656
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Wow. That's incredible.

657
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Dense area on our planet of spoken languages is Queens, New York.

658
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And they put it as around as many as 800 languages that are spoken.

659
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 And a lot of the languages are languages that are no longer even spoken

660
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 in the place where they originated from.

661
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 They're now just purely in New York, which is insane.

662
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Yeah.

663
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 They've gone there to die, basically.

664
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 It's normally, you know, people get a Florida strike.

665
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 There are a couple that are only spoken by one person there, aren't they?

666
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Yeah, exactly.

667
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Did you read about the guy, Mr. Hussain, I think, who's 67,

668
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 and he speaks Mamoujou, which is an Austronesian language,

669
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 so he grew up in Indonesia.

670
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 And he doesn't have anyone else to speak to,

671
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 because not even his wife or children speak it.

672
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 The only time he gets to speak it is on the phone to his brother back home.

673
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 So he's the only Mamoujou speaker in New York.

674
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Yeah, it's very sad.

675
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Some people think that it's good that languages die out.

676
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Do they?

677
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Yeah, which people?

678
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Go on.

679
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Contrarians.

680
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 I can see an argument.

681
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 We get very precious about them.

682
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 Well, the argument is, and this isn't my argument, but it is an argument that is,

683
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 a lot of these languages are spoke by isolated people,

684
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 and the language is part of their isolation,

685
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 and maybe it's better for people to be less isolated rather than more isolated.

686
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 I see.

687
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 And the other argument, which is much more pervasive,

688
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 is that it's complete cultures and knowledge,

689
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 which you lose as soon as you lose a language.

690
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Yeah.

691
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Although we can write them all down now.

692
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 We can record them all.

693
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 You can put them on the internet.

694
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 That is not a language living, though.

695
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Yeah.

696
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 It's not a way of life living, you know?

697
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 No, it's not.

698
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Yeah.

699
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Don't get a call all the time soon, I know.

700
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 In 2001, there were 6,809 known languages.

701
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 How did you think they were around now?

702
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 They're dying out two a month.

703
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Okay.

704
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 6,200.

705
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 I'd say 6,900.

706
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 I reckon we're discovering more languages.

707
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Yeah, that's right.

708
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 There's more than 7,000.

709
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 No way.

710
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 We're finding them quicker than they're dying out at the moment.

711
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Wow.

712
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 But I can't keep going forever.

713
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 No.

714
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 At some point, we will hit the buffers.

715
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Unless there is an infinite number of languages.

716
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Okay.

717
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 So you were right, Andy.

718
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Thank you.

719
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 That's all I need.

720
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Or unless we start creating new ones.

721
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Yes.

722
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Because there's a new, for instance, a new language in Australia, which is called light wallpury.

723
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 So it was related to wallpury.

724
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 But it's just been identified as a new language.

725
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 It's in this really isolated village of 700 people in the Northern Territory.

726
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Is it light as in like, marble light?

727
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 I think it is sort of light.

728
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 No, it's not even half a year old.

729
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 20% fewer consonants or something.

730
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Exactly.

731
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 But yeah, 350 people speak it as their native tongue.

732
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And this is just a completely new language.

733
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 Wow.

734
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Based on other languages, but now classified as new.

735
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Wow.

736
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 So we've just got to keep replacing them as fast as we lose them.

737
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 I'd really like this.

738
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 This is a fact from the endangered language alliance.

739
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Yeah.

740
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Who record and identify languages which are dying out.

741
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 There's a language from Gabon called Mahungway.

742
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 And it has a word, Manono, which means I like when you say it softly.

743
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 And I don't like when the first syllable is slightly sharper in tone.

744
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 That's like saying, fine.

745
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Fine.

746
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Oh, yeah.

747
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Yeah.

748
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 The entire language is based on sarcasm, basically.

749
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 I just think it's brilliant.

750
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 This group that you've just mentioned, the endangered language alliance,

751
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 they say that when you get the subway in America,

752
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 if you were going from Queens to Manhattan, every stop along the way,

753
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 you'll notice when they're saying things like the equivalent of mind the gap.

754
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 They'll have English, but they'll have like six translations underneath it.

755
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 And then maybe five.

756
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 And then maybe two as you get closer into Manhattan.

757
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 So the amount of density of language speakers there is enough that they're altering enough for multiple translations.

758
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 They really should have mind the gap in 800 different languages, shouldn't they?

759
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 Yes.

760
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Otherwise, there's going to be accidents.

761
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 Yeah, well, this is why we're losing.

762
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 This is why we're losing.

763
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Another language has gone extinct because...

764
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 Well, through the gap.

765
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 I read about a juggernaut in the world of linguistics and his passing.

766
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 He passed in early January, very sad.

767
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 14th of January this year.

768
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 And it was a man called Zhao Yogguang.

769
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 His birth name was Zhao Yao Ping.

770
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Not heard of him?

771
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 No.

772
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 He is the father of Pinyin, which is what's taken China into a whole new world of written language

773
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 because it took the Chinese language and he applied Romanization to it.

774
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 And so we can now use our alphabet to write Chinese words.

775
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 And he only passed away this January.

776
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 He was 111 years old.

777
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 Wow.

778
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 Yeah.

779
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 He lived in New York for a while.

780
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 I'm just trying to track down if it was Queens.

781
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 I'm not sure.

782
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 But it might have been Queens.

783
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 He met Albert Einstein there.

784
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 And he became a sort of outspoken character later in his life.

785
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 He wrote ten books after turning 100.

786
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 And most of which were banned because he was saying really constantly,

787
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 he was saying really controversial things about the Chinese government.

788
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 And when they asked him why you're doing this,

789
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 he was like, they sent some books.

790
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 Yes.

791
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 You can't write that.

792
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Yeah, and he was like, I'm over 100.

793
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 What have I got to lose?

794
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 I'm going to say what I'm going to say.

795
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 Wow.

796
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 But yeah, he absolutely transformed the Chinese language.

797
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 When he did that, it was under Zhao Unlei, who was underneath Chairman Mao.

798
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 He was his number two or whatever.

799
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Mao hated it.

800
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Mao hated the idea that they were bringing westernization into China.

801
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 So they banished him away.

802
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 And he basically spent a lot of the cultural revolution working as a scarecrow.

803
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 His job was literally to scarecrow his away in the fields from all the fields.

804
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 No way.

805
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 Yes, it's a real curious.

806
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 He was obsessed with curiosity, obsessed with knowledge.

807
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Wow.

808
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Real QI fish kind of guy.

809
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 Yeah.

810
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 And he only passed away this year at 111 in one day.

811
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 Wow.

812
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 I like the Sentinelese language.

813
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 I think we've talked about the Sentinelese people before,

814
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 who are a totally isolated group of people who live in the Anderman,

815
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 Nicobar Islands in India.

816
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 And because they're isolated and they're so aggressive,

817
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 so they really hate outsiders.

818
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 So whenever we've tried to penetrate their culture, then they attack us.

819
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 Oh, so they know what we're like.

820
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 They know what we're like.

821
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 I don't know how they've got this information.

822
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Mao, what we're trying to do is penetrate their culture.

823
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 Very unnecessarily violent word I use, wasn't it?

824
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 Yeah.

825
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 So we have no idea what their language is like.

826
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 If you look up the language on what you see.

827
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 We only know the word for fuck off.

828
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Which is one word in there.

829
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 Unless you say it softly.

830
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Please come in.

831
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 They were actually saying and we just liked it.

832
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 So one of the things that could be related to is the Andermanese kind of language,

833
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 which is spoken very nearby.

834
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 And that has all of its nouns that are based on body parts.

835
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 So every noun is related to what body part it resembles or what body part you touch it with.

836
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 What?

837
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Do you have examples?

838
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 It has a, so I think let's say you're talking about a floor, then it would have a prefix,

839
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 which means like foot something, or maybe food would always be mouth something.

840
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 Right.

841
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 I think that makes a lot of sense.

842
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 No, look what he's started out.

843
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 I do.

844
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 Don't you think most things around us are we use with bits of our body.

845
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 I mean, my wife, we were talking the other night.

846
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 We realized we didn't know what you know with the bathrooms when you have the B-Day thing.

847
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 Is it called the B-Day?

848
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 You mean the As Bowl?

849
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 The B-Day.

850
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 So is it an As Bowl?

851
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 Is that what it is?

852
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Well, it's an everything bowl, isn't it?

853
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 I just didn't know it was for men.

854
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 I thought it was for women.

855
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 It's a region bowl.

856
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 I mean, you're allowed to put whatever you want in it, but it is mostly for bums.

857
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 Okay.

858
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 Have you got one of these things?

859
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 You didn't know what it was for?

860
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 No, no, no.

861
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 We saw a picture while they were lying with it.

862
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 We saw it in chatting about it.

863
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 We saw it in chatting about it.

864
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 Evening's in with the shrines.

865
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 I was trying to think of things that like for instance a brick, what would you call that?

866
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 What body part would that go with it?

867
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 It's called a brick.

868
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000

 A brick.

883
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 What about a worm?

884
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 It's going to be things they resemble as well.
