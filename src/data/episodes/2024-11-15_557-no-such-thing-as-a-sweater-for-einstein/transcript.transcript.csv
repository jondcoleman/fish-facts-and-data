00:00:10,00:00:15,">> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:15,00:00:20,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Manchester.
00:00:20,00:00:24,>> [APPLAUSE]
00:00:24,00:00:28,">> My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:28,00:00:31,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:31,00:00:35,"Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:35,00:00:41,"from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:41,00:00:44,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:44,00:00:49,">> Okay, my fact this week is that for Einstein's 70th birthday,"
00:00:49,00:00:55,mathematician Kurt Girdle gave him a sweater and a paper which proved time travel.
00:00:55,00:00:57,">> Whoa, whoa."
00:00:57,00:01:02,>> But he didn't give him the ability to go back to his 60th birthday.
00:01:02,00:01:04,">> No, I know what you're all thinking,"
00:01:04,00:01:08,"bit dodgy, I would not certain that he did give him the sweater."
00:01:08,00:01:10,">> Okay, brilliant."
00:01:10,00:01:11,>> A lot of places say that he did.
00:01:11,00:01:16,Some places say that his wife Adele knitted it and he never gave it to him.
00:01:16,00:01:18,But I'm gonna say that.
00:01:18,00:01:19,>> Why would he have never given it?
00:01:19,00:01:23,"Isn't that an embarrassing thing where you think it might be awkward, he won't like it?"
00:01:23,00:01:28,">> Yeah, she backed out apparently and they gave an etching in its place."
00:01:28,00:01:29,>> Whose wife then?
00:01:29,00:01:29,Einstein's wife.
00:01:29,00:01:31,>> Girdle's wife.
00:01:31,00:01:32,">> Girdle, okay, okay, okay."
00:01:32,00:01:33,>> So I should say who Girdle is.
00:01:33,00:01:34,>> Yeah.
00:01:34,00:01:35,>> Does everyone knows who Girdle is?
00:01:35,00:01:38,">> Girdle, it does sound like an item of clothing, a Kurt Girdle."
00:01:38,00:01:42,"That would be a good thing to give someone for a present, like a sort of."
00:01:42,00:01:43,>> A sexy present.
00:01:43,00:01:44,">> A sexy, yeah."
00:01:44,00:01:48,">> You probably wouldn't give Einstein a Kurt Girdle for his birthday, not a 70th."
00:01:48,00:01:48,I'm sorry.
00:01:48,00:01:54,">> Girdle was a mathematician, German, early 20th century."
00:01:54,00:01:57,"He loved his logic, and I'm talking mathematical logic."
00:01:57,00:02:00,"So it's very complicated, weird stuff."
00:02:00,00:02:05,But he basically just liked disproving stuff and kind of finding holes in things
00:02:05,00:02:07,using his logical skills.
00:02:07,00:02:09,And this was one of the things he basically.
00:02:09,00:02:10,">> Yeah, why does he appeal to you?"
00:02:10,00:02:11,So strange.
00:02:11,00:02:13,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:13,00:02:15,>> He sounds amazing though.
00:02:15,00:02:16,">> Yeah, he is."
00:02:16,00:02:20,>> He was in a sort of archetypal obsessive genius.
00:02:20,00:02:21,">> Yeah. >> So for example,"
00:02:21,00:02:25,"here's an example, he used an alarm clock, but to help him to go to bed."
00:02:25,00:02:27,">> Okay, go on."
00:02:27,00:02:31,>> I think because he was so deep in his work that he needed to set an alarm clock.
00:02:31,00:02:33,"And then it went off, he was like, I must go to sleep."
00:02:33,00:02:34,"It's one in the morning again, I've been doing maths."
00:02:34,00:02:37,>> That's kind of nutty professor stuff.
00:02:37,00:02:38,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:02:38,00:02:41,>> So I should just explain his proof of time travel.
00:02:41,00:02:44,">> Just quickly, if you will, just 30 seconds."
00:02:44,00:02:48,">> Well, this was because Einstein had just come up with his theories and"
00:02:48,00:02:52,he was going into it and using his logic to see what could and could not be true.
00:02:52,00:02:56,"And he came up with this idea of you fly your rocket really, really, really,"
00:02:56,00:02:59,really fast and you're going a great big curve.
00:02:59,00:03:03,"And because the universe is rotating and because light isn't going parallel,"
00:03:03,00:03:05,it helps you to go back in time.
00:03:05,00:03:08,"It's the real basics, I know I missed out lots of steps there."
00:03:08,00:03:13,But the main problem with it is that the universe is not rotating.
00:03:13,00:03:15,">> Right, yes."
00:03:15,00:03:18,>> So that means that all of his theory is completely up the swanee.
00:03:18,00:03:22,And it's really sad because he said this to Einstein.
00:03:22,00:03:24,And Einstein lived for another five or six years.
00:03:24,00:03:27,"And Goethe used to message him every now and then, or ring him every now and"
00:03:27,00:03:31,"then, and say, have they found out that my thing's true yet?"
00:03:31,00:03:32,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:03:32,00:03:35,">> But surely if we simply got the universe to start spinning,"
00:03:35,00:03:36,we could get this going.
00:03:36,00:03:37,>> Sure.
00:03:37,00:03:38,">> Yeah, it's worth trying, right?"
00:03:38,00:03:41,">> I'm just saying, if he said as well, if he proved it,"
00:03:41,00:03:45,"if he proved time travel existed, then what he was really proving was time didn't"
00:03:45,00:03:46,exist.
00:03:46,00:03:49,">> Yes, it's basically kind of, which is sort of what Einstein had done already,"
00:03:49,00:03:49,right?
00:03:49,00:03:53,So general relativity had said time is sort of like the same as space.
00:03:53,00:03:56,And it probably curves around on itself.
00:03:56,00:04:01,"Again, this is really for toddlers, none of this is true."
00:04:01,00:04:05,"But the time, the time job I did was that you could skip from one bit to another."
00:04:05,00:04:08,But the crucial thing was that God was proving you could go back in time.
00:04:08,00:04:12,"Because Einstein obviously had already said, you can go forward in time"
00:04:12,00:04:14,faster than we already do.
00:04:14,00:04:18,"That's the idea in all those sci-fi films where if you go out into very,"
00:04:18,00:04:21,"very distant space, you can come back to Earth and you haven't aged at all."
00:04:21,00:04:24,But your daughter is older than you are now.
00:04:24,00:04:27,"That thing, that's completely uncontroversial and would happen."
00:04:27,00:04:28,Everyone knew that.
00:04:28,00:04:30,But that's not useful for people because they want to go back and
00:04:30,00:04:32,visit people who have died.
00:04:32,00:04:35,"And so yeah, he said this, and it upset people, didn't it?"
00:04:35,00:04:39,"When he said that time travel could exist, to the extent that Stephen Hawking,"
00:04:39,00:04:44,"amazing scientist number three, said this presents too many paradoxes."
00:04:44,00:04:49,"And crucially, the paradox that says, if you can go back in time,"
00:04:49,00:04:52,"you could go back, murder your former self."
00:04:52,00:04:55,But then you wouldn't exist to go back in time to murder yourself.
00:04:55,00:04:58,"You know that the classic sci-fi, the grandfather."
00:04:58,00:05:00,">> All the people who have done that, they've already gone."
00:05:00,00:05:01,>> Yeah. >> Because they did go back and
00:05:01,00:05:02,"murder themselves, it's fine."
00:05:02,00:05:04,>> [LAUGH] >> But they weren't there to know.
00:05:04,00:05:06,">> What in all Hawking, no."
00:05:06,00:05:07,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:07,00:05:10,">> Here's some time travel paradoxes, seeing as we're on the subject."
00:05:10,00:05:12,>> Yeah. >> What do you think the bootstrap paradox is?
00:05:12,00:05:17,>> So sort of pulling yourself up by your bootstrap is the phrase.
00:05:17,00:05:20,>> But you go back and you tell yourself about the horse.
00:05:20,00:05:24,You win money on a bet and you become very rich.
00:05:24,00:05:26,">> That's the back to the future paradox, yeah."
00:05:26,00:05:27,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:27,00:05:29,">> Well, it's officially known as the bootstrap paradox."
00:05:29,00:05:30,>> Okay.
00:05:30,00:05:34,>> And the idea is that it can't be true because things would just come out of
00:05:34,00:05:39,"nowhere, like as in, I would go back in time, tell myself how to invent fidget"
00:05:39,00:05:42,"spinners and they'd come out of nowhere, but that didn't happen."
00:05:42,00:05:44,"I mean, we can see- >> Is that what you would do, James?"
00:05:44,00:05:45,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:45,00:05:47,>> That is so tragic.
00:05:47,00:05:48,>> That is so tragic.
00:05:48,00:05:51,">> I did spend about half an hour trying to think, what would I do?"
00:05:51,00:05:51,>> Yeah.
00:05:51,00:05:55,">> It's amazing, it's amazingly hard to think of fidget spinners now."
00:05:55,00:05:55,Do you know what I mean?
00:05:55,00:05:57,Does anyone here still use a fidget spinner regularly?
00:05:57,00:05:58,>> Yeah.
00:05:58,00:05:59,>> Right. >> Okay.
00:05:59,00:06:02,>> What do you mean it's hard to think of them now?
00:06:02,00:06:05,">> Well, there was such a big thing six years ago."
00:06:05,00:06:05,>> Yeah.
00:06:05,00:06:08,>> And it's hard to remember now that every-
00:06:08,00:06:10,">> Quite a lot has happened since then, hasn't it really?"
00:06:10,00:06:11,">> Yeah, I suppose."
00:06:11,00:06:15,>> It feels like the whole world's got a bit more complicated since fidget spinners.
00:06:15,00:06:18,>> Do you think that's when the world set in as when we all put them back in the draw?
00:06:18,00:06:18,>> Yeah.
00:06:18,00:06:21,>> That was a distraction from the time travelers of the future.
00:06:21,00:06:23,They gave us the fidget spinners.
00:06:23,00:06:23,>> We didn't notice.
00:06:23,00:06:26,>> Trump is just a- >> That's it.
00:06:26,00:06:28,>> Can I mention a few things about Girdle?
00:06:28,00:06:29,>> Yeah.
00:06:29,00:06:31,>> I have no idea what you guys are talking about on stage.
00:06:31,00:06:32,>> [LAUGH]
00:06:32,00:06:36,">> So, a fascinating character, clearly, as we're saying."
00:06:36,00:06:40,He arrived in Princeton while Albert Einstein was there.
00:06:40,00:06:41,And Einstein loved him.
00:06:41,00:06:42,He loved him so much.
00:06:42,00:06:46,And he used to walk to work just so that he could walk with Girdle.
00:06:46,00:06:50,And he would do his stuff there and then go home so he could walk home with him.
00:06:50,00:06:51,It was this amazing pairing.
00:06:51,00:06:55,And people used to just be amazed if they had any contact with Girdle.
00:06:55,00:06:58,There's a story of someone saying that they were in a supermarket one time.
00:06:58,00:07:02,"And they found the philosopher, Richard Rorty, standing in a total daze."
00:07:02,00:07:04,"And they were like, okay, what's going on?"
00:07:04,00:07:09,And he said in a whispered tone that he'd just seen Girdle in the frozen food aisle.
00:07:09,00:07:10,>> Really?
00:07:10,00:07:13,>> Just so starstruck to see this genius.
00:07:13,00:07:15,">> That's interesting because towards the end of his life,"
00:07:15,00:07:17,his diet really changed.
00:07:17,00:07:21,"And he would only eat butter, baby food and laxatives."
00:07:21,00:07:23,>> He had a really tragic end to his life.
00:07:23,00:07:24,"He thought he was being poisoned, didn't he?"
00:07:24,00:07:29,And so he didn't eat to kind of defeat the people who he thought were poisoning him.
00:07:29,00:07:30,But that meant he couldn't starve.
00:07:30,00:07:32,">> Well, it was his life, Adele."
00:07:32,00:07:35,He would have her taste everything that he ate.
00:07:35,00:07:36,">> Oh, really?"
00:07:36,00:07:37,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:07:37,00:07:41,">> But yeah, he made Adele cook for him because the sweeter version is that he made"
00:07:41,00:07:45,Adele cook for him because she was the only person he could ever trust.
00:07:45,00:07:49,"And then when she got sick and went into hospital in the late '70s,"
00:07:49,00:07:53,"was the early '80s, then he did diet because he couldn't eat anything else."
00:07:53,00:07:55,">> And he was very, very troubled."
00:07:55,00:07:58,"I mean, it's not worth being an amazing mathematician because you are gonna be troubled."
00:07:58,00:08:00,>> Can I tell you guys about his time as a spy?
00:08:00,00:08:02,"I don't need to tell you this, this is amazing."
00:08:02,00:08:07,"Okay, so he grew up in Vienna, left for Princeton in 1940, right?"
00:08:07,00:08:12,There was a Viennese physicist called Hans Thurding who wanted to warn the US
00:08:12,00:08:17,government and the US president about the risk of the Nazis developing a nuclear bomb.
00:08:17,00:08:19,So Hans Thurding wanted to contact Einstein to pass the message on.
00:08:19,00:08:23,There's no way of contacting him from Vienna without the Nazis reading the
00:08:23,00:08:26,"message, intercepting the call, bugging him, whatever, can't be done."
00:08:26,00:08:30,"So he thought, Girdel, Girdel is going to Princeton."
00:08:30,00:08:32,"Okay, so I'll give him the task of warning Einstein, he is the message."
00:08:32,00:08:36,"Girdel then gets trapped in this nightmare of bureaucracy, he can't go."
00:08:36,00:08:40,"He has to apply for a visa, then the US consulate is sort of swamped,"
00:08:40,00:08:43,"the Nazi bureaucracy, he then is declared fit to serve in the German army."
00:08:43,00:08:44,"Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare, nightmare."
00:08:44,00:08:48,He can't get out of Vienna and get to Princeton and tell Einstein.
00:08:48,00:08:54,"Eventually he got out, he went to the USA through Moscow, Vlad Vostok, Japan,"
00:08:54,00:08:59,"San Francisco, all the way across America to Princeton, took him two months."
00:08:59,00:09:03,"And then when he got to Einstein, he just said, oh, Hans Thurding says hello, by the way."
00:09:03,00:09:07,>> [LAUGH]
00:09:07,00:09:10,>> Slightly forgot to pass on the message about the Nazis developing a nuclear bomb.
00:09:10,00:09:12,>> My God. >> So many stories where he
00:09:12,00:09:18,"seemed such a liability in that kind of respect, so when he was in America,"
00:09:18,00:09:22,"he got the chance to sit the citizen test, and he started reading the Constitution."
00:09:22,00:09:26,"And he worked out that the Constitution, the way it was worded in America,"
00:09:26,00:09:29,legally meant that it was possible for someone to become a dictator and
00:09:29,00:09:31,set up a fascist regime.
00:09:31,00:09:34,">> No, definitely not possible, I don't think, really don't think that's possible."
00:09:34,00:09:35,>> When does this show go out?
00:09:35,00:09:39,We're recording it in late October.
00:09:39,00:09:43,>> So he basically was heading towards going to do his oath.
00:09:43,00:09:46,"And Einstein went with him because he was like, I know you're gonna cock this up."
00:09:46,00:09:50,"So they arrive, but then the judge who is presiding over the whole thing sees"
00:09:50,00:09:54,"Einstein and goes, my God, please, gentlemen, come up to my room."
00:09:54,00:09:57,"And so they go up and they sit with him, and Einstein's freaking out."
00:09:57,00:10:03,"Goedl's having a chat, and the judge says that Germany was under an evil dictatorship."
00:10:03,00:10:05,"Fortunately, that's not possible in America."
00:10:05,00:10:10,"On the contrary, says Goedl, and starts to explain what he found."
00:10:10,00:10:15,"And the judge at Einstein just went, and he took the oath and got it."
00:10:15,00:10:17,">> But yeah, he really, what a liability."
00:10:17,00:10:21,">> And that was the classic sort of wanting to use logic to prove things, right?"
00:10:21,00:10:26,So he also used logic to prove that God existed.
00:10:26,00:10:29,"But he wouldn't publish it because he thought that if he did,"
00:10:29,00:10:32,then people would think that he thought God existed.
00:10:32,00:10:36,"But actually, it was just a mathematical bit of fun that he was doing."
00:10:36,00:10:37,>> Right.
00:10:37,00:10:38,>> Was it a bit of fun?
00:10:38,00:10:41,I don't know if bit of fun was one of the top elements of his character.
00:10:41,00:10:43,"I have to say, Goedl."
00:10:43,00:10:44,">> Well, for him, maths was fun."
00:10:44,00:10:45,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:10:45,00:10:47,">> I don't think it, well, I disagree."
00:10:47,00:10:49,I think he was a very sad person.
00:10:49,00:10:53,"But I do think he might have had, the one join his life might have been Adele,"
00:10:53,00:10:55,"who was such an interesting person to marry, right?"
00:10:55,00:10:57,Because she was a dancer.
00:10:57,00:11:00,She'd been a dancer in a cabaret club called The Moth in Vienna.
00:11:00,00:11:03,She was not well educated.
00:11:03,00:11:05,>> I just like the idea of a night club called The Moth.
00:11:05,00:11:10,">> Yeah, because all the dancers just constantly pass her away at the center."
00:11:10,00:11:12,>> [LAUGH]
00:11:12,00:11:14,">> That was what it was, and she got very concussed."
00:11:14,00:11:16,And that's why she married this weirdo.
00:11:16,00:11:18,She was a foot care specialist.
00:11:18,00:11:21,Just what a strange person for him to marry.
00:11:21,00:11:23,And she really protected him.
00:11:23,00:11:25,"He was quite dappy, as Dan says."
00:11:25,00:11:28,"He was a bit, didn't quite know the right way to behave socially a lot of the time."
00:11:28,00:11:31,"And at one point when he was living in Vienna,"
00:11:31,00:11:35,"he was mistaken for a Jewish person at a time when anti-Semitism, of course,"
00:11:35,00:11:39,"was incredibly rife, and he was attacked and beaten up by Nazi thugs."
00:11:39,00:11:40,And she beat them off with her umbrella.
00:11:40,00:11:41,>> Wow. >> Really?
00:11:41,00:11:42,>> Yeah. >> That's very cool.
00:11:42,00:11:44,"He hated chatting with people, right?"
00:11:44,00:11:45,"Like, that was part of that character."
00:11:45,00:11:47,"When he really wanted to avoid someone,"
00:11:47,00:11:50,"he would schedule a rendezvous at a precise time and place,"
00:11:50,00:11:52,and then make sure he was not there.
00:11:52,00:11:55,>> [LAUGH]
00:11:55,00:11:56,>> That's tremendous.
00:11:56,00:11:58,">> Yeah, we gotta move on in a sec, by the way."
00:11:58,00:12:02,">> He was, this is a sort of related thing about him avoiding people."
00:12:02,00:12:07,"He nearly wasn't understood at all after his death, as in all his papers."
00:12:07,00:12:11,"And it was thought that they were in code, that nobody could understand."
00:12:11,00:12:16,"And it actually, it turned out, it was a thing called Gabelsberger's script."
00:12:16,00:12:19,And that was a special German shorthand.
00:12:19,00:12:23,"And Gerdl was almost the last, he was in the last year of people who ever"
00:12:23,00:12:26,"learned this specific kind of shorthand, nobody else knew it."
00:12:26,00:12:29,"And obviously, for decades after that, so 50 years later,"
00:12:29,00:12:33,"you just faced with these squiggles, you think, I have no idea what this is."
00:12:33,00:12:36,And he was in the very last class way back in the 20s to learn it.
00:12:36,00:12:37,>> So cool.
00:12:37,00:12:40,">> One more thing on time travel, maybe."
00:12:40,00:12:44,"So back to the future we mentioned earlier, and back to the future three."
00:12:44,00:12:48,"I believe, how do they get to 88 miles an hour?"
00:12:48,00:12:49,>> It's on a train.
00:12:49,00:12:50,">> Well, they use a train to push it."
00:12:50,00:12:51,">> To push the car, yeah."
00:12:51,00:12:53,">> Well, the climactic bit, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:53,00:12:55,"So I read- >> You're on, they just used the car."
00:12:55,00:12:55,You're gone.
00:12:55,00:13:02,">> I read the, I read the user manual of the DeLorean car from back in the day."
00:13:02,00:13:07,"And it specifically says on page 35, to avoid damage to your vehicle,"
00:13:07,00:13:11,do not attempt to start the engine by pushing with another vehicle.
00:13:11,00:13:12,>> Really?
00:13:12,00:13:16,">> So they may have gone in the future, but they've lost their warranty."
00:13:16,00:13:16,>> Wait.
00:13:16,00:13:17,>> [LAUGH]
00:13:17,00:13:22,[MUSIC]
00:13:22,00:13:26,">> It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:13:26,00:13:30,"My fact this week is that the author of the international bestselling book,"
00:13:30,00:13:35,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad, which taught readers to be financially intelligent,"
00:13:35,00:13:38,is currently $1 billion in debt.
00:13:38,00:13:40,>> [LAUGH]
00:13:40,00:13:41,>> $1 billion.
00:13:41,00:13:42,>> $1 billion.
00:13:42,00:13:43,>> It's a lot.
00:13:43,00:13:46,>> It's a lot of dollars for one person to be in debt.
00:13:46,00:13:46,>> Yeah.
00:13:46,00:13:49,">> Has he ever been a rich dad, or is he?"
00:13:49,00:13:50,>> He was a rich dad.
00:13:50,00:13:53,So Robert Kiyosaki is his name.
00:13:53,00:13:59,"It was a novel narrative, basically, where he tried to use an analogy of having"
00:13:59,00:14:03,"one dad and a stepdad, one of which went down the classic road of going through"
00:14:03,00:14:04,business the normal way.
00:14:04,00:14:08,And then another one who was independently financial as a result of
00:14:08,00:14:09,the path that he'd chosen.
00:14:09,00:14:13,"And it was showing how you could go from rags to riches, basically,"
00:14:13,00:14:14,by not doing the normal thing.
00:14:14,00:14:19,"Massive seller, some numbers say it's sold as many as 40 million copies worldwide."
00:14:19,00:14:22,">> So that would be about a billion dollars, would it?"
00:14:22,00:14:23,>> Did he buy them all?
00:14:23,00:14:24,>> [LAUGH]
00:14:24,00:14:26,">> Wait, how has he done this?"
00:14:26,00:14:28,How has he ended up so indebted?
00:14:28,00:14:33,">> Well, in the article that I read about it, he says, I'm $1 billion in debt."
00:14:33,00:14:34,And I don't mind.
00:14:34,00:14:35,He's kind of fine with it.
00:14:35,00:14:37,">> It's because he doesn't have to deal with it, right?"
00:14:37,00:14:38,">> Yeah. >> As he says,"
00:14:38,00:14:39,it's the government's problem at this stage.
00:14:39,00:14:41,>> Exactly. >> It's kind of true of debt.
00:14:41,00:14:43,">> Yeah, he says he uses debt as money."
00:14:43,00:14:46,"So it doesn't work, it doesn't work for a while."
00:14:46,00:14:47,">> It does work for a while, it does."
00:14:47,00:14:48,">> It doesn't work in a shop, does it?"
00:14:48,00:14:51,">> Just put it on the tab again, at some point."
00:14:51,00:14:53,>> That's what a credit card is.
00:14:53,00:14:54,>> Yeah.
00:14:54,00:14:55,>> My God.
00:14:55,00:14:56,>> [LAUGH]
00:14:56,00:14:58,>> So this guy's just got the biggest credit card in the world.
00:14:58,00:15:03,>> He's got a $1 billion overdraft on his Sainsbury's credit card.
00:15:03,00:15:04,"It is sort of true to who he is, right?"
00:15:04,00:15:06,"Because he's sort of saying, cheat your way into financial health."
00:15:06,00:15:09,"And I really couldn't work out what I thought of him, because the book,"
00:15:09,00:15:12,he says it's nonfiction and he claims it's a very true story.
00:15:12,00:15:16,"His dad was the poor dad, his best friend's dad was the rich dad."
00:15:16,00:15:20,"And they took financial advice from the rich dad, who basically said,"
00:15:20,00:15:21,"people are idiots, poor people are idiots."
00:15:21,00:15:27,People who aren't upper class are idiots because they think that the way to get
00:15:27,00:15:30,"rich is to work really, really, really hard and save all your money."
00:15:30,00:15:31,That's bullshit.
00:15:31,00:15:33,All you've got to do is make money work for you.
00:15:33,00:15:35,That's what rich people are doing.
00:15:35,00:15:36,"And it is sort of true, right?"
00:15:36,00:15:38,Rich people get their millions and they invest them sensibly and
00:15:38,00:15:40,they get all this advice and they make loads more.
00:15:40,00:15:43,"But the thing is, this dad didn't exist."
00:15:43,00:15:45,So he made up that story.
00:15:45,00:15:45,>> What do you mean?
00:15:45,00:15:46,Which dad didn't exist?
00:15:46,00:15:49,">> The rich dad, only the poor dad exists."
00:15:49,00:15:51,And I think that might be a lesson to take away from this.
00:15:51,00:15:56,">> Yeah, he's had multiple companies that all have largely gone under."
00:15:56,00:16:02,"So in 1977, he had a company called Rippers, which were nylon and velcro wallets."
00:16:02,00:16:06,"So you get your Ripper and went bankrupt, just didn't work out."
00:16:06,00:16:08,"His rich dad, poor dad company, rich global."
00:16:08,00:16:10,>> It's funny to lose money on a wallet company.
00:16:10,00:16:15,">> That's quite, how can you screw up a wallet?"
00:16:15,00:16:18,">> He turned rich dad, poor dad, into a company."
00:16:18,00:16:21,"So it became the rich dad company, rich global, LLC."
00:16:21,00:16:24,That went bankrupt as well in 2012.
00:16:24,00:16:26,">> The other books, do you know the names of the other books?"
00:16:26,00:16:28,"He's written 26, which one do you want?"
00:16:28,00:16:29,>> Rich dad's cash flow quadrant.
00:16:29,00:16:31,">> Oh, yeah."
00:16:31,00:16:31,>> Sounds dubious.
00:16:31,00:16:36,"Rich dad's rich kid smart kid, sort of reverse it."
00:16:36,00:16:38,"Rich dad's retire, young retire rich."
00:16:38,00:16:38,>> Okay.
00:16:38,00:16:41,>> Rich dad's guide to becoming rich without cutting up your credit cards.
00:16:41,00:16:43,Rich dad's who took my money.
00:16:43,00:16:46,>> It does feel like he's just put a load of words in a hat.
00:16:46,00:16:46,">> Oh, yeah."
00:16:46,00:16:48,>> A lot of them are rich and die.
00:16:48,00:16:50,">> Yeah, it's true."
00:16:50,00:16:52,">> And then he wrote, we want you to be rich."
00:16:52,00:16:56,"Two men, one message, co-authored with Donald Trump."
00:16:56,00:16:58,>> No way!
00:16:58,00:16:58,">> Yeah, they paired up."
00:16:58,00:17:03,">> Because basically, Richard, he sounded like such an on-the-level businessman"
00:17:03,00:17:06,before you said he was in business with Donald Trump.
00:17:06,00:17:07,So how sad.
00:17:07,00:17:10,">> Yeah, no, they found each other because both their books,"
00:17:10,00:17:13,"The Art of the Deal, did massive best book ever."
00:17:13,00:17:16,And the other one was really well received as well.
00:17:16,00:17:17,So they thought let's come together.
00:17:17,00:17:19,And they wrote two books in total with each other.
00:17:19,00:17:21,>> Wow.
00:17:21,00:17:24,">> The first self-help book was called Self-Help, I think."
00:17:24,00:17:30,The idea of a self-help book is named after this book by Samuel Smiles.
00:17:30,00:17:34,And his book came out in the same year as On the Origin of the Species.
00:17:34,00:17:36,And sold a fuckload more.
00:17:36,00:17:38,>> Really?
00:17:38,00:17:41,">> And his idea was basically all you have to do is work really, really, really,"
00:17:41,00:17:43,really hard and you'll make loads of money.
00:17:43,00:17:46,"So it's kind of like, there's some advice in there, but"
00:17:46,00:17:52,it's mostly a list of really rich people who slept two hours a night.
00:17:52,00:17:53,">> Or successful people, right?"
00:17:53,00:17:54,I read it is funny.
00:17:54,00:17:58,"It's really weird because it is just, it's literally mini biography after mini"
00:17:58,00:18:00,biography after mini biography.
00:18:00,00:18:02,There's a biography of about 1000 people in there.
00:18:02,00:18:06,"You've got Galileo, Robert Peel, Prime Minister James Watt."
00:18:06,00:18:08,Everyone's successful and just what they did.
00:18:08,00:18:12,And what they did always sounds really unappealing and like they had no fun.
00:18:12,00:18:15,>> And he said that what you need to do is work hard like these people and
00:18:15,00:18:19,not have what normal people have the perverted life.
00:18:19,00:18:20,>> Right.
00:18:20,00:18:21,>> Uh-oh.
00:18:21,00:18:25,">> Was the great, great grandfather or great, great something of Bear Grills?"
00:18:25,00:18:26,">> He was, yeah."
00:18:26,00:18:26,>> Yes.
00:18:26,00:18:27,">> That's cool, yeah."
00:18:27,00:18:31,">> Samuel smiles, Bear Grills, both sentence people."
00:18:31,00:18:32,>> Yes.
00:18:32,00:18:34,">> Interesting, proof of thought."
00:18:34,00:18:37,>> What does Bear Grills mean in a sentence?
00:18:37,00:18:38,As in the right to Bear Grills.
00:18:38,00:18:43,>> [LAUGH]
00:18:43,00:18:44,>> That's right.
00:18:44,00:18:47,>> Or you have lots of grills if you're from London.
00:18:47,00:18:49,">> I got Bear Grills, yeah, yeah."
00:18:49,00:18:51,>> Self-help was so influential.
00:18:51,00:18:54,"It was one of the first ever books translated into Japanese, okay?"
00:18:54,00:18:55,>> Okay.
00:18:55,00:18:56,>> From English to Japanese.
00:18:56,00:19:00,And Japan had been a really closed society until very recently before this.
00:19:00,00:19:01,">> Yeah. >> And basically,"
00:19:01,00:19:03,that was the first book translated into Japanese.
00:19:03,00:19:07,"All the books he mentioned in self-help, this is how successful self-help was in"
00:19:07,00:19:12,"Japanese, all the books he mentions in the book then became bestsellers in Japan."
00:19:12,00:19:12,">> Yeah, right."
00:19:12,00:19:13,>> And all the books he did- >> What a hellish job for
00:19:13,00:19:15,"the publisher, so the publisher published that and"
00:19:15,00:19:18,"then went, shit, I've got to publish another thousand books so"
00:19:18,00:19:19,that everyone gets this one.
00:19:19,00:19:20,>> What are we gonna do with all the money we're making?
00:19:20,00:19:21,>> [LAUGH]
00:19:21,00:19:22,>> What are you talking about?
00:19:22,00:19:25,>> You're right.
00:19:25,00:19:26,">> Napoleon Hill, have you heard of him?"
00:19:26,00:19:28,">> Yeah, of course, yeah, Think and Grow Rich."
00:19:28,00:19:29,">> You're right, Think and Grow Rich,"
00:19:29,00:19:31,"which as far as I can tell is just a con, right?"
00:19:31,00:19:33,"It's like, if you think of something, the world will give it to you."
00:19:33,00:19:36,">> It's, if anyone knows the book by Ronda Byrne, The Secret."
00:19:36,00:19:40,">> Yes, I'm not saying that's a con because I don't know whether she's still"
00:19:40,00:19:43,"active and suing, I'm trying to get the book that is based on."
00:19:43,00:19:44,">> Yeah, it's based on that."
00:19:44,00:19:45,">> Think and Grow Rich is a con, yeah."
00:19:45,00:19:48,">> Yeah, so that first one is the con."
00:19:48,00:19:50,">> And he's definitely dead, right?"
00:19:50,00:19:52,">> He's so, well, this is the interesting thing about him."
00:19:52,00:19:53,>> [LAUGH]
00:19:53,00:19:58,">> He is, but he was involved with this bizarre cult."
00:19:58,00:20:00,He had loads and loads of failed businesses.
00:20:00,00:20:01,>> Are the cults still suing?
00:20:01,00:20:04,">> They have gone out of business as well, so it was fun."
00:20:04,00:20:06,They were called the master metaphysicians.
00:20:06,00:20:11,"And they came up with this scheme of raising an immortal human, okay?"
00:20:11,00:20:15,"So they adopted this baby girl, a real human baby girl."
00:20:15,00:20:16,She was called Jean Gawnd.
00:20:16,00:20:20,They pronounced that they were going to raise her a vegetarian.
00:20:20,00:20:23,"So good, tick, you know, one small woof."
00:20:23,00:20:27,">> And they all liked it, but they were too weak to say anything."
00:20:27,00:20:30,>> [LAUGH]
00:20:30,00:20:32,">> If you like that comment, please ask one of your stronger,"
00:20:32,00:20:36,meatier brethren around you to give a loud roar at Raw approval.
00:20:36,00:20:38,>> Yeah.
00:20:38,00:20:39,>> But they adopted this girl.
00:20:39,00:20:42,"I mean, this baby child, they adopted into this cult."
00:20:42,00:20:44,"And they said, we're going to make her vegetarian."
00:20:44,00:20:47,"And also, we're only going to think positive thoughts about her."
00:20:47,00:20:50,"We're going to surround her with this kind of bath, this ambient bath."
00:20:50,00:20:52,">> That's tough as a parent, though, isn't it?"
00:20:52,00:20:54,>> [LAUGH]
00:20:54,00:20:57,">> We all love our kids, but always positive."
00:20:57,00:20:58,>> Yeah. >> You're absolutely right.
00:20:58,00:21:02,">> And they didn't, they said no one tell her about the concept of death."
00:21:02,00:21:05,So she just won't know that that's a thing that you would do.
00:21:05,00:21:06,>> It was totally bizarre.
00:21:06,00:21:08,>> Yeah. >> Napoleon Hill was her godfather.
00:21:08,00:21:11,"This was in 1939, this was happening, so everyone involved is long dead."
00:21:11,00:21:14,>> And is there a big reveal where actually she's Taylor Swift?
00:21:14,00:21:14,It worked.
00:21:14,00:21:15,>> [LAUGH]
00:21:15,00:21:19,>> They eventually just returned the baby to her mother and sort of said stuff.
00:21:19,00:21:21,">> It was after 15 months, it just didn't work out."
00:21:21,00:21:24,">> She would be, what kind of 80 something now?"
00:21:24,00:21:26,"So she might, she might, well, still be around."
00:21:26,00:21:27,It may have worked.
00:21:27,00:21:28,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:21:28,00:21:30,>> Can't believe they gave up after 15 months.
00:21:30,00:21:33,"Jesus Christ, all parents want to do that, for God's sake."
00:21:33,00:21:34,>> [LAUGH]
00:21:34,00:21:37,">> But yeah, that book as well, that is possibly the best selling business book"
00:21:37,00:21:39,of all time to think and grow rich.
00:21:39,00:21:42,They estimate about 80 million copies of salt.
00:21:42,00:21:47,"And the idea that was Napoleon Hill interviewed Andrew Carnegie,"
00:21:47,00:21:49,"one of the richest men in America, most successful men."
00:21:49,00:21:53,He set him on a 20 year challenge to go and interview all of the most interesting
00:21:53,00:21:55,people around the US.
00:21:55,00:21:58,"And multiple people who've studied the life of Napoleon Hill,"
00:21:58,00:22:01,"looked through all his stuff, have all said, we don't think he ever met Andrew"
00:22:01,00:22:02,Carnegie.
00:22:02,00:22:04,We don't think he even met any of these people in the book.
00:22:04,00:22:06,"It's astonishing, this is the best selling book."
00:22:06,00:22:10,>> And is it like the other people are kind of happy to be mentioned?
00:22:10,00:22:13,"Because it shows that they're really, you know, successful."
00:22:13,00:22:14,>> I think most of them were dead.
00:22:14,00:22:16,So Carnegie was dead at that point.
00:22:16,00:22:18,"Edison, I think, was dead at that point."
00:22:18,00:22:21,">> The old Andrew Ontemurray get out claws, make sure the people are dead, and"
00:22:21,00:22:23,they can't complain about the fact you've lied about them.
00:22:23,00:22:27,"And what's so weird about that is that, the person who wrote, well,"
00:22:27,00:22:30,I think it's probably the most famous self-help book of all time.
00:22:30,00:22:33,"How to win friends and influence people, you know, everyone told that,"
00:22:33,00:22:34,everyone knows the phrase.
00:22:34,00:22:38,"It was the first sort of modern day genre self-help book by Dale Carnegie,"
00:22:38,00:22:41,who was actually born Dale Carnegie.
00:22:41,00:22:45,"But he gave a speech once in Carnegie Hall and thought, hey,"
00:22:45,00:22:46,Andrew Carnegie was successful.
00:22:46,00:22:50,I'll name myself after him instead and change the spelling of his name.
00:22:50,00:22:51,">> There's not much of a change, though."
00:22:51,00:22:53,">> It's not a huge change, no."
00:22:53,00:22:55,But it was an amazing book.
00:22:55,00:22:57,"I, Self-Help is a bullshit genre, really, isn't it?"
00:22:57,00:23:01,"But this, well, we can talk about it later."
00:23:01,00:23:02,"No, and I'm sure it's fine."
00:23:02,00:23:04,But this really was quite good.
00:23:04,00:23:09,"The idea of it was be sincere, be kind, we'll be interested in people."
00:23:09,00:23:12,"He said, you can win more friends in two months by being genuinely interested in"
00:23:12,00:23:16,people than you would in two years by getting people to be interested in you.
00:23:16,00:23:19,And the only reason he wrote it was because he wanted to write the great
00:23:19,00:23:23,"American novel, really desperate to, wrote this whole novel."
00:23:23,00:23:27,"This is early 1930s, went to the publishers and they said, this is terrible."
00:23:27,00:23:30,"You can't write novels, stop trying."
00:23:30,00:23:33,">> I thought you were going to say, I'm afraid so, this is Moby Dick."
00:23:33,00:23:34,You've just written it out again.
00:23:34,00:23:36,>> [LAUGH]
00:23:36,00:23:40,">> He did, he wrote in his private time too, Dale Carnegie."
00:23:40,00:23:45,"He wrote, he kept a folder, which was entitled, damned fool things I have done."
00:23:45,00:23:46,>> Yes.
00:23:46,00:23:50,">> And any social misstep he made, any faux pas."
00:23:50,00:23:53,"If you ever made someone feel awkward or uncomfortable,"
00:23:53,00:23:55,he would just write it down and file it away.
00:23:55,00:23:57,And so he could kind of learn from it.
00:23:57,00:23:59,So he wasn't kind of walking the walk of self-help as well.
00:23:59,00:24:01,>> I keep one off the back of reading that book.
00:24:01,00:24:01,>> Do you?
00:24:01,00:24:03,">> Yeah, I have one."
00:24:03,00:24:05,I have an idiot diary and it is full.
00:24:05,00:24:09,">> Yeah. >> It is on a daily, yeah."
00:24:09,00:24:13,">> So Dale Carnegie would, mostly he would dictate them to his secretary."
00:24:13,00:24:15,Because he was very successful at this point.
00:24:15,00:24:18,"But sometimes he was so embarrassed by whatever he'd done or said,"
00:24:18,00:24:21,that he would just privately write it down in the wrong hand.
00:24:21,00:24:23,">> You must've read a lot of self-help books, Stan, right?"
00:24:23,00:24:25,>> [LAUGH]
00:24:25,00:24:27,>> And one day you're going to find the one that works for you.
00:24:27,00:24:28,And it's all going to turn around.
00:24:28,00:24:30,">> Which is the best one, which is the best."
00:24:30,00:24:31,>> I love that one.
00:24:31,00:24:32,It's a genuinely good book.
00:24:32,00:24:34,>> It does seem like a genuine book.
00:24:34,00:24:35,>> Yeah.
00:24:35,00:24:39,"There was one written by his wife, wasn't there, Mrs. Dale Carnegie."
00:24:39,00:24:42,Which was called How to Help Your Husband Get Ahead.
00:24:42,00:24:43,>> No.
00:24:43,00:24:44,>> Yeah.
00:24:44,00:24:45,>> No way.
00:24:45,00:24:47,">> If you have a job or career of your own,"
00:24:47,00:24:51,would you be willing to give it up if it would advance your husband's interests?
00:24:51,00:24:55,"If not, you are more interested in promoting yourself than promoting your husband."
00:24:55,00:24:57,">> No way, Mrs. Carnegie."
00:24:57,00:24:58,>> Yeah.
00:24:58,00:25:00,>> I'll get back to that one.
00:25:00,00:25:03,>> [LAUGH]
00:25:03,00:25:07,>> One of the fun things about the internet coming to rise in Kindle books and
00:25:07,00:25:10,all that sort of stuff is you suddenly get access to all these books that you never
00:25:10,00:25:14,knew existed and the self-help genre has some extraordinary ones.
00:25:14,00:25:18,I found one called How to Land a Top Paying Pierogi Maker's Job.
00:25:18,00:25:21,"Now, that's dumplings, right?"
00:25:21,00:25:25,So How to Land a Top Paying Dumpling Maker's Job by Ashley McFadden.
00:25:25,00:25:28,"But then this one got me, which was by Donald L."
00:25:28,00:25:32,"Wilson, Natural Bust Enlargement with Total Mindpower."
00:25:32,00:25:33,>> [LAUGH]
00:25:33,00:25:39,>> How to use the other 90% of your mind to increase the size of your breasts.
00:25:39,00:25:43,">> So it only works on your breasts, you can't stare across a room."
00:25:43,00:25:45,>> [LAUGH]
00:25:45,00:25:47,>> I'm trying to help you.
00:25:47,00:25:49,>> [LAUGH]
00:25:49,00:25:51,">> You gave up your career for me, let me give something back."
00:25:51,00:25:59,>> [LAUGH]
00:25:59,00:26:03,">> It is time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:26:03,00:26:06,">> My fact this week is that during the Mexican Revolution,"
00:26:06,00:26:10,the women in the army traveled on train roofs because the horses took up all
00:26:10,00:26:12,the room inside the carriages.
00:26:12,00:26:14,>> [LAUGH]
00:26:14,00:26:15,">> Right, that sounds bad."
00:26:15,00:26:17,">> It does, but it's- >> Have you ever tried to"
00:26:17,00:26:20,display the horse to stand on a train carriage roof?
00:26:20,00:26:21,>> It's very hard.
00:26:21,00:26:25,>> Have you ever tried to persuade a woman to stand on top of it?
00:26:25,00:26:28,">> I never have, I never have."
00:26:28,00:26:32,">> You only have a book one seat, don't you, and then it's laps or roof."
00:26:32,00:26:35,>> One of the big issues apparently is the beating sun.
00:26:35,00:26:39,It's a very hot place to be on top of a train.
00:26:39,00:26:41,">> I mean, it makes sense, you're very exposed."
00:26:41,00:26:41,>> Yes.
00:26:41,00:26:44,">> They do have big sombreros though, looking at a picture."
00:26:44,00:26:47,">> They do, and these women famously wore big sombreros."
00:26:47,00:26:50,"And I mean, I think traveling on top of a train sounds super fun."
00:26:50,00:26:54,"But, so I don't mean to present this fact, it's an anti-feminist thing."
00:26:54,00:26:58,"They probably wanted to do it, but this was- >> There's the anti-feminist."
00:26:58,00:27:00,>> [LAUGH]
00:27:00,00:27:03,">> This was Mexican Revolution, which I'm sure I don't need to remind you,"
00:27:03,00:27:07,"around from 1910 to about 1920, and they were quite famous these women."
00:27:07,00:27:13,"They were known as soldaderas, and they existed before the Mexican Revolution,"
00:27:13,00:27:15,in other Mexican wars in the 19th century.
00:27:15,00:27:19,"They were largely women who traveled with their male family members,"
00:27:19,00:27:24,"their husbands, or their sons, to provide them with cooking, nursing,"
00:27:24,00:27:27,"company, because that wasn't really provided by the state, to the army."
00:27:27,00:27:30,So armies would travel with their partners.
00:27:30,00:27:34,There was one soldier who was once asked why he was making his wife come into
00:27:34,00:27:37,"battle with him, and he said, shall I starve then?"
00:27:37,00:27:39,Who shall make my tortillas but my wife?
00:27:39,00:27:41,>> [LAUGH]
00:27:41,00:27:42,>> They do sound very cool.
00:27:42,00:27:45,>> Yeah. >> Are they the same
00:27:45,00:27:46,as last Adelitas?
00:27:46,00:27:48,">> Yes, they are the same."
00:27:48,00:27:51,Adelitas was a name that was introduced in the revolution.
00:27:51,00:27:55,"And it was after an apparent companion of Pancho Villa,"
00:27:55,00:27:58,"who was one of the many revolutionary heroes, but she didn't actually exist."
00:27:58,00:28:00,But they were named after her.
00:28:00,00:28:01,>> Okay.
00:28:01,00:28:05,>> Because some of the women just fought as women.
00:28:05,00:28:07,>> Yep. >> Some of them dressed up as men and
00:28:07,00:28:08,then fought.
00:28:08,00:28:10,">> Yep, yeah. >> Some of them dressed as men and"
00:28:10,00:28:14,then just decided to stay men after the revolution was over.
00:28:14,00:28:18,"Emilio Robles was born, Emilio Robles."
00:28:18,00:28:22,"And then just fought as a commander in charge of hundreds of men,"
00:28:22,00:28:25,"won lots of respect, apparently through drinking and womanizing."
00:28:25,00:28:26,>> Yes. >> Okay.
00:28:26,00:28:31,">> And then lived the rest of his life as Emilio, married a lady,"
00:28:31,00:28:32,adopted a daughter.
00:28:32,00:28:33,>> Yeah. >> And that was that.
00:28:33,00:28:35,">> Yeah, absolutely."
00:28:35,00:28:38,"And they're known of and spoken of today, the ones who fought."
00:28:38,00:28:44,Often the ones who fought rode sidesaddle and they rode in long dresses and
00:28:44,00:28:47,they kicked up dust with their horses to disorient the opposition.
00:28:47,00:28:51,"Which I'm sure wasn't the main method of attack, but."
00:28:51,00:28:54,>> The other thing is that a lot of them had this braided sort of
00:28:54,00:28:56,buns on the side of their head.
00:28:56,00:29:00,And George Lucas told Time Magazine that that's where he got his idea for
00:29:00,00:29:02,Princess Leia's style. >> No way.
00:29:02,00:29:06,">> Yeah, in the, in one of the museums of Star Wars,"
00:29:06,00:29:09,they have a photo of Clara de la Rocha.
00:29:09,00:29:11,And you can see the layer buns there.
00:29:11,00:29:15,"So yeah, the Mexican Revolution gave us Princess Leia."
00:29:15,00:29:17,>> Should we say what the Mexican Revolution was about?
00:29:17,00:29:20,>> It was about giving us buns for Princess Leia's.
00:29:20,00:29:22,">> Yeah, completely, yeah."
00:29:22,00:29:26,"Freedom for Mexico, basically, from whom?"
00:29:26,00:29:27,>> Dictatorship.
00:29:27,00:29:28,>> Dictators in the capitalists.
00:29:28,00:29:32,">> From Porfirio Diaz, who was in charge for quite a long time."
00:29:32,00:29:38,And he held a banquet to celebrate more than quarter of a century of stability.
00:29:38,00:29:40,"And about two weeks later, the revolution broke out."
00:29:40,00:29:41,>> [LAUGH]
00:29:41,00:29:44,>> Just in the nick of time you got there then.
00:29:44,00:29:45,">> It was really crazy, wasn't it?"
00:29:45,00:29:47,"Because it was about ten years of, someone, he was overthrown."
00:29:47,00:29:50,>> Yeah. >> And then the guy who replaced him was
00:29:50,00:29:51,overthrown. >> Yeah.
00:29:51,00:29:52,">> And then maybe the next guy, I think,"
00:29:52,00:29:55,"was also overthrown, a lot of turmoil."
00:29:55,00:29:57,>> It was very complicated.
00:29:57,00:30:00,>> I've had her in the country having several leaders in the space of a few years.
00:30:00,00:30:02,And I've been going to absolute.
00:30:02,00:30:08,>> It was one of my favorite moments of it was during some of this turmoil.
00:30:08,00:30:09,>> We've all got a favorite moment.
00:30:09,00:30:11,>> By the Mexican Revolution.
00:30:11,00:30:14,>> There was a guy called Victoriano Huerta.
00:30:14,00:30:20,"And he was actually the person who, the second dictator, who deposed the good guy."
00:30:20,00:30:23,"So Huerta- >> So it's bad guys, I'm sorry."
00:30:23,00:30:26,">> We had to simplify it somehow, there's good guys, there's bad guys."
00:30:26,00:30:29,"Huerta, bad guy, deposes Madero, good guy."
00:30:29,00:30:34,"But he's like, okay, I want it to look a bit like the presidency I want to have now"
00:30:34,00:30:35,is legitimate.
00:30:35,00:30:38,"But what I've done is I've deposed and actually executed, oops,"
00:30:38,00:30:40,the current president and the vice president.
00:30:40,00:30:44,"So he made the person who'd been third in line to the presidency,"
00:30:44,00:30:49,"president, for literally some say 15, some say 45 minutes."
00:30:49,00:30:52,Just so that this guy could appoint him- >> Huerta.
00:30:52,00:30:54,>> Who's past the Liz Truss of the resolution.
00:30:54,00:30:58,">> Yeah, I mean, he didn't necessarily want it."
00:30:58,00:31:03,"He's literally there so that he could make Huerta, Secretary of the Interior,"
00:31:03,00:31:05,which meant Huerta was next in line for the presidency.
00:31:05,00:31:09,"And then Mr. 15 minutes stepped aside and was like,"
00:31:09,00:31:10,"Huerta, you're next in line."
00:31:10,00:31:11,>> Who does that fool?
00:31:11,00:31:12,It doesn't fool anyone.
00:31:12,00:31:14,">> It's weird, what's the fucking point?"
00:31:14,00:31:17,Just kill the third guy as well and see who's the presidency.
00:31:17,00:31:19,">> Don't have killed the first or second, I mean, just, yeah, yeah."
00:31:19,00:31:21,">> No, good advice, don't kill anyone."
00:31:21,00:31:23,>> That's the message.
00:31:23,00:31:25,>> [LAUGH]
00:31:25,00:31:30,">> Pantrovia, Pantrovia was a great general."
00:31:30,00:31:32,And he is famous mainly in the war for
00:31:32,00:31:35,having struck a deal with the mutual film company to
00:31:35,00:31:40,"sell the film rights for his own battles in exchange for cash, basically."
00:31:40,00:31:45,"And propaganda venue, and there are lots of myths saying they made him retake"
00:31:45,00:31:49,"battles, entire battles, if they, sorry, we didn't have the camera running."
00:31:49,00:31:52,>> It's surely hard to get everyone involved in that retake.
00:31:52,00:31:53,>> [LAUGH]
00:31:53,00:31:54,>> He's picking up money.
00:31:54,00:31:56,>> [LAUGH]
00:31:56,00:31:58,>> So there's a bit of back and forth about it.
00:31:58,00:32:03,"But basically, it does seem absolutely true that he got 20% of the box office"
00:32:03,00:32:05,from the films of his own battles.
00:32:05,00:32:06,>> Amazing.
00:32:06,00:32:07,>> There was a fantastic bit.
00:32:07,00:32:10,Film crews would often wait for a battle to die down.
00:32:10,00:32:12,"And then they would approach some nearby soldiers and say,"
00:32:12,00:32:14,"look, can you recreate what just happened?"
00:32:14,00:32:15,>> So that did actually happen?
00:32:15,00:32:17,">> That, I mean, lots of this did happen, yeah."
00:32:17,00:32:19,">> You would wait for it to die down, wouldn't you?"
00:32:19,00:32:22,"It was a guy just armed with a camera, I think."
00:32:22,00:32:25,">> Some of it they filmed, and it wasn't regarded as dramatic enough, and"
00:32:25,00:32:29,"it had to be restaged, because, yeah, I mean, but some of it they would ask"
00:32:29,00:32:30,nearby soldiers to reconstruct.
00:32:30,00:32:33,And there's a fantastic moment where a group of Mexican soldiers realized
00:32:33,00:32:37,that they are being portrayed as cowards in the film that is being shot of them.
00:32:37,00:32:41,"They decided to start fighting for real, and then an entirely new battle breaks"
00:32:41,00:32:44,out because they were so unhappy with the way they were being portrayed in the film
00:32:44,00:32:45,of the battle that just happened.
00:32:45,00:32:46,>> It's so weird.
00:32:46,00:32:47,">> I love it, I love it."
00:32:47,00:32:52,">> In 1914, there was the New York Times wrote a news announcement which said,"
00:32:52,00:32:57,"Pancho Villa, general in command of the constitutionalist army in northern Mexico"
00:32:57,00:33:02,will in future carry on his warfare against President Huerta as a full partner in
00:33:02,00:33:05,the moving pictures venture with Harry E. Aitken.
00:33:05,00:33:08,">> It's an astonishing announcement, and he did it."
00:33:08,00:33:11,"Zapata, who was another one, Huerta did it as well."
00:33:11,00:33:14,Supposedly his deal meant that they would screen it for him so
00:33:14,00:33:16,that he could censor it before it went out.
00:33:16,00:33:21,">> Yeah, the Mexican Revolution, it seems that a lot of the army was"
00:33:21,00:33:22,stoned a lot of the time.
00:33:22,00:33:23,>> Really?
00:33:23,00:33:27,>> It's kind of hard to find the evidence of this because on a lot of the marijuana
00:33:27,00:33:31,"websites, they just make shit up a lot of the time."
00:33:31,00:33:34,>> But it does seem true that actually a lot of them were stoned.
00:33:34,00:33:38,"The Yakuis, who were one of the groups of peasants, they were hired marijuana."
00:33:38,00:33:40,They fought like demonic spirits.
00:33:40,00:33:42,They ground out yards and still got nowhere.
00:33:42,00:33:45,Then they staggered about here and they're confused.
00:33:45,00:33:51,>> I don't remember the fighting like demonic spirits element of being stoned.
00:33:51,00:33:54,I remember staggering about confused elements.
00:33:54,00:33:55,>> Does anyone have any tortillas?
00:33:55,00:33:59,>> I forgot my wife.
00:33:59,00:34:06,>> Did you hear about Wenceslau Moguel?
00:34:06,00:34:07,This is incredible.
00:34:07,00:34:11,"Okay, this was a guy who was caught up in the fighting, as all of Mexico was."
00:34:11,00:34:12,This was 1915.
00:34:12,00:34:17,"Incidentally, the reason I think it doesn't get as much play over here is that"
00:34:17,00:34:19,the First World War was going on for 1914 to 18.
00:34:19,00:34:22,So like that attracted a lot of attention over here.
00:34:22,00:34:23,But there was a lot of stuff going on over there.
00:34:23,00:34:28,">> We had the big Hollywood hit, but they had the Art House movie, didn't they?"
00:34:28,00:34:30,">> Yes, people went to see."
00:34:30,00:34:31,>> Wow.
00:34:31,00:34:34,">> Anyway, Wenceslau Moguel gets caught up in this conflict."
00:34:34,00:34:36,And he was accused of being a revolutionary.
00:34:36,00:34:42,He was not tried and then he was sentenced to death and
00:34:42,00:34:45,"the typical method at the time, firing squad."
00:34:45,00:34:50,"And as far as I can tell, Moguel is more or"
00:34:50,00:34:54,less the only person ever to have survived a firing squad.
00:34:54,00:34:56,>> Okay.
00:34:56,00:34:59,>> He was shot eight or nine times.
00:34:59,00:35:00,">> Okay. >> The coup de grace was,"
00:35:00,00:35:02,he was shot actually in the forehead.
00:35:02,00:35:06,">> Wow. >> He survived, he was in pain."
00:35:06,00:35:08,>> [LAUGH]
00:35:08,00:35:09,>> He was in severe pain.
00:35:09,00:35:12,">> But the federales, the people who had shot him, they just moved on to whatever"
00:35:12,00:35:14,"they were doing next, and he was incredibly, he was still alive."
00:35:14,00:35:17,"He managed to crawl to safety, he recovered from his wounds."
00:35:17,00:35:19,He lived it till 1976.
00:35:19,00:35:21,>> How did he crawl to safety?
00:35:21,00:35:24,">> I have no idea, I mean he was permanently scarred and disfigured."
00:35:24,00:35:27,"He clearly had been through something unbelievably traumatic, but he lived."
00:35:27,00:35:30,"And he was known as El Fusilado, the one who has been shot."
00:35:30,00:35:32,And that was his nickname from then on.
00:35:32,00:35:34,There is a song about him by anyone now?
00:35:34,00:35:35,>> Robbie Williams.
00:35:35,00:35:36,>> Chamba Wamba.
00:35:36,00:35:39,>> I get knocked down.
00:35:39,00:35:40,>> I get knocked down again.
00:35:40,00:35:45,>> [LAUGH]
00:35:45,00:35:47,>> That's incredible.
00:35:47,00:35:48,>> It's an extraordinary story.
00:35:48,00:35:53,">> So does it count the surviving firing squad, what Pancho Villa did,"
00:35:53,00:35:57,which he was sentenced to death by firing a squad in about 1913 when Huerta was
00:35:57,00:36:01,"in charge, and Madero, who was actually president,"
00:36:01,00:36:04,"who was Villa's ally, sent a stay of execution."
00:36:04,00:36:07,"He was like, shit, Pancho Villa's being executed, I don't want that."
00:36:07,00:36:10,"Sent a stay of execution to say, do not kill this guy."
00:36:10,00:36:14,"Pancho Villa was standing there, firing a squad, guns cocked pointing at him."
00:36:14,00:36:19,"When the person arrived, waving the letter, saying, stop, stop."
00:36:19,00:36:21,And so they didn't shoot him.
00:36:21,00:36:22,That's film stuff.
00:36:22,00:36:23,>> Maybe that was all set up for the film.
00:36:23,00:36:24,>> [LAUGH]
00:36:24,00:36:29,">> He had a nickname as well, Pancho Villa, which also is a song."
00:36:29,00:36:33,"So there's quite a lot of tunes coming out, which was La Cucaracha."
00:36:33,00:36:35,>> Really?
00:36:35,00:36:37,">> I don't think the song is based on him, but that was his nickname."
00:36:37,00:36:37,>> Yeah.
00:36:37,00:36:39,">> Is it not, I mean, because what the hell does that mean?"
00:36:39,00:36:40,">> No, it is Cockroach."
00:36:40,00:36:42,>> Little Cockroach.
00:36:42,00:36:46,"And the Cockroach, in the most popular version of that song, is stoned."
00:36:46,00:36:47,So. >> Yeah.
00:36:47,00:36:50,"But they called him the Cockroach because Pancho Villa,"
00:36:50,00:36:53,he was like a revolutionary in Northern Mexico.
00:36:53,00:36:57,He wasn't very happy about America was kind of getting involved.
00:36:57,00:37:01,And so he decided to attack America on his own with some of his mates.
00:37:01,00:37:02,>> [LAUGH]
00:37:02,00:37:05,>> And they went in and sort of shot up a town in America and
00:37:05,00:37:07,then legged it back into Mexico.
00:37:07,00:37:11,And America was not very happy about that because they didn't have World War I
00:37:11,00:37:12,to bother about quite yet.
00:37:12,00:37:13,>> [LAUGH]
00:37:13,00:37:15,>> And so they went in and they went after him and they went after him for
00:37:15,00:37:18,years and years and tried to find him and they couldn't find him.
00:37:18,00:37:19,And that's why they called him the Cockroach.
00:37:19,00:37:22,"Because it's like, you know, you know, he's there under the fridge somewhere,"
00:37:22,00:37:24,but you don't know where he is exactly.
00:37:24,00:37:26,>> Really?
00:37:26,00:37:27,>> Yeah. >> Okay.
00:37:27,00:37:31,>> One thing about Pancho Villa is according to the new American bartender's
00:37:31,00:37:36,"guide, if you go into Mexico City and you say you want tequila,"
00:37:36,00:37:42,"estilo Pancho Villa, por favor, which is tequila in the Pancho Villa style,"
00:37:42,00:37:45,that's the coolest way of asking for tequila.
00:37:45,00:37:50,"But if you order it, went to Slav Margwell style, you get nine shots delivered."
00:37:50,00:37:52,>> [LAUGH]
00:37:52,00:37:57,[MUSIC]
00:37:57,00:38:00,">> Okay, we need to move on to our final fact of the show."
00:38:00,00:38:04,It is time for our final fact and that is Andy.
00:38:04,00:38:09,">> My fact is, there is a cave in Greece where water flows uphill."
00:38:09,00:38:09,>> How?
00:38:09,00:38:13,">> Well, I should say, I'll just quickly say where I got this."
00:38:13,00:38:20,"I recently judged a competition of a fact competition from Descent Magazine,"
00:38:20,00:38:25,"which is the caving Bible, really, you know, and this was the winning fact."
00:38:25,00:38:26,"And Descent Magazine, I should just say, is great."
00:38:26,00:38:28,And I did look up if it could be confused with anything.
00:38:28,00:38:32,"There is also Descent Magazine, which is politics."
00:38:32,00:38:35,"Descent Magazine, which is a Canadian literary mag."
00:38:35,00:38:38,"Decent Magazine, just a magazine for men, I think."
00:38:38,00:38:43,"Discount Magazine, Decant Magazine, and Long and Short, which is a Daxon Magazine."
00:38:43,00:38:44,">> Wow, that's great."
00:38:44,00:38:45,>> That's good.
00:38:45,00:38:46,>> But this one-
00:38:46,00:38:47,>> Long and Short is a great name.
00:38:47,00:38:49,>> That's incredible.
00:38:49,00:38:52,">> We'll get into the fact, but this is a bi-monthly magazine."
00:38:52,00:38:54,It's been going since 1969.
00:38:54,00:38:58,"I'm so fascinated by, did you meet everyone at Descent Magazine?"
00:38:58,00:38:59,How many facts came in?
00:38:59,00:39:03,>> It was almost an email-based competition judging thing for me.
00:39:03,00:39:05,I didn't get to go to the ball.
00:39:05,00:39:10,"But this island is in Kefalonia, an Ionian island."
00:39:10,00:39:14,And it has a cave where the sea flows into the land.
00:39:14,00:39:17,"Okay, so it goes the other way, confusing."
00:39:17,00:39:19,And it makes its way through the island.
00:39:19,00:39:20,There's kind of porous rock under the island.
00:39:20,00:39:23,"And it comes out on the other side of the island, right?"
00:39:23,00:39:26,But scientists were interested in what was happening to it.
00:39:26,00:39:29,And they put in some very strong dye in the water in the bit
00:39:29,00:39:34,where it goes into the island's rocks to see what happened.
00:39:34,00:39:35,They used 140 kilos of dye.
00:39:35,00:39:38,So they dyed a huge amount of the water.
00:39:38,00:39:41,And what they found is it emerged two weeks later
00:39:41,00:39:43,"on the other side of the island, which is nine miles across."
00:39:43,00:39:44,>> Amazing.
00:39:44,00:39:47,>> And it emerged higher than sea level on the other side.
00:39:47,00:39:47,>> Really?
00:39:47,00:39:50,So has it gone through the porous rocks?
00:39:50,00:39:52,Or is it flowing like the other side?
00:39:52,00:39:54,>> I think the idea is the sea water comes in.
00:39:54,00:39:58,And this is fresh water that's moving uphill and the two mix.
00:39:58,00:40:00,But then the sea water is denser.
00:40:00,00:40:02,So it kind of pushes the fresh water upwards.
00:40:02,00:40:02,>> Nice.
00:40:02,00:40:03,>> Pretty much.
00:40:03,00:40:06,It's all to do with sea and fresh water and their relative densities.
00:40:06,00:40:07,"Exactly, as James says, because of the salt."
00:40:07,00:40:13,">> And it comes out in Melisani Cave, which is the cave of the nymphs."
00:40:13,00:40:14,>> Right.
00:40:14,00:40:17,>> The nymphs being those horny Greek people.
00:40:17,00:40:18,>> Right.
00:40:18,00:40:19,">> Oh, yeah."
00:40:19,00:40:19,>> Sexy.
00:40:19,00:40:22,>> Narrow down.
00:40:22,00:40:25,">> So no human could go this stretch of water to the side, could they?"
00:40:25,00:40:26,">> No, no, I'm down to it that way."
00:40:26,00:40:30,">> There might be a route, as the internet is full of videos of people."
00:40:30,00:40:33,Has anyone here ever seen the caving videos?
00:40:33,00:40:35,They're so upsetting.
00:40:35,00:40:35,>> Why?
00:40:35,00:40:39,">> There's people going through really, like they're crawling with their"
00:40:39,00:40:43,shoulders only through these insanely tight spaces underground.
00:40:43,00:40:44,>> It's really scary.
00:40:44,00:40:44,>> It's really claustrophobic.
00:40:44,00:40:49,"I don't think I'm claustrophobic, but you watch this and you think, that is unbearable, you know?"
00:40:49,00:40:57,>> I like the fact that cavers are like Batman in that if there is a caving disaster.
00:40:57,00:40:58,">> They live in a cave, yeah, yeah."
00:40:58,00:41:03,">> Yeah, oh my God, I haven't thought of that element."
00:41:03,00:41:08,"Wow, because I was thinking about it, if there's a caving disaster, the call goes out to all cavers and they flock."
00:41:08,00:41:12,"So there was, for instance, so Wales is a good place to go caving."
00:41:12,00:41:18,"And there was a call in a place called O Goff Fanonthe, which I'm sure a Welsh person will get in touch and"
00:41:18,00:41:19,tell me how badly I pronounce that.
00:41:19,00:41:22,">> It almost sounds like Gotham, in a way, like a Welsh version of Gotham."
00:41:22,00:41:26,">> Oh my God, this is blowing so wide open."
00:41:26,00:41:30,"Right, so there was an accident in this cave where a caver, George Lennane, fell."
00:41:30,00:41:36,"He was very badly injured and he was a very long way into this cave, as I say, 274 metres below ground."
00:41:36,00:41:44,"The call goes out, 16 teams across England responded, 300 rescuers from England, Scotland and Wales all dropped their jobs,"
00:41:44,00:41:49,"dropped their pens, closed their computers, got on the next train to this cave."
00:41:49,00:41:53,"And they all helped out, which I would say is a lot of people who are quite bored by their jobs in marketing."
00:41:53,00:41:59,"And, you know, the call has said we need about eight or nine cavers and they've gone, it's all right, I'm here, I'm there."
00:41:59,00:42:04,"And they're all underground, but it is extraordinary if you've got someone incredibly injured as he was,"
00:42:04,00:42:09,"broken bones and stuff, getting a stretcher by someone who's incapacitated through, like,"
00:42:09,00:42:15,"underwater up vertical inclines, you know, places where you can only fit one human body,"
00:42:15,00:42:20,"and you're soaking wet and it took about three days, I think, so you're freezing cold."
00:42:20,00:42:22,">> Wait, how many metres down was he?"
00:42:22,00:42:24,>> He was 274 metres.
00:42:24,00:42:26,>> And how many people answered the call?
00:42:26,00:42:27,>> 300.
00:42:27,00:42:35,">> So you could just do a human train and just, like, grab it by the ankles and bang, we go."
00:42:35,00:42:42,>> I feel like you've got a bit of a problem there with the other 100-nod people who are underwater for that amount of time.
00:42:42,00:42:43,>> That's very true.
00:42:43,00:42:48,>> So has anyone here been down the devil's arse?
00:42:48,00:42:51,>> Is that in Manchester?
00:42:51,00:42:53,">> It's not far off, it's in the Peak Districts."
00:42:53,00:42:54,">> Oh, okay."
00:42:54,00:42:58,">> And it seemed like it was because for listeners, the whole audience said yes to that question."
00:42:58,00:43:00,">> It's very famous around here, the devil's arse."
00:43:00,00:43:01,>> Okay.
00:43:01,00:43:02,>> It's a cave in Dalbyshire.
00:43:02,00:43:03,>> Okay.
00:43:03,00:43:07,">> And they changed the name, it was known as Devil's Arse, and then they changed it"
00:43:07,00:43:14,"to Peak Cavern in 1880 because Queen Victoria visited, but we've changed it back now."
00:43:14,00:43:17,And it's lots of awesome things about it.
00:43:17,00:43:22,"It's where a lot of Britain's last troglodytes lived, so cave dwellers lived there."
00:43:22,00:43:26,"They made ropes, and they would sell it to the nearby villages."
00:43:26,00:43:27,>> The troglodytes?
00:43:27,00:43:29,">> Sorry, when are we talking?"
00:43:29,00:43:31,>> They left the final time in 1915.
00:43:31,00:43:32,>> What?
00:43:32,00:43:33,>> Yeah.
00:43:33,00:43:38,And it's where the Thieves' Kant was invented.
00:43:38,00:43:44,"So Thieves' Kant is a type of language that thieves used, and it was invented by a person"
00:43:44,00:43:51,"called Giles Hather and Cock Laurel, and they were at the mouth of the devil's arse, and"
00:43:51,00:43:56,they came up with this new language that they'd be able to talk about and the cops wouldn't
00:43:56,00:43:57,understand what they were saying.
00:43:57,00:44:01,">> I mean, just saying Cock Laurel's at the mouth of the devil's arse is quite a confusing"
00:44:01,00:44:03,thing to hear.
00:44:03,00:44:07,">> Well, do you want to guess some Thieves' Kant words?"
00:44:07,00:44:08,">> Okay, yeah."
00:44:08,00:44:10,>> What do you think a bung nipper is?
00:44:10,00:44:11,>> A bung nipper.
00:44:11,00:44:12,>> Bung.
00:44:12,00:44:13,B-U-N-G nipper.
00:44:13,00:44:19,>> A child who lives in a barrel.
00:44:19,00:44:25,>> Is it when you're caving and someone is so up your arse in terms of like they're too
00:44:25,00:44:26,enthusiastic?
00:44:26,00:44:31,"So bung, as in Beavis and Butthead bunghole, a nipper is like you're literally nipping"
00:44:31,00:44:32,it with your mouth.
00:44:32,00:44:33,">> No, I got it."
00:44:33,00:44:34,But the thing is --
00:44:34,00:44:35,[ Laughter ]
00:44:35,00:44:38,">> This is more about thieving than caving, right?"
00:44:38,00:44:41,">> I mean, they met at the mouth of the devil's arse thing."
00:44:41,00:44:42,">> Oh, this is about thieving?"
00:44:42,00:44:43,>> Yeah.
00:44:43,00:44:44,They're nothing stupid caves.
00:44:44,00:44:45,"Oh, really?"
00:44:45,00:44:46,>> A bung nipper.
00:44:46,00:44:47,So that's someone stealing something?
00:44:47,00:44:48,>> Yeah.
00:44:48,00:44:49,Don't put you out of your misery.
00:44:49,00:44:50,It's just a purse.
00:44:50,00:44:51,Just a purse.
00:44:51,00:44:52,>> Yeah.
00:44:52,00:44:53,>> Do you know what a little snakesman is?
00:44:53,00:44:54,>> Little snakesman.
00:44:54,00:44:55,>> Yeah.
00:44:55,00:44:59,">> Is it, like, in Oliver Twist where you're like a little kid and you go in someone's deep"
00:44:59,00:45:03,pocket with your snake-like little arm and pull out his wallet?
00:45:03,00:45:05,">> You're really, really close."
00:45:05,00:45:06,Really close.
00:45:06,00:45:10,It's a small boy who passed through a window and then they'd unlock the door of the house
00:45:10,00:45:11,and then the thieves can go in.
00:45:11,00:45:12,>> Also a scene in Oliver Twist.
00:45:12,00:45:13,>> Yeah.
00:45:13,00:45:15,">> God, I was just 200 pages too soon."
00:45:15,00:45:19,">> And finally, moss."
00:45:19,00:45:20,What is moss?
00:45:20,00:45:21,>> Moss.
00:45:21,00:45:22,>> According to thieves.
00:45:22,00:45:23,>> Thieves.
00:45:23,00:45:26,An old person to rob.
00:45:26,00:45:27,They're not going to move.
00:45:27,00:45:28,They're not going to notice.
00:45:28,00:45:31,They might as well be moss and you can just --
00:45:31,00:45:33,>> Always on the north side of a tree.
00:45:33,00:45:34,>> Yeah.
00:45:34,00:45:35,>> No.
00:45:35,00:45:37,>> Just a weedy thief because it's wet.
00:45:37,00:45:38,>> No.
00:45:38,00:45:39,>> It's like moss.
00:45:39,00:45:40,>> Where does moss grow?
00:45:40,00:45:41,>> Roofs.
00:45:41,00:45:42,>> Bugs?
00:45:42,00:45:45,">> Someone who goes in the roof, who takes off the roof of the house and goes in and somehow"
00:45:45,00:45:46,the residents don't notice.
00:45:46,00:45:48,>> I'm going to give it to you.
00:45:48,00:45:50,>> It's lead stolen from the top of buildings.
00:45:50,00:45:51,>> Ah.
00:45:51,00:45:52,>> No.
00:45:52,00:45:53,>> That's very good.
00:45:53,00:45:57,">> So now if you're ever in the 19th century, gangs --"
00:45:57,00:45:58,>> Love it.
00:45:58,00:45:59,>> Good to know.
00:45:59,00:46:01,>> Did you guys hear about Beatriz Flamene?
00:46:01,00:46:02,>> No.
00:46:02,00:46:03,What's that?
00:46:03,00:46:06,">> She is a caver, April 2023."
00:46:06,00:46:08,"She came out of a cave, right?"
00:46:08,00:46:10,And that's not interesting because she is a professional caver.
00:46:10,00:46:11,>> Makes sense.
00:46:11,00:46:12,>> Yeah.
00:46:12,00:46:17,>> She went in in November 2021 to that cave.
00:46:17,00:46:18,>> How long was that?
00:46:18,00:46:20,>> I think it's about 500 days.
00:46:20,00:46:21,>> What?
00:46:21,00:46:23,>> November -- it's a year and several months.
00:46:23,00:46:24,>> Did she get lost?
00:46:24,00:46:25,>> She knew.
00:46:25,00:46:28,"It was an experiment she was doing with some scientists, but she was up for it."
00:46:28,00:46:31,">> She wasn't just going to do a -- you know, when you're on a beach with a kid and you're"
00:46:31,00:46:33,going to a poo in a cave.
00:46:33,00:46:34,And I always used to think that --
00:46:34,00:46:35,>> Pause.
00:46:35,00:46:36,Pause.
00:46:36,00:46:37,Pause.
00:46:37,00:46:38,>> Okay.
00:46:38,00:46:39,Here we go.
00:46:39,00:46:40,>> Right.
00:46:40,00:46:43,>> There was a moment in every podcast where someone overshares.
00:46:43,00:46:44,>> Hang on.
00:46:44,00:46:47,>> I always had that thought down.
00:46:47,00:46:48,">> Everyone does this, right?"
00:46:48,00:46:49,When they're children.
00:46:49,00:46:50,>> Okay.
00:46:50,00:46:51,Okay.
00:46:51,00:46:52,Audience.
00:46:52,00:46:53,Anyone ever shit in a cave?
00:46:53,00:46:54,>> Oh.
00:46:54,00:46:55,We do it in the sea.
00:46:55,00:46:57,>> What we're saying is she hadn't just gone and done a poo and got lost.
00:46:57,00:46:58,>> No.
00:46:58,00:46:59,>> Sorry.
00:46:59,00:47:01,I just heard Dan say we did it in the sea.
00:47:01,00:47:02,>> Yeah.
00:47:02,00:47:04,>> My mum made us go into a cave and dig a hole and do one at least.
00:47:04,00:47:08,We just sent out to sea to do a big floater where everyone's trying to body board.
00:47:08,00:47:12,Don't try and make me the weird one here.
00:47:12,00:47:13,>> Okay.
00:47:13,00:47:17,But it was an experiment for -- it was full science about what happens to the human body
00:47:17,00:47:18,under these conditions.
00:47:18,00:47:21,So she didn't know anything about the news in that time.
00:47:21,00:47:22,She was completely cut off from civilization.
00:47:22,00:47:23,She didn't know about the Queen dying.
00:47:23,00:47:24,"She didn't know about Russia, Ukraine."
00:47:24,00:47:25,She didn't know about Liz Truss.
00:47:25,00:47:26,She didn't know anything.
00:47:26,00:47:31,She had a quick shit in the cave and come back.
00:47:31,00:47:34,She had the time of her life.
00:47:34,00:47:36,It's amazing reading her account of it.
00:47:36,00:47:38,She said it was an excellent experience.
00:47:38,00:47:40,She didn't have a bath or a shower for a year and a half.
00:47:40,00:47:45,She thought she'd been in for 160 days because she had no sense of time down there.
00:47:45,00:47:46,I just love it.
00:47:46,00:47:48,">> Your body goes into a weird rhythm, doesn't it?"
00:47:48,00:47:53,You kind of go into 12-hour days or 14-hour days or something.
00:47:53,00:47:56,">> Basically, she said, ""I really don't want to know about anything that's happening out"
00:47:56,00:48:00,"there, even if there's an emergency, even if there's a family thing."
00:48:00,00:48:03,"I just want to try this experience properly."""
00:48:03,00:48:06,So she would get food delivered by the scientists.
00:48:06,00:48:14,"They would collect every fifth poo, and I suppose the previous four poos as well."
00:48:14,00:48:17,"Every five poos she did, she got a collection done by the scientists."
00:48:17,00:48:24,">> Is it like one of those Costa Cards where you, you know, stamp every time?"
00:48:24,00:48:25,What do you mean they collected everyone?
00:48:25,00:48:28,>> Were they going into her chamber?
00:48:28,00:48:29,>> They collected her poo.
00:48:29,00:48:32,"Like, she would come out to the bit where she picked up her food and I suppose drop off"
00:48:32,00:48:33,her poo and then she would retreat again.
00:48:33,00:48:37,">> That's the worst delivery ever, isn't it?"
00:48:37,00:48:40,"Thanks for the tip, mate."
00:48:40,00:48:41,>> Deliver poo.
00:48:41,00:48:44,>> There we go.
00:48:44,00:48:45,Get this.
00:48:45,00:48:46,Get this.
00:48:46,00:48:49,"Like, at one point, the cave was swarmed with flies and she was just completely covered"
00:48:49,00:48:52,"in flies for a while, like head to toe in flies."
00:48:52,00:48:55,She didn't talk out loud except when she was filming her video diary.
00:48:55,00:48:59,"When they came down to get her, she didn't want to leave."
00:48:59,00:49:01,She was annoyed because she hadn't finished her book.
00:49:01,00:49:02,"She said, ""Why are you coming down to get me?"
00:49:02,00:49:03,"I haven't finished my book."""
00:49:03,00:49:05,>> How many books did she bring down?
00:49:05,00:49:06,How so a reader is she?
00:49:06,00:49:07,>> She got through 60 books.
00:49:07,00:49:08,>> Did she?
00:49:08,00:49:09,Wow.
00:49:09,00:49:10,That's incredible.
00:49:10,00:49:15,"So, I reckon the poo thing is to do with minimal impact caving, which is a genuine thing."
00:49:15,00:49:19,"Because if you go into a cave, it's a whole ecosystem and you don't want to disturb things"
00:49:19,00:49:20,that are going on there.
00:49:20,00:49:25,"So, they say things like avoid touching microbial mats so you don't want to mess with the communities"
00:49:25,00:49:27,that are living in the cave.
00:49:27,00:49:28,No smoking in caves.
00:49:28,00:49:30,I can't believe that.
00:49:30,00:49:35,You can't bring siggies down because it might interfere with the bats and all sorts of other
00:49:35,00:49:36,animals living there.
00:49:36,00:49:39,"No recreational drugs or alcohol while caving, they say."
00:49:39,00:49:40,">> Oh, come on."
00:49:40,00:49:41,Why the hell not that?
00:49:41,00:49:42,">> I know, right?"
00:49:42,00:49:43,>> You can't do that there.
00:49:43,00:49:47,>> Limited scratching of skin and hair because you don't want any dandruff or follicles to
00:49:47,00:49:48,get off.
00:49:48,00:49:52,"But then the big thing, which was a bit confusing to me, I had to look it up, it said, ""Always"
00:49:52,00:49:54,"make sure to bring your burrito kit."""
00:49:54,00:50:04,And your burrito kit.
00:50:04,00:50:09,Your burrito kit is this slang for a bag to store your poo.
00:50:09,00:50:15,So you bring bottles to put your urine in and you bring your burrito kit to put your
00:50:15,00:50:16,poo in.
00:50:16,00:50:21,And I discovered that burrito kit meant that by going to a caving slang web page.
00:50:21,00:50:24,"So I'm going to give you, not thieving slang, but I'm going to give you some caving slang."
00:50:24,00:50:28,>> What do you guys think air repel is?
00:50:28,00:50:29,>> Repel.
00:50:29,00:50:31,>> Repel as in like repelling.
00:50:31,00:50:33,>> Repelling as in like going down a cliff or something.
00:50:33,00:50:34,">> Yeah, exactly."
00:50:34,00:50:36,>> It sounds like when you just jump off one surface a very long way.
00:50:36,00:50:38,"It's like I'm sailing, but you've forgotten your rope."
00:50:38,00:50:39,>> Sort of.
00:50:39,00:50:41,It's when you accidentally fall down a cave.
00:50:41,00:50:45,There's the cardboard caver.
00:50:45,00:50:46,Cardboard caver.
00:50:46,00:50:50,>> Is that someone who's not very good or somebody who's got the equipment but they
00:50:50,00:50:52,don't know how to do it?
00:50:52,00:50:57,>> It's when at the first sign of wetness you decide to turn back because you don't want
00:50:57,00:50:59,to get involved with that.
00:50:59,00:51:00,Douching.
00:51:00,00:51:01,>> Oh.
00:51:01,00:51:02,>> It's when you --
00:51:02,00:51:06,">> It's when you fall down and the water goes into you, like you slide down."
00:51:06,00:51:07,>> Yeah.
00:51:07,00:51:11,>> Like that's where they have that in -- what do you call it when you're on the back of
00:51:11,00:51:12,a motor boat?
00:51:12,00:51:13,>> Water skiing.
00:51:13,00:51:14,>> Water skiing.
00:51:14,00:51:15,"Yeah, yeah."
00:51:15,00:51:17,"If you fall off and the water goes up you, that's douching."
00:51:17,00:51:18,>> I've been water skiing.
00:51:18,00:51:21,I've never had water enter me like how you're describing.
00:51:21,00:51:23,">> No, I've heard that too."
00:51:23,00:51:24,Have you?
00:51:24,00:51:25,>> I've heard it.
00:51:25,00:51:26,It's the most painful thing you could possibly experience.
00:51:26,00:51:27,">> Wow, really?"
00:51:27,00:51:28,>> You're a lucky man.
00:51:28,00:51:29,>> Wow.
00:51:29,00:51:30,I must have a tiny bum hole.
00:51:30,00:51:38,>> There's always a second over sharing moment when you take the first one's over.
00:51:38,00:51:43,">> Well, anyway, it's the practice of blocking a stream at the top of a pit."
00:51:43,00:51:44,>> I forgot the word now.
00:51:44,00:51:45,>> Douching.
00:51:45,00:51:46,Sorry.
00:51:46,00:51:50,">> You block the stream at the top of a pit, only let it to go all over your friend on"
00:51:50,00:51:54,"the rope below when they're most vulnerable, so you build up the water and then it's like"
00:51:54,00:51:55,gunging them.
00:51:55,00:51:56,Yeah.
00:51:56,00:52:00,>> Can I -- did everyone read the greatest story that was this week or last week of accidental
00:52:00,00:52:01,caving?
00:52:01,00:52:02,>> No.
00:52:02,00:52:03,>> Matilda Campbell.
00:52:03,00:52:04,I'm playing it fast on this for the word caving.
00:52:04,00:52:06,I think it was so good.
00:52:06,00:52:11,"She is in Australia, obviously, New South Wales, Hunter Valley."
00:52:11,00:52:12,She's on some rocks with her friends.
00:52:12,00:52:16,"She drops her phone in a crevice between two rocks, she thinks, I'll go and get that."
00:52:16,00:52:20,"She went face first down into this crevice, which was three meters deep between boulders,"
00:52:20,00:52:23,"got stuck head first, three meters down."
00:52:23,00:52:26,She was there for seven hours.
00:52:26,00:52:27,She had no phone reception.
00:52:27,00:52:31,"She had one friend with her who had to be like, sorry, mate, I'm going to have to go and find"
00:52:31,00:52:37,"someone and left her alone upside down, three meters down, squashed between rocks for ages."
00:52:37,00:52:42,"Eventually fire, ambulance, police and a bunch of volunteers came and it still took them"
00:52:42,00:52:44,seven hours to move these boulders.
00:52:44,00:52:46,But she's such a hero.
00:52:46,00:52:50,The lead paramedic said the whole time she was so calm and collected through the whole
00:52:50,00:52:51,thing.
00:52:51,00:52:52,I would have been frantic.
00:52:52,00:52:53,She wasn't panicked at all.
00:52:53,00:52:57,"And she was wedged in this weird S shape, so even when they'd moved the boulders they"
00:52:57,00:53:00,couldn't really get her body out for ages.
00:53:00,00:53:02,"And yeah, eventually they got her out."
00:53:02,00:53:05,And the article I read I think in the Guardian said sadly they were unable to retrieve her
00:53:05,00:53:06,phone.
00:53:06,00:53:16,Still a tragic loss.
00:53:16,00:53:17,That is it.
00:53:17,00:53:18,That is all of our facts.
00:53:18,00:53:20,Thank you so much for listening.
00:53:20,00:53:21,Thank you Manchester.
00:53:21,00:53:22,We'll be back again.
00:53:22,00:53:23,We'll be back again next week.
00:53:23,00:53:23,"For Simran, goodbye!"
