 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.960
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.560
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Manchester.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.560
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.520
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.320
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.640
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.000
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.480
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.160
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that for Einstein's 70th birthday,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.440
 mathematician Kurt Girdle gave him a sweater and a paper which proved time travel.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.520
 >> Whoa, whoa.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.080
 >> But he didn't give him the ability to go back to his 60th birthday.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.440
 >> No, I know what you're all thinking,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.120
 bit dodgy, I would not certain that he did give him the sweater.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.040
 >> Okay, brilliant.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.680
 >> A lot of places say that he did.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.680
 Some places say that his wife Adele knitted it and he never gave it to him.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.000
 But I'm gonna say that.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.200
 >> Why would he have never given it?

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.320
 Isn't that an embarrassing thing where you think it might be awkward, he won't like it?

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.320
 >> Yeah, she backed out apparently and they gave an etching in its place.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.160
 >> Whose wife then?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.840
 Einstein's wife.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.160
 >> Girdle's wife.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.360
 >> Girdle, okay, okay, okay.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.680
 >> So I should say who Girdle is.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.080
 >> Yeah.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.560
 >> Does everyone knows who Girdle is?

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.800
 >> Girdle, it does sound like an item of clothing, a Kurt Girdle.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.160
 That would be a good thing to give someone for a present, like a sort of.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.000
 >> A sexy present.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 >> A sexy, yeah.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.200
 >> You probably wouldn't give Einstein a Kurt Girdle for his birthday, not a 70th.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.720
 I'm sorry.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.080
 >> Girdle was a mathematician, German, early 20th century.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.480
 He loved his logic, and I'm talking mathematical logic.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.520
 So it's very complicated, weird stuff.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.520
 But he basically just liked disproving stuff and kind of finding holes in things

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.440
 using his logical skills.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.280
 And this was one of the things he basically.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.800
 >> Yeah, why does he appeal to you?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.480
 So strange.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.680
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.240
 >> He sounds amazing though.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.160
 >> Yeah, he is.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.360
 >> He was in a sort of archetypal obsessive genius.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.600
 >> Yeah. >> So for example,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.040
 here's an example, he used an alarm clock, but to help him to go to bed.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.760
 >> Okay, go on.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.680
 >> I think because he was so deep in his work that he needed to set an alarm clock.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.240
 And then it went off, he was like, I must go to sleep.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.800
 It's one in the morning again, I've been doing maths.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.080
 >> That's kind of nutty professor stuff.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.000
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.160
 >> So I should just explain his proof of time travel.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.320
 >> Just quickly, if you will, just 30 seconds.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.240
 >> Well, this was because Einstein had just come up with his theories and

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.840
 he was going into it and using his logic to see what could and could not be true.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.400
 And he came up with this idea of you fly your rocket really, really, really,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.440
 really fast and you're going a great big curve.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.880
 And because the universe is rotating and because light isn't going parallel,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.760
 it helps you to go back in time.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.960
 It's the real basics, I know I missed out lots of steps there.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.360
 But the main problem with it is that the universe is not rotating.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.040
 >> Right, yes.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.800
 >> So that means that all of his theory is completely up the swanee.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.240
 And it's really sad because he said this to Einstein.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.560
 And Einstein lived for another five or six years.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.480
 And Goethe used to message him every now and then, or ring him every now and

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.000
 then, and say, have they found out that my thing's true yet?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.440
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.120
 >> But surely if we simply got the universe to start spinning,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.680
 we could get this going.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.320
 >> Sure.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.520
 >> Yeah, it's worth trying, right?

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.000
 >> I'm just saying, if he said as well, if he proved it,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.160
 if he proved time travel existed, then what he was really proving was time didn't

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.280
 exist.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.600
 >> Yes, it's basically kind of, which is sort of what Einstein had done already,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.920
 right?

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.680
 So general relativity had said time is sort of like the same as space.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.480
 And it probably curves around on itself.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.920
 Again, this is really for toddlers, none of this is true.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.880
 But the time, the time job I did was that you could skip from one bit to another.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.560
 But the crucial thing was that God was proving you could go back in time.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.640
 Because Einstein obviously had already said, you can go forward in time

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.360
 faster than we already do.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.160
 That's the idea in all those sci-fi films where if you go out into very,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.360
 very distant space, you can come back to Earth and you haven't aged at all.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.080
 But your daughter is older than you are now.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.520
 That thing, that's completely uncontroversial and would happen.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.320
 Everyone knew that.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.720
 But that's not useful for people because they want to go back and

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.280
 visit people who have died.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.080
 And so yeah, he said this, and it upset people, didn't it?

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.600
 When he said that time travel could exist, to the extent that Stephen Hawking,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.760
 amazing scientist number three, said this presents too many paradoxes.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.440
 And crucially, the paradox that says, if you can go back in time,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.160
 you could go back, murder your former self.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.640
 But then you wouldn't exist to go back in time to murder yourself.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.680
 You know that the classic sci-fi, the grandfather.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.520
 >> All the people who have done that, they've already gone.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.600
 >> Yeah. >> Because they did go back and

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.920
 murder themselves, it's fine.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.400
 >> [LAUGH] >> But they weren't there to know.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.120
 >> What in all Hawking, no.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.360
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.280
 >> Here's some time travel paradoxes, seeing as we're on the subject.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.880
 >> Yeah. >> What do you think the bootstrap paradox is?

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.720
 >> So sort of pulling yourself up by your bootstrap is the phrase.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.600
 >> But you go back and you tell yourself about the horse.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.000
 You win money on a bet and you become very rich.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.240
 >> That's the back to the future paradox, yeah.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.080
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.280
 >> Well, it's officially known as the bootstrap paradox.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.240
 >> Okay.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.080
 >> And the idea is that it can't be true because things would just come out of

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.120
 nowhere, like as in, I would go back in time, tell myself how to invent fidget

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.000
 spinners and they'd come out of nowhere, but that didn't happen.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.200
 I mean, we can see- >> Is that what you would do, James?

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.480
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.040
 >> That is so tragic.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.400
 >> That is so tragic.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.040
 >> I did spend about half an hour trying to think, what would I do?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.840
 >> Yeah.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.240
 >> It's amazing, it's amazingly hard to think of fidget spinners now.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.960
 Do you know what I mean?

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.840
 Does anyone here still use a fidget spinner regularly?

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.840
 >> Yeah.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.960
 >> Right. >> Okay.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.160
 >> What do you mean it's hard to think of them now?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.000
 >> Well, there was such a big thing six years ago.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.680
 >> Yeah.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.240
 >> And it's hard to remember now that every-

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.120
 >> Quite a lot has happened since then, hasn't it really?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.400
 >> Yeah, I suppose.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.440
 >> It feels like the whole world's got a bit more complicated since fidget spinners.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.360
 >> Do you think that's when the world set in as when we all put them back in the draw?

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.680
 >> Yeah.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.640
 >> That was a distraction from the time travelers of the future.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.000
 They gave us the fidget spinners.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.880
 >> We didn't notice.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.800
 >> Trump is just a- >> That's it.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.440
 >> Can I mention a few things about Girdle?

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.080
 >> Yeah.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.080
 >> I have no idea what you guys are talking about on stage.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.920
 >> [LAUGH]

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.360
 >> So, a fascinating character, clearly, as we're saying.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.280
 He arrived in Princeton while Albert Einstein was there.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.440
 And Einstein loved him.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.600
 He loved him so much.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.360
 And he used to walk to work just so that he could walk with Girdle.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.000
 And he would do his stuff there and then go home so he could walk home with him.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.520
 It was this amazing pairing.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.080
 And people used to just be amazed if they had any contact with Girdle.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.520
 There's a story of someone saying that they were in a supermarket one time.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.960
 And they found the philosopher, Richard Rorty, standing in a total daze.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.600
 And they were like, okay, what's going on?

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.840
 And he said in a whispered tone that he'd just seen Girdle in the frozen food aisle.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.920
 >> Really?

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.280
 >> Just so starstruck to see this genius.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.800
 >> That's interesting because towards the end of his life,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.600
 his diet really changed.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.360
 And he would only eat butter, baby food and laxatives.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.160
 >> He had a really tragic end to his life.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.800
 He thought he was being poisoned, didn't he?

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.600
 And so he didn't eat to kind of defeat the people who he thought were poisoning him.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.160
 But that meant he couldn't starve.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.040
 >> Well, it was his life, Adele.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.640
 He would have her taste everything that he ate.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.440
 >> Oh, really?

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.120
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.560
 >> But yeah, he made Adele cook for him because the sweeter version is that he made

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.480
 Adele cook for him because she was the only person he could ever trust.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.760
 And then when she got sick and went into hospital in the late '70s,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.440
 was the early '80s, then he did diet because he couldn't eat anything else.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.480
 >> And he was very, very troubled.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.920
 I mean, it's not worth being an amazing mathematician because you are gonna be troubled.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.920
 >> Can I tell you guys about his time as a spy?

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.360
 I don't need to tell you this, this is amazing.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.240
 Okay, so he grew up in Vienna, left for Princeton in 1940, right?

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:12.480
 There was a Viennese physicist called Hans Thurding who wanted to warn the US

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.040
 government and the US president about the risk of the Nazis developing a nuclear bomb.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.680
 So Hans Thurding wanted to contact Einstein to pass the message on.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.000
 There's no way of contacting him from Vienna without the Nazis reading the

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.760
 message, intercepting the call, bugging him, whatever, can't be done.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.200
 So he thought, Girdel, Girdel is going to Princeton.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.920
 Okay, so I'll give him the task of warning Einstein, he is the message.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.320
 Girdel then gets trapped in this nightmare of bureaucracy, he can't go.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.120
 He has to apply for a visa, then the US consulate is sort of swamped,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.360
 the Nazi bureaucracy, he then is declared fit to serve in the German army.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.680
 Nightmare, nightmare, nightmare, nightmare.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.600
 He can't get out of Vienna and get to Princeton and tell Einstein.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:54.760
 Eventually he got out, he went to the USA through Moscow, Vlad Vostok, Japan,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.840
 San Francisco, all the way across America to Princeton, took him two months.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.640
 And then when he got to Einstein, he just said, oh, Hans Thurding says hello, by the way.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.160
 >> [LAUGH]

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.760
 >> Slightly forgot to pass on the message about the Nazis developing a nuclear bomb.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.640
 >> My God. >> So many stories where he

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:18.040
 seemed such a liability in that kind of respect, so when he was in America,

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.720
 he got the chance to sit the citizen test, and he started reading the Constitution.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.400
 And he worked out that the Constitution, the way it was worded in America,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.800
 legally meant that it was possible for someone to become a dictator and

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.280
 set up a fascist regime.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.640
 >> No, definitely not possible, I don't think, really don't think that's possible.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.840
 >> When does this show go out?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.040
 We're recording it in late October.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.160
 >> So he basically was heading towards going to do his oath.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.320
 And Einstein went with him because he was like, I know you're gonna cock this up.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.400
 So they arrive, but then the judge who is presiding over the whole thing sees

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.280
 Einstein and goes, my God, please, gentlemen, come up to my room.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.120
 And so they go up and they sit with him, and Einstein's freaking out.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:03.000
 Goedl's having a chat, and the judge says that Germany was under an evil dictatorship.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.120
 Fortunately, that's not possible in America.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.960
 On the contrary, says Goedl, and starts to explain what he found.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.440
 And the judge at Einstein just went, and he took the oath and got it.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.800
 >> But yeah, he really, what a liability.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.960
 >> And that was the classic sort of wanting to use logic to prove things, right?

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.560
 So he also used logic to prove that God existed.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.360
 But he wouldn't publish it because he thought that if he did,

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.240
 then people would think that he thought God existed.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.160
 But actually, it was just a mathematical bit of fun that he was doing.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.200
 >> Right.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.440
 >> Was it a bit of fun?

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.880
 I don't know if bit of fun was one of the top elements of his character.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.200
 I have to say, Goedl.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.680
 >> Well, for him, maths was fun.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.520
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.200
 >> I don't think it, well, I disagree.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.360
 I think he was a very sad person.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.280
 But I do think he might have had, the one join his life might have been Adele,

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.120
 who was such an interesting person to marry, right?

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.240
 Because she was a dancer.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.920
 She'd been a dancer in a cabaret club called The Moth in Vienna.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.720
 She was not well educated.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.960
 >> I just like the idea of a night club called The Moth.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.160
 >> Yeah, because all the dancers just constantly pass her away at the center.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.200
 >> [LAUGH]

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.600
 >> That was what it was, and she got very concussed.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.560
 And that's why she married this weirdo.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.440
 She was a foot care specialist.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.800
 Just what a strange person for him to marry.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.480
 And she really protected him.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.000
 He was quite dappy, as Dan says.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.920
 He was a bit, didn't quite know the right way to behave socially a lot of the time.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.760
 And at one point when he was living in Vienna,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.600
 he was mistaken for a Jewish person at a time when anti-Semitism, of course,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.000
 was incredibly rife, and he was attacked and beaten up by Nazi thugs.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.600
 And she beat them off with her umbrella.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.400
 >> Wow. >> Really?

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.440
 >> Yeah. >> That's very cool.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.360
 He hated chatting with people, right?

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.720
 Like, that was part of that character.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.800
 When he really wanted to avoid someone,

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.840
 he would schedule a rendezvous at a precise time and place,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.400
 and then make sure he was not there.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.280
 >> [LAUGH]

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.240
 >> That's tremendous.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.560
 >> Yeah, we gotta move on in a sec, by the way.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.880
 >> He was, this is a sort of related thing about him avoiding people.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.960
 He nearly wasn't understood at all after his death, as in all his papers.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.240
 And it was thought that they were in code, that nobody could understand.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.320
 And it actually, it turned out, it was a thing called Gabelsberger's script.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.560
 And that was a special German shorthand.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.360
 And Gerdl was almost the last, he was in the last year of people who ever

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.680
 learned this specific kind of shorthand, nobody else knew it.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.940
 And obviously, for decades after that, so 50 years later,

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.000
 you just faced with these squiggles, you think, I have no idea what this is.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.520
 And he was in the very last class way back in the 20s to learn it.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.400
 >> So cool.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.320
 >> One more thing on time travel, maybe.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.560
 So back to the future we mentioned earlier, and back to the future three.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.160
 I believe, how do they get to 88 miles an hour?

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.200
 >> It's on a train.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.360
 >> Well, they use a train to push it.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.200
 >> To push the car, yeah.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.640
 >> Well, the climactic bit, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.320
 So I read- >> You're on, they just used the car.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:55.840
 You're gone.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:02.520
 >> I read the, I read the user manual of the DeLorean car from back in the day.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.560
 And it specifically says on page 35, to avoid damage to your vehicle,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.720
 do not attempt to start the engine by pushing with another vehicle.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.800
 >> Really?

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.080
 >> So they may have gone in the future, but they've lost their warranty.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.600
 >> Wait.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.560
 >> [LAUGH]

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.920
 [MUSIC]

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.200
 >> It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.920
 My fact this week is that the author of the international bestselling book,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.600
 Rich Dad, Poor Dad, which taught readers to be financially intelligent,

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.360
 is currently $1 billion in debt.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.120
 >> [LAUGH]

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.360
 >> $1 billion.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.960
 >> $1 billion.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.680
 >> It's a lot.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.000
 >> It's a lot of dollars for one person to be in debt.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.480
 >> Yeah.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.080
 >> Has he ever been a rich dad, or is he?

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.520
 >> He was a rich dad.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.760
 So Robert Kiyosaki is his name.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:59.320
 It was a novel narrative, basically, where he tried to use an analogy of having

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.600
 one dad and a stepdad, one of which went down the classic road of going through

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.600
 business the normal way.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.160
 And then another one who was independently financial as a result of

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.200
 the path that he'd chosen.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.040
 And it was showing how you could go from rags to riches, basically,

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.840
 by not doing the normal thing.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.360
 Massive seller, some numbers say it's sold as many as 40 million copies worldwide.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.760
 >> So that would be about a billion dollars, would it?

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.680
 >> Did he buy them all?

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.520
 >> [LAUGH]

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.440
 >> Wait, how has he done this?

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.720
 How has he ended up so indebted?

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.280
 >> Well, in the article that I read about it, he says, I'm $1 billion in debt.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.320
 And I don't mind.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.480
 He's kind of fine with it.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.280
 >> It's because he doesn't have to deal with it, right?

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.120
 >> Yeah. >> As he says,

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.880
 it's the government's problem at this stage.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.120
 >> Exactly. >> It's kind of true of debt.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.200
 >> Yeah, he says he uses debt as money.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.000
 So it doesn't work, it doesn't work for a while.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.040
 >> It does work for a while, it does.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.680
 >> It doesn't work in a shop, does it?

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.520
 >> Just put it on the tab again, at some point.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.320
 >> That's what a credit card is.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.280
 >> Yeah.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.080
 >> My God.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.840
 >> [LAUGH]

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.480
 >> So this guy's just got the biggest credit card in the world.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.000
 >> He's got a $1 billion overdraft on his Sainsbury's credit card.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.600
 It is sort of true to who he is, right?

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.960
 Because he's sort of saying, cheat your way into financial health.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.520
 And I really couldn't work out what I thought of him, because the book,

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.840
 he says it's nonfiction and he claims it's a very true story.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.880
 His dad was the poor dad, his best friend's dad was the rich dad.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.120
 And they took financial advice from the rich dad, who basically said,

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.960
 people are idiots, poor people are idiots.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.640
 People who aren't upper class are idiots because they think that the way to get

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.320
 rich is to work really, really, really hard and save all your money.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.440
 That's bullshit.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.920
 All you've got to do is make money work for you.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.080
 That's what rich people are doing.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.240
 And it is sort of true, right?

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.760
 Rich people get their millions and they invest them sensibly and

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.960
 they get all this advice and they make loads more.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.880
 But the thing is, this dad didn't exist.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.400
 So he made up that story.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:45.920
 >> What do you mean?

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.640
 Which dad didn't exist?

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.200
 >> The rich dad, only the poor dad exists.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.720
 And I think that might be a lesson to take away from this.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.480
 >> Yeah, he's had multiple companies that all have largely gone under.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:02.320
 So in 1977, he had a company called Rippers, which were nylon and velcro wallets.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.520
 So you get your Ripper and went bankrupt, just didn't work out.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.400
 His rich dad, poor dad company, rich global.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.800
 >> It's funny to lose money on a wallet company.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.920
 >> That's quite, how can you screw up a wallet?

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.400
 >> He turned rich dad, poor dad, into a company.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.680
 So it became the rich dad company, rich global, LLC.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.160
 That went bankrupt as well in 2012.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.320
 >> The other books, do you know the names of the other books?

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.240
 He's written 26, which one do you want?

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.880
 >> Rich dad's cash flow quadrant.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.120
 >> Oh, yeah.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:31.720
 >> Sounds dubious.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.360
 Rich dad's rich kid smart kid, sort of reverse it.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.000
 Rich dad's retire, young retire rich.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.600
 >> Okay.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.720
 >> Rich dad's guide to becoming rich without cutting up your credit cards.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.240
 Rich dad's who took my money.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.080
 >> It does feel like he's just put a load of words in a hat.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.640
 >> Oh, yeah.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.720
 >> A lot of them are rich and die.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.600
 >> Yeah, it's true.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.680
 >> And then he wrote, we want you to be rich.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.680
 Two men, one message, co-authored with Donald Trump.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.040
 >> No way!

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:58.840
 >> Yeah, they paired up.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.760
 >> Because basically, Richard, he sounded like such an on-the-level businessman

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.280
 before you said he was in business with Donald Trump.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.480
 So how sad.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.160
 >> Yeah, no, they found each other because both their books,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.360
 The Art of the Deal, did massive best book ever.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.600
 And the other one was really well received as well.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.720
 So they thought let's come together.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.880
 And they wrote two books in total with each other.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.360
 >> Wow.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.960
 >> The first self-help book was called Self-Help, I think.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:30.240
 The idea of a self-help book is named after this book by Samuel Smiles.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.880
 And his book came out in the same year as On the Origin of the Species.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.840
 And sold a fuckload more.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.120
 >> Really?

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.760
 >> And his idea was basically all you have to do is work really, really, really,

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.920
 really hard and you'll make loads of money.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.400
 So it's kind of like, there's some advice in there, but

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:52.360
 it's mostly a list of really rich people who slept two hours a night.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.760
 >> Or successful people, right?

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.880
 I read it is funny.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.920
 It's really weird because it is just, it's literally mini biography after mini

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.040
 biography after mini biography.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.280
 There's a biography of about 1000 people in there.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.760
 You've got Galileo, Robert Peel, Prime Minister James Watt.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.840
 Everyone's successful and just what they did.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.520
 And what they did always sounds really unappealing and like they had no fun.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.960
 >> And he said that what you need to do is work hard like these people and

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.800
 not have what normal people have the perverted life.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.400
 >> Right.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.560
 >> Uh-oh.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.120
 >> Was the great, great grandfather or great, great something of Bear Grills?

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.000
 >> He was, yeah.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.500
 >> Yes.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.680
 >> That's cool, yeah.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.080
 >> Samuel smiles, Bear Grills, both sentence people.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.800
 >> Yes.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.520
 >> Interesting, proof of thought.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.160
 >> What does Bear Grills mean in a sentence?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.720
 As in the right to Bear Grills.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.360
 >> [LAUGH]

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.600
 >> That's right.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.000
 >> Or you have lots of grills if you're from London.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.680
 >> I got Bear Grills, yeah, yeah.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.160
 >> Self-help was so influential.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.680
 It was one of the first ever books translated into Japanese, okay?

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.320
 >> Okay.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.600
 >> From English to Japanese.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.760
 And Japan had been a really closed society until very recently before this.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.800
 >> Yeah. >> And basically,

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.520
 that was the first book translated into Japanese.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.560
 All the books he mentioned in self-help, this is how successful self-help was in

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:12.000
 Japanese, all the books he mentions in the book then became bestsellers in Japan.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.520
 >> Yeah, right.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.840
 >> And all the books he did- >> What a hellish job for

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.520
 the publisher, so the publisher published that and

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.240
 then went, shit, I've got to publish another thousand books so

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240
 that everyone gets this one.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.720
 >> What are we gonna do with all the money we're making?

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.720
 >> [LAUGH]

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.840
 >> What are you talking about?

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.280
 >> You're right.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.920
 >> Napoleon Hill, have you heard of him?

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.440
 >> Yeah, of course, yeah, Think and Grow Rich.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.400
 >> You're right, Think and Grow Rich,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.120
 which as far as I can tell is just a con, right?

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.480
 It's like, if you think of something, the world will give it to you.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.960
 >> It's, if anyone knows the book by Ronda Byrne, The Secret.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.080
 >> Yes, I'm not saying that's a con because I don't know whether she's still

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.320
 active and suing, I'm trying to get the book that is based on.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.520
 >> Yeah, it's based on that.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.560
 >> Think and Grow Rich is a con, yeah.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.320
 >> Yeah, so that first one is the con.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.280
 >> And he's definitely dead, right?

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.720
 >> He's so, well, this is the interesting thing about him.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.800
 >> [LAUGH]

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.120
 >> He is, but he was involved with this bizarre cult.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.400
 He had loads and loads of failed businesses.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.840
 >> Are the cults still suing?

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.800
 >> They have gone out of business as well, so it was fun.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.880
 They were called the master metaphysicians.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.720
 And they came up with this scheme of raising an immortal human, okay?

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.040
 So they adopted this baby girl, a real human baby girl.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.840
 She was called Jean Gawnd.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.560
 They pronounced that they were going to raise her a vegetarian.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.720
 So good, tick, you know, one small woof.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.120
 >> And they all liked it, but they were too weak to say anything.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.280
 >> [LAUGH]

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.360
 >> If you like that comment, please ask one of your stronger,

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.760
 meatier brethren around you to give a loud roar at Raw approval.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.160
 >> Yeah.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.320
 >> But they adopted this girl.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.760
 I mean, this baby child, they adopted into this cult.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.200
 And they said, we're going to make her vegetarian.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.680
 And also, we're only going to think positive thoughts about her.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.520
 We're going to surround her with this kind of bath, this ambient bath.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.200
 >> That's tough as a parent, though, isn't it?

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.240
 >> [LAUGH]

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.080
 >> We all love our kids, but always positive.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.160
 >> Yeah. >> You're absolutely right.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.560
 >> And they didn't, they said no one tell her about the concept of death.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.160
 So she just won't know that that's a thing that you would do.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.080
 >> It was totally bizarre.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.320
 >> Yeah. >> Napoleon Hill was her godfather.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.120
 This was in 1939, this was happening, so everyone involved is long dead.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.080
 >> And is there a big reveal where actually she's Taylor Swift?

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.640
 It worked.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.960
 >> [LAUGH]

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.280
 >> They eventually just returned the baby to her mother and sort of said stuff.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.480
 >> It was after 15 months, it just didn't work out.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.240
 >> She would be, what kind of 80 something now?

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.160
 So she might, she might, well, still be around.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.280
 It may have worked.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.560
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.600
 >> Can't believe they gave up after 15 months.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.200
 Jesus Christ, all parents want to do that, for God's sake.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.360
 >> [LAUGH]

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.760
 >> But yeah, that book as well, that is possibly the best selling business book

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.480
 of all time to think and grow rich.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.520
 They estimate about 80 million copies of salt.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.200
 And the idea that was Napoleon Hill interviewed Andrew Carnegie,

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.600
 one of the richest men in America, most successful men.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.280
 He set him on a 20 year challenge to go and interview all of the most interesting

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.440
 people around the US.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.120
 And multiple people who've studied the life of Napoleon Hill,

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.560
 looked through all his stuff, have all said, we don't think he ever met Andrew

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.400
 Carnegie.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.760
 We don't think he even met any of these people in the book.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.760
 It's astonishing, this is the best selling book.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.200
 >> And is it like the other people are kind of happy to be mentioned?

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.080
 Because it shows that they're really, you know, successful.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.360
 >> I think most of them were dead.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.360
 So Carnegie was dead at that point.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.280
 Edison, I think, was dead at that point.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.440
 >> The old Andrew Ontemurray get out claws, make sure the people are dead, and

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.920
 they can't complain about the fact you've lied about them.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.800
 And what's so weird about that is that, the person who wrote, well,

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.520
 I think it's probably the most famous self-help book of all time.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.120
 How to win friends and influence people, you know, everyone told that,

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.320
 everyone knows the phrase.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.480
 It was the first sort of modern day genre self-help book by Dale Carnegie,

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.440
 who was actually born Dale Carnegie.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.000
 But he gave a speech once in Carnegie Hall and thought, hey,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.520
 Andrew Carnegie was successful.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.320
 I'll name myself after him instead and change the spelling of his name.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.920
 >> There's not much of a change, though.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.800
 >> It's not a huge change, no.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.240
 But it was an amazing book.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.800
 I, Self-Help is a bullshit genre, really, isn't it?

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.040
 But this, well, we can talk about it later.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.880
 No, and I'm sure it's fine.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.600
 But this really was quite good.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.200
 The idea of it was be sincere, be kind, we'll be interested in people.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.880
 He said, you can win more friends in two months by being genuinely interested in

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.480
 people than you would in two years by getting people to be interested in you.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.880
 And the only reason he wrote it was because he wanted to write the great

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.280
 American novel, really desperate to, wrote this whole novel.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.680
 This is early 1930s, went to the publishers and they said, this is terrible.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.120
 You can't write novels, stop trying.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.040
 >> I thought you were going to say, I'm afraid so, this is Moby Dick.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.160
 You've just written it out again.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.840
 >> [LAUGH]

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.640
 >> He did, he wrote in his private time too, Dale Carnegie.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:45.800
 He wrote, he kept a folder, which was entitled, damned fool things I have done.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.520
 >> Yes.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.400
 >> And any social misstep he made, any faux pas.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.200
 If you ever made someone feel awkward or uncomfortable,

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.320
 he would just write it down and file it away.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.160
 And so he could kind of learn from it.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.000
 So he wasn't kind of walking the walk of self-help as well.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.240
 >> I keep one off the back of reading that book.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:01.920
 >> Do you?

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.120
 >> Yeah, I have one.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.760
 I have an idiot diary and it is full.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.760
 >> Yeah. >> It is on a daily, yeah.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.840
 >> So Dale Carnegie would, mostly he would dictate them to his secretary.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.120
 Because he was very successful at this point.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.800
 But sometimes he was so embarrassed by whatever he'd done or said,

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.640
 that he would just privately write it down in the wrong hand.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.960
 >> You must've read a lot of self-help books, Stan, right?

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.760
 >> [LAUGH]

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.840
 >> And one day you're going to find the one that works for you.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.840
 And it's all going to turn around.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.560
 >> Which is the best one, which is the best.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.560
 >> I love that one.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.720
 It's a genuinely good book.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.880
 >> It does seem like a genuine book.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.320
 >> Yeah.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.000
 There was one written by his wife, wasn't there, Mrs. Dale Carnegie.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.360
 Which was called How to Help Your Husband Get Ahead.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.200
 >> No.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.160
 >> Yeah.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.240
 >> No way.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.120
 >> If you have a job or career of your own,

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.480
 would you be willing to give it up if it would advance your husband's interests?

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.520
 If not, you are more interested in promoting yourself than promoting your husband.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.760
 >> No way, Mrs. Carnegie.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.800
 >> Yeah.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.440
 >> I'll get back to that one.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.120
 >> [LAUGH]

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.440
 >> One of the fun things about the internet coming to rise in Kindle books and

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.760
 all that sort of stuff is you suddenly get access to all these books that you never

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.240
 knew existed and the self-help genre has some extraordinary ones.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.880
 I found one called How to Land a Top Paying Pierogi Maker's Job.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.320
 Now, that's dumplings, right?

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.720
 So How to Land a Top Paying Dumpling Maker's Job by Ashley McFadden.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.080
 But then this one got me, which was by Donald L.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.160
 Wilson, Natural Bust Enlargement with Total Mindpower.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.960
 >> [LAUGH]

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:39.160
 >> How to use the other 90% of your mind to increase the size of your breasts.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.480
 >> So it only works on your breasts, you can't stare across a room.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.960
 >> [LAUGH]

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.360
 >> I'm trying to help you.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.560
 >> [LAUGH]

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.960
 >> You gave up your career for me, let me give something back.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:59.300
 >> [LAUGH]

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.000
 >> It is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.280
 >> My fact this week is that during the Mexican Revolution,

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.960
 the women in the army traveled on train roofs because the horses took up all

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.920
 the room inside the carriages.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.240
 >> [LAUGH]

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.760
 >> Right, that sounds bad.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.220
 >> It does, but it's- >> Have you ever tried to

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.440
 display the horse to stand on a train carriage roof?

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.880
 >> It's very hard.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.480
 >> Have you ever tried to persuade a woman to stand on top of it?

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.160
 >> I never have, I never have.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.360
 >> You only have a book one seat, don't you, and then it's laps or roof.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.440
 >> One of the big issues apparently is the beating sun.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.320
 It's a very hot place to be on top of a train.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.200
 >> I mean, it makes sense, you're very exposed.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:41.640
 >> Yes.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.080
 >> They do have big sombreros though, looking at a picture.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.200
 >> They do, and these women famously wore big sombreros.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.680
 And I mean, I think traveling on top of a train sounds super fun.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.360
 But, so I don't mean to present this fact, it's an anti-feminist thing.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.280
 They probably wanted to do it, but this was- >> There's the anti-feminist.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.160
 >> [LAUGH]

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.360
 >> This was Mexican Revolution, which I'm sure I don't need to remind you,

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.760
 around from 1910 to about 1920, and they were quite famous these women.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:13.240
 They were known as soldaderas, and they existed before the Mexican Revolution,

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.920
 in other Mexican wars in the 19th century.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.600
 They were largely women who traveled with their male family members,

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.400
 their husbands, or their sons, to provide them with cooking, nursing,

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.800
 company, because that wasn't really provided by the state, to the army.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.680
 So armies would travel with their partners.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.460
 There was one soldier who was once asked why he was making his wife come into

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.480
 battle with him, and he said, shall I starve then?

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.600
 Who shall make my tortillas but my wife?

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.000
 >> [LAUGH]

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.260
 >> They do sound very cool.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.040
 >> Yeah. >> Are they the same

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.600
 as last Adelitas?

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.440
 >> Yes, they are the same.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.800
 Adelitas was a name that was introduced in the revolution.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.480
 And it was after an apparent companion of Pancho Villa,

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.840
 who was one of the many revolutionary heroes, but she didn't actually exist.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.080
 But they were named after her.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.400
 >> Okay.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.680
 >> Because some of the women just fought as women.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.280
 >> Yep. >> Some of them dressed up as men and

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.000
 then fought.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.280
 >> Yep, yeah. >> Some of them dressed as men and

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.240
 then just decided to stay men after the revolution was over.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.400
 Emilio Robles was born, Emilio Robles.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.720
 And then just fought as a commander in charge of hundreds of men,

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.360
 won lots of respect, apparently through drinking and womanizing.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.480
 >> Yes. >> Okay.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:31.520
 >> And then lived the rest of his life as Emilio, married a lady,

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.800
 adopted a daughter.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.880
 >> Yeah. >> And that was that.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.160
 >> Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.760
 And they're known of and spoken of today, the ones who fought.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:44.200
 Often the ones who fought rode sidesaddle and they rode in long dresses and

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.600
 they kicked up dust with their horses to disorient the opposition.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.080
 Which I'm sure wasn't the main method of attack, but.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.720
 >> The other thing is that a lot of them had this braided sort of

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.680
 buns on the side of their head.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.640
 And George Lucas told Time Magazine that that's where he got his idea for

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.800
 Princess Leia's style. >> No way.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.320
 >> Yeah, in the, in one of the museums of Star Wars,

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.320
 they have a photo of Clara de la Rocha.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.840
 And you can see the layer buns there.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.080
 So yeah, the Mexican Revolution gave us Princess Leia.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.600
 >> Should we say what the Mexican Revolution was about?

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.000
 >> It was about giving us buns for Princess Leia's.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 >> Yeah, completely, yeah.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.400
 Freedom for Mexico, basically, from whom?

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.200
 >> Dictatorship.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.560
 >> Dictators in the capitalists.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.800
 >> From Porfirio Diaz, who was in charge for quite a long time.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:38.000
 And he held a banquet to celebrate more than quarter of a century of stability.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.080
 And about two weeks later, the revolution broke out.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.760
 >> [LAUGH]

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.480
 >> Just in the nick of time you got there then.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.480
 >> It was really crazy, wasn't it?

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.920
 Because it was about ten years of, someone, he was overthrown.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.000
 >> Yeah. >> And then the guy who replaced him was

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.080
 overthrown. >> Yeah.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.720
 >> And then maybe the next guy, I think,

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.280
 was also overthrown, a lot of turmoil.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.640
 >> It was very complicated.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.200
 >> I've had her in the country having several leaders in the space of a few years.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.440
 And I've been going to absolute.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:08.040
 >> It was one of my favorite moments of it was during some of this turmoil.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.600
 >> We've all got a favorite moment.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.720
 >> By the Mexican Revolution.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.360
 >> There was a guy called Victoriano Huerta.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:20.040
 And he was actually the person who, the second dictator, who deposed the good guy.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.320
 So Huerta- >> So it's bad guys, I'm sorry.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.160
 >> We had to simplify it somehow, there's good guys, there's bad guys.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.600
 Huerta, bad guy, deposes Madero, good guy.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.040
 But he's like, okay, I want it to look a bit like the presidency I want to have now

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.160
 is legitimate.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.440
 But what I've done is I've deposed and actually executed, oops,

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.880
 the current president and the vice president.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.440
 So he made the person who'd been third in line to the presidency,

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:49.160
 president, for literally some say 15, some say 45 minutes.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.040
 Just so that this guy could appoint him- >> Huerta.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.660
 >> Who's past the Liz Truss of the resolution.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.360
 >> Yeah, I mean, he didn't necessarily want it.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.000
 He's literally there so that he could make Huerta, Secretary of the Interior,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.800
 which meant Huerta was next in line for the presidency.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.200
 And then Mr. 15 minutes stepped aside and was like,

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.600
 Huerta, you're next in line.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.920
 >> Who does that fool?

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.720
 It doesn't fool anyone.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.200
 >> It's weird, what's the fucking point?

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.480
 Just kill the third guy as well and see who's the presidency.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.600
 >> Don't have killed the first or second, I mean, just, yeah, yeah.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.360
 >> No, good advice, don't kill anyone.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.320
 >> That's the message.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.200
 >> [LAUGH]

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:30.460
 >> Pantrovia, Pantrovia was a great general.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.360
 And he is famous mainly in the war for

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.560
 having struck a deal with the mutual film company to

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.720
 sell the film rights for his own battles in exchange for cash, basically.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.080
 And propaganda venue, and there are lots of myths saying they made him retake

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.000
 battles, entire battles, if they, sorry, we didn't have the camera running.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.200
 >> It's surely hard to get everyone involved in that retake.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.400
 >> [LAUGH]

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.400
 >> He's picking up money.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.240
 >> [LAUGH]

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.600
 >> So there's a bit of back and forth about it.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:03.280
 But basically, it does seem absolutely true that he got 20% of the box office

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.520
 from the films of his own battles.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.640
 >> Amazing.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.640
 >> There was a fantastic bit.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.560
 Film crews would often wait for a battle to die down.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.360
 And then they would approach some nearby soldiers and say,

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.000
 look, can you recreate what just happened?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.080
 >> So that did actually happen?

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.720
 >> That, I mean, lots of this did happen, yeah.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.640
 >> You would wait for it to die down, wouldn't you?

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.400
 It was a guy just armed with a camera, I think.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.000
 >> Some of it they filmed, and it wasn't regarded as dramatic enough, and

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 it had to be restaged, because, yeah, I mean, but some of it they would ask

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.160
 nearby soldiers to reconstruct.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.520
 And there's a fantastic moment where a group of Mexican soldiers realized

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.480
 that they are being portrayed as cowards in the film that is being shot of them.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.080
 They decided to start fighting for real, and then an entirely new battle breaks

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.480
 out because they were so unhappy with the way they were being portrayed in the film

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.720
 of the battle that just happened.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.520
 >> It's so weird.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.360
 >> I love it, I love it.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:52.320
 >> In 1914, there was the New York Times wrote a news announcement which said,

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.480
 Pancho Villa, general in command of the constitutionalist army in northern Mexico

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:02.280
 will in future carry on his warfare against President Huerta as a full partner in

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.720
 the moving pictures venture with Harry E. Aitken.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.120
 >> It's an astonishing announcement, and he did it.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.400
 Zapata, who was another one, Huerta did it as well.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.720
 Supposedly his deal meant that they would screen it for him so

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.480
 that he could censor it before it went out.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.160
 >> Yeah, the Mexican Revolution, it seems that a lot of the army was

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.720
 stoned a lot of the time.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.640
 >> Really?

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.640
 >> It's kind of hard to find the evidence of this because on a lot of the marijuana

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:31.040
 websites, they just make shit up a lot of the time.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.160
 >> But it does seem true that actually a lot of them were stoned.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.400
 The Yakuis, who were one of the groups of peasants, they were hired marijuana.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.680
 They fought like demonic spirits.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.960
 They ground out yards and still got nowhere.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.320
 Then they staggered about here and they're confused.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:51.600
 >> I don't remember the fighting like demonic spirits element of being stoned.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.040
 I remember staggering about confused elements.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.840
 >> Does anyone have any tortillas?

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.200
 >> I forgot my wife.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:06.000
 >> Did you hear about Wenceslau Moguel?

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.080
 This is incredible.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:11.440
 Okay, this was a guy who was caught up in the fighting, as all of Mexico was.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.360
 This was 1915.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:17.120
 Incidentally, the reason I think it doesn't get as much play over here is that

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.720
 the First World War was going on for 1914 to 18.

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.400
 So like that attracted a lot of attention over here.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.720
 But there was a lot of stuff going on over there.

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:28.920
 >> We had the big Hollywood hit, but they had the Art House movie, didn't they?

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.600
 >> Yes, people went to see.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.680
 >> Wow.

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.880
 >> Anyway, Wenceslau Moguel gets caught up in this conflict.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.920
 And he was accused of being a revolutionary.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:42.760
 He was not tried and then he was sentenced to death and

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.920
 the typical method at the time, firing squad.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.520
 And as far as I can tell, Moguel is more or

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.800
 less the only person ever to have survived a firing squad.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.000
 >> Okay.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.180
 >> He was shot eight or nine times.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.520
 >> Okay. >> The coup de grace was,

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.480
 he was shot actually in the forehead.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:06.360
 >> Wow. >> He survived, he was in pain.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.160
 >> [LAUGH]

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.320
 >> He was in severe pain.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.040
 >> But the federales, the people who had shot him, they just moved on to whatever

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.880
 they were doing next, and he was incredibly, he was still alive.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.840
 He managed to crawl to safety, he recovered from his wounds.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.960
 He lived it till 1976.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.160
 >> How did he crawl to safety?

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.000
 >> I have no idea, I mean he was permanently scarred and disfigured.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.680
 He clearly had been through something unbelievably traumatic, but he lived.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.800
 And he was known as El Fusilado, the one who has been shot.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.160
 And that was his nickname from then on.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.840
 There is a song about him by anyone now?

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.640
 >> Robbie Williams.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.280
 >> Chamba Wamba.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.380
 >> I get knocked down.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.600
 >> I get knocked down again.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:45.480
 >> [LAUGH]

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.080
 >> That's incredible.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.400
 >> It's an extraordinary story.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:53.320
 >> So does it count the surviving firing squad, what Pancho Villa did,

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.520
 which he was sentenced to death by firing a squad in about 1913 when Huerta was

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.160
 in charge, and Madero, who was actually president,

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.640
 who was Villa's ally, sent a stay of execution.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.560
 He was like, shit, Pancho Villa's being executed, I don't want that.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.280
 Sent a stay of execution to say, do not kill this guy.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.680
 Pancho Villa was standing there, firing a squad, guns cocked pointing at him.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:19.360
 When the person arrived, waving the letter, saying, stop, stop.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.400
 And so they didn't shoot him.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.280
 That's film stuff.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.640
 >> Maybe that was all set up for the film.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.880
 >> [LAUGH]

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:29.800
 >> He had a nickname as well, Pancho Villa, which also is a song.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:33.280
 So there's quite a lot of tunes coming out, which was La Cucaracha.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.040
 >> Really?

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.360
 >> I don't think the song is based on him, but that was his nickname.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:37.960
 >> Yeah.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.880
 >> Is it not, I mean, because what the hell does that mean?

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.800
 >> No, it is Cockroach.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.040
 >> Little Cockroach.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.440
 And the Cockroach, in the most popular version of that song, is stoned.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.840
 So. >> Yeah.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.800
 But they called him the Cockroach because Pancho Villa,

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.720
 he was like a revolutionary in Northern Mexico.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:57.320
 He wasn't very happy about America was kind of getting involved.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.560
 And so he decided to attack America on his own with some of his mates.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.600
 >> [LAUGH]

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.440
 >> And they went in and sort of shot up a town in America and

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.400
 then legged it back into Mexico.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:11.200
 And America was not very happy about that because they didn't have World War I

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.440
 to bother about quite yet.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.040
 >> [LAUGH]

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.800
 >> And so they went in and they went after him and they went after him for

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.040
 years and years and tried to find him and they couldn't find him.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.680
 And that's why they called him the Cockroach.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.680
 Because it's like, you know, you know, he's there under the fridge somewhere,

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.120
 but you don't know where he is exactly.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.000
 >> Really?

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.200
 >> Yeah. >> Okay.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:31.640
 >> One thing about Pancho Villa is according to the new American bartender's

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:36.160
 guide, if you go into Mexico City and you say you want tequila,

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:42.160
 estilo Pancho Villa, por favor, which is tequila in the Pancho Villa style,

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.160
 that's the coolest way of asking for tequila.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:50.600
 But if you order it, went to Slav Margwell style, you get nine shots delivered.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.560
 >> [LAUGH]

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.720
 [MUSIC]

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.520
 >> Okay, we need to move on to our final fact of the show.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.240
 It is time for our final fact and that is Andy.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:09.360
 >> My fact is, there is a cave in Greece where water flows uphill.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:09.880
 >> How?

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.360
 >> Well, I should say, I'll just quickly say where I got this.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:20.840
 I recently judged a competition of a fact competition from Descent Magazine,

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:25.040
 which is the caving Bible, really, you know, and this was the winning fact.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.680
 And Descent Magazine, I should just say, is great.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.880
 And I did look up if it could be confused with anything.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:32.040
 There is also Descent Magazine, which is politics.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.040
 Descent Magazine, which is a Canadian literary mag.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.040
 Decent Magazine, just a magazine for men, I think.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:43.240
 Discount Magazine, Decant Magazine, and Long and Short, which is a Daxon Magazine.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.720
 >> Wow, that's great.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.480
 >> That's good.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.360
 >> But this one-

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.840
 >> Long and Short is a great name.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.040
 >> That's incredible.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.120
 >> We'll get into the fact, but this is a bi-monthly magazine.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.280
 It's been going since 1969.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.120
 I'm so fascinated by, did you meet everyone at Descent Magazine?

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.680
 How many facts came in?

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.960
 >> It was almost an email-based competition judging thing for me.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.320
 I didn't get to go to the ball.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:10.880
 But this island is in Kefalonia, an Ionian island.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.920
 And it has a cave where the sea flows into the land.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.040
 Okay, so it goes the other way, confusing.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.200
 And it makes its way through the island.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.840
 There's kind of porous rock under the island.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.600
 And it comes out on the other side of the island, right?

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.600
 But scientists were interested in what was happening to it.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.960
 And they put in some very strong dye in the water in the bit

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:34.040
 where it goes into the island's rocks to see what happened.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.960
 They used 140 kilos of dye.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.520
 So they dyed a huge amount of the water.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.200
 And what they found is it emerged two weeks later

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.560
 on the other side of the island, which is nine miles across.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.080
 >> Amazing.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.320
 >> And it emerged higher than sea level on the other side.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:47.920
 >> Really?

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.080
 So has it gone through the porous rocks?

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.120
 Or is it flowing like the other side?

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.320
 >> I think the idea is the sea water comes in.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.440
 And this is fresh water that's moving uphill and the two mix.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.000
 But then the sea water is denser.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.360
 So it kind of pushes the fresh water upwards.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:02.680
 >> Nice.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.160
 >> Pretty much.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.200
 It's all to do with sea and fresh water and their relative densities.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.480
 Exactly, as James says, because of the salt.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:13.520
 >> And it comes out in Melisani Cave, which is the cave of the nymphs.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.560
 >> Right.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.000
 >> The nymphs being those horny Greek people.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.040
 >> Right.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.440
 >> Oh, yeah.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:19.960
 >> Sexy.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.080
 >> Narrow down.

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.000
 >> So no human could go this stretch of water to the side, could they?

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.880
 >> No, no, I'm down to it that way.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.280
 >> There might be a route, as the internet is full of videos of people.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.640
 Has anyone here ever seen the caving videos?

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.200
 They're so upsetting.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:35.960
 >> Why?

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.360
 >> There's people going through really, like they're crawling with their

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.320
 shoulders only through these insanely tight spaces underground.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.120
 >> It's really scary.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:44.880
 >> It's really claustrophobic.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.160
 I don't think I'm claustrophobic, but you watch this and you think, that is unbearable, you know?

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:57.520
 >> I like the fact that cavers are like Batman in that if there is a caving disaster.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.720
 >> They live in a cave, yeah, yeah.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:03.080
 >> Yeah, oh my God, I haven't thought of that element.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:08.760
 Wow, because I was thinking about it, if there's a caving disaster, the call goes out to all cavers and they flock.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.960
 So there was, for instance, so Wales is a good place to go caving.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:18.360
 And there was a call in a place called O Goff Fanonthe, which I'm sure a Welsh person will get in touch and

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.800
 tell me how badly I pronounce that.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.320
 >> It almost sounds like Gotham, in a way, like a Welsh version of Gotham.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.160
 >> Oh my God, this is blowing so wide open.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.680
 Right, so there was an accident in this cave where a caver, George Lennane, fell.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:36.440
 He was very badly injured and he was a very long way into this cave, as I say, 274 metres below ground.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:44.520
 The call goes out, 16 teams across England responded, 300 rescuers from England, Scotland and Wales all dropped their jobs,

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:49.000
 dropped their pens, closed their computers, got on the next train to this cave.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.640
 And they all helped out, which I would say is a lot of people who are quite bored by their jobs in marketing.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:59.360
 And, you know, the call has said we need about eight or nine cavers and they've gone, it's all right, I'm here, I'm there.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:04.560
 And they're all underground, but it is extraordinary if you've got someone incredibly injured as he was,

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.680
 broken bones and stuff, getting a stretcher by someone who's incapacitated through, like,

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:15.560
 underwater up vertical inclines, you know, places where you can only fit one human body,

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:20.360
 and you're soaking wet and it took about three days, I think, so you're freezing cold.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.960
 >> Wait, how many metres down was he?

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.760
 >> He was 274 metres.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.280
 >> And how many people answered the call?

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.320
 >> 300.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:35.040
 >> So you could just do a human train and just, like, grab it by the ankles and bang, we go.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:42.040
 >> I feel like you've got a bit of a problem there with the other 100-nod people who are underwater for that amount of time.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.040
 >> That's very true.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:48.320
 >> So has anyone here been down the devil's arse?

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.040
 >> Is that in Manchester?

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.040
 >> It's not far off, it's in the Peak Districts.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.040
 >> Oh, okay.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:58.440
 >> And it seemed like it was because for listeners, the whole audience said yes to that question.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.800
 >> It's very famous around here, the devil's arse.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.800
 >> Okay.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.800
 >> It's a cave in Dalbyshire.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.800
 >> Okay.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.440
 >> And they changed the name, it was known as Devil's Arse, and then they changed it

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:14.720
 to Peak Cavern in 1880 because Queen Victoria visited, but we've changed it back now.

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.080
 And it's lots of awesome things about it.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:22.760
 It's where a lot of Britain's last troglodytes lived, so cave dwellers lived there.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.400
 They made ropes, and they would sell it to the nearby villages.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.400
 >> The troglodytes?

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.720
 >> Sorry, when are we talking?

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.840
 >> They left the final time in 1915.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.840
 >> What?

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:33.840
 >> Yeah.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:38.400
 And it's where the Thieves' Kant was invented.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:44.920
 So Thieves' Kant is a type of language that thieves used, and it was invented by a person

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:51.200
 called Giles Hather and Cock Laurel, and they were at the mouth of the devil's arse, and

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.520
 they came up with this new language that they'd be able to talk about and the cops wouldn't

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:57.720
 understand what they were saying.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.480
 >> I mean, just saying Cock Laurel's at the mouth of the devil's arse is quite a confusing

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.160
 thing to hear.

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:07.080
 >> Well, do you want to guess some Thieves' Kant words?

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:08.080
 >> Okay, yeah.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.360
 >> What do you think a bung nipper is?

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.360
 >> A bung nipper.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.360
 >> Bung.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.360
 B-U-N-G nipper.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:19.720
 >> A child who lives in a barrel.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:25.800
 >> Is it when you're caving and someone is so up your arse in terms of like they're too

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.800
 enthusiastic?

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:31.160
 So bung, as in Beavis and Butthead bunghole, a nipper is like you're literally nipping

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.160
 it with your mouth.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.160
 >> No, I got it.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.160
 But the thing is --

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.160
 [ Laughter ]

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.160
 >> This is more about thieving than caving, right?

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.240
 >> I mean, they met at the mouth of the devil's arse thing.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.240
 >> Oh, this is about thieving?

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.240
 >> Yeah.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.240
 They're nothing stupid caves.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.240
 Oh, really?

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240
 >> A bung nipper.

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.240
 So that's someone stealing something?

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.240
 >> Yeah.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.240
 Don't put you out of your misery.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.240
 It's just a purse.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.240
 Just a purse.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.240
 >> Yeah.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.680
 >> Do you know what a little snakesman is?

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.680
 >> Little snakesman.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:55.680
 >> Yeah.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:59.600
 >> Is it, like, in Oliver Twist where you're like a little kid and you go in someone's deep

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:03.040
 pocket with your snake-like little arm and pull out his wallet?

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.360
 >> You're really, really close.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.360
 Really close.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.320
 It's a small boy who passed through a window and then they'd unlock the door of the house

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.760
 and then the thieves can go in.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.840
 >> Also a scene in Oliver Twist.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:13.840
 >> Yeah.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.840
 >> God, I was just 200 pages too soon.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.680
 >> And finally, moss.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.680
 What is moss?

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.680
 >> Moss.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.680
 >> According to thieves.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:23.680
 >> Thieves.

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.040
 An old person to rob.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.040
 They're not going to move.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.040
 They're not going to notice.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:31.240
 They might as well be moss and you can just --

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.200
 >> Always on the north side of a tree.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.200
 >> Yeah.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.200
 >> No.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.200
 >> Just a weedy thief because it's wet.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.200
 >> No.

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.200
 >> It's like moss.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.200
 >> Where does moss grow?

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.200
 >> Roofs.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.200
 >> Bugs?

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.000
 >> Someone who goes in the roof, who takes off the roof of the house and goes in and somehow

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.160
 the residents don't notice.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.080
 >> I'm going to give it to you.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:50.160
 >> It's lead stolen from the top of buildings.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.160
 >> Ah.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.160
 >> No.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.160
 >> That's very good.

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.360
 >> So now if you're ever in the 19th century, gangs --

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.360
 >> Love it.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.360
 >> Good to know.

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.640
 >> Did you guys hear about Beatriz Flamene?

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.640
 >> No.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.640
 What's that?

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.960
 >> She is a caver, April 2023.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.520
 She came out of a cave, right?

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.880
 And that's not interesting because she is a professional caver.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.880
 >> Makes sense.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.880
 >> Yeah.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:17.120
 >> She went in in November 2021 to that cave.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.320
 >> How long was that?

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.520
 >> I think it's about 500 days.

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.520
 >> What?

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.440
 >> November -- it's a year and several months.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.440
 >> Did she get lost?

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:25.440
 >> She knew.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.960
 It was an experiment she was doing with some scientists, but she was up for it.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.840
 >> She wasn't just going to do a -- you know, when you're on a beach with a kid and you're

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.380
 going to a poo in a cave.

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:34.380
 And I always used to think that --

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.380
 >> Pause.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.380
 Pause.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:37.380
 Pause.

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:38.380
 >> Okay.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.380
 Here we go.

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.380
 >> Right.

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.600
 >> There was a moment in every podcast where someone overshares.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.600
 >> Hang on.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.280
 >> I always had that thought down.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.280
 >> Everyone does this, right?

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.280
 When they're children.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.280
 >> Okay.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.280
 Okay.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.280
 Audience.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.280
 Anyone ever shit in a cave?

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.280
 >> Oh.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.280
 We do it in the sea.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.160
 >> What we're saying is she hadn't just gone and done a poo and got lost.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.160
 >> No.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.160
 >> Sorry.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.160
 I just heard Dan say we did it in the sea.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.160
 >> Yeah.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.480
 >> My mum made us go into a cave and dig a hole and do one at least.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.360
 We just sent out to sea to do a big floater where everyone's trying to body board.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.340
 Don't try and make me the weird one here.

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.340
 >> Okay.

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:17.360
 But it was an experiment for -- it was full science about what happens to the human body

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.760
 under these conditions.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.020
 So she didn't know anything about the news in that time.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:22.660
 She was completely cut off from civilization.

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:23.660
 She didn't know about the Queen dying.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:24.660
 She didn't know about Russia, Ukraine.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:25.660
 She didn't know about Liz Truss.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:26.660
 She didn't know anything.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:31.620
 She had a quick shit in the cave and come back.

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.580
 She had the time of her life.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.300
 It's amazing reading her account of it.

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.260
 She said it was an excellent experience.

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.720
 She didn't have a bath or a shower for a year and a half.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:45.280
 She thought she'd been in for 160 days because she had no sense of time down there.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.440
 I just love it.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:48.920
 >> Your body goes into a weird rhythm, doesn't it?

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:53.320
 You kind of go into 12-hour days or 14-hour days or something.

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.840
 >> Basically, she said, "I really don't want to know about anything that's happening out

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.360
 there, even if there's an emergency, even if there's a family thing.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.640
 I just want to try this experience properly."

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.560
 So she would get food delivered by the scientists.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:14.460
 They would collect every fifth poo, and I suppose the previous four poos as well.

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.880
 Every five poos she did, she got a collection done by the scientists.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:24.060
 >> Is it like one of those Costa Cards where you, you know, stamp every time?

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.860
 What do you mean they collected everyone?

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.180
 >> Were they going into her chamber?

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:29.180
 >> They collected her poo.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.180
 Like, she would come out to the bit where she picked up her food and I suppose drop off

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.860
 her poo and then she would retreat again.

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:37.840
 >> That's the worst delivery ever, isn't it?

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.580
 Thanks for the tip, mate.

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:41.580
 >> Deliver poo.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:44.040
 >> There we go.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.040
 Get this.

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.040
 Get this.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.880
 Like, at one point, the cave was swarmed with flies and she was just completely covered

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.680
 in flies for a while, like head to toe in flies.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.680
 She didn't talk out loud except when she was filming her video diary.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:59.080
 When they came down to get her, she didn't want to leave.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.680
 She was annoyed because she hadn't finished her book.

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.680
 She said, "Why are you coming down to get me?

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.680
 I haven't finished my book."

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.580
 >> How many books did she bring down?

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.580
 How so a reader is she?

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.580
 >> She got through 60 books.

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:08.580
 >> Did she?

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:09.580
 Wow.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:10.580
 That's incredible.

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:15.580
 So, I reckon the poo thing is to do with minimal impact caving, which is a genuine thing.

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:19.140
 Because if you go into a cave, it's a whole ecosystem and you don't want to disturb things

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.140
 that are going on there.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:25.900
 So, they say things like avoid touching microbial mats so you don't want to mess with the communities

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.320
 that are living in the cave.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.820
 No smoking in caves.

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.420
 I can't believe that.

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:35.440
 You can't bring siggies down because it might interfere with the bats and all sorts of other

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.720
 animals living there.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.280
 No recreational drugs or alcohol while caving, they say.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.280
 >> Oh, come on.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.280
 Why the hell not that?

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.280
 >> I know, right?

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.280
 >> You can't do that there.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:47.760
 >> Limited scratching of skin and hair because you don't want any dandruff or follicles to

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.760
 get off.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.000
 But then the big thing, which was a bit confusing to me, I had to look it up, it said, "Always

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.760
 make sure to bring your burrito kit."

00:49:54.760 --> 00:50:04.100
 And your burrito kit.

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:09.460
 Your burrito kit is this slang for a bag to store your poo.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:15.020
 So you bring bottles to put your urine in and you bring your burrito kit to put your

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:16.020
 poo in.

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:21.300
 And I discovered that burrito kit meant that by going to a caving slang web page.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.700
 So I'm going to give you, not thieving slang, but I'm going to give you some caving slang.

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:28.160
 >> What do you guys think air repel is?

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.160
 >> Repel.

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.040
 >> Repel as in like repelling.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.040
 >> Repelling as in like going down a cliff or something.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.040
 >> Yeah, exactly.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.680
 >> It sounds like when you just jump off one surface a very long way.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.520
 It's like I'm sailing, but you've forgotten your rope.

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:39.520
 >> Sort of.

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.520
 It's when you accidentally fall down a cave.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.760
 There's the cardboard caver.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:46.760
 Cardboard caver.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.840
 >> Is that someone who's not very good or somebody who's got the equipment but they

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.160
 don't know how to do it?

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:57.660
 >> It's when at the first sign of wetness you decide to turn back because you don't want

00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:59.500
 to get involved with that.

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:00.500
 Douching.

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:01.500
 >> Oh.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.500
 >> It's when you --

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:06.660
 >> It's when you fall down and the water goes into you, like you slide down.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:07.660
 >> Yeah.

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:11.660
 >> Like that's where they have that in -- what do you call it when you're on the back of

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:12.660
 a motor boat?

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:13.660
 >> Water skiing.

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:14.660
 >> Water skiing.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.660
 Yeah, yeah.

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.660
 If you fall off and the water goes up you, that's douching.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:18.660
 >> I've been water skiing.

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:21.740
 I've never had water enter me like how you're describing.

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.240
 >> No, I've heard that too.

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.240
 Have you?

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.240
 >> I've heard it.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.740
 It's the most painful thing you could possibly experience.

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:27.740
 >> Wow, really?

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:28.740
 >> You're a lucky man.

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:29.740
 >> Wow.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:30.740
 I must have a tiny bum hole.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:38.740
 >> There's always a second over sharing moment when you take the first one's over.

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:43.420
 >> Well, anyway, it's the practice of blocking a stream at the top of a pit.

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:44.420
 >> I forgot the word now.

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:45.420
 >> Douching.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:46.420
 Sorry.

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:50.380
 >> You block the stream at the top of a pit, only let it to go all over your friend on

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:54.780
 the rope below when they're most vulnerable, so you build up the water and then it's like

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:55.780
 gunging them.

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:56.780
 Yeah.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:00.860
 >> Can I -- did everyone read the greatest story that was this week or last week of accidental

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:01.860
 caving?

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:02.860
 >> No.

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:03.860
 >> Matilda Campbell.

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:04.860
 I'm playing it fast on this for the word caving.

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:06.300
 I think it was so good.

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:11.380
 She is in Australia, obviously, New South Wales, Hunter Valley.

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.780
 She's on some rocks with her friends.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:16.700
 She drops her phone in a crevice between two rocks, she thinks, I'll go and get that.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:20.860
 She went face first down into this crevice, which was three meters deep between boulders,

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.740
 got stuck head first, three meters down.

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.060
 She was there for seven hours.

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.860
 She had no phone reception.

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:31.540
 She had one friend with her who had to be like, sorry, mate, I'm going to have to go and find

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:37.580
 someone and left her alone upside down, three meters down, squashed between rocks for ages.

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:42.420
 Eventually fire, ambulance, police and a bunch of volunteers came and it still took them

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.900
 seven hours to move these boulders.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.140
 But she's such a hero.

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:50.940
 The lead paramedic said the whole time she was so calm and collected through the whole

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:51.940
 thing.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:52.940
 I would have been frantic.

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:53.940
 She wasn't panicked at all.

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:57.980
 And she was wedged in this weird S shape, so even when they'd moved the boulders they

00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.740
 couldn't really get her body out for ages.

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.100
 And yeah, eventually they got her out.

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.660
 And the article I read I think in the Guardian said sadly they were unable to retrieve her

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:06.660
 phone.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:16.660
 Still a tragic loss.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:17.660
 That is it.

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.660
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.140
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.140
 Thank you Manchester.

00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.140
 We'll be back again.

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.140
 We'll be back again next week.

00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:23.140
 For Simran, goodbye!

00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:33.140
 [APPLAUSE]

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:35.720
 (upbeat music)
