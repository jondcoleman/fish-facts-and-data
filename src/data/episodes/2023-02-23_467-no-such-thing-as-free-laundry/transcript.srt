1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,240
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,880
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,880
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covran Garden.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,920
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,140
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,640
 Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,920
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,480
 for this time for a very special, somewhat sad episode.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,320
 - Poignant.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,240
 - Poignant episode.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,180
 A very sad announcement that we have to make is that--

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,720
 - A happy announcement, no?

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,380
 I think it's a happy announcement.

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,220
 - Is it?

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,040
 - It's very confusing.

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,480
 - Well, Anna Tyshinski is leaving the show.

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,160
 So it's a--

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,100
 - I'm delighted.

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,580
 - Yeah.

21
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,640
 - I'm delighted.

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,280
 - Yeah, for nine months, temporarily.

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,080
 - Temporarily, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,400
 She's going away for a while to think about

25
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,480
 what she's done and then, then she can come back.

26
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,080
 - And what specifically she's done--

27
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,920
 - Yes, is--

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,840
 - Is created a baby.

29
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,680
 - She has.

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,800
 She's been collaborating on another project

31
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,520
 with another person.

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,560
 - It's very low effort, so much less work than the podcast.

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,360
 And I hope that it continues that way.

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,200
 - That it does.

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,560
 Anyway, we thought we would commemorate this tragedy.

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,160
 I think it's a tragedy that she's going.

37
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,000
 - Joyfully.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,840
 - That she's going.

39
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,680
 - Joyful news.

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,520
 - That's obviously happy stuff, yeah.

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,040
 But not for us, not for the listener.

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,880
 - Not for Dan.

43
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,720
 - Not for me.

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,920
 - I honestly feel like I am secretly dying

45
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,340
 and no one's told me.

46
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,880
 (laughing)

47
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,040
 The person who's been leaving drinks tonight,

48
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,040
 people who say, "You went down as a leaving thing."

49
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,400
 - As someone who's been in this situation,

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,320
 or a similar situation 12 months ago,

51
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
 metaphorically, it's the end.

52
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,880
 - I'm gonna be dead inside from now on, aren't I?

53
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,720
 - I'm afraid so.

54
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,840
 - You've gone for two weeks, though, on paternity.

55
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,400
 Should we have done a missing?

56
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
 James is off.

57
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,880
 (laughing)

58
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,800
 Do the best of.

59
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
 - And look, we should say that's what we're here to do.

60
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,360
 We're here to commemorate our wonderful buddy.

61
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,200
 - Okay.

62
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,040
 (laughing)

63
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,360
 - A very daffy word.

64
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,400
 - So, can we say, "Celebrate," you know?

65
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,840
 - It's not sad occasion. - It's not eulogy.

66
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,000
 - Well, yeah.

67
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,640
 So we thought what we'd do is we would present

68
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,880
 our three favorite facts this time, not four.

69
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,080
 It's sort of get used to the idea that she's not here.

70
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,760
 And share with you some of the greatest moments

71
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,080
 that she's had over the last nine years of fish.

72
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,200
 Nine years we've been doing this.

73
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,040
 - Nine years.

74
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,440
 - It's coming up to it in March of this year.

75
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,080
 So yeah, we're on the brink.

76
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,200
 - So.

77
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,040
 - Oh, God, I'm going out.

78
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,880
 - You're coming back.

79
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
 You're coming back in nine months

80
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,440
 and there's a very exciting roster of guests

81
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,600
 actually presenting lined up to replace you.

82
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,440
 So, you know.

83
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,280
 - Wow.

84
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
 Let's not use the word "replace."

85
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
 (laughing)

86
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,760
 - Would you jump into a grave that quickly?

87
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,960
 (laughing)

88
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,160
 Sarah Pascoe?

89
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,800
 (laughing)

90
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,560
 - They could jump into someone's grave.

91
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,040
 Isn't that what you do?

92
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,880
 (laughing)

93
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,720
 - Wait.

94
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,560
 - I don't think if you're replacing them,

95
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,640
 you climb into that coffin with them.

96
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,480
 - You're right.

97
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,320
 - What's the phrase?

98
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,720
 - Jump into their bed?

99
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,040
 - Jump into their bed?

100
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,880
 - No.

101
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,720
 - Jump into their bed?

102
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,560
 - Pick up their shoes.

103
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,400
 - Pick up their shoes?

104
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,520
 - Fill the dead man's shoes.

105
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,360
 - I wouldn't piss on their shoes if they were dead.

106
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,560
 That's the phrase.

107
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,400
 - Is it?

108
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
 - No, it's like.

109
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,440
 - I think it's maternity cover.

110
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,440
 I think that's the word we're looking for.

111
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,320
 - They haven't even cleaned up the funeral meat yet.

112
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,880
 - She's not even cold.

113
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,840
 - She's not even cold.

114
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,680
 - I'm sorry.

115
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,520
 They haven't cleaned up her funeral meat?

116
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,360
 (laughing)

117
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,200
 - I think that's actually.

118
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,640
 I think that's from Hamlet.

119
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,680
 Oh, no, they...

120
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,520
 - Yeah, no, it is.

121
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
 There's a thing about funeral meats.

122
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,720
 In the wedding, they reuse the stuff

123
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,120
 for Hamlet's dad's funeral for the wedding

124
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,080
 to Hamlet's dad's brother.

125
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,280
 - Have you heard of cheesy funeral potatoes?

126
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,000
 (laughing)

127
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,840
 - Sounds yummy, though.

128
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,040
 - It's a thing they do in Utah, I think.

129
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,960
 And it's basically potatoes,

130
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,600
 cream, cheese, and corn flakes all together.

131
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,480
 And it's what you have in funerals.

132
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,120
 And the idea is that it's the kind of thing

133
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,560
 that a typical Utah family,

134
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,680
 typical Mormon family would have in the lada.

135
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,160
 And everyone would have these four

136
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,400
 or five different things.

137
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,280
 I think chicken soup is one of them as well,

138
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,480
 but you put them all together

139
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,960
 and it's like the meal that you have at a funeral, so.

140
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,800
 - Really?

141
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,320
 Hold on, you don't mix the chicken soup with the...

142
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,160
 - Yeah, I don't get it.

143
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,760
 - You just put it in the chicken soup.

144
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

145
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,040
 - And then you put corn flakes on top.

146
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,120
 - We're here basically to have your

147
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,880
 cheesy funeral potato meats, and that's lovely.

148
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,960
 - I think chicken soup's quite an incentive thing to have

149
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,440
 'cause that traditionally makes you better,

150
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,320
 but of course at a funeral,

151
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,280
 it's too late for that, isn't it?

152
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,600
 - Absolutely right.

153
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,800
 Sorry, this, we've broken the format.

154
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,960
 - We're gonna do our three favorite facts

155
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,520
 about Anna Tyshinski, each one of us presenting it.

156
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,920
 And why don't we start with you, James?

157
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,600
 - Okay, well, my fact this week is that

158
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,280
 in order to get into the United States,

159
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,240
 Anna Tyshinski had to tell a fact about a dead president.

160
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,080
 (laughing)

161
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,560
 - Am I, I'm never allowed there again.

162
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,040
 - They let you in, surprisingly, despite it.

163
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,880
 - They did.

164
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,040
 - It was, or border control, or whatever it is.

165
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,000
 - Yeah, I actually can't remember the context

166
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,560
 where they made me say it.

167
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,400
 - Well.

168
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,240
 - We'd landed, hadn't we?

169
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,920
 - We'd landed, so we had to get a visa

170
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,600
 as something like people of exceptional talent

171
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,440
 or something like that.

172
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,960
 - Yeah, it was like we were Julia Roberts or something.

173
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,000
 She wouldn't need one, of course,

174
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,040
 'cause she is American, but.

175
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,920
 - So we went to the American embassy

176
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,360
 and we had to prove to them that we had exceptional talent,

177
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,560
 or they were exceptionally famous or something.

178
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,840
 And the woman at the window just said,

179
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,400
 "Notice things of fish, I never heard of you."

180
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,240
 - That's right.

181
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,960
 - Yeah, and immediately we were on the back foot.

182
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,400
 But anyway, eventually we managed to convince them

183
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,440
 that we should go to America and get a visa to work there

184
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,560
 so that we could do our show.

185
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,080
 But when we got to the passport control,

186
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,640
 the visa said that we were a comedy podcast.

187
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,720
 And the guy said to you, Anna, as you walked up,

188
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,000
 he said, "Well, what do you do?"

189
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,360
 And you said, "Well, it's a kind of about facts."

190
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,160
 And he said, "Well, tell me a fact then."

191
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,680
 And the only thing you could think about

192
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,360
 was something about the murderer of a president.

193
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,200
 - Yeah.

194
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,120
 The only thing I can usually think about

195
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,400
 is President Garfield's anus,

196
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
 but all the more so when you're landing in the home

197
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,880
 of President Garfield.

198
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,720
 So yeah, I told him that when President Garfield

199
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,560
 was assassinated, it was a slow process

200
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,760
 and he spent the last month of his life

201
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,880
 eating through his anus,

202
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,840
 which I'm sure you're all familiar with

203
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,440
 if you remember episode one.

204
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,480
 - Yeah. - Second ever fact on the show.

205
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
 - How did he react?

206
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,120
 - The border control. - President Garfield, yeah.

207
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,680
 (laughing)

208
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,720
 - There were a lot of funeral potatoes that week.

209
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,600
 (laughing)

210
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,840
 - I think he did what most border control people do,

211
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,480
 which is be very unimpressed and slightly threatening.

212
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,280
 I think it was like, "Okay, go on ahead then, ma'am."

213
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,640
 - Wow. - Wow.

214
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,160
 - Which is the reaction I've always wanted

215
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,360
 to all of our podcast facts, so.

216
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,160
 - Do you know, weirdly, this fact about President Garfield

217
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,880
 was I remember the exact moment that you told me that fact.

218
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,600
 I can remember the exact spot of the office.

219
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,680
 Yeah, because we were getting ready to do

220
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
 what was still a run-through of the show

221
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,280
 and we used that segment in the very first episode,

222
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,360
 but I remember you had sent around your facts

223
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
 and your fact was about President Garfield

224
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,560
 and it was to do with the fact

225
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,520
 that he spent three months on his death bed

226
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,600
 and they tried to cure him.

227
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,080
 I can't remember your wording, but it wasn't great.

228
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,240
 It was sort of like, we need that.

229
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,560
 - Just a quick note, Anna.

230
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,640
 (laughing)

231
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,760
 - That's what this is gonna be.

232
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,920
 This is an intervention.

233
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,680
 What to think about over the next nine months.

234
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,280
 - Don't be holding that in for nine years.

235
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,360
 - Yeah.

236
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,200
 - I've got a big list. - You can do this

237
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,600
 for everyone from episode one.

238
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,040
 - We're starting, let's start.

239
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,200
 Episode one will be here. - Okay, it's surprising.

240
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,040
 Tell me what I should have said.

241
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,280
 - I can't remember what you said to me at the time,

242
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,920
 but I said to you, "I love the story.

243
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,360
 Is there any other way of expressing it?"

244
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,720
 And you literally in a beat said, "Oh, what about this?

245
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,680
 For the last three months of his life,

246
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,000
 he ate everything through his anus."

247
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,680
 And I remember genuinely, it was a bit of a thunderbolt,

248
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,320
 kind of like, "Oh my God, we're gonna have a hit

249
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,920
 on our hands." It was just so beautifully crafted.

250
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,760
 Yeah, I really felt it.

251
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,440
 I'm just telling the origin story here.

252
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
 - What a strange, inspirational moment.

253
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,200
 I don't think a lot of great inventors could emphasize

254
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,840
 with that moment being the one.

255
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,680
 - It was thunderbolt.

256
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,960
 - And that's why we were so nearly called

257
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,200
 the President Garfield Anus Cust.

258
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,560
 - Well, it's such a shame that we changed the name.

259
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,520
 - To be honest, when we were thinking of our first book,

260
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,280
 James and I, when we were brainstorming ideas

261
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,840
 for the title, "The President's Anus."

262
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,320
 - I remember "The President's Anus" coming up

263
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,680
 quite a bit, being tossed about.

264
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,320
 - It feels like it's going to be tossed.

265
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,160
 - As it was.

266
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,840
 - It feels like the beginning of a title,

267
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,680
 "The President's Anus."

268
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,520
 It feels like it should be,

269
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,720
 "The President's Anus is missing."

270
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,560
 Or some--

271
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

272
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,160
 Yeah, but one of my favorite things of that tour,

273
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,600
 so we did a big, it was our first ever American tour.

274
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,320
 First and only American tour.

275
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,160
 - Yeah.

276
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,080
 - Pulled yourself back from saying a big American tour

277
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
 'cause it was five days.

278
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,200
 - Well, for us, it was super exciting.

279
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,640
 We were up on Times Square.

280
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,920
 We got to play New York.

281
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,840
 We played Washington.

282
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,160
 We stayed in the--

283
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,000
 - Watergate.

284
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,040
 - The Watergate Hotel.

285
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,880
 - Yeah.

286
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,520
 - Where they had, like, remember they had the,

287
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,800
 the pencils, like, please steal this pencil.

288
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,640
 - Oh, the room keys.

289
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,480
 - And the room keys.

290
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,320
 - Said I was stolen from the Watergate Hotel.

291
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,600
 - That's right, yeah.

292
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,280
 All the light bulbs, like, pillows I brought home.

293
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,160
 That's the same thing, weirdly.

294
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,880
 - And those documents from the White House, though.

295
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,040
 Yeah, but my favorite thing of all

296
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,560
 was when we were staying in New York.

297
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,800
 And I just remember seeing Anna one morning

298
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,880
 and her looking unbelievably abused

299
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,360
 because she was holding a bill in her hand

300
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,000
 for a basic bit of laundry

301
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,960
 that she had sent to the hotel.

302
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,800
 - Oh, my God.

303
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,680
 - Which came to $240.

304
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,520
 - It was more than that.

305
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,360
 It was more than that.

306
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,160
 I think it was, like, $400.

307
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,000
 - Oh, my God.

308
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,160
 - And I thought it was complimentary.

309
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,000
 I just, I don't know.

310
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,600
 - They just put a bag outside your door, didn't they?

311
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,880
 With laundry written on it.

312
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,720
 Just shove it in.

313
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,880
 - Yeah, you just put stuff in.

314
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,840
 I don't know.

315
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,560
 We always send premier ins when we're in the UK.

316
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,800
 We're not used to this.

317
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,280
 So yeah, it tossed all my clothes from the whole tour in.

318
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,200
 (laughing)

319
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,040
 - You had enough clothes.

320
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,600
 You didn't really need it all done.

321
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,480
 - Absolutely not when we were going home the next day.

322
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,080
 - Sometimes it's lovely to get home

323
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,920
 with a fresh case of clothes.

324
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
 It feels incredible.

325
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,600
 - Anyway, so we made a loss on that tour, didn't we?

326
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,440
 - Yeah, we did.

327
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,320
 - I know, I should say, just to make you think kindly

328
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,560
 of these people, you're stuck with the next nine months

329
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,560
 that they agreed that that could be split that loss

330
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,960
 over the whole tour group rather than just me taking it.

331
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,800
 - Did we?

332
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,640
 - Yeah, yeah, and I think--

333
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,480
 - Yeah, sorry about that.

334
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,320
 - I think the tour pretty much dead on broke even.

335
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,160
 - Yeah, right.

336
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,880
 - But we would have been in the black if it had--

337
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,600
 - I owe you all a hundred pounds.

338
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,800
 - Yeah, yeah.

339
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,480
 I think, no, I think I didn't pipe up

340
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,320
 because when I went back to England,

341
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,240
 I bought so many books that my overweight money allowance

342
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,520
 was something like $1,000 or something.

343
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,360
 It was ridiculous.

344
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,040
 - We didn't take the hit for that though, did we?

345
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,880
 - I think you might have done.

346
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,160
 - I think we might have done, yeah.

347
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,760
 - Well, if I'm gonna take the laundry hit, I was, I thought.

348
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,600
 - Andy, we should have gone for the huckers

349
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,960
 and the cocaine that we sent.

350
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,360
 (laughing)

351
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,160
 - I only ate one meal a day in America

352
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,360
 'cause I was so concerned about making a loss.

353
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,840
 (laughing)

354
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,400
 - We made him walk all the way from Boston to New York.

355
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,360
 - I took one pair of pants and I wore it inside, outside,

356
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,760
 back to front, upside down.

357
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,440
 Now I know I was on tour with, you know, Elton John.

358
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
 - Yeah, so sorry about that.

359
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,320
 - Wow.

360
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,480
 - But yeah, didn't get evicted from the country.

361
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,960
 No, what's the cool when you get evicted?

362
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,800
 Deported.

363
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,640
 - Deported.

364
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,560
 - Didn't get deported for talking about

365
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,120
 presidential assassination, so actually helped us get in.

366
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
 So if you are trying to get into America,

367
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,960
 give it a go.

368
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,240
 - Okay, well, the point of this show, I think,

369
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,240
 is that we're gonna play some of Anna's best bits.

370
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,080
 And so--

371
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,920
 - It's a very short show.

372
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,440
 - It should be a very short show.

373
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,480
 So let's do a little bit now,

374
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,560
 beginning with President Garfield's anus.

375
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,140
 (upbeat music)

376
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:26,440
 - Okay, fact number two, Anna, this one's yours.

377
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,160
 - Yeah, so for the last month of his life,

378
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,360
 US President James Garfield ate everything

379
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,600
 through his anus.

380
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,840
 (all laughing)

381
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,720
 - We will get letters from a lot of people here.

382
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,080
 - That is mine.

383
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,520
 Yeah, I mean, I wasn't there,

384
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,560
 but this is what the doctors tell me.

385
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,000
 (all laughing)

386
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,920
 No, so James Garfield was, as everyone obviously knows,

387
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,260
 shot in July, 1881, and he lived for a further 80 days.

388
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,040
 He was shot in the small, in the, like, small of his back

389
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,920
 and once in the arm.

390
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,240
 So doctors now say he would have been at our hospital

391
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,380
 about two or three days later.

392
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,320
 But obviously, 'cause medicine was not quite as advanced

393
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,160
 as it is now.

394
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,840
 In 1881, they just invited, like,

395
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,560
 dozens of doctors to his bedside

396
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,800
 who all prodded around trying to find this bullet.

397
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,480
 They didn't know where the bullet had gone in his body.

398
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,320
 So they gathered around, prodded about,

399
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,360
 made him worse and worse.

400
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,760
 He stopped being able to eat.

401
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,080
 And obviously, if you stop being able to consume food

402
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,600
 in those days, they just shoved it up your arse.

403
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
 And so that's what they did.

404
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,200
 - So does that work?

405
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,680
 - It does not work, no.

406
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,760
 It was widely discredited in the early 30s.

407
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,220
 And I think you get about an eighth of the nutrition

408
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,860
 from some of the food.

409
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,660
 But there's some food that you can't absorb at all.

410
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,700
 - What I love is the list of foods

411
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,860
 that he was fed in his mother.

412
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,700
 - Oh, that's good, yeah.

413
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,060
 - Beef, bouillon, egg yolks, milk.

414
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,880
 - Egg yolks.

415
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,720
 - Egg yolks.

416
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,220
 - Wait a second, guys.

417
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,060
 Egg yolks, it was only true for a while.

418
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,820
 'Cause I was reading the doctor at the time

419
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,820
 his report on it.

420
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,940
 So yeah, he was fed egg yolks for a bit of time.

421
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,780
 And then all the surgeons complained

422
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,860
 that it was causing annoying and offensive plateaus.

423
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,280
 And so they ceased feeding him egg yolks.

424
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,120
 And it deprecated.

425
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,740
 - So they stopped it because it was annoying them.

426
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,080
 Not the other way around.

427
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,820
 (laughing)

428
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,840
 Guys, I'd be quite happy to eat an egg with my mouth.

429
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,240
 (laughing)

430
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,200
 That's all right by you guys.

431
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,440
 - Apparently it's illegal to move sheep in whales

432
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,040
 until they've been checked to see

433
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,440
 whether they carry traces of the fallout from Chernobyl.

434
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,280
 - Really?

435
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,120
 - Yeah.

436
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,960
 - On this particular subject,

437
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,920
 I have a question for you guys.

438
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,760
 - Oh yeah?

439
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,080
 - Why shouldn't you buy trousers from the Northern Ukraine?

440
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,920
 - I don't know.

441
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,200
 Why shouldn't you buy trousers from the Northern Ukraine?

442
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,220
 - Chernobyl fallout.

443
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,960
 (laughing)

444
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,520
 - Ladies and gentlemen, that is the joke.

445
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,920
 - Yeah, just so you know,

446
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,880
 just as a little inside bit of behind the scenes

447
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,240
 information here, Anna has consistently for the last,

448
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,040
 what, 14 podcasts said that same joke

449
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,480
 and we've cut it out every single episode.

450
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,200
 - Anna has refused to have it in the podcast.

451
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,040
 - This is a day.

452
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,760
 - And you will not hear it in this one either.

453
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,600
 - Yeah.

454
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,440
 - Unless someone else said it.

455
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,600
 - It's the best joke ever.

456
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,280
 Ambrose Pare, who was a famous doctor in the 15th century,

457
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,480
 saw a beggar in Paris who was begging him for money

458
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,160
 and who did so by, I don't actually know if we can put this

459
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,000
 out, it's so gross.

460
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,840
 - Let's just say it anyway.

461
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,880
 - Who did so by, she begged by lifting her skirts

462
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,400
 to reveal a prolapsed rectum.

463
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,800
 It was a horrid sight, he says.

464
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,360
 It was over half a foot long leaking pasta light fluid

465
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,760
 over her legs and garments.

466
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,080
 But his companion then attacked the woman and said,

467
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,320
 you're a big faker, you don't look sick enough

468
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
 to have a prolapsed rectum.

469
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,000
 - You have to be pretty confident that you're right

470
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,840
 in that situation.

471
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,400
 - Yeah, I know prolapsed rectums and that madame.

472
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,280
 - He beat this woman to the ground and eventually

473
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,040
 she was forced to reveal that it was actually

474
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,800
 the prolapsed rectum of an ox.

475
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,680
 But she put inside her some boxes.

476
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,120
 - It was actually a prolapsed rectum.

477
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,640
 - It was, it wasn't prolapsed.

478
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,400
 - He felt pretty silly then, didn't he?

479
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,680
 (all laughing)

480
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,800
 - That's not a human prolapsed rectum.

481
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,400
 (all laughing)

482
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,240
 It was the prolapsed rectum of an ox.

483
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,880
 - Yeah, she'd put up her own bum though.

484
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,200
 I think, oh my God.

485
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,040
 - I think you've gone to the trouble of doing that.

486
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,760
 I really think you've earned your 50 cents or whatever.

487
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,600
 - Absolutely.

488
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,840
 But the lifting of her skirts as well.

489
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,960
 She could just have a sign saying,

490
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,640
 prolapsed rectum, please help.

491
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,840
 - Wait, so if you saw someone with a sign saying,

492
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,280
 (all laughing)

493
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,160
 that's probably how she starts it.

494
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,760
 And she's like, no one is buying this at all.

495
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,120
 - Except Andy.

496
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,400
 I can show it to you, no need.

497
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,600
 Absolutely believe you.

498
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,680
 - The thing is though, I would pay,

499
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,680
 I would pay 50p not to see a prolapsed rectum.

500
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,640
 - That is a fair point.

501
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,320
 - She should have done that.

502
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,520
 - We should move on.

503
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,480
 - When they were building the New York subway,

504
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,080
 the guys who were building it were called sand hogs

505
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,280
 'cause they dug through lots of sand.

506
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,280
 And I was reading a newspaper report from 1916

507
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,000
 and it was about this guy called Marshall Mabee

508
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,280
 who was working in the tunnel to dig the subway.

509
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,840
 And there was a pocket of compressed air

510
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,880
 which suddenly kind of escaped.

511
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,760
 So he's got this big shield up in the tunnel in front of him

512
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,520
 and they're using this shield to push forward

513
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,600
 and make the tunnel bigger.

514
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,720
 And he said he saw an 18-inch pocket of air suddenly appear

515
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,520
 and it sucked him towards it.

516
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,960
 He was sucked into it.

517
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,720
 He was blasted up through the ground.

518
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,560
 So he was blasted up through 12 feet of riverbed

519
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,160
 and then blasted up through the river itself

520
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,840
 and then hurled up 25 feet in the air above the river.

521
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,840
 - He wasn't grinding through earth, 12 feet of earth.

522
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,240
 - Yeah, that's what riverbed's made of.

523
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,080
 It's less, it's more plausible for him to be blasted

524
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,240
 through 12 feet of earth and 12 feet of concrete or steel

525
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,080
 or whatever.

526
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,400
 No, no, no, I was thinking was it just a tunnel?

527
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,080
 Like it was a hole that he was blasted through.

528
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,720
 It just happened to be going, don't believe it.

529
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,920
 - So here we go, let me,

530
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,640
 there's a whole interview with him and everything.

531
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,640
 There's a nice interview with his wife saying,

532
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,680
 it's okay, he's fine.

533
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,320
 He's looking forward to going back to work.

534
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,160
 This is what the New York Times said at the time.

535
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,040
 There's a pocket of compressed air

536
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,120
 to prevent the river's bottom from caving in.

537
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,880
 So they have some, God, I don't know how that works.

538
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,720
 - But somehow it happened, guys,

539
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,960
 and this compressed air got loose

540
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,320
 and he saw an 18-inch hole

541
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,200
 and before he knew it, he was being sucked towards it.

542
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,120
 Two of his colleagues actually also got sucked in

543
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,560
 and they did perish.

544
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,200
 And he survived by blasting up,

545
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,480
 putting his arm out in front of him

546
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,520
 and blasting up through the riverbed.

547
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
 - I don't believe it.

548
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,960
 - 12 feet of riverbed and then got shot through

549
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,280
 and then out in the air.

550
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,720
 There's enough force left over,

551
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,160
 shot through the river itself and then you had 25 feet.

552
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,000
 - 25 feet?

553
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,920
 - The New York Times is a very retro.

554
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,560
 - What year is it?

555
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,360
 - Yeah, and what date was this?

556
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,360
 - February 1916, all right, not April.

557
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,120
 Yeah, it was a little bit insane,

558
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,920
 but there you go, there's a picture of the guy.

559
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,320
 Pictures don't lie.

560
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,360
 - What, mid-flight?

561
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,560
 - No, not mid-flight.

562
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,200
 (laughs)

563
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,040
 - That's extraordinary.

564
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,520
 - Did you say that was in New York?

565
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,600
 - Yeah, it was soft ground,

566
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
 so that's why they were called the sound.

567
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,280
 - Oh, well, if it was soft ground, I see, yeah.

568
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,600
 It was still a riverbed, though, wasn't it?

569
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,080
 - 25 feet after 12 beds of--

570
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,920
 - And a river.

571
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,240
 - And a river.

572
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,080
 - I don't know how it possibly happened.

573
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,400
 So there was a woman in South Korea recently

574
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,360
 who was eating squid, so we all eat squid.

575
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,080
 We call it calamari for reasons I don't understand,

576
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,880
 but she was eating some boiled squid in a restaurant,

577
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,880
 and she suddenly felt a pain in her tongue,

578
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,720
 and it turned out the squid wasn't quite dead,

579
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,640
 and it was a male squid,

580
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,320
 and it had deposited its sperm packet into her tongue,

581
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,920
 so she felt horrible pain in her tongue,

582
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,400
 and then felt lots of stuff crawling around

583
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,880
 inside her tongue, and had to go to hospital,

584
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,240
 and they took out a whole bunch of sperm.

585
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,480
 And apparently this does happen a bit,

586
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,640
 like there's been reports in Japan of it happening.

587
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,520
 - Oh, that's so fucked up.

588
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,200
 I will never fucking do that shit again.

589
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,000
 - Oh my god.

590
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 - Yeah.

591
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,960
 - Fuck it now.

592
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,460
 (all laughing)

593
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,460
 - Fuck that.

594
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,080
 (all laughing)

595
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,000
 - Ventritarianism, here you come.

596
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,080
 - I don't think we've mentioned this before.

597
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,040
 This year KFC have released a novel for the first time.

598
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,880
 - What?

599
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,600
 - It's a novel starring the Colonel,

600
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,200
 and it's a Milsen Boone-style romance,

601
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,120
 and it's called "Tender Wings of Desire."

602
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,160
 - He is a sexy man.

603
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,880
 - Well, we ascertained before we started

604
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,680
 recording this podcast that you quite fancy

605
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,520
 Richard Nixon.

606
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,340
 - Oh yeah.

607
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,000
 - How did we miss that when we got to that?

608
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,520
 - We didn't ascertain that.

609
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,080
 That's warping of the truth.

610
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,000
 - Oh, I'm sorry.

611
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,480
 - I find him not unattractive, given that there was an incident.

612
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,040
 - But for Andy, that's pretty much someone saying

613
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
 you're attractive.

614
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,760
 That's the best I can hope for these days.

615
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,240
 - I'm not physically repulsed by him.

616
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,080
 Great, Dave.

617
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,640
 He said in an interview that something like,

618
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,720
 "I know how I look.

619
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,600
 I'm under no illusions about my appearance,

620
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,080
 so I'll have to be good in other ways."

621
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,920
 And I read that interview,

622
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,440
 and I thought, "Well, he is good in other ways,

623
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,760
 isn't he?

624
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,040
 Lots of ways that Richard Nixon is a very good man."

625
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,400
 - What would you say your--

626
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,280
 - Yeah, what are your top five ways

627
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,440
 where she's a great guy, Hannah?

628
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,800
 - When British author William Haslitt died,

629
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,400
 his landlady was so keen to re-let his room

630
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,520
 that she hid his body under the bed

631
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,600
 while she showed new tenants around.

632
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,680
 - And he's still there under that bed, isn't he?

633
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,120
 - He's still there, yeah.

634
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,400
 But he was a big deal,

635
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,720
 and people used to go just to the Haslitt Hotel

636
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,840
 just because that's where he lived.

637
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,240
 Seamus Heaney used to go there, obsessed with him,

638
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,880
 and they would have meet-ups there

639
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,000
 just to be able to be in the sort of presence

640
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,880
 of the location of this great person

641
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,320
 who everyone seems to have forgotten,

642
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,000
 except it turns out, you, Hannah, just--

643
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,240
 - I mean, people know what him Haslitt is,

644
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,800
 but I did happen to take a book of his essays

645
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,280
 on my gap here, which I know is,

646
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,080
 I just told these guys back stage, I know.

647
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,800
 One of those guys was gonna mention it,

648
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,840
 so I thought I'd get in there.

649
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,760
 - Which drug were you taking when you were reading it?

650
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,160
 - The essays themselves were my drug, James.

651
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,800
 - What am I on?

652
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,000
 I'm on chapter three.

653
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,640
 - I mean, they didn't come in chapters, but whatever.

654
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,800
 - You know, in shopping centers

655
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,960
 where the fish eat your dead skin?

656
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,800
 - I've had that once,

657
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,360
 and all I could think while I was having it

658
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,800
 was reincarnation and just looking

659
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,960
 at the guy, "What the fuck did you do in your last life

660
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,280
 "that you have come back to eat my feet?"

661
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,120
 - This is--

662
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,040
 - I had it once, and I think I've told you guys this,

663
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,800
 but I had it once in Cambodia,

664
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,800
 and they had to ask me to take my feet out of the pond,

665
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,280
 'cause you put your feet in with like five other people,

666
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
 and my feet is so disgusting

667
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,320
 that they were all coming to my feet,

668
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,800
 and no one else was getting their money's worth.

669
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,520
 (audience laughing)

670
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,680
 That's a real, real, actually low point.

671
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,840
 (audience laughing)

672
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,360
 - Proud-wise, me.

673
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,940
 (upbeat music)

674
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:17,080
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two about Anna Tyshinski,

675
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,200
 and that is Andy.

676
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,880
 - Well, my fact is a crowdsourced fact.

677
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,720
 - Yeah.

678
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,680
 - So, as you know, there's a Discord.

679
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,760
 If you don't know Discord,

680
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,840
 it's a website where you chat about stuff.

681
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,480
 Is that what it is?

682
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,120
 - Why did you bother explaining if you have no idea?

683
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,480
 It's a forum, it's a forum to chat.

684
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,320
 There is a fish Discord, the fish cord,

685
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,320
 and as part of Anna's commemoration episode.

686
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,160
 - Morning, morning episode, I think, yeah.

687
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,320
 - Morning sickness, hi-o.

688
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,960
 (laughing)

689
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,960
 Dan, I think you asked for some of Anna's best bits.

690
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,880
 - Yeah.

691
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,640
 - And asked what listeners, you know,

692
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,680
 fish fans wanted to hear again.

693
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,520
 I mean, various bits.

694
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,160
 - You can make a compilation of Anna saying her own surname.

695
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,000
 - Correctly.

696
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,520
 - When do you say your own surname?

697
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,960
 - Yeah, I don't know if you can make a compilation out of that.

698
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,000
 - You can certainly make a compilation of the evolution

699
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,960
 of my pronunciation of your surname.

700
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,240
 - Yeah, a lot of people got quite sad

701
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,080
 when you evolved from pronouncing it,

702
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,960
 well, as some people said wrongly, Tyshinski to Tyshinski.

703
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,440
 - Well, yeah, and I always say that it was a bit of a,

704
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,880
 it was a bit unfair on me because you were right here

705
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,160
 to tell me I was saying it wrong for about six years,

706
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,560
 and no one did.

707
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,000
 No one did, your dad didn't, your mom didn't,

708
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,160
 anytime any of your family came to our show,

709
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,400
 no one would say, by the way,

710
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,840
 do you think you might be able to pronounce

711
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,840
 the surname correctly?

712
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,800
 No one said anything.

713
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,920
 And yours was a surname that I specifically,

714
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,800
 if I would say, like, next fact is James,

715
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,800
 next fact is Andy, I would say next fact, Tyshinski.

716
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,040
 I would always say your surname.

717
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,720
 So it was always coming up.

718
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,320
 - But I think, do you remember them?

719
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,640
 Oh, Larry really liked it.

720
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,280
 'Cause then he had the Schreiber and Tyshinski cops,

721
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,320
 maybe who were trying to find the president's anus.

722
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,640
 - To your cops, yeah, we got to get to the bottom

723
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,600
 of this big laundry bill, Tyshinski.

724
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,320
 - Oh, nice, yeah.

725
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,640
 What's your pronunciation?

726
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,640
 - I say Tyshinski, but you can also say Tyshinski,

727
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,880
 or a lot of people do say Tyshinski,

728
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,600
 and it's weird that people assume that's the way

729
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,440
 you could say it.

730
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,840
 It's quite different starting with a chub.

731
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,680
 - It's P-T, yeah.

732
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,040
 You don't call it a charodactyl, do you?

733
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,680
 - You don't, I don't know, or a charmigan.

734
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,520
 But I should say for actual Polish listeners

735
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,160
 that it's Tyshinski, so you're supposed to say the P.

736
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,680
 So I don't pronounce it right, either.

737
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,520
 - Okay, there we go.

738
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,040
 - And I sort of should also be Ptazinska, 'cause I'm a girl.

739
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,880
 - Oh, no way.

740
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,720
 - Wow.

741
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,560
 - I am.

742
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,880
 (laughing)

743
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,440
 - I don't remember this suggestion for a clip to play.

744
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,240
 Episode 342, no such thing as a presidential fight club.

745
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,640
 Anna refers to a child as a wimp because he had asthma.

746
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,200
 - And that child, ladies and gentlemen,

747
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,480
 grew up to be a podcaster, Andrew Hudson.

748
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,440
 (laughing)

749
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,840
 - There's probably some context that I haven't seen

750
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,440
 in the reports of that myself,

751
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,320
 and I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation,

752
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,520
 but I'm gonna refer it to a committee

753
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,360
 that we will investigate.

754
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,240
 - You'll end up being suspended for nine months.

755
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,080
 It's perfect, it's a perfect crime.

756
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,680
 So funny what people remember, like one person wrote,

757
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,200
 "I can't remember which episode."

758
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,680
 So this is them, like they've literally

759
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,840
 bankless in their head, you can't remember which episode,

760
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,240
 but Anna calling Matanus to Tunis, mootie tootie.

761
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,840
 (laughing)

762
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,640
 - Lives rent free in my brain.

763
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,600
 Mootie tootie tootie tootie tootie tootie.

764
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

765
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,160
 - I don't remember this bit at all,

766
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,400
 and neither does the person who said it.

767
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,800
 I don't remember the episode,

768
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,200
 but it was about some female animal drinking semen,

769
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,080
 and Anna was like, yeah, relatable.

770
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,360
 Sometimes the tap is just too far away.

771
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,600
 (laughing)

772
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
 Don't recall that.

773
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,600
 - Just a few times at uni, and a terrible hangover is,

774
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,840
 there's a cut by the bed, what are you gonna do?

775
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,020
 - Fill me up love before you go, but then do go.

776
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,280
 (laughing)

777
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,720
 - Yeah, I mean, you've had a lot of feedback

778
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,480
 about your kind of quite dirty-ish potty mouth,

779
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,320
 I would say.

780
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,080
 - I feel like I'm the least potty.

781
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,920
 - I think people just notice it more when you do it.

782
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,040
 - Yeah, yeah.

783
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,000
 - I think that's it, it's everyday sexism.

784
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,760
 - Well, actually, there's a bit of a debate,

785
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,080
 even on the Discord about you, Anna.

786
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,920
 So, one person says,

787
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,560
 if you go back and listen to the first year's episodes,

788
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,840
 Anna's so restrained and polite in comparison,

789
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,920
 and then she gets comfortable

790
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,360
 and the sarcasm starts to flow, okay?

791
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,760
 Now, someone has replied to that saying,

792
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,480
 "I'm on episode 39, she has never been polite."

793
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,760
 (laughing)

794
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,320
 - I think there is one episode,

795
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,320
 I remember editing it, where you're polite

796
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,040
 for about two thirds of the episode,

797
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,640
 and then for the final third of the episode,

798
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,400
 you just go completely off the rails.

799
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,240
 - Really?

800
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,320
 - And it was the episode when you drank

801
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,560
 a pint of champagne before the show.

802
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,800
 - Oh no, God, that wasn't the only one,

803
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,640
 one of our first live shows.

804
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,320
 - I think it might have been our actual first live show,

805
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,240
 or maybe our second.

806
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,600
 - It was like, it was a Christmas one,

807
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,760
 and it was an Aces and Aces.

808
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,600
 - Aces and Aces.

809
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,440
 - In North London.

810
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,280
 - That's right.

811
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,440
 - And you can really, you can pinpoint

812
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,960
 the exact second that the champagne hits.

813
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,360
 - What's confusing is that I'm sure Dan and I

814
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,400
 drunk pints of champagne for that,

815
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,440
 and I also am sure that Dan

816
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,760
 is more of a lightweight than I am.

817
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,280
 - Yeah, but the difference is

818
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,080
 that Dan is never coherent.

819
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,920
 (laughing)

820
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,760
 - You can't tell.

821
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,600
 - Yes.

822
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,440
 - That's a beauty.

823
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,000
 - Exactly, I'm bulletproof.

824
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,600
 - I'm drunk now, no one's noticed.

825
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,960
 (laughing)

826
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,040
 - Episode 261.

827
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,880
 - Oh yeah.

828
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,760
 - Dan's talking about Scott of the Antarctic

829
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,680
 taking two gramophones with him.

830
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,760
 Anna, he was a fucking idiot, wasn't he?

831
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,000
 (laughing)

832
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,160
 - You gotta stand by that, it's not surprising he died.

833
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,120
 You know, he didn't take two gramophones.

834
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,960
 Amundsen.

835
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,800
 - Amundsen.

836
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,620
 - Yeah, yeah.

837
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,440
 Actually, I hate saying that name so much,

838
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,280
 I could never say it.

839
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,120
 - You said it quite weird.

840
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,960
 - I know.

841
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,800
 - Amundsen.

842
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,640
 - Amundsen.

843
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,480
 - Amundsen.

844
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,800
 (laughing)

845
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,520
 - I don't know why I see it coming up in my head.

846
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,440
 Is this how you feel down with all words?

847
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,240
 - Yeah, yeah, I do.

848
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,200
 I see them coming up on the page

849
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,440
 and you gotta make a decision.

850
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,680
 You're either gonna try and pronounce it correctly,

851
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,840
 get it wrong, or, and check it out

852
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,880
 and get it wrong just for that,

853
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,280
 or you just gotta run through it.

854
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,640
 You just gotta, you gotta.

855
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,280
 - It reminds me, and I know this is a podcast about Anna,

856
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,040
 but it does remind me of the first audiobook that we did,

857
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,240
 (laughing)

858
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,280
 which was just after you'd had your first baby

859
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,440
 and were very short on sleep.

860
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,960
 And Dan kept pronouncing the word January, February.

861
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,280
 (laughing)

862
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
 - Like six times.

863
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

864
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,520
 - We were like, Dan, Dan, you said February.

865
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,840
 Can you just do it again?

866
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,680
 - Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

867
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,280
 - Okay, here we go.

868
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,120
 - February.

869
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,320
 (laughing)

870
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,720
 - It was remarkable.

871
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,560
 It was really something.

872
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,480
 - And we had to change the whole article at the end,

873
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,280
 didn't we, to something that happened in February?

874
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
 - I used to love those books

875
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,080
 'cause they were the books of the year

876
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,760
 and it was like things that happened

877
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,360
 between January and December that year.

878
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,920
 Obviously, the book came out in November,

879
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,360
 so it's usually January to September or October.

880
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,680
 But Andy used to always come in

881
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,160
 with things that had happened the previous year.

882
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,520
 And Anna would be like, no, this was last year.

883
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,360
 And he's like, yeah, but it was late 20, come on, it was December.

884
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,920
 - My reasoning here

885
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,880
 is that you're doing one of these books a year.

886
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,640
 Each book has to have a 12 month catchment area.

887
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,360
 It's the book of, not the calendar year,

888
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,200
 not the calendar year,

889
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,280
 but the, like the school year or the school year.

890
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,560
 - Yeah, the financial year.

891
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
 - That's right, the school year.

892
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,120
 - You started in September.

893
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,960
 - Everyone understands,

894
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,920
 otherwise you're knocking out a third of your own material.

895
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,600
 - Why didn't we name it the book of the school year,

896
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,440
 actually?

897
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,760
 (laughing)

898
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,600
 - So honest.

899
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,440
 - The book of the financial year

900
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,960
 would have really set those sales rocketing.

901
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,800
 - Yeah.

902
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,000
 (laughing)

903
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,240
 - Have we got one last one, Andy or?

904
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,960
 - Anna is among the 10% of people

905
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,080
 who can lick their own nose.

906
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,920
 - What?

907
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,760
 - Oh.

908
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,600
 - We did a, okay.

909
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,440
 - Oh my God, yeah.

910
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,680
 - She's doing it, she's doing it.

911
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,000
 - We did a fact about Buddha

912
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,680
 and how Buddha could stick his tongue through his ear.

913
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,000
 - Into his ear, that was it.

914
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,840
 - Yeah.

915
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,720
 - And then you showed us that.

916
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,560
 - Yeah.

917
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,320
 - And had lots of other stuff that I don't have, though.

918
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,240
 - Weird body part anomalies.

919
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,200
 I also actually have a lot,

920
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,760
 but they're less sort of magical than Buddha's.

921
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,360
 And more like get medical help.

922
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,560
 (laughing)

923
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,280
 - That's good though, touching your nose.

924
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,120
 I can't do that.

925
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,720
 - Your tongue barely gets out of your mouth.

926
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,240
 - I think I'm tongue tied.

927
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,080
 - Oh, really?

928
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,120
 - And that's why you're so bad at breastfeeding, isn't it?

929
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,960
 - Yes.

930
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,280
 (laughing)

931
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,320
 - But I'm still trying.

932
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,040
 - Yeah, good on you.

933
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,440
 - That's it, we'll get you there.

934
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,880
 - Oh, that's a bristly experience, Dan.

935
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,720
 You're very bearded.

936
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,560
 (laughing)

937
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,400
 - That's so rough.

938
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,720
 - Yeah, it's not good for the--

939
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,880
 - It's because of breast and rash happening there.

940
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,560
 - Highly sanded boobs up here there.

941
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,800
 (laughing)

942
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,480
 - The nipples almost gone all together.

943
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,320
 (laughing)

944
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,760
 It's just a flat, floppy out potato.

945
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,600
 (laughing)

946
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,000
 - It's just a flat potato.

947
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,920
 - Can we have some more of Anna, please?

948
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,760
 (laughing)

949
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,720
 Classic Czazinski.

950
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,400
 - Okay, well, I'll have a look on the archives.

951
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,880
 Let's see if we can find some of the things

952
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,760
 that you've mentioned in the next little Anna compilation.

953
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,340
 (upbeat music)

954
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:07,560
 - My fact is that the way to recognize the Buddha

955
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,400
 is to look out for his webbed feet,

956
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
 a tongue that can reach his ears,

957
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,920
 and withdrawn genitalia.

958
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,040
 - That's a good excuse on a date.

959
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,000
 - No, no, no, it's not small.

960
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 I'm just, I'm the Buddha, I'm the reincarnated Buddha.

961
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,160
 - Oh yeah, then show me your tongue,

962
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,760
 'cause I could get on board with this.

963
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,000
 (laughing)

964
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 - I read that female beetles,

965
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,800
 they quench their thirst through sex,

966
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,760
 and it's because of the semen and the fluids in the semen,

967
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,160
 'cause they get very dehydrated,

968
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,240
 and so when they have sex,

969
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,920
 it's actually just like having a drink for them.

970
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,880
 - That's the reason we all do it, Dan.

971
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,240
 (laughing)

972
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,320
 - Sometimes the tap is too far away.

973
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,580
 (laughing)

974
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:58,840
 - A few people who were farmers

975
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
 who were involved in castrating lambs

976
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,880
 when they were born got very ill very quickly,

977
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,800
 and there was 12 people who got ill,

978
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,960
 but they worked out that two of them got ill

979
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,480
 because they were castrating with an old method

980
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,080
 that still goes on these days,

981
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,400
 not completely, but in the 1800s all the time.

982
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,240
 They castrate using their teeth,

983
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,560
 so these are, yeah, these are humans who go,

984
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,360
 and two of these guys were castrating these lambs

985
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,720
 with their teeth, and they got very ill.

986
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,240
 - One of my best friends has done that in Australia.

987
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,480
 - Really? - West Australia, yep.

988
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,640
 - Did they get ill?

989
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,280
 - Well, he's pretty insane, but he's not sick.

990
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,080
 - What, I think he is sick, yeah.

991
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,480
 (laughing)

992
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,920
 - And they go by on a conveyor belt, right,

993
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,800
 and you lie underneath them,

994
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,040
 and you just whip him off on by one.

995
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,880
 - What?

996
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,720
 - Yeah.

997
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,760
 - Well, you come up like Jaws,

998
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,760
 like you just bite off their balls?

999
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,760
 - Is your friend Australian?

1000
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,960
 - He lived in Australia for a year.

1001
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,120
 - Well, he was British.

1002
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,960
 - Yeah.

1003
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,680
 - Feels like they kind of saw him coming, didn't they?

1004
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,520
 - Yeah.

1005
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,080
 - Yeah, we all do this, mate.

1006
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,200
 (laughing)

1007
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,560
 - This guy looks like he'll bite the balls off anything.

1008
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,280
 - I just don't get wrestling.

1009
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,120
 - What?

1010
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,320
 - It doesn't make any sense to me.

1011
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,560
 We've covered it before on this podcast,

1012
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,320
 and I find it impossible to research,

1013
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,200
 'cause everything you read about it,

1014
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,240
 you're like, is this real?

1015
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,920
 Did this really happen?

1016
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,560
 The confusion of real sport and fake acting is bewildering.

1017
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,400
 Like, there's this fight between him and Hulk Hogan,

1018
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,200
 which was this really famous fight,

1019
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,640
 and apparently it was super controversial.

1020
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,840
 It was in 1988, and there was a referee,

1021
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,080
 a famous referee called Dave Hebner,

1022
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,480
 who was refereed wrestling matches,

1023
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
 and he happened to have an identical twin.

1024
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,320
 - Oh, yes.

1025
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,920
 - And they tracked down for this match.

1026
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,760
 - The referee?

1027
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,200
 - Yeah, the referee had an identical twin.

1028
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,520
 - Okay, he didn't really, I think.

1029
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,880
 - No, he did really.

1030
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,280
 I've seen the actual pictures, either he did,

1031
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,760
 or there's some amazing Photoshopping going on,

1032
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,880
 but he had this identical twin,

1033
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,040
 and so, right, Andre the Giant's agent

1034
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,680
 got Dave, who was supposed to referee the match,

1035
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,320
 locked him in a cupboard, and then bribed Earl,

1036
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,240
 his identical twin, to referee the game instead,

1037
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,040
 and he did, and then he made Andre the Giant won,

1038
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,080
 and then Dave broke out of his closet,

1039
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,000
 and then him and his identical twin brother

1040
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,520
 had a big fight afterwards in front of the crowd.

1041
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,040
 - This is the weirdest conversation.

1042
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,400
 - I really wanna hear Anna doing the Coventry of WWF.

1043
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,280
 - I don't understand any of this.

1044
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,640
 Is that real?

1045
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,480
 Oh my God.

1046
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,800
 - But there's storylines, there's storylines.

1047
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,000
 You go to the theater all the time,

1048
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,840
 are you standing up and going,

1049
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,160
 "What the fuck is going on here?"

1050
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,920
 - No, no, no, because in the write-ups of the theater,

1051
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,000
 it doesn't say, and there was an incredibly

1052
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,480
 controversial moment when Hamlet's mother

1053
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,640
 remarried Hamlet's uncle, and the audience couldn't,

1054
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,400
 you're like, "Okay, this is a story."

1055
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,240
 There was in the Wikipedia page, there's this one.

1056
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,240
 Was it controversial, or was it all made up?

1057
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,560
 - It's all made up.

1058
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,960
 - It's all made up, it's all made up.

1059
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,600
 - Then why is it controversial?

1060
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,960
 - It's controversial in the world of wrestling.

1061
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,160
 - Which is a fake world.

1062
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,120
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1063
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,720
 - Okay. - Now you're getting it.

1064
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,560
 (all laughing)

1065
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,000
 - No, it is weird how it's presented as true.

1066
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,440
 You know, normally it plays, there is a synopsis,

1067
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,520
 and normally when you go out of the play,

1068
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,560
 the thing doesn't keep happening out.

1069
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,520
 - No, but I just think it's amazing

1070
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,920
 that we found the edge of Anna's comfort zone.

1071
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,080
 - Yeah.

1072
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,440
 - I never thought we'd get there.

1073
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,120
 - Who would know as pro wrestling is fake?

1074
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,600
 (all laughing)

1075
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,480
 - The town choir championships.

1076
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,160
 I just think this is so amazing

1077
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,240
 that these kind of things have the budget for this.

1078
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,400
 - I've been there once.

1079
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,240
 - What?

1080
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,440
 (all laughing)

1081
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,640
 - Did not place.

1082
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,240
 (all laughing)

1083
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,840
 (all laughing)

1084
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,320
 - What?

1085
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,760
 Do you know where they were held, the last ones?

1086
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,720
 - The one I went to was in either Lancashire

1087
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,800
 or Yorkshire, I can't remember.

1088
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,000
 - Cool, the last one was in Bermuda, so I feel like.

1089
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,240
 (all laughing)

1090
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,440
 - Do you ever get the feeling you chose the wrong year?

1091
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,240
 (all laughing)

1092
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,640
 - I mean, who was paying for town choir, it's good.

1093
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,920
 Anyway, this year, it's the first time a Brit

1094
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,920
 has won the town choir championship.

1095
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,040
 It was very exciting.

1096
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,120
 - Mark Wiley beat off 24 other contestants.

1097
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,120
 (all laughing)

1098
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,840
 - And they were like, "Oh, yay!"

1099
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,420
 (all laughing)

1100
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:26,800
 - It's one of the requirements these days.

1101
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,640
 (all laughing)

1102
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,960
 He actually said.

1103
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,360
 - For legal reasons, we have to correct that.

1104
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,200
 (all laughing)

1105
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,200
 - Sorry, so this guy won over and above

1106
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,040
 24 other contestants.

1107
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,200
 What he won was an awful lot of rum, he said.

1108
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,160
 (all laughing)

1109
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,480
 Which I needed for medicinal purposes.

1110
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,040
 He explained which is understandable

1111
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,640
 after the trauma he'd undergone, so.

1112
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,240
 (all laughing)

1113
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:03,800
 - Okay, it's time for fact number three,

1114
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,840
 and that is my fact.

1115
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,800
 My fact this week is that we're sitting here

1116
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,480
 in the Covent Garden office.

1117
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,520
 This is a important room to us,

1118
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,880
 and it's the last time the four of us

1119
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,440
 are ever gonna be in this room together doing the podcast

1120
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,320
 'cause Anna's going off and the offices are moving.

1121
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,040
 But it's also important for another reason

1122
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,880
 because in 2022, Anna and I set a Guinness World Record

1123
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,000
 right here in this room.

1124
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,720
 We became the world record holders of the longest

1125
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,480
 anyone has ever played.

1126
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,160
 Keep the balloon in the air, tennis game between two people.

1127
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,440
 - That was amazing. - In history.

1128
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,960
 - I remember that three weeks when you were doing that,

1129
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,560
 it was just 'cause we were coming

1130
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,440
 and we'd have to work around you.

1131
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
 - Record the podcast each week.

1132
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,000
 - Oh my God, it was so hard.

1133
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,840
 It was tough, wasn't it?

1134
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,440
 - And not sleeping to that level.

1135
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,800
 I mean, the amount of Red Bull that we had to.

1136
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,400
 - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

1137
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,880
 By the third week, I just was really surprised

1138
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,720
 you were still doing it.

1139
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,280
 - Yeah, so that was the rehearsal.

1140
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,640
 When we actually did it, it was 80 minutes

1141
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,560
 we lost it, 80 minutes for keeping a balloon in there.

1142
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,840
 - And do you still have that record?

1143
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,960
 - We've been beaten.

1144
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,600
 - Oh no. - Yep, we've been beaten.

1145
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
 Someone beat us by eight seconds.

1146
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,920
 With, I would argue, an unfair advantage.

1147
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,160
 They had a giant balloon.

1148
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,640
 It was like the size of a beach ball.

1149
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,720
 - It should be a restriction on balloon size.

1150
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,960
 - Well, you should have read the small print.

1151
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,400
 - I should have read the small print, yeah.

1152
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,560
 But one thing we did manage to do

1153
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,000
 is make it into a physical Guinness World Record book.

1154
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,200
 So there's a picture of me and Anna

1155
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,760
 in the Guinness World Records 2023.

1156
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,040
 - That's not us, what?

1157
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,120
 - What, that's, that's-

1158
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,320
 - Oh there, sorry, I was gonna get that bloke below.

1159
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,680
 - Who was the chicken in your mind when I was-

1160
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,640
 (all laughing)

1161
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,720
 - That's your man holding a chicken.

1162
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,080
 - What about, is that Irving Finkel above you?

1163
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,920
 - That is Irving Finkel.

1164
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,880
 - And what does it say?

1165
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,560
 Oldest depiction of a ghost.

1166
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,640
 - Oldest depiction of a ghost.

1167
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,560
 - You're really on the best page here, right?

1168
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,680
 - Well, what you'll notice as well

1169
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,280
 is I'm responsible for that ghost

1170
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,120
 getting the Guinness World Record, yeah.

1171
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,960
 - Tell us how.

1172
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,120
 - I took Craig Glende, who is the Guinness World Records

1173
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,920
 editor-in-chief to the British Museum

1174
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,240
 to meet the world's oldest ghost

1175
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,400
 to give it a Guinness World Record.

1176
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,920
 - I wonder if you're the only person in that book, Dan,

1177
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,280
 who's got two world records.

1178
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,120
 - And that's possible.

1179
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,960
 - Is Usain Bolt in there?

1180
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,480
 - No, you can't claim the same world record

1181
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,320
 as Irving Finkel.

1182
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,440
 You didn't find the oldest ghost.

1183
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,120
 - No, no, I just got the oldest ghost.

1184
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,280
 - I just, you know.

1185
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,440
 - I'm sorry, Dan, can I just check this book?

1186
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,360
 Can I just have a quick look at it?

1187
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,400
 So this is, Guinness World Records 2023.

1188
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,240
 - Yeah.

1189
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,680
 - And it's about an event that happened in 2022.

1190
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,520
 - Yeah.

1191
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,360
 (all laughing)

1192
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,760
 - And this is maybe the most successful book in history.

1193
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
 (all laughing)

1194
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,280
 - Oh, okay.

1195
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,520
 Maybe it's all right sometimes.

1196
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,100
 (all laughing)

1197
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,280
 - Yeah, but so we did that.

1198
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,760
 We did that here in this room.

1199
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,480
 - This ghost was depicted 2,500 years ago.

1200
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,240
 (all laughing)

1201
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,200
 - Yes, yes, the world's oldest ghost

1202
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,920
 is not going to have appeared in 2023.

1203
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,400
 (all laughing)

1204
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,640
 But yeah, it's, and Anna, that's for you,

1205
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,800
 'cause I know you don't have a copy.

1206
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,280
 So I want you to have,

1207
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,800
 because obviously you don't have a copy.

1208
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,480
 You're not interested in this kind of stuff.

1209
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,840
 So yeah, so now we're forcing a copy onto you.

1210
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,760
 - I mean, we did, we cheated, didn't we?

1211
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,000
 - We did cheat, we didn't cheat.

1212
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,840
 - Oh, hello.

1213
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,680
 - What are you talking about?

1214
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,520
 We didn't cheat.

1215
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,160
 - Well, we're friends with Craig, who's fantastic,

1216
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,040
 who organizes all the Guinness stuff,

1217
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,680
 and he gave us a tip-off

1218
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,840
 that no one's tried to break this category,

1219
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,160
 but it is a category.

1220
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,920
 So as long as you get over an hour.

1221
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,520
 So Ashley, we went for 20 minutes more than we needed to,

1222
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,760
 which showed a lot of commitment,

1223
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,440
 'cause it was pub time by then.

1224
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,280
 - It's right, yeah, and Anna drank the whole way through.

1225
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,080
 There's a big glass of wine in her hand.

1226
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,440
 I think I had a beer, but it was,

1227
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,600
 I can't quite remember now.

1228
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,840
 It was daunting.

1229
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,680
 It was very scary.

1230
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,320
 It's very scary keeping a balloon in the air, wasn't it?

1231
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,760
 Do you remember the like, the-

1232
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,400
 - I'm sorry, what is riding on it really?

1233
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,240
 I mean, if you-

1234
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,160
 - There was a bomb inside and it touches the ground.

1235
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,400
 - You literally could've just tried again the next day,

1236
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,840
 or the next hour.

1237
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,080
 - Do you know how tedious it is,

1238
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,520
 saying that we're just down Shriver for almost two hours.

1239
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,160
 (all laughing)

1240
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,120
 - The record should have been

1241
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,360
 the person who spent the most time with that Shriver.

1242
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,120
 (all laughing)

1243
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,120
 - Even the Goat pissed off after 20 minutes.

1244
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,080
 I'll tell you what, there's been a lot of adventures

1245
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,520
 where Anna has been the kind of,

1246
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,320
 the butt of the story, I would say, to an extent.

1247
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,320
 Like Little Adventures.

1248
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,000
 - The Garfield Danes of the Stories.

1249
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,920
 - The ass, we will be missing the ass soon.

1250
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,760
 - What are you talking about?

1251
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,320
 - I just, I get a bit upset

1252
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,280
 because I wasn't there for some of my favorite ones,

1253
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,160
 and James was.

1254
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,200
 James, you two have had quite a few adventures.

1255
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,560
 Well, there was the time that Anna flipped over

1256
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,640
 her bike by canal, knocked her teeth out,

1257
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,000
 and you had to rescue her outside a pub because-

1258
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,080
 - I wouldn't say I rescued her.

1259
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,280
 I took her to the hospital.

1260
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,240
 - Yeah, that was very nice of you

1261
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,640
 'cause they didn't have a phone on me or anything,

1262
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,600
 and so I had to wait for a pass by to come.

1263
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,940
 - Who do you think knocked you off the bike?

1264
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,020
 (all laughing)

1265
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,080
 - Well, can I just say on that?

1266
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,480
 'Cause it was quite funny, 'cause we're in A&E,

1267
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,640
 and we were just sat there waiting for you to be seen,

1268
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,840
 and you just come back from Ireland,

1269
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,120
 you've been on holiday in Ireland,

1270
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,800
 and you were telling me a story about what had happened,

1271
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,440
 and for some reason you'd upset someone who ran a shop,

1272
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,440
 and you upset this woman so much

1273
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,760
 that she started shouting at you, saying,

1274
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,880
 "Who the hell do you think you are?"

1275
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,920
 And when you told me the story,

1276
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,400
 you said it in a really thick Irish accent.

1277
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,600
 - I could do it now.

1278
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,600
 - Well, let's not do that, but you said it

1279
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,680
 just as the doctor was coming from behind you

1280
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,720
 to say, "Anatoshinsky, where are you?"

1281
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,400
 And so all he saw was me and you,

1282
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,120
 you with your face covered in blood,

1283
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,960
 and you yelling at me, "Who the hell do you think you are?"

1284
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,400
 And we just looked like some kind of domestic abuse couple.

1285
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,560
 - Oh, my God.

1286
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,080
 - Yes, we're working on our issues.

1287
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,120
 Just fix my jaw, let's get out of here.

1288
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,280
 - He would have heard then you go to an English accent

1289
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,960
 and think, "Okay, she's seriously wobbly,

1290
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,560
 something's happened, we need to keep her in."

1291
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,000
 - You just gotta have foreign accents in real life.

1292
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,840
 - Exactly, yeah.

1293
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,680
 - Who's the president?

1294
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,240
 - Or the T-sock, you know.

1295
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,520
 (all laughing)

1296
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,080
 - But the best story, and I don't know if you're gonna say it,

1297
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,760
 I just wanna tear it up and say,

1298
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,960
 "I hope you'll say it."

1299
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,440
 And it's the regret of my life, I wasn't there for it,

1300
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,680
 is when James and Anna went to a university

1301
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,080
 in order to tell the students Canterbury,

1302
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,520
 and you stayed the night in a hotel,

1303
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,080
 and Anna got a bit drunk.

1304
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,040
 (all laughing)

1305
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,880
 - I don't think I should tell the story.

1306
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,520
 - I should have, I don't know.

1307
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,160
 - I'll tell you what I remember of it,

1308
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,840
 which is that James and I went and,

1309
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,640
 yeah, Alan Davies was doing a show at Canterbury.

1310
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,480
 You went to do something.

1311
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,680
 - I think he just got like an honorary degree

1312
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,520
 or something like that.

1313
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,480
 - Yes, he had, and so he was being interviewed,

1314
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,320
 and it was great.

1315
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,400
 And so we went for some moral support.

1316
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,320
 Me, James, Alan, and--

1317
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,160
 - John Lloyd?

1318
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,000
 - John Lloyd.

1319
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,360
 - Alan went to support himself.

1320
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,760
 (all laughing)

1321
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,720
 Do you know what, I'm gonna come along for moral support.

1322
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,280
 - For moral support.

1323
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,760
 - Afterwards, we had quite a lot to drink in some hotel bar,

1324
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,760
 and we were staying in this place

1325
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,600
 that was actually next to the cathedral, which was awesome.

1326
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,600
 - It was almost like part of the cathedral, wasn't it?

1327
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,760
 - It was kind of appended to it.

1328
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,800
 - Certainly a place where I wouldn't do anything.

1329
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,160
 (all laughing)

1330
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,000
 - God might judge adversely.

1331
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 So great night.

1332
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,760
 I guess at about three o'clock,

1333
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,480
 we sort of went to, we tried to bed,

1334
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,480
 and I have this thing often.

1335
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,560
 - In the morning.

1336
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,400
 (all laughing)

1337
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,240
 Bloody hell.

1338
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,080
 I didn't know that.

1339
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,520
 I thought it was all happened around 11 p.m., 11.30.

1340
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,760
 Three.

1341
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,840
 - Woo.

1342
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,600
 And he's always stopped at that bit of the story,

1343
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,040
 just jaw on the floor, can't hear anything else.

1344
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,040
 - Okay, go on, go on.

1345
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,480
 - So I really love looking round places

1346
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,720
 and sneaking into places that maybe I'm not supposed to be in,

1347
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,880
 and like disuse rooms and buildings,

1348
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,760
 and sometimes use buildings, whatever.

1349
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,960
 And so I wasn't really tired,

1350
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,840
 and I thought I'd go for a wander.

1351
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,280
 So I remember first of all,

1352
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,520
 pushing open a lot of doors in my hotel corridor

1353
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,400
 to see what opened.

1354
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,480
 (all laughing)

1355
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,920
 Managing to get into a sort of weird garden

1356
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,960
 out of a fire escape,

1357
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,440
 and then climbing over a fence into the cathedral,

1358
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,880
 kind of the cathedral, then wandering around there.

1359
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,560
 And then what happens often with me is,

1360
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,600
 you're drunk and you're in this place,

1361
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,440
 you're not allowed to be in,

1362
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
 and you're like, "Well, I guess I'll go back now."

1363
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,880
 So climbed back over the fence, went back upstairs,

1364
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,840
 and I pushed another door in the hotel,

1365
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,040
 and ended up in this lecture theater,

1366
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,320
 where I sort of fanied around for a bit,

1367
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,840
 looked in all the cupboards,

1368
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,920
 trying to see what I could see really.

1369
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,680
 - You found a lot of candy, didn't you?

1370
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,920
 - I found a lot of sweets.

1371
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,560
 I found a massive bag of different colored sweets,

1372
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,720
 and I thought what would be so amusing would be,

1373
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,680
 if I took these all back to my room,

1374
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,600
 and I just took all the green ones out,

1375
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,040
 and then I just put it back in the room,

1376
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,600
 and that's when I freak the shit out

1377
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,600
 of whoever comes to get the sweets next time,

1378
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,960
 and also greens my favorite color of sweet.

1379
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,640
 So I spent about half an hour in my room

1380
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,320
 with a huge bag, taking out all the green sweets.

1381
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,320
 And then I went to put the bag of sweets back,

1382
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,440
 because I don't want to just steal all people's sweets.

1383
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,520
 And then as I was leaving the room,

1384
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,120
 having replaced the bag of sweets,

1385
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,000
 I just saw this massive whiteboard

1386
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,200
 at the front of the room,

1387
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,920
 and so I thought, okay, I'll just grab a marker pen.

1388
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,280
 I grabbed a marker pen and I wrote in big letters,

1389
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,000
 yippee-ki-ay, motherfuckers,

1390
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,320
 in capitals on this whiteboard.

1391
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,880
 And then that was actually ideal timing,

1392
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,960
 because I heard someone coming down the corridor,

1393
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,640
 and doing a bit of a, "Oi, and what are you doing?"

1394
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,600
 And so then I legged it and it was a member of staff,

1395
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,840
 so I legged it back to my room and she sort of chased me.

1396
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,000
 - So then you went to bed, right?

1397
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,160
 I've been asleep this whole time.

1398
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,440
 I woke up the next morning to check out,

1399
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,880
 and you were like a naughty school girl

1400
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,040
 sat in the corner of the reception,

1401
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,160
 being bollocked by someone.

1402
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,400
 (laughing)

1403
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,520
 - Yeah, it transpired.

1404
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,360
 It was actually very unlucky,

1405
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,720
 because it hadn't been a whiteboard.

1406
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,320
 It had been a built-in white screen

1407
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,000
 that was part of the wall.

1408
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,840
 (laughing)

1409
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,840
 I'd written on it in indelible, unremovable ink,

1410
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,080
 in large letters, yippee-ki-ay, motherfuckers.

1411
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,600
 A die-hard quote, oh, I do remember that from the night

1412
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,200
 before when I was chased by the security guard,

1413
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,280
 I was going, "It's a quote from die-hard."

1414
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,080
 (laughing)

1415
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,480
 To excuse it, like, "I'm not saying

1416
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,640
 "yippee-ki-ay, motherfuckers."

1417
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,320
 It's a quote. - It's a quote.

1418
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,720
 - Anyway, the push comes to shove.

1419
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,000
 "The next morning, at 9 a.m., there was a church group

1420
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,320
 "who had booked that room."

1421
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,580
 (laughing)

1422
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:14,600
 - That did seem to be the truth of the matter.

1423
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,440
 - They walked in.

1424
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,480
 - Someone desperately scrubbing off the bottom of the pot.

1425
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,040
 - They couldn't scrub it off, they had to cover it up.

1426
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,640
 They had to cover it up with a curtain.

1427
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,120
 And I was charged a small amount of money

1428
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,600
 for the repairs to the room.

1429
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,920
 - Less, in fact, probably,

1430
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,000
 than one small bag of laundry in New York City.

1431
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,680
 Pretty good going.

1432
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,800
 - It was the funniest thing that I've ever experienced,

1433
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,640
 being on the train coming back

1434
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,840
 and you having to ring up our boss to tell them,

1435
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,040
 because I think it had come off the company credit cards

1436
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,320
 or something, so you knew that they were gonna find out.

1437
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,520
 - No, they told our accountant at work.

1438
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,960
 So actually, the first thing I knew was,

1439
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,320
 just empathize for a minute with me, please.

1440
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,720
 I'd gone to bed incredibly drunk about four in the morning.

1441
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,760
 My phone rang at 8 a.m.

1442
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,160
 and I saw it was Liz, our lovely accountant.

1443
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,600
 And imagine the heart sinking

1444
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,920
 when I saw Liz's name come up.

1445
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,880
 I thought, I don't know what's happening.

1446
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,720
 (laughing)

1447
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,360
 Huff and rumble, and yeah, I picked up

1448
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,480
 and the hotel had indeed called her.

1449
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,440
 Yeah, it was tough.

1450
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,440
 I thought it was gonna be fired, actually.

1451
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,880
 We laughed now, guys, but this could have been

1452
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,720
 the end of the podcast.

1453
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,600
 - 'Cause I remember pretty much all the way from,

1454
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,560
 like, let's say, well, for about half an hour

1455
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,560
 on the train back, you're like,

1456
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,160
 "I'm gonna get fired, what are we gonna do?"

1457
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,000
 - Yeah.

1458
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,840
 - There'll be no more podcasts,

1459
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,000
 'cause I won't be able to do this anymore.

1460
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,880
 - Yeah, yeah, I'm probably going to prison.

1461
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,720
 - Yeah.

1462
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,560
 - And to hell.

1463
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,480
 Let's not forget the cathedral's right next door.

1464
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,320
 - Yeah.

1465
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,960
 - It's the greatest story ever told.

1466
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,400
 - Anyway, good luck getting those stories

1467
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,720
 out of these so-called guests you're having on in my house.

1468
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,760
 (laughing)

1469
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,440
 Is there a pass going to do that?

1470
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,960
 Yeah, she probably would.

1471
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,240
 She would have been up for it.

1472
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,880
 - Oh, well, let's have, why don't we do

1473
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,000
 one more batch of "Best of Anna"

1474
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,320
 and just hear a bit more from "The Greatest Hits"

1475
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,960
 from the last nine years, Anna Tyshensky.

1476
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,540
 (upbeat music)

1477
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:04,480
 - I was having a look at the Reverend Richard Coles'

1478
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,200
 autobiography, or biography.

1479
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,880
 And he was saying, it was just a throwaway line

1480
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,880
 that I then looked into.

1481
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,520
 He was saying that a lot of vickers have funny names,

1482
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,440
 and he was saying he knew someone who insisted

1483
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,040
 on everyone, even bishops, calling them the Reverend Gazz.

1484
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,880
 And so then I thought, "I wonder what funny names

1485
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,680
 there have been in the church over the years?"

1486
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,920
 There's this blog, the blog of St. Chrysostom's church

1487
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,000
 in Manchester, and it's really good.

1488
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,400
 You know when people put proper effort

1489
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,320
 into quite an obscure thing?

1490
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,560
 And there's a piece on funny names of church leaders

1491
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,440
 throughout history, and there are some such good ones.

1492
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,040
 So I like this anecdote, which is Henry Joy Fiennes Clinton,

1493
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,520
 who was a rector in the early 20th century,

1494
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,040
 who went to see the Bishop of London,

1495
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,360
 and the bishop said, "Take a chair, Clinton,"

1496
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,400
 to which he replied, "It's Fiennes Clinton."

1497
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,240
 And the bishop said, "In that case, take two."

1498
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,160
 And so it's just, I think that was funny from a bishop.

1499
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,520
 Come on, it's a... It's Bishapuma.

1500
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,960
 It's Bishapuma. It's Bishapuma, yeah.

1501
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,640
 Okay, we won't get him on the podcast.

1502
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,160
 Just this is his audition tape, and I thought...

1503
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,680
 Oh, no, come on, give us more zingers.

1504
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,480
 Right, wow.

1505
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,560
 Okay.

1506
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,400
 Okay, what about this?

1507
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,480
 The very Reverend Gonville-Obey French Baytag,

1508
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:22,320
 but French is spelled with a small F and two of them.

1509
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,200
 Is that important for the anecdote?

1510
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,160
 There's no anecdote.

1511
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,840
 It's just the word "French" spelled slightly differently.

1512
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:36,160
 No, Anna, we want you to tell us every single one you've found.

1513
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,240
 This is literally all I've got now.

1514
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,280
 It's just a super, not very amusing name.

1515
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,720
 Okay, Father John Brabazan, Brabazan Loutha.

1516
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,640
 Come on. It's two Brabazans.

1517
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,280
 Brabazan, Brabazan.

1518
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,520
 Oh, my God, I'm just picturing Jimmy Carr

1519
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,640
 at the Habersmith Apollo.

1520
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,800
 The next act is a fucking killer act.

1521
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,320
 She's got some amazing anecdotes.

1522
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,120
 Anna Tashinsky, everybody.

1523
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,480
 Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

1524
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,640
 We've got Father Page Turner, we've got Father Pickles.

1525
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,880
 Page Turner, open with Page Turner.

1526
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,840
 That's great. Father Pickles is funny as well.

1527
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,840
 I'll reorder the set.

1528
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,560
 Father Careful, Father Christmas.

1529
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,280
 Okay.

1530
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,880
 So that's the one I should stick with, Father Christmas.

1531
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,600
 You don't think stick with any of it.

1532
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,040
 Okay.

1533
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,640
 Have you guys heard of St Andrew Undershaft?

1534
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,360
 LAUGHTER

1535
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,760
 I can't believe...

1536
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,160
 You just said a name way funnier than Anna's 20 minutes.

1537
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,240
 Just upstage the full day of work.

1538
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,520
 I'm so sorry.

1539
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,080
 I've been delving into church, aren't I?

1540
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,400
 I'm so sorry.

1541
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,840
 This is right under your nose the whole time.

1542
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,480
 On the subject of people being allergic to things,

1543
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,640
 I went on to...

1544
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,480
 I continued my search.

1545
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,960
 And I went to Yahoo Answers,

1546
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,160
 because people often ask questions.

1547
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,800
 The best site on the internet.

1548
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,720
 This was the question.

1549
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,920
 So, "My girlfriend is allergic to almost every animal

1550
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,680
 "you'd find in a petting zoo.

1551
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,920
 "If she inhales air that is around a horse,

1552
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,400
 "she can be hospitalized.

1553
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,000
 "Now, she loves giraffes.

1554
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,360
 "Does anyone think she'd be allergic to them too?

1555
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,280
 "I was thinking of surprising her on her birthday

1556
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,720
 "with a trip to the local zoo to pet a giraffe."

1557
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,880
 And the reply, the top-rated reply,

1558
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,680
 because that's how it works on Yahoo Answers,

1559
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,000
 the most voted to reply,

1560
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,960
 "If she's allergic to almost every animal

1561
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:35,400
 "I guarantee you the zoo will contain more than just giraffes.

1562
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,880
 "Why don't you do something less stupid?"

1563
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,600
 LAUGHTER

1564
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,080
 So, where did you take her in the end, then?

1565
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,400
 I did, I did.

1566
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,320
 LAUGHTER

1567
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:52,800
 Britain's leading female table tennis player

1568
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,360
 is this woman, this girl, called Tintin Ho.

1569
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,040
 And do you guys...

1570
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,960
 Can you guess why she's called that?

1571
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,920
 She's got a quiff, Tintin.

1572
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,800
 That's why I was... No, I was thinking Tintin.

1573
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,880
 Got a small dog called Snowy.

1574
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,440
 Confusingly, it's not related to the character of Tintin.

1575
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,560
 Wait, she hangs out with an old fisherman called Captain Haddock.

1576
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,480
 Again, it's not like a thing.

1577
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,360
 She has a pair of twins that she hangs out with

1578
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,520
 called the Thompson twins.

1579
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,840
 You can't just stop us making Tintin jokes, Anna, immediately.

1580
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,000
 She's got her father is called Herge.

1581
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,760
 Right, as I have made quite clear, it's not related to Tintin,

1582
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,040
 and there must be other avenues you can pursue.

1583
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,600
 She's Belgian, you know?

1584
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,760
 Right, I'm just going to tell you, OK?

1585
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,880
 No, no, no, no, no. I feel like we're close.

1586
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,640
 She's made up ten.

1587
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,400
 Yeah, he's found something different, but incorrect.

1588
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,160
 No, it's because her dad is obsessed with table tennis.

1589
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,880
 And actually, that's kind of weird.

1590
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,440
 Sorry, hang on. It's coming, it's coming.

1591
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,200
 I was so sure you were going to say her dad is obsessed with Tintin.

1592
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,680
 I wish I hadn't brought this up.

1593
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,720
 He's obsessed with table tennis.

1594
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:05,640
 And the initials of table tennis are TT.

1595
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,520
 So we called her Tintin, and, in fact, her brother is called Ping.

1596
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,320
 And she said it was between her being called Tintin

1597
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,640
 and her being called Pong when she was born.

1598
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,560
 Wow. And so she says that she is delighted that she didn't get bombed.

1599
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,560
 You can't have two kids who call them Ping and Pong.

1600
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,200
 The social services will get involved.

1601
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,000
 You would think.

1602
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,000
 Aber, in 1976, they had the number one spot for 39 weeks,

1603
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,360
 and after 12 weeks of it, their version of Top of the Pops

1604
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,160
 just stopped showing the music video,

1605
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,120
 because you've seen it for 12 weeks, guys.

1606
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,400
 In Australia, that one. Yeah, fans absolutely rioted.

1607
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,560
 And that was on the Australian version of Top of the Pops,

1608
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,280
 which was called Countdown.

1609
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:51,120
 Yeah. Well, when you say fans rioted, did I say rioted?

1610
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,800
 Yeah. I meant, "were furious."

1611
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:58,360
 One complaint was registered with the ABC.

1612
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,120
 No, but generally, look, when they toured, one mother ran

1613
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,320
 and she put her baby down on the road

1614
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,280
 so that their tour caravan would stop and she could get an autograph.

1615
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,440
 Whoa. Right.

1616
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,080
 There was a hotel which cut up their bedsheets after they'd left,

1617
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,600
 and they sold it via newspaper.

1618
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,280
 Oh, they do that all the time. Yeah, they did that with the Beatles as well.

1619
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,520
 Did they? I've got about six of them. Not the baby thing, though.

1620
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,080
 I just wanted you to know we will not succumb to that kind of blackmail.

1621
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,800
 If there's a baby in front of our tour bus, we're going straight over it.

1622
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:27,240
 Who knows fish policy, right?

1623
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,560
 (LAUGHTER)

1624
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:35,920
 It's very important to get that clear from the outset.

1625
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,760
 That's good.

1626
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,720
 It's very controversial the way they vote in the Grammys.

1627
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,720
 Oh, yeah.

1628
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,440
 Because, well, until this year, it was super secret.

1629
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,040
 It sounds quite exciting.

1630
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,640
 And I think what used to happen was,

1631
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,840
 winners were decided by this, like, 12,000 strong

1632
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,960
 Recording Academy bunch of voters.

1633
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,840
 But then, I think, partly because the awards just kept going so wrong,

1634
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,040
 and they just kept giving it to weird people.

1635
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,960
 They had to change the rules, and I think the straw that broke the camel's back

1636
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,800
 came in the early '90s when "Album of the Year" was up,

1637
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,520
 and Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA" was released,

1638
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,320
 and "Princess Purple Rain" was released,

1639
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,280
 and Lionel Richie's "Can't Slow Down" won.

1640
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,880
 And everyone said, "We don't like that. That's not as good as the other two."

1641
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,680
 And so they formed a secret committee,

1642
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,520
 which basically goes through all the 12,000 votes and takes out the duds.

1643
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,520
 Because, actually, you would think that having a larger group, 12,000,

1644
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,080
 would be more likely to give you a democratic answer, right?

1645
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,080
 Yeah.

1646
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,000
 But a democratic answer isn't necessarily the best answer, James.

1647
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
 Is that not right?

1648
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:45,200
 That's my view, and my one-way ticket to Russia has just come through.

1649
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,160
 Anyway, people got quite pissed off by the secret committee

1650
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,560
 because no one knew how they voted or why they voted,

1651
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,160
 and there's someone called the Weekend, I think.

1652
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,160
 Oh, the Weekend.

1653
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,160
 The Weekend.

1654
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,160
 Oh, right.

1655
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,160
 Well, it's spelled the Weekend.

1656
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,160
 Yeah, yeah.

1657
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,160
 Um, so...

1658
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,160
 This show has certainly weakened over the years, hasn't it?

1659
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,160
 Yeah, so it's spelled like Weekend, anyway, but without any.

1660
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,160
 So, um, he...

1661
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,160
 Well, with two E's.

1662
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:15,160
 But not three.

1663
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,160
 Anyway, the Weekend got annoyed that he hadn't got nominated.

1664
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,160
 I think it's pronounced the Weckend.

1665
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,160
 Ladies and gentlemen, the Weekend.

1666
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,160
 I just...

1667
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:29,160
 I want a new podcast where we give Anna the name of all the partners

1668
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,160
 that are in the charts and see if she can pronounce them.

1669
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,160
 They've asked me to read out the nominations next year.

1670
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,160
 I'm quite nervous now.

1671
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,160
 Lil Nas the Tenth?

1672
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,160
 I didn't know there were nine other Lil Nases.

1673
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,160
 I know how to artificially inseminate a cow

1674
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,160
 based on researching for this podcast.

1675
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,160
 Cool.

1676
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,160
 So, about 5% of dairy cows in this country,

1677
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,160
 when they have to be inseminated,

1678
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,160
 they get inseminated just by semen rather than the actual bull.

1679
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,160
 And for some reason, I found myself reading

1680
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,160
 this really in-depth farmer's guide to how to do it.

1681
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,160
 And what I didn't realise was, so you get a semen gun,

1682
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,160
 which you put the semen in.

1683
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,160
 Imagine you bring your semen gun to a gunfight.

1684
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,160
 No!

1685
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,160
 Dammit.

1686
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,160
 You bring your semen gun to the insemination fight,

1687
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,160
 but what you do is, you have to...

1688
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,160
 So, there are two entries into a cow.

1689
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,160
 So, it's much like a human's...

1690
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,160
 Yeah.

1691
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,160
 You've got the...

1692
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,160
 Oh, sorry.

1693
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,160
 There are three now.

1694
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,160
 Oh, sorry, there are three.

1695
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,160
 We're in Devon.

1696
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,160
 Something tells me you're not the biggest expert in this room

1697
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,160
 on the number of ways into a cow.

1698
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,160
 I know that people in Devon know all these secret ways,

1699
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,160
 but there are two entries...

1700
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,160
 There are two entries into the back of a cow, officially.

1701
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,160
 And so, you know, one is the rectum, as we all have.

1702
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,160
 Stop, Professor. Let me write this down.

1703
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:05,160
 Children, wouldn't you be quiet?

1704
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:08,160
 You've got the rectum, and then you've got the sex tubes,

1705
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,160
 and they're different...

1706
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,160
 All right, the cervix.

1707
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,160
 But what you do is, amazingly, when you're inseminating a cow,

1708
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,160
 you obviously have to stick the gun in the cervix,

1709
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,160
 but the way you navigate the gun

1710
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:25,160
 into the uterine horns, as they're called,

1711
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,160
 is you have to put your other arm that's not holding the gun

1712
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,160
 into the rectum.

1713
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,160
 And so, it's so amazing.

1714
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,160
 And they say you shove your arm into the rectum,

1715
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,160
 insert your arm into the rectum,

1716
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,160
 get someone else to hold the cow's tail aside while you do this.

1717
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,160
 No, it would be a bald farmer who tried using one foot

1718
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,160
 to pin the cow's tail.

1719
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:53,160
 This is the worst game of Twister I've ever played.

1720
00:59:53,160 --> 01:00:00,160
 It says "left hand sex tubes."

1721
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,160
 Anyway, look.

1722
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,160
 It just feels like this lesson isn't going to end,

1723
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,160
 so you essentially use your rectum arm

1724
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,160
 to navigate your semen gun,

1725
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,160
 which is in the vaginal canal,

1726
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,160
 and you push it through.

1727
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,160
 So you've got your arm in the rectum,

1728
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,160
 and it's pushing against the other canal

1729
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,160
 so that it gets into the uterus,

1730
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,160
 and it's called rectovaginal insemination.

1731
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,160
 And that's lesson over. Enjoy.

1732
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:34,160
 Well, there we go.

1733
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,160
 There it is, some of the best of Anna Tyshinski's best bits.

1734
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,160
 I was trying to think, you know,

1735
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,160
 is there some way that we could keep a bit of you here, you know?

1736
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,160
 Oh, God, my God.

1737
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,160
 Is there some way...

1738
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,160
 We want her to give us the finger.

1739
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,160
 Give us the finger.

1740
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,160
 Just in spirit, you know? Just in spirit.

1741
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,160
 She's been metaphorically giving everyone the finger

1742
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,160
 for the last nine years.

1743
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,160
 I'll tell you what, though.

1744
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,160
 I thought hard about it.

1745
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,160
 I thought, "How do we keep a bit of Anna here?"

1746
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,160
 And I worked it out.

1747
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,160
 I suddenly remembered the weirdest story

1748
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,160
 I have ever heard involving Anna Tyshinski,

1749
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,160
 and it is this.

1750
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,160
 There was a Christmas party that Anna once went to,

1751
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,160
 and part of the party, they said,

1752
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,160
 "We're going to do a really fun thing.

1753
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,160
 We're going to do a raffle.

1754
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,160
 You're just going to take a ticket,

1755
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,160
 and you're going to get a present,

1756
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,160
 so everyone bring a present so you can give it to someone."

1757
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,160
 So, I was talking to the friend today who I bumped into.

1758
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,160
 She gave a scarf, for example.

1759
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,160
 Right.

1760
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,160
 Yeah, normal things.

1761
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,160
 Normal things were handed around.

1762
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,160
 This person, whose name is Lenny,

1763
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,160
 received her number and received her prize in the raffle.

1764
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,160
 I never met Lenny.

1765
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,160
 And this is the prize that Anna had donated.

1766
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,160
 It is her teeth.

1767
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,160
 Oh, my God!

1768
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,160
 That fell out of her mouth.

1769
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,160
 Lenny hasn't treasured and kept the teeth.

1770
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,160
 WTS.

1771
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,160
 She has.

1772
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,160
 They're in her home.

1773
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,160
 I went to her home today to pick it up.

1774
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,160
 This is Lenny didn't know who Anna was.

1775
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,160
 She opens up her present,

1776
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:02,160
 and there are teeth from one of the other party members there.

1777
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,160
 Were these the teeth that got knocked out

1778
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,160
 when James went to get you from...

1779
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,160
 Yeah.

1780
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,160
 Yeah, so these are the teeth.

1781
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,160
 They got removed.

1782
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,160
 I thought they were in the canal.

1783
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,160
 They're in the canal.

1784
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,160
 We weren't looking for them.

1785
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,160
 We did.

1786
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,160
 The fully knocked out ones were in the canal,

1787
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,160
 and they were the ones that had to get taken out later.

1788
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,160
 Bloody hell.

1789
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,160
 Yeah, so Anna thought it'd be normal

1790
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,160
 to give in a raffle prize her teeth away.

1791
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,160
 Now, Polly, who is the partner of Lenny,

1792
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,160
 tried to get rid of Anna's teeth to begin with

1793
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,160
 because she has a fear of teeth.

1794
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,160
 She literally hates the tapping of teeth.

1795
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,160
 It was the worst present that could have arrived into the house.

1796
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,160
 But as a result,

1797
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,160
 for the last couple of years since they've had these teeth,

1798
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:42,160
 Lenny hides your teeth all over the house to surprise Polly.

1799
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,160
 If she goes to sleep, she'll put it under her pillow.

1800
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,160
 If she's opening a pencil case,

1801
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,160
 the teeth will be inside the pencil case.

1802
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,160
 Reverse tooth fairy, basically.

1803
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,160
 And then they almost got given away in another raffle very recently,

1804
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,160
 but Lenny decided to keep them because she was having too much time.

1805
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,160
 How much did you pay for those, and have you told your wife?

1806
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,160
 But so, now, while you're gone, you are here.

1807
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,160
 There'll be a bit of Anna's always with us.

1808
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,160
 What we're going to do is we're going to make Sarah Pasco put some of those.

1809
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,160
 Every time there's a guest,

1810
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,160
 we're going to make them shove them into their face.

1811
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,160
 It's going to make the book all sound very weird, isn't it?

1812
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,160
 But it's worth it to get a bit of me.

1813
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,160
 Oh, well, I'm so honoured that my teeth have had such a life beyond me, actually.

1814
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,160
 I know. It's really exciting.

1815
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,160
 It's a weird story, Dan.

1816
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,160
 That's a weird story.

1817
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,160
 You're responsible too, Anna.

1818
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,160
 James is the only one who gets off Scott for it.

1819
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,160
 No, actually, you were involved in the losing of the teeth.

1820
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,160
 What? I was not.

1821
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,160
 I'm the only one here who doesn't have any involved with this mad,

1822
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,160
 batshit, teeth raffle story.

1823
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,160
 You will.

1824
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,160
 I won't.

1825
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,160
 You're the next chapter.

1826
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:46,160
 Anyway, let's wrap up.

1827
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,160
 That is it.

1828
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,160
 That is all of our facts.

1829
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,160
 Thank you so much for listening.

1830
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:53,160

01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,160

1834
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,160
 Hi, James Harkin.

1835
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,160
 And Anna.

1836
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,160
 No, you don't say anything.

1837
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,160
 You're gone.

1838
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,160
 Yeah, I mean, you can email ScottStackUI.com,

1839
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,160
 but good luck me ever seeing it.

1840
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,160
 Yeah.

1841
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,160
 And you'll see it and do a good impersonation

1842
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,160
 when you reply, right?

1843
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,160
 Yeah, that's right.

1844
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,160
 You'll be wearing the team every time you reply to an email.

1845
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,160
 I'll time the emails all to go out between 3 and 5 a.m.

1846
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,160
 and everyone will end Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

1847
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,160
 Yeah, we're going to our group account at no such thing.

1848
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,160
 And we'll be back again next week with a really exciting guest

1849
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,160
 as part of our big rotation of awesome guests,

01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,160

 And we'll be back with that episode next week.
