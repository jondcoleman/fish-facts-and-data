00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.240
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.880
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.880
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covran Garden.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.920
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.140
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.640
 Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.920
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.480
 for this time for a very special, somewhat sad episode.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.320
 - Poignant.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.240
 - Poignant episode.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.180
 A very sad announcement that we have to make is that--

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.720
 - A happy announcement, no?

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.380
 I think it's a happy announcement.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.220
 - Is it?

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.040
 - It's very confusing.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.480
 - Well, Anna Tyshinski is leaving the show.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.160
 So it's a--

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.100
 - I'm delighted.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.580
 - Yeah.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.640
 - I'm delighted.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.280
 - Yeah, for nine months, temporarily.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.080
 - Temporarily, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.400
 She's going away for a while to think about

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.480
 what she's done and then, then she can come back.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.080
 - And what specifically she's done--

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.920
 - Yes, is--

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.840
 - Is created a baby.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.680
 - She has.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.800
 She's been collaborating on another project

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.520
 with another person.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.560
 - It's very low effort, so much less work than the podcast.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.360
 And I hope that it continues that way.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.200
 - That it does.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.560
 Anyway, we thought we would commemorate this tragedy.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.160
 I think it's a tragedy that she's going.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.000
 - Joyfully.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.840
 - That she's going.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.680
 - Joyful news.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.520
 - That's obviously happy stuff, yeah.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.040
 But not for us, not for the listener.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.880
 - Not for Dan.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.720
 - Not for me.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.920
 - I honestly feel like I am secretly dying

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.340
 and no one's told me.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.880
 (laughing)

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.040
 The person who's been leaving drinks tonight,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 people who say, "You went down as a leaving thing."

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.400
 - As someone who's been in this situation,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.320
 or a similar situation 12 months ago,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.320
 metaphorically, it's the end.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.880
 - I'm gonna be dead inside from now on, aren't I?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.720
 - I'm afraid so.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.840
 - You've gone for two weeks, though, on paternity.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.400
 Should we have done a missing?

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.240
 James is off.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.880
 (laughing)

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.800
 Do the best of.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.800
 - And look, we should say that's what we're here to do.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.360
 We're here to commemorate our wonderful buddy.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.200
 - Okay.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.040
 (laughing)

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.360
 - A very daffy word.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.400
 - So, can we say, "Celebrate," you know?

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.840
 - It's not sad occasion. - It's not eulogy.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.000
 - Well, yeah.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.640
 So we thought what we'd do is we would present

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.880
 our three favorite facts this time, not four.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.080
 It's sort of get used to the idea that she's not here.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.760
 And share with you some of the greatest moments

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.080
 that she's had over the last nine years of fish.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.200
 Nine years we've been doing this.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.040
 - Nine years.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.440
 - It's coming up to it in March of this year.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.080
 So yeah, we're on the brink.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.200
 - So.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.040
 - Oh, God, I'm going out.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.880
 - You're coming back.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.880
 You're coming back in nine months

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.440
 and there's a very exciting roster of guests

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.600
 actually presenting lined up to replace you.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.440
 So, you know.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.280
 - Wow.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280
 Let's not use the word "replace."

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.920
 (laughing)

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.760
 - Would you jump into a grave that quickly?

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.960
 (laughing)

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.160
 Sarah Pascoe?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.800
 (laughing)

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.560
 - They could jump into someone's grave.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.040
 Isn't that what you do?

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.880
 (laughing)

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.720
 - Wait.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.560
 - I don't think if you're replacing them,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.640
 you climb into that coffin with them.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.480
 - You're right.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.320
 - What's the phrase?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.720
 - Jump into their bed?

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.040
 - Jump into their bed?

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.880
 - No.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.720
 - Jump into their bed?

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.560
 - Pick up their shoes.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.400
 - Pick up their shoes?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.520
 - Fill the dead man's shoes.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.360
 - I wouldn't piss on their shoes if they were dead.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.560
 That's the phrase.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.400
 - Is it?

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.240
 - No, it's like.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.440
 - I think it's maternity cover.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.440
 I think that's the word we're looking for.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.320
 - They haven't even cleaned up the funeral meat yet.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.880
 - She's not even cold.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.840
 - She's not even cold.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.680
 - I'm sorry.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.520
 They haven't cleaned up her funeral meat?

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.360
 (laughing)

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.200
 - I think that's actually.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.640
 I think that's from Hamlet.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.680
 Oh, no, they...

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.520
 - Yeah, no, it is.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.520
 There's a thing about funeral meats.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.720
 In the wedding, they reuse the stuff

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.120
 for Hamlet's dad's funeral for the wedding

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.080
 to Hamlet's dad's brother.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.280
 - Have you heard of cheesy funeral potatoes?

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.000
 (laughing)

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.840
 - Sounds yummy, though.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.040
 - It's a thing they do in Utah, I think.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.960
 And it's basically potatoes,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.600
 cream, cheese, and corn flakes all together.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.480
 And it's what you have in funerals.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.120
 And the idea is that it's the kind of thing

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.560
 that a typical Utah family,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.680
 typical Mormon family would have in the lada.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.160
 And everyone would have these four

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.400
 or five different things.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.280
 I think chicken soup is one of them as well,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.480
 but you put them all together

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.960
 and it's like the meal that you have at a funeral, so.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.800
 - Really?

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.320
 Hold on, you don't mix the chicken soup with the...

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.160
 - Yeah, I don't get it.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.760
 - You just put it in the chicken soup.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.040
 - And then you put corn flakes on top.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.120
 - We're here basically to have your

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.880
 cheesy funeral potato meats, and that's lovely.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.960
 - I think chicken soup's quite an incentive thing to have

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.440
 'cause that traditionally makes you better,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.320
 but of course at a funeral,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.280
 it's too late for that, isn't it?

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.600
 - Absolutely right.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.800
 Sorry, this, we've broken the format.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.960
 - We're gonna do our three favorite facts

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.520
 about Anna Tyshinski, each one of us presenting it.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.920
 And why don't we start with you, James?

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.600
 - Okay, well, my fact this week is that

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.280
 in order to get into the United States,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.240
 Anna Tyshinski had to tell a fact about a dead president.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.080
 (laughing)

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.560
 - Am I, I'm never allowed there again.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.040
 - They let you in, surprisingly, despite it.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.880
 - They did.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.040
 - It was, or border control, or whatever it is.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.000
 - Yeah, I actually can't remember the context

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.560
 where they made me say it.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.400
 - Well.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.240
 - We'd landed, hadn't we?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.920
 - We'd landed, so we had to get a visa

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.600
 as something like people of exceptional talent

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.440
 or something like that.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.960
 - Yeah, it was like we were Julia Roberts or something.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.000
 She wouldn't need one, of course,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.040
 'cause she is American, but.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.920
 - So we went to the American embassy

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.360
 and we had to prove to them that we had exceptional talent,

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.560
 or they were exceptionally famous or something.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.840
 And the woman at the window just said,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.400
 "Notice things of fish, I never heard of you."

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.240
 - That's right.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.960
 - Yeah, and immediately we were on the back foot.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.400
 But anyway, eventually we managed to convince them

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.440
 that we should go to America and get a visa to work there

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.560
 so that we could do our show.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.080
 But when we got to the passport control,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.640
 the visa said that we were a comedy podcast.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.720
 And the guy said to you, Anna, as you walked up,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.000
 he said, "Well, what do you do?"

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.360
 And you said, "Well, it's a kind of about facts."

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.160
 And he said, "Well, tell me a fact then."

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.680
 And the only thing you could think about

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.360
 was something about the murderer of a president.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.200
 - Yeah.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.120
 The only thing I can usually think about

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.400
 is President Garfield's anus,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.400
 but all the more so when you're landing in the home

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.880
 of President Garfield.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.720
 So yeah, I told him that when President Garfield

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.560
 was assassinated, it was a slow process

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.760
 and he spent the last month of his life

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.880
 eating through his anus,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.840
 which I'm sure you're all familiar with

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.440
 if you remember episode one.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.480
 - Yeah. - Second ever fact on the show.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.480
 - How did he react?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.120
 - The border control. - President Garfield, yeah.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.680
 (laughing)

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.720
 - There were a lot of funeral potatoes that week.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.600
 (laughing)

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.840
 - I think he did what most border control people do,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.480
 which is be very unimpressed and slightly threatening.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.280
 I think it was like, "Okay, go on ahead then, ma'am."

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.640
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.160
 - Which is the reaction I've always wanted

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.360
 to all of our podcast facts, so.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.160
 - Do you know, weirdly, this fact about President Garfield

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.880
 was I remember the exact moment that you told me that fact.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.600
 I can remember the exact spot of the office.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.680
 Yeah, because we were getting ready to do

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.440
 what was still a run-through of the show

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.280
 and we used that segment in the very first episode,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.360
 but I remember you had sent around your facts

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.520
 and your fact was about President Garfield

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.560
 and it was to do with the fact

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.520
 that he spent three months on his death bed

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.600
 and they tried to cure him.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.080
 I can't remember your wording, but it wasn't great.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.240
 It was sort of like, we need that.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.560
 - Just a quick note, Anna.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.640
 (laughing)

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.760
 - That's what this is gonna be.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.920
 This is an intervention.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.680
 What to think about over the next nine months.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.280
 - Don't be holding that in for nine years.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.360
 - Yeah.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.200
 - I've got a big list. - You can do this

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.600
 for everyone from episode one.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.040
 - We're starting, let's start.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.200
 Episode one will be here. - Okay, it's surprising.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.040
 Tell me what I should have said.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.280
 - I can't remember what you said to me at the time,

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.920
 but I said to you, "I love the story.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.360
 Is there any other way of expressing it?"

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.720
 And you literally in a beat said, "Oh, what about this?

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.680
 For the last three months of his life,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.000
 he ate everything through his anus."

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.680
 And I remember genuinely, it was a bit of a thunderbolt,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.320
 kind of like, "Oh my God, we're gonna have a hit

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.920
 on our hands." It was just so beautifully crafted.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.760
 Yeah, I really felt it.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.440
 I'm just telling the origin story here.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.520
 - What a strange, inspirational moment.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.200
 I don't think a lot of great inventors could emphasize

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.840
 with that moment being the one.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.680
 - It was thunderbolt.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.960
 - And that's why we were so nearly called

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.200
 the President Garfield Anus Cust.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.560
 - Well, it's such a shame that we changed the name.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.520
 - To be honest, when we were thinking of our first book,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.280
 James and I, when we were brainstorming ideas

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.840
 for the title, "The President's Anus."

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.320
 - I remember "The President's Anus" coming up

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.680
 quite a bit, being tossed about.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.320
 - It feels like it's going to be tossed.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.160
 - As it was.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.840
 - It feels like the beginning of a title,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.680
 "The President's Anus."

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.520
 It feels like it should be,

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.720
 "The President's Anus is missing."

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.560
 Or some--

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.560
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.160
 Yeah, but one of my favorite things of that tour,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.600
 so we did a big, it was our first ever American tour.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.320
 First and only American tour.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.160
 - Yeah.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.080
 - Pulled yourself back from saying a big American tour

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.080
 'cause it was five days.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.200
 - Well, for us, it was super exciting.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.640
 We were up on Times Square.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.920
 We got to play New York.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.840
 We played Washington.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.160
 We stayed in the--

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.000
 - Watergate.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.040
 - The Watergate Hotel.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.880
 - Yeah.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.520
 - Where they had, like, remember they had the,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.800
 the pencils, like, please steal this pencil.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.640
 - Oh, the room keys.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.480
 - And the room keys.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.320
 - Said I was stolen from the Watergate Hotel.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.600
 - That's right, yeah.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.280
 All the light bulbs, like, pillows I brought home.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.160
 That's the same thing, weirdly.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.880
 - And those documents from the White House, though.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.040
 Yeah, but my favorite thing of all

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.560
 was when we were staying in New York.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.800
 And I just remember seeing Anna one morning

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.880
 and her looking unbelievably abused

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.360
 because she was holding a bill in her hand

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.000
 for a basic bit of laundry

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.960
 that she had sent to the hotel.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.800
 - Oh, my God.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.680
 - Which came to $240.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.520
 - It was more than that.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.360
 It was more than that.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.160
 I think it was, like, $400.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.000
 - Oh, my God.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.160
 - And I thought it was complimentary.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.000
 I just, I don't know.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.600
 - They just put a bag outside your door, didn't they?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.880
 With laundry written on it.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.720
 Just shove it in.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.880
 - Yeah, you just put stuff in.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.840
 I don't know.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.560
 We always send premier ins when we're in the UK.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.800
 We're not used to this.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.280
 So yeah, it tossed all my clothes from the whole tour in.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.200
 (laughing)

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.040
 - You had enough clothes.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.600
 You didn't really need it all done.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.480
 - Absolutely not when we were going home the next day.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.080
 - Sometimes it's lovely to get home

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.920
 with a fresh case of clothes.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.440
 It feels incredible.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.600
 - Anyway, so we made a loss on that tour, didn't we?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.440
 - Yeah, we did.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.320
 - I know, I should say, just to make you think kindly

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.560
 of these people, you're stuck with the next nine months

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.560
 that they agreed that that could be split that loss

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.960
 over the whole tour group rather than just me taking it.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.800
 - Did we?

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.640
 - Yeah, yeah, and I think--

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.480
 - Yeah, sorry about that.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.320
 - I think the tour pretty much dead on broke even.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.160
 - Yeah, right.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.880
 - But we would have been in the black if it had--

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.600
 - I owe you all a hundred pounds.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.480
 I think, no, I think I didn't pipe up

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.320
 because when I went back to England,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.240
 I bought so many books that my overweight money allowance

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.520
 was something like $1,000 or something.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.360
 It was ridiculous.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.040
 - We didn't take the hit for that though, did we?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.880
 - I think you might have done.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.160
 - I think we might have done, yeah.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.760
 - Well, if I'm gonna take the laundry hit, I was, I thought.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.600
 - Andy, we should have gone for the huckers

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.960
 and the cocaine that we sent.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.360
 (laughing)

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.160
 - I only ate one meal a day in America

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.360
 'cause I was so concerned about making a loss.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.840
 (laughing)

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.400
 - We made him walk all the way from Boston to New York.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.360
 - I took one pair of pants and I wore it inside, outside,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.760
 back to front, upside down.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.440
 Now I know I was on tour with, you know, Elton John.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.480
 - Yeah, so sorry about that.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.320
 - Wow.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.480
 - But yeah, didn't get evicted from the country.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.960
 No, what's the cool when you get evicted?

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.800
 Deported.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.640
 - Deported.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.560
 - Didn't get deported for talking about

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.120
 presidential assassination, so actually helped us get in.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.120
 So if you are trying to get into America,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.960
 give it a go.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.240
 - Okay, well, the point of this show, I think,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.240
 is that we're gonna play some of Anna's best bits.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.080
 And so--

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.920
 - It's a very short show.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.440
 - It should be a very short show.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.480
 So let's do a little bit now,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.560
 beginning with President Garfield's anus.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.140
 (upbeat music)

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:26.440
 - Okay, fact number two, Anna, this one's yours.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.160
 - Yeah, so for the last month of his life,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.360
 US President James Garfield ate everything

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.600
 through his anus.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.840
 (all laughing)

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.720
 - We will get letters from a lot of people here.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.080
 - That is mine.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.520
 Yeah, I mean, I wasn't there,

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.560
 but this is what the doctors tell me.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.000
 (all laughing)

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.920
 No, so James Garfield was, as everyone obviously knows,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.260
 shot in July, 1881, and he lived for a further 80 days.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.040
 He was shot in the small, in the, like, small of his back

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.920
 and once in the arm.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.240
 So doctors now say he would have been at our hospital

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.380
 about two or three days later.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:05.320
 But obviously, 'cause medicine was not quite as advanced

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.160
 as it is now.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.840
 In 1881, they just invited, like,

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.560
 dozens of doctors to his bedside

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.800
 who all prodded around trying to find this bullet.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.480
 They didn't know where the bullet had gone in his body.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.320
 So they gathered around, prodded about,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.360
 made him worse and worse.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.760
 He stopped being able to eat.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.080
 And obviously, if you stop being able to consume food

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.600
 in those days, they just shoved it up your arse.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.600
 And so that's what they did.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.200
 - So does that work?

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.680
 - It does not work, no.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.760
 It was widely discredited in the early 30s.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.220
 And I think you get about an eighth of the nutrition

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.860
 from some of the food.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.660
 But there's some food that you can't absorb at all.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.700
 - What I love is the list of foods

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.860
 that he was fed in his mother.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.700
 - Oh, that's good, yeah.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.060
 - Beef, bouillon, egg yolks, milk.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.880
 - Egg yolks.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.720
 - Egg yolks.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.220
 - Wait a second, guys.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.060
 Egg yolks, it was only true for a while.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.820
 'Cause I was reading the doctor at the time

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.820
 his report on it.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.940
 So yeah, he was fed egg yolks for a bit of time.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.780
 And then all the surgeons complained

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.860
 that it was causing annoying and offensive plateaus.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.280
 And so they ceased feeding him egg yolks.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.120
 And it deprecated.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.740
 - So they stopped it because it was annoying them.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.080
 Not the other way around.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.820
 (laughing)

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.840
 Guys, I'd be quite happy to eat an egg with my mouth.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.240
 (laughing)

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.200
 That's all right by you guys.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.440
 - Apparently it's illegal to move sheep in whales

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.040
 until they've been checked to see

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.440
 whether they carry traces of the fallout from Chernobyl.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.280
 - Really?

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.120
 - Yeah.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.960
 - On this particular subject,

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.920
 I have a question for you guys.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.760
 - Oh yeah?

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.080
 - Why shouldn't you buy trousers from the Northern Ukraine?

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:31.920
 - I don't know.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.200
 Why shouldn't you buy trousers from the Northern Ukraine?

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.220
 - Chernobyl fallout.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.960
 (laughing)

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.520
 - Ladies and gentlemen, that is the joke.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.920
 - Yeah, just so you know,

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.880
 just as a little inside bit of behind the scenes

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.240
 information here, Anna has consistently for the last,

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.040
 what, 14 podcasts said that same joke

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.480
 and we've cut it out every single episode.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.200
 - Anna has refused to have it in the podcast.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.040
 - This is a day.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.760
 - And you will not hear it in this one either.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.600
 - Yeah.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.440
 - Unless someone else said it.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.600
 - It's the best joke ever.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.280
 Ambrose Pare, who was a famous doctor in the 15th century,

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.480
 saw a beggar in Paris who was begging him for money

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.160
 and who did so by, I don't actually know if we can put this

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.000
 out, it's so gross.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.840
 - Let's just say it anyway.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.880
 - Who did so by, she begged by lifting her skirts

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.400
 to reveal a prolapsed rectum.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.800
 It was a horrid sight, he says.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.360
 It was over half a foot long leaking pasta light fluid

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.760
 over her legs and garments.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.080
 But his companion then attacked the woman and said,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.320
 you're a big faker, you don't look sick enough

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.320
 to have a prolapsed rectum.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.000
 - You have to be pretty confident that you're right

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.840
 in that situation.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.400
 - Yeah, I know prolapsed rectums and that madame.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.280
 - He beat this woman to the ground and eventually

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.040
 she was forced to reveal that it was actually

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.800
 the prolapsed rectum of an ox.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.680
 But she put inside her some boxes.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.120
 - It was actually a prolapsed rectum.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.640
 - It was, it wasn't prolapsed.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.400
 - He felt pretty silly then, didn't he?

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.680
 (all laughing)

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.800
 - That's not a human prolapsed rectum.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.400
 (all laughing)

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.240
 It was the prolapsed rectum of an ox.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.880
 - Yeah, she'd put up her own bum though.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.200
 I think, oh my God.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.040
 - I think you've gone to the trouble of doing that.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.760
 I really think you've earned your 50 cents or whatever.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.600
 - Absolutely.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:17.840
 But the lifting of her skirts as well.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.960
 She could just have a sign saying,

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.640
 prolapsed rectum, please help.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.840
 - Wait, so if you saw someone with a sign saying,

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.280
 (all laughing)

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.160
 that's probably how she starts it.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.760
 And she's like, no one is buying this at all.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.120
 - Except Andy.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.400
 I can show it to you, no need.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.600
 Absolutely believe you.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.680
 - The thing is though, I would pay,

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.680
 I would pay 50p not to see a prolapsed rectum.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.640
 - That is a fair point.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.320
 - She should have done that.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.520
 - We should move on.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.480
 - When they were building the New York subway,

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.080
 the guys who were building it were called sand hogs

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.280
 'cause they dug through lots of sand.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.280
 And I was reading a newspaper report from 1916

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.000
 and it was about this guy called Marshall Mabee

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.280
 who was working in the tunnel to dig the subway.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.840
 And there was a pocket of compressed air

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.880
 which suddenly kind of escaped.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.760
 So he's got this big shield up in the tunnel in front of him

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.520
 and they're using this shield to push forward

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.600
 and make the tunnel bigger.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.720
 And he said he saw an 18-inch pocket of air suddenly appear

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.520
 and it sucked him towards it.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.960
 He was sucked into it.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.720
 He was blasted up through the ground.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.560
 So he was blasted up through 12 feet of riverbed

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.160
 and then blasted up through the river itself

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.840
 and then hurled up 25 feet in the air above the river.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.840
 - He wasn't grinding through earth, 12 feet of earth.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.240
 - Yeah, that's what riverbed's made of.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.080
 It's less, it's more plausible for him to be blasted

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.240
 through 12 feet of earth and 12 feet of concrete or steel

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.080
 or whatever.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.400
 No, no, no, I was thinking was it just a tunnel?

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.080
 Like it was a hole that he was blasted through.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.720
 It just happened to be going, don't believe it.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.920
 - So here we go, let me,

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.640
 there's a whole interview with him and everything.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.640
 There's a nice interview with his wife saying,

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.680
 it's okay, he's fine.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.320
 He's looking forward to going back to work.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.160
 This is what the New York Times said at the time.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.040
 There's a pocket of compressed air

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.120
 to prevent the river's bottom from caving in.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.880
 So they have some, God, I don't know how that works.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.720
 - But somehow it happened, guys,

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.960
 and this compressed air got loose

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.320
 and he saw an 18-inch hole

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.200
 and before he knew it, he was being sucked towards it.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.120
 Two of his colleagues actually also got sucked in

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.560
 and they did perish.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.200
 And he survived by blasting up,

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.480
 putting his arm out in front of him

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.520
 and blasting up through the riverbed.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.520
 - I don't believe it.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.960
 - 12 feet of riverbed and then got shot through

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.280
 and then out in the air.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.720
 There's enough force left over,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.160
 shot through the river itself and then you had 25 feet.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.000
 - 25 feet?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.920
 - The New York Times is a very retro.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.560
 - What year is it?

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.360
 - Yeah, and what date was this?

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.360
 - February 1916, all right, not April.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.120
 Yeah, it was a little bit insane,

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.920
 but there you go, there's a picture of the guy.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.320
 Pictures don't lie.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.360
 - What, mid-flight?

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.560
 - No, not mid-flight.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.200
 (laughs)

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.040
 - That's extraordinary.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.520
 - Did you say that was in New York?

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.600
 - Yeah, it was soft ground,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.600
 so that's why they were called the sound.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.280
 - Oh, well, if it was soft ground, I see, yeah.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.600
 It was still a riverbed, though, wasn't it?

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.080
 - 25 feet after 12 beds of--

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:28.920
 - And a river.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.240
 - And a river.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.080
 - I don't know how it possibly happened.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.400
 So there was a woman in South Korea recently

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.360
 who was eating squid, so we all eat squid.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.080
 We call it calamari for reasons I don't understand,

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.880
 but she was eating some boiled squid in a restaurant,

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.880
 and she suddenly felt a pain in her tongue,

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.720
 and it turned out the squid wasn't quite dead,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.640
 and it was a male squid,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.320
 and it had deposited its sperm packet into her tongue,

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.920
 so she felt horrible pain in her tongue,

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.400
 and then felt lots of stuff crawling around

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.880
 inside her tongue, and had to go to hospital,

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.240
 and they took out a whole bunch of sperm.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.480
 And apparently this does happen a bit,

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.640
 like there's been reports in Japan of it happening.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.520
 - Oh, that's so fucked up.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.200
 I will never fucking do that shit again.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.000
 - Oh my god.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 - Yeah.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.960
 - Fuck it now.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.460
 (all laughing)

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.460
 - Fuck that.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.080
 (all laughing)

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.000
 - Ventritarianism, here you come.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.080
 - I don't think we've mentioned this before.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.040
 This year KFC have released a novel for the first time.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:25.880
 - What?

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.600
 - It's a novel starring the Colonel,

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.200
 and it's a Milsen Boone-style romance,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.120
 and it's called "Tender Wings of Desire."

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.160
 - He is a sexy man.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.880
 - Well, we ascertained before we started

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.680
 recording this podcast that you quite fancy

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.520
 Richard Nixon.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.340
 - Oh yeah.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.000
 - How did we miss that when we got to that?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.520
 - We didn't ascertain that.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.080
 That's warping of the truth.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.000
 - Oh, I'm sorry.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.480
 - I find him not unattractive, given that there was an incident.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.040
 - But for Andy, that's pretty much someone saying

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.040
 you're attractive.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.760
 That's the best I can hope for these days.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.240
 - I'm not physically repulsed by him.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.080
 Great, Dave.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.640
 He said in an interview that something like,

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.720
 "I know how I look.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.600
 I'm under no illusions about my appearance,

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.080
 so I'll have to be good in other ways."

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:07.920
 And I read that interview,

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.440
 and I thought, "Well, he is good in other ways,

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.760
 isn't he?

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.040
 Lots of ways that Richard Nixon is a very good man."

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.400
 - What would you say your--

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.280
 - Yeah, what are your top five ways

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.440
 where she's a great guy, Hannah?

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.800
 - When British author William Haslitt died,

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.400
 his landlady was so keen to re-let his room

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.520
 that she hid his body under the bed

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.600
 while she showed new tenants around.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.680
 - And he's still there under that bed, isn't he?

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.120
 - He's still there, yeah.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.400
 But he was a big deal,

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.720
 and people used to go just to the Haslitt Hotel

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.840
 just because that's where he lived.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.240
 Seamus Heaney used to go there, obsessed with him,

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.880
 and they would have meet-ups there

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.000
 just to be able to be in the sort of presence

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.880
 of the location of this great person

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.320
 who everyone seems to have forgotten,

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.000
 except it turns out, you, Hannah, just--

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.240
 - I mean, people know what him Haslitt is,

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.800
 but I did happen to take a book of his essays

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.280
 on my gap here, which I know is,

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.080
 I just told these guys back stage, I know.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.800
 One of those guys was gonna mention it,

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.840
 so I thought I'd get in there.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.760
 - Which drug were you taking when you were reading it?

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.160
 - The essays themselves were my drug, James.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.800
 - What am I on?

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.000
 I'm on chapter three.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.640
 - I mean, they didn't come in chapters, but whatever.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.800
 - You know, in shopping centers

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.960
 where the fish eat your dead skin?

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.800
 - I've had that once,

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.360
 and all I could think while I was having it

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.800
 was reincarnation and just looking

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.960
 at the guy, "What the fuck did you do in your last life

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.280
 "that you have come back to eat my feet?"

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.120
 - This is--

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.040
 - I had it once, and I think I've told you guys this,

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.800
 but I had it once in Cambodia,

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.800
 and they had to ask me to take my feet out of the pond,

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.280
 'cause you put your feet in with like five other people,

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.480
 and my feet is so disgusting

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.320
 that they were all coming to my feet,

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.800
 and no one else was getting their money's worth.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.520
 (audience laughing)

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.680
 That's a real, real, actually low point.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.840
 (audience laughing)

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.360
 - Proud-wise, me.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.940
 (upbeat music)

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:17.080
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two about Anna Tyshinski,

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.200
 and that is Andy.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.880
 - Well, my fact is a crowdsourced fact.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.720
 - Yeah.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.680
 - So, as you know, there's a Discord.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.760
 If you don't know Discord,

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.840
 it's a website where you chat about stuff.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.480
 Is that what it is?

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.120
 - Why did you bother explaining if you have no idea?

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.480
 It's a forum, it's a forum to chat.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.320
 There is a fish Discord, the fish cord,

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:44.320
 and as part of Anna's commemoration episode.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.160
 - Morning, morning episode, I think, yeah.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.320
 - Morning sickness, hi-o.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.960
 (laughing)

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:55.960
 Dan, I think you asked for some of Anna's best bits.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.880
 - Yeah.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.640
 - And asked what listeners, you know,

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.680
 fish fans wanted to hear again.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.520
 I mean, various bits.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.160
 - You can make a compilation of Anna saying her own surname.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.000
 - Correctly.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.520
 - When do you say your own surname?

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.960
 - Yeah, I don't know if you can make a compilation out of that.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.000
 - You can certainly make a compilation of the evolution

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.960
 of my pronunciation of your surname.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.240
 - Yeah, a lot of people got quite sad

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.080
 when you evolved from pronouncing it,

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.960
 well, as some people said wrongly, Tyshinski to Tyshinski.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.440
 - Well, yeah, and I always say that it was a bit of a,

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.880
 it was a bit unfair on me because you were right here

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.160
 to tell me I was saying it wrong for about six years,

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.560
 and no one did.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.000
 No one did, your dad didn't, your mom didn't,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.160
 anytime any of your family came to our show,

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.400
 no one would say, by the way,

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.840
 do you think you might be able to pronounce

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:39.840
 the surname correctly?

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.800
 No one said anything.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.920
 And yours was a surname that I specifically,

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.800
 if I would say, like, next fact is James,

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.800
 next fact is Andy, I would say next fact, Tyshinski.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.040
 I would always say your surname.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.720
 So it was always coming up.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.320
 - But I think, do you remember them?

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.640
 Oh, Larry really liked it.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.280
 'Cause then he had the Schreiber and Tyshinski cops,

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.320
 maybe who were trying to find the president's anus.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.640
 - To your cops, yeah, we got to get to the bottom

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.600
 of this big laundry bill, Tyshinski.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.320
 - Oh, nice, yeah.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.640
 What's your pronunciation?

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.640
 - I say Tyshinski, but you can also say Tyshinski,

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.880
 or a lot of people do say Tyshinski,

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.600
 and it's weird that people assume that's the way

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.440
 you could say it.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.840
 It's quite different starting with a chub.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.680
 - It's P-T, yeah.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.040
 You don't call it a charodactyl, do you?

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.680
 - You don't, I don't know, or a charmigan.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.520
 But I should say for actual Polish listeners

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.160
 that it's Tyshinski, so you're supposed to say the P.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.680
 So I don't pronounce it right, either.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.520
 - Okay, there we go.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.040
 - And I sort of should also be Ptazinska, 'cause I'm a girl.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:34.880
 - Oh, no way.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.720
 - Wow.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.560
 - I am.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.880
 (laughing)

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.440
 - I don't remember this suggestion for a clip to play.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.240
 Episode 342, no such thing as a presidential fight club.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.640
 Anna refers to a child as a wimp because he had asthma.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.200
 - And that child, ladies and gentlemen,

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.480
 grew up to be a podcaster, Andrew Hudson.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.440
 (laughing)

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.840
 - There's probably some context that I haven't seen

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.440
 in the reports of that myself,

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.320
 and I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation,

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.520
 but I'm gonna refer it to a committee

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.360
 that we will investigate.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.240
 - You'll end up being suspended for nine months.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.080
 It's perfect, it's a perfect crime.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.680
 So funny what people remember, like one person wrote,

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.200
 "I can't remember which episode."

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.680
 So this is them, like they've literally

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.840
 bankless in their head, you can't remember which episode,

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.240
 but Anna calling Matanus to Tunis, mootie tootie.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.840
 (laughing)

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.640
 - Lives rent free in my brain.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.600
 Mootie tootie tootie tootie tootie tootie.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.160
 - I don't remember this bit at all,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.400
 and neither does the person who said it.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.800
 I don't remember the episode,

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.200
 but it was about some female animal drinking semen,

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.080
 and Anna was like, yeah, relatable.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.360
 Sometimes the tap is just too far away.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.600
 (laughing)

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.600
 Don't recall that.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.600
 - Just a few times at uni, and a terrible hangover is,

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.840
 there's a cut by the bed, what are you gonna do?

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.020
 - Fill me up love before you go, but then do go.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.280
 (laughing)

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.720
 - Yeah, I mean, you've had a lot of feedback

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.480
 about your kind of quite dirty-ish potty mouth,

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.320
 I would say.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.080
 - I feel like I'm the least potty.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.920
 - I think people just notice it more when you do it.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.040
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.000
 - I think that's it, it's everyday sexism.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.760
 - Well, actually, there's a bit of a debate,

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.080
 even on the Discord about you, Anna.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.920
 So, one person says,

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.560
 if you go back and listen to the first year's episodes,

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.840
 Anna's so restrained and polite in comparison,

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.920
 and then she gets comfortable

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.360
 and the sarcasm starts to flow, okay?

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.760
 Now, someone has replied to that saying,

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.480
 "I'm on episode 39, she has never been polite."

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.760
 (laughing)

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.320
 - I think there is one episode,

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.320
 I remember editing it, where you're polite

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.040
 for about two thirds of the episode,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.640
 and then for the final third of the episode,

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.400
 you just go completely off the rails.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.240
 - Really?

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.320
 - And it was the episode when you drank

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.560
 a pint of champagne before the show.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.800
 - Oh no, God, that wasn't the only one,

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.640
 one of our first live shows.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.320
 - I think it might have been our actual first live show,

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.240
 or maybe our second.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.600
 - It was like, it was a Christmas one,

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.760
 and it was an Aces and Aces.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.600
 - Aces and Aces.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.440
 - In North London.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.280
 - That's right.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.440
 - And you can really, you can pinpoint

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.960
 the exact second that the champagne hits.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.360
 - What's confusing is that I'm sure Dan and I

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.400
 drunk pints of champagne for that,

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.440
 and I also am sure that Dan

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.760
 is more of a lightweight than I am.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.280
 - Yeah, but the difference is

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.080
 that Dan is never coherent.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:17.920
 (laughing)

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.760
 - You can't tell.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:19.600
 - Yes.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.440
 - That's a beauty.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.000
 - Exactly, I'm bulletproof.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.600
 - I'm drunk now, no one's noticed.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.960
 (laughing)

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.040
 - Episode 261.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:26.880
 - Oh yeah.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.760
 - Dan's talking about Scott of the Antarctic

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.680
 taking two gramophones with him.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.760
 Anna, he was a fucking idiot, wasn't he?

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.000
 (laughing)

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.160
 - You gotta stand by that, it's not surprising he died.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.120
 You know, he didn't take two gramophones.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:43.960
 Amundsen.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.800
 - Amundsen.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.620
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.440
 Actually, I hate saying that name so much,

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.280
 I could never say it.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.120
 - You said it quite weird.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:49.960
 - I know.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.800
 - Amundsen.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.640
 - Amundsen.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.480
 - Amundsen.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.800
 (laughing)

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.520
 - I don't know why I see it coming up in my head.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.440
 Is this how you feel down with all words?

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.240
 - Yeah, yeah, I do.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.200
 I see them coming up on the page

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.440
 and you gotta make a decision.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.680
 You're either gonna try and pronounce it correctly,

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.840
 get it wrong, or, and check it out

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.880
 and get it wrong just for that,

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.280
 or you just gotta run through it.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.640
 You just gotta, you gotta.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.280
 - It reminds me, and I know this is a podcast about Anna,

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.040
 but it does remind me of the first audiobook that we did,

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.240
 (laughing)

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.280
 which was just after you'd had your first baby

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.440
 and were very short on sleep.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.960
 And Dan kept pronouncing the word January, February.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.280
 (laughing)

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.280
 - Like six times.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.520
 - We were like, Dan, Dan, you said February.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.840
 Can you just do it again?

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.680
 - Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.280
 - Okay, here we go.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.120
 - February.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.320
 (laughing)

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.720
 - It was remarkable.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.560
 It was really something.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.480
 - And we had to change the whole article at the end,

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.280
 didn't we, to something that happened in February?

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.280
 - I used to love those books

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.080
 'cause they were the books of the year

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.760
 and it was like things that happened

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.360
 between January and December that year.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.920
 Obviously, the book came out in November,

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.360
 so it's usually January to September or October.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.680
 But Andy used to always come in

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.160
 with things that had happened the previous year.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.520
 And Anna would be like, no, this was last year.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.360
 And he's like, yeah, but it was late 20, come on, it was December.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.920
 - My reasoning here

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.880
 is that you're doing one of these books a year.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.640
 Each book has to have a 12 month catchment area.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.360
 It's the book of, not the calendar year,

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.200
 not the calendar year,

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.280
 but the, like the school year or the school year.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.560
 - Yeah, the financial year.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.560
 - That's right, the school year.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.120
 - You started in September.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:24.960
 - Everyone understands,

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.920
 otherwise you're knocking out a third of your own material.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.600
 - Why didn't we name it the book of the school year,

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.440
 actually?

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.760
 (laughing)

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.600
 - So honest.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.440
 - The book of the financial year

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.960
 would have really set those sales rocketing.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.800
 - Yeah.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.000
 (laughing)

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.240
 - Have we got one last one, Andy or?

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.960
 - Anna is among the 10% of people

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.080
 who can lick their own nose.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:44.920
 - What?

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.760
 - Oh.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.600
 - We did a, okay.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.440
 - Oh my God, yeah.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.680
 - She's doing it, she's doing it.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.000
 - We did a fact about Buddha

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.680
 and how Buddha could stick his tongue through his ear.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.000
 - Into his ear, that was it.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.840
 - Yeah.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.720
 - And then you showed us that.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.560
 - Yeah.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.320
 - And had lots of other stuff that I don't have, though.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.240
 - Weird body part anomalies.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.200
 I also actually have a lot,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.760
 but they're less sort of magical than Buddha's.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.360
 And more like get medical help.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.560
 (laughing)

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.280
 - That's good though, touching your nose.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.120
 I can't do that.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.720
 - Your tongue barely gets out of your mouth.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.240
 - I think I'm tongue tied.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.080
 - Oh, really?

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.120
 - And that's why you're so bad at breastfeeding, isn't it?

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:17.960
 - Yes.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.280
 (laughing)

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.320
 - But I'm still trying.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.040
 - Yeah, good on you.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.440
 - That's it, we'll get you there.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.880
 - Oh, that's a bristly experience, Dan.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.720
 You're very bearded.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.560
 (laughing)

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.400
 - That's so rough.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.720
 - Yeah, it's not good for the--

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.880
 - It's because of breast and rash happening there.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.560
 - Highly sanded boobs up here there.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.800
 (laughing)

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.480
 - The nipples almost gone all together.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.320
 (laughing)

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.760
 It's just a flat, floppy out potato.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.600
 (laughing)

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.000
 - It's just a flat potato.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.920
 - Can we have some more of Anna, please?

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.760
 (laughing)

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.720
 Classic Czazinski.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.400
 - Okay, well, I'll have a look on the archives.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.880
 Let's see if we can find some of the things

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.760
 that you've mentioned in the next little Anna compilation.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.340
 (upbeat music)

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:07.560
 - My fact is that the way to recognize the Buddha

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.400
 is to look out for his webbed feet,

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.400
 a tongue that can reach his ears,

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.920
 and withdrawn genitalia.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.040
 - That's a good excuse on a date.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.000
 - No, no, no, it's not small.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 I'm just, I'm the Buddha, I'm the reincarnated Buddha.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.160
 - Oh yeah, then show me your tongue,

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.760
 'cause I could get on board with this.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.000
 (laughing)

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 - I read that female beetles,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.800
 they quench their thirst through sex,

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.760
 and it's because of the semen and the fluids in the semen,

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.160
 'cause they get very dehydrated,

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.240
 and so when they have sex,

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.920
 it's actually just like having a drink for them.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.880
 - That's the reason we all do it, Dan.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.240
 (laughing)

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.320
 - Sometimes the tap is too far away.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.580
 (laughing)

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:58.840
 - A few people who were farmers

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.840
 who were involved in castrating lambs

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.880
 when they were born got very ill very quickly,

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.800
 and there was 12 people who got ill,

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.960
 but they worked out that two of them got ill

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.480
 because they were castrating with an old method

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.080
 that still goes on these days,

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.400
 not completely, but in the 1800s all the time.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.240
 They castrate using their teeth,

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.560
 so these are, yeah, these are humans who go,

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.360
 and two of these guys were castrating these lambs

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.720
 with their teeth, and they got very ill.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.240
 - One of my best friends has done that in Australia.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.480
 - Really? - West Australia, yep.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.640
 - Did they get ill?

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.280
 - Well, he's pretty insane, but he's not sick.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.080
 - What, I think he is sick, yeah.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.480
 (laughing)

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.920
 - And they go by on a conveyor belt, right,

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.800
 and you lie underneath them,

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.040
 and you just whip him off on by one.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:43.880
 - What?

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.720
 - Yeah.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.760
 - Well, you come up like Jaws,

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.760
 like you just bite off their balls?

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.760
 - Is your friend Australian?

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.960
 - He lived in Australia for a year.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.120
 - Well, he was British.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:53.960
 - Yeah.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.680
 - Feels like they kind of saw him coming, didn't they?

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.520
 - Yeah.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.080
 - Yeah, we all do this, mate.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.200
 (laughing)

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.560
 - This guy looks like he'll bite the balls off anything.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.280
 - I just don't get wrestling.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.120
 - What?

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.320
 - It doesn't make any sense to me.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.560
 We've covered it before on this podcast,

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.320
 and I find it impossible to research,

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.200
 'cause everything you read about it,

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.240
 you're like, is this real?

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.920
 Did this really happen?

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.560
 The confusion of real sport and fake acting is bewildering.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.400
 Like, there's this fight between him and Hulk Hogan,

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.200
 which was this really famous fight,

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.640
 and apparently it was super controversial.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.840
 It was in 1988, and there was a referee,

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.080
 a famous referee called Dave Hebner,

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.480
 who was refereed wrestling matches,

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.480
 and he happened to have an identical twin.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.320
 - Oh, yes.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.920
 - And they tracked down for this match.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.760
 - The referee?

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.200
 - Yeah, the referee had an identical twin.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.520
 - Okay, he didn't really, I think.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.880
 - No, he did really.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.280
 I've seen the actual pictures, either he did,

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.760
 or there's some amazing Photoshopping going on,

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.880
 but he had this identical twin,

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.040
 and so, right, Andre the Giant's agent

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.680
 got Dave, who was supposed to referee the match,

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.320
 locked him in a cupboard, and then bribed Earl,

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.240
 his identical twin, to referee the game instead,

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.040
 and he did, and then he made Andre the Giant won,

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.080
 and then Dave broke out of his closet,

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.000
 and then him and his identical twin brother

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.520
 had a big fight afterwards in front of the crowd.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.040
 - This is the weirdest conversation.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.400
 - I really wanna hear Anna doing the Coventry of WWF.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.280
 - I don't understand any of this.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.640
 Is that real?

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.480
 Oh my God.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.800
 - But there's storylines, there's storylines.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.000
 You go to the theater all the time,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.840
 are you standing up and going,

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.160
 "What the fuck is going on here?"

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.920
 - No, no, no, because in the write-ups of the theater,

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.000
 it doesn't say, and there was an incredibly

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.480
 controversial moment when Hamlet's mother

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.640
 remarried Hamlet's uncle, and the audience couldn't,

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.400
 you're like, "Okay, this is a story."

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.240
 There was in the Wikipedia page, there's this one.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.240
 Was it controversial, or was it all made up?

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.560
 - It's all made up.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.960
 - It's all made up, it's all made up.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.600
 - Then why is it controversial?

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.960
 - It's controversial in the world of wrestling.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.160
 - Which is a fake world.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.120
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.720
 - Okay. - Now you're getting it.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.560
 (all laughing)

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.000
 - No, it is weird how it's presented as true.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.440
 You know, normally it plays, there is a synopsis,

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.520
 and normally when you go out of the play,

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.560
 the thing doesn't keep happening out.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.520
 - No, but I just think it's amazing

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.920
 that we found the edge of Anna's comfort zone.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.080
 - Yeah.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.440
 - I never thought we'd get there.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.120
 - Who would know as pro wrestling is fake?

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.600
 (all laughing)

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.480
 - The town choir championships.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.160
 I just think this is so amazing

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.240
 that these kind of things have the budget for this.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.400
 - I've been there once.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.240
 - What?

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.440
 (all laughing)

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.640
 - Did not place.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.240
 (all laughing)

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.840
 (all laughing)

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.320
 - What?

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.760
 Do you know where they were held, the last ones?

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.720
 - The one I went to was in either Lancashire

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.800
 or Yorkshire, I can't remember.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.000
 - Cool, the last one was in Bermuda, so I feel like.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.240
 (all laughing)

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.440
 - Do you ever get the feeling you chose the wrong year?

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.240
 (all laughing)

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.640
 - I mean, who was paying for town choir, it's good.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.920
 Anyway, this year, it's the first time a Brit

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.920
 has won the town choir championship.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.040
 It was very exciting.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.120
 - Mark Wiley beat off 24 other contestants.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.120
 (all laughing)

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.840
 - And they were like, "Oh, yay!"

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.420
 (all laughing)

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:26.800
 - It's one of the requirements these days.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.640
 (all laughing)

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.960
 He actually said.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.360
 - For legal reasons, we have to correct that.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.200
 (all laughing)

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:39.200
 - Sorry, so this guy won over and above

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.040
 24 other contestants.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.200
 What he won was an awful lot of rum, he said.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.160
 (all laughing)

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.480
 Which I needed for medicinal purposes.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.040
 He explained which is understandable

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.640
 after the trauma he'd undergone, so.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.240
 (all laughing)

00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:03.800
 - Okay, it's time for fact number three,

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.840
 and that is my fact.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.800
 My fact this week is that we're sitting here

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.480
 in the Covent Garden office.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.520
 This is a important room to us,

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.880
 and it's the last time the four of us

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.440
 are ever gonna be in this room together doing the podcast

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.320
 'cause Anna's going off and the offices are moving.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.040
 But it's also important for another reason

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:24.880
 because in 2022, Anna and I set a Guinness World Record

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.000
 right here in this room.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.720
 We became the world record holders of the longest

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.480
 anyone has ever played.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.160
 Keep the balloon in the air, tennis game between two people.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.440
 - That was amazing. - In history.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.960
 - I remember that three weeks when you were doing that,

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.560
 it was just 'cause we were coming

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.440
 and we'd have to work around you.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.440
 - Record the podcast each week.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.000
 - Oh my God, it was so hard.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:46.840
 It was tough, wasn't it?

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.440
 - And not sleeping to that level.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.800
 I mean, the amount of Red Bull that we had to.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.400
 - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.880
 By the third week, I just was really surprised

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.720
 you were still doing it.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.280
 - Yeah, so that was the rehearsal.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.640
 When we actually did it, it was 80 minutes

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.560
 we lost it, 80 minutes for keeping a balloon in there.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.840
 - And do you still have that record?

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.960
 - We've been beaten.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.600
 - Oh no. - Yep, we've been beaten.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.600
 Someone beat us by eight seconds.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.920
 With, I would argue, an unfair advantage.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.160
 They had a giant balloon.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.640
 It was like the size of a beach ball.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.720
 - It should be a restriction on balloon size.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.960
 - Well, you should have read the small print.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.400
 - I should have read the small print, yeah.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.560
 But one thing we did manage to do

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:25.000
 is make it into a physical Guinness World Record book.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.200
 So there's a picture of me and Anna

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.760
 in the Guinness World Records 2023.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.040
 - That's not us, what?

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.120
 - What, that's, that's-

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.320
 - Oh there, sorry, I was gonna get that bloke below.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.680
 - Who was the chicken in your mind when I was-

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.640
 (all laughing)

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.720
 - That's your man holding a chicken.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.080
 - What about, is that Irving Finkel above you?

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:40.920
 - That is Irving Finkel.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.880
 - And what does it say?

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.560
 Oldest depiction of a ghost.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.640
 - Oldest depiction of a ghost.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.560
 - You're really on the best page here, right?

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.680
 - Well, what you'll notice as well

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.280
 is I'm responsible for that ghost

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.120
 getting the Guinness World Record, yeah.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:51.960
 - Tell us how.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.120
 - I took Craig Glende, who is the Guinness World Records

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.920
 editor-in-chief to the British Museum

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.240
 to meet the world's oldest ghost

00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.400
 to give it a Guinness World Record.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.920
 - I wonder if you're the only person in that book, Dan,

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.280
 who's got two world records.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.120
 - And that's possible.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:04.960
 - Is Usain Bolt in there?

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.480
 - No, you can't claim the same world record

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.320
 as Irving Finkel.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.440
 You didn't find the oldest ghost.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.120
 - No, no, I just got the oldest ghost.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.280
 - I just, you know.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.440
 - I'm sorry, Dan, can I just check this book?

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.360
 Can I just have a quick look at it?

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.400
 So this is, Guinness World Records 2023.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.240
 - Yeah.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.680
 - And it's about an event that happened in 2022.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:19.520
 - Yeah.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.360
 (all laughing)

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.760
 - And this is maybe the most successful book in history.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.760
 (all laughing)

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.280
 - Oh, okay.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.520
 Maybe it's all right sometimes.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.100
 (all laughing)

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.280
 - Yeah, but so we did that.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.760
 We did that here in this room.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.480
 - This ghost was depicted 2,500 years ago.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.240
 (all laughing)

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.200
 - Yes, yes, the world's oldest ghost

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.920
 is not going to have appeared in 2023.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.400
 (all laughing)

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.640
 But yeah, it's, and Anna, that's for you,

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.800
 'cause I know you don't have a copy.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.280
 So I want you to have,

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.800
 because obviously you don't have a copy.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.480
 You're not interested in this kind of stuff.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.840
 So yeah, so now we're forcing a copy onto you.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.760
 - I mean, we did, we cheated, didn't we?

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.000
 - We did cheat, we didn't cheat.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.840
 - Oh, hello.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.680
 - What are you talking about?

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.520
 We didn't cheat.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.160
 - Well, we're friends with Craig, who's fantastic,

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.040
 who organizes all the Guinness stuff,

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.680
 and he gave us a tip-off

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.840
 that no one's tried to break this category,

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.160
 but it is a category.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.920
 So as long as you get over an hour.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.520
 So Ashley, we went for 20 minutes more than we needed to,

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.760
 which showed a lot of commitment,

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.440
 'cause it was pub time by then.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.280
 - It's right, yeah, and Anna drank the whole way through.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.080
 There's a big glass of wine in her hand.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.440
 I think I had a beer, but it was,

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.600
 I can't quite remember now.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.840
 It was daunting.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.680
 It was very scary.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.320
 It's very scary keeping a balloon in the air, wasn't it?

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.760
 Do you remember the like, the-

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.400
 - I'm sorry, what is riding on it really?

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.240
 I mean, if you-

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:36.160
 - There was a bomb inside and it touches the ground.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.400
 - You literally could've just tried again the next day,

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.840
 or the next hour.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.080
 - Do you know how tedious it is,

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.520
 saying that we're just down Shriver for almost two hours.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.160
 (all laughing)

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.120
 - The record should have been

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.360
 the person who spent the most time with that Shriver.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.120
 (all laughing)

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.120
 - Even the Goat pissed off after 20 minutes.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.080
 I'll tell you what, there's been a lot of adventures

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.520
 where Anna has been the kind of,

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:01.320
 the butt of the story, I would say, to an extent.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.320
 Like Little Adventures.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.000
 - The Garfield Danes of the Stories.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.920
 - The ass, we will be missing the ass soon.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.760
 - What are you talking about?

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.320
 - I just, I get a bit upset

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.280
 because I wasn't there for some of my favorite ones,

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.160
 and James was.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.200
 James, you two have had quite a few adventures.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.560
 Well, there was the time that Anna flipped over

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.640
 her bike by canal, knocked her teeth out,

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.000
 and you had to rescue her outside a pub because-

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.080
 - I wouldn't say I rescued her.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.280
 I took her to the hospital.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.240
 - Yeah, that was very nice of you

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.640
 'cause they didn't have a phone on me or anything,

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.600
 and so I had to wait for a pass by to come.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.940
 - Who do you think knocked you off the bike?

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.020
 (all laughing)

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.080
 - Well, can I just say on that?

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.480
 'Cause it was quite funny, 'cause we're in A&E,

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.640
 and we were just sat there waiting for you to be seen,

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.840
 and you just come back from Ireland,

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.120
 you've been on holiday in Ireland,

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.800
 and you were telling me a story about what had happened,

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.440
 and for some reason you'd upset someone who ran a shop,

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.440
 and you upset this woman so much

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.760
 that she started shouting at you, saying,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.880
 "Who the hell do you think you are?"

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.920
 And when you told me the story,

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.400
 you said it in a really thick Irish accent.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.600
 - I could do it now.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.600
 - Well, let's not do that, but you said it

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.680
 just as the doctor was coming from behind you

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.720
 to say, "Anatoshinsky, where are you?"

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.400
 And so all he saw was me and you,

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.120
 you with your face covered in blood,

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.960
 and you yelling at me, "Who the hell do you think you are?"

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.400
 And we just looked like some kind of domestic abuse couple.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.560
 - Oh, my God.

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.080
 - Yes, we're working on our issues.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:32.120
 Just fix my jaw, let's get out of here.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.280
 - He would have heard then you go to an English accent

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.960
 and think, "Okay, she's seriously wobbly,

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.560
 something's happened, we need to keep her in."

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.000
 - You just gotta have foreign accents in real life.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.840
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:41.680
 - Who's the president?

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.240
 - Or the T-sock, you know.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.520
 (all laughing)

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.080
 - But the best story, and I don't know if you're gonna say it,

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.760
 I just wanna tear it up and say,

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.960
 "I hope you'll say it."

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.440
 And it's the regret of my life, I wasn't there for it,

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.680
 is when James and Anna went to a university

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:00.080
 in order to tell the students Canterbury,

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.520
 and you stayed the night in a hotel,

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.080
 and Anna got a bit drunk.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.040
 (all laughing)

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.880
 - I don't think I should tell the story.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.520
 - I should have, I don't know.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.160
 - I'll tell you what I remember of it,

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.840
 which is that James and I went and,

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.640
 yeah, Alan Davies was doing a show at Canterbury.

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.480
 You went to do something.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.680
 - I think he just got like an honorary degree

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.520
 or something like that.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.480
 - Yes, he had, and so he was being interviewed,

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.320
 and it was great.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.400
 And so we went for some moral support.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.320
 Me, James, Alan, and--

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.160
 - John Lloyd?

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.000
 - John Lloyd.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.360
 - Alan went to support himself.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.760
 (all laughing)

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.720
 Do you know what, I'm gonna come along for moral support.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.280
 - For moral support.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.760
 - Afterwards, we had quite a lot to drink in some hotel bar,

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.760
 and we were staying in this place

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.600
 that was actually next to the cathedral, which was awesome.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.600
 - It was almost like part of the cathedral, wasn't it?

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.760
 - It was kind of appended to it.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.800
 - Certainly a place where I wouldn't do anything.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.160
 (all laughing)

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.000
 - God might judge adversely.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 So great night.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.760
 I guess at about three o'clock,

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.480
 we sort of went to, we tried to bed,

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.480
 and I have this thing often.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.560
 - In the morning.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.400
 (all laughing)

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.240
 Bloody hell.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.080
 I didn't know that.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.520
 I thought it was all happened around 11 p.m., 11.30.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.760
 Three.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:08.840
 - Woo.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.600
 And he's always stopped at that bit of the story,

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.040
 just jaw on the floor, can't hear anything else.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.040
 - Okay, go on, go on.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.480
 - So I really love looking round places

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.720
 and sneaking into places that maybe I'm not supposed to be in,

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.880
 and like disuse rooms and buildings,

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.760
 and sometimes use buildings, whatever.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.960
 And so I wasn't really tired,

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.840
 and I thought I'd go for a wander.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.280
 So I remember first of all,

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.520
 pushing open a lot of doors in my hotel corridor

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.400
 to see what opened.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.480
 (all laughing)

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.920
 Managing to get into a sort of weird garden

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.960
 out of a fire escape,

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:42.440
 and then climbing over a fence into the cathedral,

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.880
 kind of the cathedral, then wandering around there.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:47.560
 And then what happens often with me is,

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.600
 you're drunk and you're in this place,

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.440
 you're not allowed to be in,

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.440
 and you're like, "Well, I guess I'll go back now."

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.880
 So climbed back over the fence, went back upstairs,

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.840
 and I pushed another door in the hotel,

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.040
 and ended up in this lecture theater,

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.320
 where I sort of fanied around for a bit,

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.840
 looked in all the cupboards,

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.920
 trying to see what I could see really.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.680
 - You found a lot of candy, didn't you?

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.920
 - I found a lot of sweets.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.560
 I found a massive bag of different colored sweets,

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.720
 and I thought what would be so amusing would be,

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.680
 if I took these all back to my room,

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.600
 and I just took all the green ones out,

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.040
 and then I just put it back in the room,

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.600
 and that's when I freak the shit out

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.600
 of whoever comes to get the sweets next time,

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.960
 and also greens my favorite color of sweet.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.640
 So I spent about half an hour in my room

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.320
 with a huge bag, taking out all the green sweets.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.320
 And then I went to put the bag of sweets back,

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.440
 because I don't want to just steal all people's sweets.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.520
 And then as I was leaving the room,

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.120
 having replaced the bag of sweets,

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.000
 I just saw this massive whiteboard

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.200
 at the front of the room,

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.920
 and so I thought, okay, I'll just grab a marker pen.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:55.280
 I grabbed a marker pen and I wrote in big letters,

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.000
 yippee-ki-ay, motherfuckers,

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.320
 in capitals on this whiteboard.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.880
 And then that was actually ideal timing,

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.960
 because I heard someone coming down the corridor,

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.640
 and doing a bit of a, "Oi, and what are you doing?"

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.600
 And so then I legged it and it was a member of staff,

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.840
 so I legged it back to my room and she sort of chased me.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.000
 - So then you went to bed, right?

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.160
 I've been asleep this whole time.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.440
 I woke up the next morning to check out,

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.880
 and you were like a naughty school girl

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.040
 sat in the corner of the reception,

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.160
 being bollocked by someone.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.400
 (laughing)

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:31.520
 - Yeah, it transpired.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.360
 It was actually very unlucky,

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.720
 because it hadn't been a whiteboard.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.320
 It had been a built-in white screen

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.000
 that was part of the wall.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:40.840
 (laughing)

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:45.840
 I'd written on it in indelible, unremovable ink,

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.080
 in large letters, yippee-ki-ay, motherfuckers.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.600
 A die-hard quote, oh, I do remember that from the night

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.200
 before when I was chased by the security guard,

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.280
 I was going, "It's a quote from die-hard."

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.080
 (laughing)

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.480
 To excuse it, like, "I'm not saying

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.640
 "yippee-ki-ay, motherfuckers."

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.320
 It's a quote. - It's a quote.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.720
 - Anyway, the push comes to shove.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.000
 "The next morning, at 9 a.m., there was a church group

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.320
 "who had booked that room."

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.580
 (laughing)

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:14.600
 - That did seem to be the truth of the matter.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.440
 - They walked in.

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.480
 - Someone desperately scrubbing off the bottom of the pot.

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.040
 - They couldn't scrub it off, they had to cover it up.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.640
 They had to cover it up with a curtain.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.120
 And I was charged a small amount of money

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.600
 for the repairs to the room.

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.920
 - Less, in fact, probably,

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.000
 than one small bag of laundry in New York City.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.680
 Pretty good going.

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.800
 - It was the funniest thing that I've ever experienced,

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.640
 being on the train coming back

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.840
 and you having to ring up our boss to tell them,

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:46.040
 because I think it had come off the company credit cards

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.320
 or something, so you knew that they were gonna find out.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.520
 - No, they told our accountant at work.

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.960
 So actually, the first thing I knew was,

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.320
 just empathize for a minute with me, please.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.720
 I'd gone to bed incredibly drunk about four in the morning.

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.760
 My phone rang at 8 a.m.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:03.160
 and I saw it was Liz, our lovely accountant.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.600
 And imagine the heart sinking

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.920
 when I saw Liz's name come up.

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.880
 I thought, I don't know what's happening.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:09.720
 (laughing)

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.360
 Huff and rumble, and yeah, I picked up

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.480
 and the hotel had indeed called her.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.440
 Yeah, it was tough.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.440
 I thought it was gonna be fired, actually.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.880
 We laughed now, guys, but this could have been

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.720
 the end of the podcast.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.600
 - 'Cause I remember pretty much all the way from,

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:23.560
 like, let's say, well, for about half an hour

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.560
 on the train back, you're like,

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.160
 "I'm gonna get fired, what are we gonna do?"

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.000
 - Yeah.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:27.840
 - There'll be no more podcasts,

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.000
 'cause I won't be able to do this anymore.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.880
 - Yeah, yeah, I'm probably going to prison.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:31.720
 - Yeah.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:32.560
 - And to hell.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.480
 Let's not forget the cathedral's right next door.

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.320
 - Yeah.

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.960
 - It's the greatest story ever told.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.400
 - Anyway, good luck getting those stories

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.720
 out of these so-called guests you're having on in my house.

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.760
 (laughing)

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.440
 Is there a pass going to do that?

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:46.960
 Yeah, she probably would.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:48.240
 She would have been up for it.

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.880
 - Oh, well, let's have, why don't we do

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.000
 one more batch of "Best of Anna"

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.320
 and just hear a bit more from "The Greatest Hits"

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.960
 from the last nine years, Anna Tyshensky.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.540
 (upbeat music)

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:04.480
 - I was having a look at the Reverend Richard Coles'

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.200
 autobiography, or biography.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.880
 And he was saying, it was just a throwaway line

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:09.880
 that I then looked into.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:13.520
 He was saying that a lot of vickers have funny names,

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.440
 and he was saying he knew someone who insisted

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.040
 on everyone, even bishops, calling them the Reverend Gazz.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.880
 And so then I thought, "I wonder what funny names

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.680
 there have been in the church over the years?"

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.920
 There's this blog, the blog of St. Chrysostom's church

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.000
 in Manchester, and it's really good.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.400
 You know when people put proper effort

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.320
 into quite an obscure thing?

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.560
 And there's a piece on funny names of church leaders

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:38.440
 throughout history, and there are some such good ones.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:42.040
 So I like this anecdote, which is Henry Joy Fiennes Clinton,

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.520
 who was a rector in the early 20th century,

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.040
 who went to see the Bishop of London,

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:48.360
 and the bishop said, "Take a chair, Clinton,"

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:51.400
 to which he replied, "It's Fiennes Clinton."

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.240
 And the bishop said, "In that case, take two."

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:58.160
 And so it's just, I think that was funny from a bishop.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.520
 Come on, it's a... It's Bishapuma.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.960
 It's Bishapuma. It's Bishapuma, yeah.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.640
 Okay, we won't get him on the podcast.

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.160
 Just this is his audition tape, and I thought...

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.680
 Oh, no, come on, give us more zingers.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.480
 Right, wow.

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.560
 Okay.

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:13.400
 Okay, what about this?

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:17.480
 The very Reverend Gonville-Obey French Baytag,

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:22.320
 but French is spelled with a small F and two of them.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.200
 Is that important for the anecdote?

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.160
 There's no anecdote.

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.840
 It's just the word "French" spelled slightly differently.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.160
 No, Anna, we want you to tell us every single one you've found.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.240
 This is literally all I've got now.

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.280
 It's just a super, not very amusing name.

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:44.720
 Okay, Father John Brabazan, Brabazan Loutha.

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.640
 Come on. It's two Brabazans.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.280
 Brabazan, Brabazan.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.520
 Oh, my God, I'm just picturing Jimmy Carr

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.640
 at the Habersmith Apollo.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:55.800
 The next act is a fucking killer act.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.320
 She's got some amazing anecdotes.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.120
 Anna Tashinsky, everybody.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.480
 Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:06.640
 We've got Father Page Turner, we've got Father Pickles.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:10.880
 Page Turner, open with Page Turner.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.840
 That's great. Father Pickles is funny as well.

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.840
 I'll reorder the set.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.560
 Father Careful, Father Christmas.

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.280
 Okay.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:20.880
 So that's the one I should stick with, Father Christmas.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.600
 You don't think stick with any of it.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.040
 Okay.

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.640
 Have you guys heard of St Andrew Undershaft?

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.360
 LAUGHTER

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.760
 I can't believe...

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:34.160
 You just said a name way funnier than Anna's 20 minutes.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.240
 Just upstage the full day of work.

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.520
 I'm so sorry.

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.080
 I've been delving into church, aren't I?

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.400
 I'm so sorry.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.840
 This is right under your nose the whole time.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.480
 On the subject of people being allergic to things,

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.640
 I went on to...

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:52.480
 I continued my search.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.960
 And I went to Yahoo Answers,

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.160
 because people often ask questions.

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:00.800
 The best site on the internet.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.720
 This was the question.

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.920
 So, "My girlfriend is allergic to almost every animal

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.680
 "you'd find in a petting zoo.

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.920
 "If she inhales air that is around a horse,

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.400
 "she can be hospitalized.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.000
 "Now, she loves giraffes.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.360
 "Does anyone think she'd be allergic to them too?

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.280
 "I was thinking of surprising her on her birthday

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.720
 "with a trip to the local zoo to pet a giraffe."

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:24.880
 And the reply, the top-rated reply,

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.680
 because that's how it works on Yahoo Answers,

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.000
 the most voted to reply,

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.960
 "If she's allergic to almost every animal

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:35.400
 "I guarantee you the zoo will contain more than just giraffes.

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.880
 "Why don't you do something less stupid?"

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.600
 LAUGHTER

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.080
 So, where did you take her in the end, then?

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:43.400
 I did, I did.

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.320
 LAUGHTER

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:52.800
 Britain's leading female table tennis player

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:56.360
 is this woman, this girl, called Tintin Ho.

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.040
 And do you guys...

00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.960
 Can you guess why she's called that?

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.920
 She's got a quiff, Tintin.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.800
 That's why I was... No, I was thinking Tintin.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.880
 Got a small dog called Snowy.

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.440
 Confusingly, it's not related to the character of Tintin.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:11.560
 Wait, she hangs out with an old fisherman called Captain Haddock.

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.480
 Again, it's not like a thing.

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.360
 She has a pair of twins that she hangs out with

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:17.520
 called the Thompson twins.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.840
 You can't just stop us making Tintin jokes, Anna, immediately.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.000
 She's got her father is called Herge.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.760
 Right, as I have made quite clear, it's not related to Tintin,

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:30.040
 and there must be other avenues you can pursue.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.600
 She's Belgian, you know?

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.760
 Right, I'm just going to tell you, OK?

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.880
 No, no, no, no, no. I feel like we're close.

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.640
 She's made up ten.

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:41.400
 Yeah, he's found something different, but incorrect.

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:45.160
 No, it's because her dad is obsessed with table tennis.

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.880
 And actually, that's kind of weird.

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.440
 Sorry, hang on. It's coming, it's coming.

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.200
 I was so sure you were going to say her dad is obsessed with Tintin.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:58.680
 I wish I hadn't brought this up.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.720
 He's obsessed with table tennis.

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:05.640
 And the initials of table tennis are TT.

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.520
 So we called her Tintin, and, in fact, her brother is called Ping.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.320
 And she said it was between her being called Tintin

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.640
 and her being called Pong when she was born.

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:19.560
 Wow. And so she says that she is delighted that she didn't get bombed.

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.560
 You can't have two kids who call them Ping and Pong.

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.200
 The social services will get involved.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.000
 You would think.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 Aber, in 1976, they had the number one spot for 39 weeks,

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.360
 and after 12 weeks of it, their version of Top of the Pops

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.160
 just stopped showing the music video,

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.120
 because you've seen it for 12 weeks, guys.

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.400
 In Australia, that one. Yeah, fans absolutely rioted.

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.560
 And that was on the Australian version of Top of the Pops,

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.280
 which was called Countdown.

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:51.120
 Yeah. Well, when you say fans rioted, did I say rioted?

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.800
 Yeah. I meant, "were furious."

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:58.360
 One complaint was registered with the ABC.

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:01.120
 No, but generally, look, when they toured, one mother ran

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.320
 and she put her baby down on the road

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:06.280
 so that their tour caravan would stop and she could get an autograph.

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:07.440
 Whoa. Right.

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:10.080
 There was a hotel which cut up their bedsheets after they'd left,

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.600
 and they sold it via newspaper.

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.280
 Oh, they do that all the time. Yeah, they did that with the Beatles as well.

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.520
 Did they? I've got about six of them. Not the baby thing, though.

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.080
 I just wanted you to know we will not succumb to that kind of blackmail.

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.800
 If there's a baby in front of our tour bus, we're going straight over it.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:27.240
 Who knows fish policy, right?

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.560
 (LAUGHTER)

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:35.920
 It's very important to get that clear from the outset.

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.760
 That's good.

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.720
 It's very controversial the way they vote in the Grammys.

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.440
 Because, well, until this year, it was super secret.

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.040
 It sounds quite exciting.

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.640
 And I think what used to happen was,

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.840
 winners were decided by this, like, 12,000 strong

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.960
 Recording Academy bunch of voters.

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:58.840
 But then, I think, partly because the awards just kept going so wrong,

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:01.040
 and they just kept giving it to weird people.

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.960
 They had to change the rules, and I think the straw that broke the camel's back

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.800
 came in the early '90s when "Album of the Year" was up,

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:11.520
 and Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA" was released,

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:13.320
 and "Princess Purple Rain" was released,

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.280
 and Lionel Richie's "Can't Slow Down" won.

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:19.880
 And everyone said, "We don't like that. That's not as good as the other two."

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.680
 And so they formed a secret committee,

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:25.520
 which basically goes through all the 12,000 votes and takes out the duds.

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:29.520
 Because, actually, you would think that having a larger group, 12,000,

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:32.080
 would be more likely to give you a democratic answer, right?

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.080
 Yeah.

00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:36.000
 But a democratic answer isn't necessarily the best answer, James.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 Is that not right?

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:45.200
 That's my view, and my one-way ticket to Russia has just come through.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.160
 Anyway, people got quite pissed off by the secret committee

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:49.560
 because no one knew how they voted or why they voted,

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.160
 and there's someone called the Weekend, I think.

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.160
 Oh, the Weekend.

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:54.160
 The Weekend.

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.160
 Oh, right.

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.160
 Well, it's spelled the Weekend.

00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:00.160
 Um, so...

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:03.160
 This show has certainly weakened over the years, hasn't it?

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:07.160
 Yeah, so it's spelled like Weekend, anyway, but without any.

00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:08.160
 So, um, he...

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.160
 Well, with two E's.

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:15.160
 But not three.

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:18.160
 Anyway, the Weekend got annoyed that he hadn't got nominated.

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.160
 I think it's pronounced the Weckend.

00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:24.160
 Ladies and gentlemen, the Weekend.

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.160
 I just...

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:29.160
 I want a new podcast where we give Anna the name of all the partners

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:32.160
 that are in the charts and see if she can pronounce them.

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.160
 They've asked me to read out the nominations next year.

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.160
 I'm quite nervous now.

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:38.160
 Lil Nas the Tenth?

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:42.160
 I didn't know there were nine other Lil Nases.

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:45.160
 I know how to artificially inseminate a cow

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:47.160
 based on researching for this podcast.

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.160
 Cool.

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:51.160
 So, about 5% of dairy cows in this country,

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:53.160
 when they have to be inseminated,

00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.160
 they get inseminated just by semen rather than the actual bull.

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.160
 And for some reason, I found myself reading

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:01.160
 this really in-depth farmer's guide to how to do it.

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:04.160
 And what I didn't realise was, so you get a semen gun,

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.160
 which you put the semen in.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.160
 Imagine you bring your semen gun to a gunfight.

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:12.160
 No!

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.160
 Dammit.

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:17.160
 You bring your semen gun to the insemination fight,

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:20.160
 but what you do is, you have to...

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.160
 So, there are two entries into a cow.

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.160
 So, it's much like a human's...

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.160
 Yeah.

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.160
 You've got the...

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.160
 Oh, sorry.

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.160
 There are three now.

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.160
 Oh, sorry, there are three.

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:35.160
 We're in Devon.

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:39.160
 Something tells me you're not the biggest expert in this room

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:43.160
 on the number of ways into a cow.

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:46.160
 I know that people in Devon know all these secret ways,

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:49.160
 but there are two entries...

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:52.160
 There are two entries into the back of a cow, officially.

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:56.160
 And so, you know, one is the rectum, as we all have.

00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.160
 Stop, Professor. Let me write this down.

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:05.160
 Children, wouldn't you be quiet?

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.160
 You've got the rectum, and then you've got the sex tubes,

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.160
 and they're different...

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:13.160
 All right, the cervix.

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:16.160
 But what you do is, amazingly, when you're inseminating a cow,

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.160
 you obviously have to stick the gun in the cervix,

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.160
 but the way you navigate the gun

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:25.160
 into the uterine horns, as they're called,

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:29.160
 is you have to put your other arm that's not holding the gun

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.160
 into the rectum.

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:35.160
 And so, it's so amazing.

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.160
 And they say you shove your arm into the rectum,

00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.160
 insert your arm into the rectum,

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:42.160
 get someone else to hold the cow's tail aside while you do this.

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:45.160
 No, it would be a bald farmer who tried using one foot

00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:48.160
 to pin the cow's tail.

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:53.160
 This is the worst game of Twister I've ever played.

00:59:53.160 --> 01:00:00.160
 It says "left hand sex tubes."

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.160
 Anyway, look.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.160
 It just feels like this lesson isn't going to end,

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.160
 so you essentially use your rectum arm

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.160
 to navigate your semen gun,

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:13.160
 which is in the vaginal canal,

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.160
 and you push it through.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.160
 So you've got your arm in the rectum,

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.160
 and it's pushing against the other canal

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.160
 so that it gets into the uterus,

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.160
 and it's called rectovaginal insemination.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:27.160
 And that's lesson over. Enjoy.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:34.160
 Well, there we go.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.160
 There it is, some of the best of Anna Tyshinski's best bits.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.160
 I was trying to think, you know,

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:44.160
 is there some way that we could keep a bit of you here, you know?

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.160
 Oh, God, my God.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.160
 Is there some way...

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.160
 We want her to give us the finger.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.160
 Give us the finger.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.160
 Just in spirit, you know? Just in spirit.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.160
 She's been metaphorically giving everyone the finger

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.160
 for the last nine years.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.160
 I'll tell you what, though.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.160
 I thought hard about it.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.160
 I thought, "How do we keep a bit of Anna here?"

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.160
 And I worked it out.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.160
 I suddenly remembered the weirdest story

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:08.160
 I have ever heard involving Anna Tyshinski,

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.160
 and it is this.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.160
 There was a Christmas party that Anna once went to,

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.160
 and part of the party, they said,

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.160
 "We're going to do a really fun thing.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.160
 We're going to do a raffle.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.160
 You're just going to take a ticket,

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.160
 and you're going to get a present,

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.160
 so everyone bring a present so you can give it to someone."

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:26.160
 So, I was talking to the friend today who I bumped into.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.160
 She gave a scarf, for example.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.160
 Right.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.160
 Yeah, normal things.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.160
 Normal things were handed around.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.160
 This person, whose name is Lenny,

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.160
 received her number and received her prize in the raffle.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.160
 I never met Lenny.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.160
 And this is the prize that Anna had donated.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.160
 It is her teeth.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.160
 Oh, my God!

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.160
 That fell out of her mouth.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.160
 Lenny hasn't treasured and kept the teeth.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.160
 WTS.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.160
 She has.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.160
 They're in her home.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.160
 I went to her home today to pick it up.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.160
 This is Lenny didn't know who Anna was.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.160
 She opens up her present,

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.160
 and there are teeth from one of the other party members there.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.160
 Were these the teeth that got knocked out

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.160
 when James went to get you from...

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.160
 Yeah.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.160
 Yeah, so these are the teeth.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.160
 They got removed.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.160
 I thought they were in the canal.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.160
 They're in the canal.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.160
 We weren't looking for them.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.160
 We did.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.160
 The fully knocked out ones were in the canal,

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.160
 and they were the ones that had to get taken out later.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.160
 Bloody hell.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.160
 Yeah, so Anna thought it'd be normal

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.160
 to give in a raffle prize her teeth away.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.160
 Now, Polly, who is the partner of Lenny,

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.160
 tried to get rid of Anna's teeth to begin with

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.160
 because she has a fear of teeth.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.160
 She literally hates the tapping of teeth.

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.160
 It was the worst present that could have arrived into the house.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.160
 But as a result,

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.160
 for the last couple of years since they've had these teeth,

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.160
 Lenny hides your teeth all over the house to surprise Polly.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.160
 If she goes to sleep, she'll put it under her pillow.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.160
 If she's opening a pencil case,

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.160
 the teeth will be inside the pencil case.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.160
 Reverse tooth fairy, basically.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.160
 And then they almost got given away in another raffle very recently,

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.160
 but Lenny decided to keep them because she was having too much time.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.160
 How much did you pay for those, and have you told your wife?

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.160
 But so, now, while you're gone, you are here.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.160
 There'll be a bit of Anna's always with us.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.160
 What we're going to do is we're going to make Sarah Pasco put some of those.

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.160
 Every time there's a guest,

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.160
 we're going to make them shove them into their face.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.160
 It's going to make the book all sound very weird, isn't it?

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.160
 But it's worth it to get a bit of me.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:20.160
 Oh, well, I'm so honoured that my teeth have had such a life beyond me, actually.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160
 I know. It's really exciting.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.160
 It's a weird story, Dan.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.160
 That's a weird story.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.160
 You're responsible too, Anna.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.160
 James is the only one who gets off Scott for it.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.160
 No, actually, you were involved in the losing of the teeth.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.160
 What? I was not.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.160
 I'm the only one here who doesn't have any involved with this mad,

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.160
 batshit, teeth raffle story.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.160
 You will.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.160
 I won't.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.160
 You're the next chapter.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:46.160
 Anyway, let's wrap up.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.160
 That is it.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.160
 That is all of our facts.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.160
 Thank you so much for listening.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:53.160
 If you want to get in contact with any of us about the weird ass stories

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.160

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.160
 I'm on @Sribeland, Andy at Andrew Hunter, and James.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.160
 Hi, James Harkin.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.160
 And Anna.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.160
 No, you don't say anything.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.160
 You're gone.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.160
 Yeah, I mean, you can email ScottStackUI.com,

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.160
 but good luck me ever seeing it.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.160
 Yeah.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.160
 And you'll see it and do a good impersonation

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.160
 when you reply, right?

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.160
 Yeah, that's right.

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.160
 You'll be wearing the team every time you reply to an email.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.160
 I'll time the emails all to go out between 3 and 5 a.m.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:21.160
 and everyone will end Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.160
 Yeah, we're going to our group account at no such thing.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.160
 And we'll be back again next week with a really exciting guest

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.160
 as part of our big rotation of awesome guests,

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.160
 starting with Sarah Pasco.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.160
 And we'll be back with that episode next week.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.160
 We'll see you then.
