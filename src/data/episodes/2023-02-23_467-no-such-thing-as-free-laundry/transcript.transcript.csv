00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:18,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:18,00:00:21,coming to you from the QI offices in Covran Garden.
00:00:21,00:00:22,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:22,00:00:25,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:25,00:00:27,Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin.
00:00:27,00:00:29,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:29,00:00:34,"for this time for a very special, somewhat sad episode."
00:00:34,00:00:35,- Poignant.
00:00:35,00:00:37,- Poignant episode.
00:00:37,00:00:40,A very sad announcement that we have to make is that--
00:00:40,00:00:41,"- A happy announcement, no?"
00:00:41,00:00:43,I think it's a happy announcement.
00:00:43,00:00:44,- Is it?
00:00:44,00:00:45,- It's very confusing.
00:00:45,00:00:47,"- Well, Anna Tyshinski is leaving the show."
00:00:47,00:00:49,So it's a--
00:00:49,00:00:50,- I'm delighted.
00:00:50,00:00:51,- Yeah.
00:00:51,00:00:52,- I'm delighted.
00:00:52,00:00:54,"- Yeah, for nine months, temporarily."
00:00:54,00:00:56,"- Temporarily, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:00:56,00:00:58,She's going away for a while to think about
00:00:58,00:01:01,"what she's done and then, then she can come back."
00:01:01,00:01:03,- And what specifically she's done--
00:01:03,00:01:03,"- Yes, is--"
00:01:03,00:01:04,- Is created a baby.
00:01:04,00:01:05,- She has.
00:01:05,00:01:07,She's been collaborating on another project
00:01:07,00:01:09,with another person.
00:01:09,00:01:12,"- It's very low effort, so much less work than the podcast."
00:01:12,00:01:15,And I hope that it continues that way.
00:01:15,00:01:16,- That it does.
00:01:16,00:01:19,"Anyway, we thought we would commemorate this tragedy."
00:01:19,00:01:21,I think it's a tragedy that she's going.
00:01:21,00:01:22,- Joyfully.
00:01:22,00:01:22,- That she's going.
00:01:22,00:01:23,- Joyful news.
00:01:23,00:01:25,"- That's obviously happy stuff, yeah."
00:01:25,00:01:27,"But not for us, not for the listener."
00:01:27,00:01:27,- Not for Dan.
00:01:27,00:01:28,- Not for me.
00:01:28,00:01:30,- I honestly feel like I am secretly dying
00:01:30,00:01:32,and no one's told me.
00:01:32,00:01:33,(laughing)
00:01:33,00:01:36,"The person who's been leaving drinks tonight,"
00:01:36,00:01:38,"people who say, ""You went down as a leaving thing."""
00:01:38,00:01:40,"- As someone who's been in this situation,"
00:01:40,00:01:43,"or a similar situation 12 months ago,"
00:01:43,00:01:45,"metaphorically, it's the end."
00:01:45,00:01:46,"- I'm gonna be dead inside from now on, aren't I?"
00:01:46,00:01:47,- I'm afraid so.
00:01:47,00:01:49,"- You've gone for two weeks, though, on paternity."
00:01:49,00:01:51,Should we have done a missing?
00:01:51,00:01:52,James is off.
00:01:52,00:01:53,(laughing)
00:01:53,00:01:54,Do the best of.
00:01:54,00:01:56,"- And look, we should say that's what we're here to do."
00:01:56,00:01:59,We're here to commemorate our wonderful buddy.
00:01:59,00:02:00,- Okay.
00:02:00,00:02:01,(laughing)
00:02:01,00:02:02,- A very daffy word.
00:02:02,00:02:05,"- So, can we say, ""Celebrate,"" you know?"
00:02:05,00:02:07,- It's not sad occasion. - It's not eulogy.
00:02:07,00:02:09,"- Well, yeah."
00:02:09,00:02:10,So we thought what we'd do is we would present
00:02:10,00:02:12,"our three favorite facts this time, not four."
00:02:12,00:02:15,It's sort of get used to the idea that she's not here.
00:02:15,00:02:17,And share with you some of the greatest moments
00:02:17,00:02:21,that she's had over the last nine years of fish.
00:02:21,00:02:22,Nine years we've been doing this.
00:02:22,00:02:23,- Nine years.
00:02:23,00:02:24,- It's coming up to it in March of this year.
00:02:24,00:02:26,"So yeah, we're on the brink."
00:02:26,00:02:27,- So.
00:02:27,00:02:29,"- Oh, God, I'm going out."
00:02:29,00:02:29,- You're coming back.
00:02:29,00:02:30,You're coming back in nine months
00:02:30,00:02:32,and there's a very exciting roster of guests
00:02:32,00:02:34,actually presenting lined up to replace you.
00:02:34,00:02:35,"So, you know."
00:02:35,00:02:36,- Wow.
00:02:36,00:02:37,"Let's not use the word ""replace."""
00:02:37,00:02:39,(laughing)
00:02:39,00:02:41,- Would you jump into a grave that quickly?
00:02:41,00:02:42,(laughing)
00:02:42,00:02:44,Sarah Pascoe?
00:02:44,00:02:45,(laughing)
00:02:45,00:02:47,- They could jump into someone's grave.
00:02:47,00:02:49,Isn't that what you do?
00:02:49,00:02:49,(laughing)
00:02:49,00:02:50,- Wait.
00:02:50,00:02:51,"- I don't think if you're replacing them,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,you climb into that coffin with them.
00:02:53,00:02:54,- You're right.
00:02:54,00:02:55,- What's the phrase?
00:02:55,00:02:56,- Jump into their bed?
00:02:56,00:02:58,- Jump into their bed?
00:02:58,00:02:58,- No.
00:02:58,00:02:59,- Jump into their bed?
00:02:59,00:03:00,- Pick up their shoes.
00:03:00,00:03:01,- Pick up their shoes?
00:03:01,00:03:02,- Fill the dead man's shoes.
00:03:02,00:03:04,- I wouldn't piss on their shoes if they were dead.
00:03:04,00:03:05,That's the phrase.
00:03:05,00:03:06,- Is it?
00:03:06,00:03:07,"- No, it's like."
00:03:07,00:03:08,- I think it's maternity cover.
00:03:08,00:03:10,I think that's the word we're looking for.
00:03:10,00:03:12,- They haven't even cleaned up the funeral meat yet.
00:03:12,00:03:13,- She's not even cold.
00:03:13,00:03:14,- She's not even cold.
00:03:14,00:03:15,- I'm sorry.
00:03:15,00:03:17,They haven't cleaned up her funeral meat?
00:03:17,00:03:18,(laughing)
00:03:18,00:03:20,- I think that's actually.
00:03:20,00:03:21,I think that's from Hamlet.
00:03:21,00:03:22,"Oh, no, they..."
00:03:22,00:03:23,"- Yeah, no, it is."
00:03:23,00:03:24,There's a thing about funeral meats.
00:03:24,00:03:26,"In the wedding, they reuse the stuff"
00:03:26,00:03:29,for Hamlet's dad's funeral for the wedding
00:03:29,00:03:30,to Hamlet's dad's brother.
00:03:30,00:03:32,- Have you heard of cheesy funeral potatoes?
00:03:32,00:03:34,(laughing)
00:03:34,00:03:34,"- Sounds yummy, though."
00:03:34,00:03:37,"- It's a thing they do in Utah, I think."
00:03:37,00:03:40,"And it's basically potatoes,"
00:03:40,00:03:45,"cream, cheese, and corn flakes all together."
00:03:45,00:03:47,And it's what you have in funerals.
00:03:47,00:03:50,And the idea is that it's the kind of thing
00:03:50,00:03:52,"that a typical Utah family,"
00:03:52,00:03:55,typical Mormon family would have in the lada.
00:03:55,00:03:57,And everyone would have these four
00:03:57,00:03:58,or five different things.
00:03:58,00:04:00,"I think chicken soup is one of them as well,"
00:04:00,00:04:01,but you put them all together
00:04:01,00:04:03,"and it's like the meal that you have at a funeral, so."
00:04:03,00:04:04,- Really?
00:04:04,00:04:06,"Hold on, you don't mix the chicken soup with the..."
00:04:06,00:04:07,"- Yeah, I don't get it."
00:04:07,00:04:08,- You just put it in the chicken soup.
00:04:08,00:04:09,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:09,00:04:11,- And then you put corn flakes on top.
00:04:11,00:04:13,- We're here basically to have your
00:04:13,00:04:16,"cheesy funeral potato meats, and that's lovely."
00:04:16,00:04:18,- I think chicken soup's quite an incentive thing to have
00:04:18,00:04:20,"'cause that traditionally makes you better,"
00:04:20,00:04:22,"but of course at a funeral,"
00:04:22,00:04:24,"it's too late for that, isn't it?"
00:04:24,00:04:25,- Absolutely right.
00:04:25,00:04:27,"Sorry, this, we've broken the format."
00:04:27,00:04:29,- We're gonna do our three favorite facts
00:04:29,00:04:32,"about Anna Tyshinski, each one of us presenting it."
00:04:32,00:04:33,"And why don't we start with you, James?"
00:04:33,00:04:36,"- Okay, well, my fact this week is that"
00:04:36,00:04:39,"in order to get into the United States,"
00:04:39,00:04:43,Anna Tyshinski had to tell a fact about a dead president.
00:04:43,00:04:46,(laughing)
00:04:46,00:04:48,"- Am I, I'm never allowed there again."
00:04:48,00:04:51,"- They let you in, surprisingly, despite it."
00:04:51,00:04:51,- They did.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"- It was, or border control, or whatever it is."
00:04:54,00:04:56,"- Yeah, I actually can't remember the context"
00:04:56,00:04:57,where they made me say it.
00:04:57,00:04:58,- Well.
00:04:58,00:04:59,"- We'd landed, hadn't we?"
00:04:59,00:05:01,"- We'd landed, so we had to get a visa"
00:05:01,00:05:05,as something like people of exceptional talent
00:05:05,00:05:06,or something like that.
00:05:06,00:05:07,"- Yeah, it was like we were Julia Roberts or something."
00:05:07,00:05:09,"She wouldn't need one, of course,"
00:05:09,00:05:11,"'cause she is American, but."
00:05:11,00:05:12,- So we went to the American embassy
00:05:12,00:05:16,"and we had to prove to them that we had exceptional talent,"
00:05:16,00:05:18,or they were exceptionally famous or something.
00:05:18,00:05:21,"And the woman at the window just said,"
00:05:21,00:05:25,"""Notice things of fish, I never heard of you."""
00:05:25,00:05:26,- That's right.
00:05:26,00:05:28,"- Yeah, and immediately we were on the back foot."
00:05:28,00:05:31,"But anyway, eventually we managed to convince them"
00:05:31,00:05:34,that we should go to America and get a visa to work there
00:05:34,00:05:36,so that we could do our show.
00:05:36,00:05:40,"But when we got to the passport control,"
00:05:40,00:05:44,the visa said that we were a comedy podcast.
00:05:44,00:05:46,"And the guy said to you, Anna, as you walked up,"
00:05:46,00:05:48,"he said, ""Well, what do you do?"""
00:05:48,00:05:50,"And you said, ""Well, it's a kind of about facts."""
00:05:50,00:05:52,"And he said, ""Well, tell me a fact then."""
00:05:52,00:05:53,And the only thing you could think about
00:05:53,00:05:56,was something about the murderer of a president.
00:05:56,00:05:57,- Yeah.
00:05:57,00:06:00,The only thing I can usually think about
00:06:00,00:06:01,"is President Garfield's anus,"
00:06:01,00:06:03,but all the more so when you're landing in the home
00:06:03,00:06:04,of President Garfield.
00:06:04,00:06:07,"So yeah, I told him that when President Garfield"
00:06:07,00:06:10,"was assassinated, it was a slow process"
00:06:10,00:06:11,and he spent the last month of his life
00:06:11,00:06:12,"eating through his anus,"
00:06:12,00:06:14,which I'm sure you're all familiar with
00:06:14,00:06:16,if you remember episode one.
00:06:16,00:06:18,- Yeah. - Second ever fact on the show.
00:06:18,00:06:20,- How did he react?
00:06:20,00:06:22,"- The border control. - President Garfield, yeah."
00:06:22,00:06:23,(laughing)
00:06:23,00:06:25,- There were a lot of funeral potatoes that week.
00:06:25,00:06:27,(laughing)
00:06:27,00:06:29,"- I think he did what most border control people do,"
00:06:29,00:06:32,which is be very unimpressed and slightly threatening.
00:06:32,00:06:36,"I think it was like, ""Okay, go on ahead then, ma'am."""
00:06:36,00:06:37,- Wow. - Wow.
00:06:37,00:06:39,- Which is the reaction I've always wanted
00:06:39,00:06:41,"to all of our podcast facts, so."
00:06:41,00:06:44,"- Do you know, weirdly, this fact about President Garfield"
00:06:44,00:06:47,was I remember the exact moment that you told me that fact.
00:06:47,00:06:49,I can remember the exact spot of the office.
00:06:49,00:06:51,"Yeah, because we were getting ready to do"
00:06:51,00:06:53,what was still a run-through of the show
00:06:53,00:06:56,"and we used that segment in the very first episode,"
00:06:56,00:06:59,but I remember you had sent around your facts
00:06:59,00:07:01,and your fact was about President Garfield
00:07:01,00:07:02,and it was to do with the fact
00:07:02,00:07:04,that he spent three months on his death bed
00:07:04,00:07:05,and they tried to cure him.
00:07:05,00:07:08,"I can't remember your wording, but it wasn't great."
00:07:08,00:07:10,"It was sort of like, we need that."
00:07:10,00:07:11,"- Just a quick note, Anna."
00:07:11,00:07:13,(laughing)
00:07:13,00:07:14,- That's what this is gonna be.
00:07:14,00:07:15,This is an intervention.
00:07:15,00:07:17,What to think about over the next nine months.
00:07:17,00:07:19,- Don't be holding that in for nine years.
00:07:19,00:07:20,- Yeah.
00:07:20,00:07:21,- I've got a big list. - You can do this
00:07:21,00:07:22,for everyone from episode one.
00:07:22,00:07:24,"- We're starting, let's start."
00:07:24,00:07:26,"Episode one will be here. - Okay, it's surprising."
00:07:26,00:07:27,Tell me what I should have said.
00:07:27,00:07:28,"- I can't remember what you said to me at the time,"
00:07:28,00:07:29,"but I said to you, ""I love the story."
00:07:29,00:07:31,"Is there any other way of expressing it?"""
00:07:31,00:07:33,"And you literally in a beat said, ""Oh, what about this?"
00:07:33,00:07:34,"For the last three months of his life,"
00:07:34,00:07:36,"he ate everything through his anus."""
00:07:36,00:07:38,"And I remember genuinely, it was a bit of a thunderbolt,"
00:07:38,00:07:40,"kind of like, ""Oh my God, we're gonna have a hit"
00:07:40,00:07:42,"on our hands."" It was just so beautifully crafted."
00:07:42,00:07:43,"Yeah, I really felt it."
00:07:43,00:07:45,I'm just telling the origin story here.
00:07:45,00:07:47,"- What a strange, inspirational moment."
00:07:47,00:07:50,I don't think a lot of great inventors could emphasize
00:07:50,00:07:51,with that moment being the one.
00:07:51,00:07:52,- It was thunderbolt.
00:07:52,00:07:53,- And that's why we were so nearly called
00:07:53,00:07:56,the President Garfield Anus Cust.
00:07:56,00:07:58,"- Well, it's such a shame that we changed the name."
00:07:58,00:08:00,"- To be honest, when we were thinking of our first book,"
00:08:00,00:08:02,"James and I, when we were brainstorming ideas"
00:08:02,00:08:03,"for the title, ""The President's Anus."""
00:08:03,00:08:05,"- I remember ""The President's Anus"" coming up"
00:08:05,00:08:06,"quite a bit, being tossed about."
00:08:06,00:08:09,- It feels like it's going to be tossed.
00:08:09,00:08:10,- As it was.
00:08:10,00:08:11,"- It feels like the beginning of a title,"
00:08:11,00:08:12,"""The President's Anus."""
00:08:12,00:08:13,"It feels like it should be,"
00:08:13,00:08:14,"""The President's Anus is missing."""
00:08:14,00:08:15,Or some--
00:08:15,00:08:17,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:17,00:08:19,"Yeah, but one of my favorite things of that tour,"
00:08:19,00:08:21,"so we did a big, it was our first ever American tour."
00:08:21,00:08:23,First and only American tour.
00:08:23,00:08:24,- Yeah.
00:08:24,00:08:25,- Pulled yourself back from saying a big American tour
00:08:25,00:08:26,'cause it was five days.
00:08:26,00:08:28,"- Well, for us, it was super exciting."
00:08:28,00:08:31,We were up on Times Square.
00:08:31,00:08:32,We got to play New York.
00:08:32,00:08:33,We played Washington.
00:08:33,00:08:35,We stayed in the--
00:08:35,00:08:36,- Watergate.
00:08:36,00:08:37,- The Watergate Hotel.
00:08:37,00:08:37,- Yeah.
00:08:37,00:08:39,"- Where they had, like, remember they had the,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,"the pencils, like, please steal this pencil."
00:08:41,00:08:42,"- Oh, the room keys."
00:08:42,00:08:43,- And the room keys.
00:08:43,00:08:45,- Said I was stolen from the Watergate Hotel.
00:08:45,00:08:46,"- That's right, yeah."
00:08:46,00:08:49,"All the light bulbs, like, pillows I brought home."
00:08:49,00:08:51,"That's the same thing, weirdly."
00:08:51,00:08:53,"- And those documents from the White House, though."
00:08:53,00:08:56,"Yeah, but my favorite thing of all"
00:08:56,00:08:57,was when we were staying in New York.
00:08:57,00:08:59,And I just remember seeing Anna one morning
00:08:59,00:09:02,and her looking unbelievably abused
00:09:02,00:09:05,because she was holding a bill in her hand
00:09:05,00:09:07,for a basic bit of laundry
00:09:07,00:09:08,that she had sent to the hotel.
00:09:08,00:09:09,"- Oh, my God."
00:09:09,00:09:11,- Which came to $240.
00:09:11,00:09:12,- It was more than that.
00:09:12,00:09:13,It was more than that.
00:09:13,00:09:15,"I think it was, like, $400."
00:09:15,00:09:16,"- Oh, my God."
00:09:16,00:09:18,- And I thought it was complimentary.
00:09:18,00:09:20,"I just, I don't know."
00:09:20,00:09:22,"- They just put a bag outside your door, didn't they?"
00:09:22,00:09:23,With laundry written on it.
00:09:23,00:09:24,Just shove it in.
00:09:24,00:09:25,"- Yeah, you just put stuff in."
00:09:25,00:09:26,I don't know.
00:09:26,00:09:29,We always send premier ins when we're in the UK.
00:09:29,00:09:30,We're not used to this.
00:09:30,00:09:33,"So yeah, it tossed all my clothes from the whole tour in."
00:09:33,00:09:35,(laughing)
00:09:35,00:09:37,- You had enough clothes.
00:09:37,00:09:38,You didn't really need it all done.
00:09:38,00:09:40,- Absolutely not when we were going home the next day.
00:09:40,00:09:42,- Sometimes it's lovely to get home
00:09:42,00:09:43,with a fresh case of clothes.
00:09:43,00:09:45,It feels incredible.
00:09:45,00:09:47,"- Anyway, so we made a loss on that tour, didn't we?"
00:09:47,00:09:48,"- Yeah, we did."
00:09:48,00:09:51,"- I know, I should say, just to make you think kindly"
00:09:51,00:09:53,"of these people, you're stuck with the next nine months"
00:09:53,00:09:56,that they agreed that that could be split that loss
00:09:56,00:09:59,over the whole tour group rather than just me taking it.
00:09:59,00:10:00,- Did we?
00:10:00,00:10:01,"- Yeah, yeah, and I think--"
00:10:01,00:10:02,"- Yeah, sorry about that."
00:10:02,00:10:04,- I think the tour pretty much dead on broke even.
00:10:04,00:10:05,"- Yeah, right."
00:10:05,00:10:07,- But we would have been in the black if it had--
00:10:07,00:10:09,- I owe you all a hundred pounds.
00:10:09,00:10:10,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:10:10,00:10:12,"I think, no, I think I didn't pipe up"
00:10:12,00:10:14,"because when I went back to England,"
00:10:14,00:10:18,I bought so many books that my overweight money allowance
00:10:18,00:10:20,"was something like $1,000 or something."
00:10:20,00:10:22,It was ridiculous.
00:10:22,00:10:24,"- We didn't take the hit for that though, did we?"
00:10:24,00:10:24,- I think you might have done.
00:10:24,00:10:26,"- I think we might have done, yeah."
00:10:26,00:10:28,"- Well, if I'm gonna take the laundry hit, I was, I thought."
00:10:28,00:10:30,"- Andy, we should have gone for the huckers"
00:10:30,00:10:31,and the cocaine that we sent.
00:10:31,00:10:34,(laughing)
00:10:34,00:10:36,- I only ate one meal a day in America
00:10:36,00:10:38,'cause I was so concerned about making a loss.
00:10:38,00:10:40,(laughing)
00:10:40,00:10:44,- We made him walk all the way from Boston to New York.
00:10:44,00:10:47,"- I took one pair of pants and I wore it inside, outside,"
00:10:47,00:10:48,"back to front, upside down."
00:10:48,00:10:51,"Now I know I was on tour with, you know, Elton John."
00:10:51,00:10:54,"- Yeah, so sorry about that."
00:10:54,00:10:55,- Wow.
00:10:55,00:10:57,"- But yeah, didn't get evicted from the country."
00:10:57,00:10:58,"No, what's the cool when you get evicted?"
00:10:58,00:10:59,Deported.
00:10:59,00:11:00,- Deported.
00:11:00,00:11:01,- Didn't get deported for talking about
00:11:01,00:11:04,"presidential assassination, so actually helped us get in."
00:11:04,00:11:06,"So if you are trying to get into America,"
00:11:06,00:11:06,give it a go.
00:11:06,00:11:09,"- Okay, well, the point of this show, I think,"
00:11:09,00:11:12,is that we're gonna play some of Anna's best bits.
00:11:12,00:11:13,And so--
00:11:13,00:11:13,- It's a very short show.
00:11:13,00:11:15,- It should be a very short show.
00:11:15,00:11:16,"So let's do a little bit now,"
00:11:16,00:11:18,beginning with President Garfield's anus.
00:11:18,00:11:21,(upbeat music)
00:11:21,00:11:26,"- Okay, fact number two, Anna, this one's yours."
00:11:26,00:11:29,"- Yeah, so for the last month of his life,"
00:11:29,00:11:32,US President James Garfield ate everything
00:11:32,00:11:33,through his anus.
00:11:33,00:11:36,(all laughing)
00:11:36,00:11:38,- We will get letters from a lot of people here.
00:11:38,00:11:40,- That is mine.
00:11:40,00:11:41,"Yeah, I mean, I wasn't there,"
00:11:41,00:11:43,but this is what the doctors tell me.
00:11:43,00:11:46,(all laughing)
00:11:46,00:11:48,"No, so James Garfield was, as everyone obviously knows,"
00:11:48,00:11:53,"shot in July, 1881, and he lived for a further 80 days."
00:11:53,00:11:56,"He was shot in the small, in the, like, small of his back"
00:11:56,00:11:56,and once in the arm.
00:11:56,00:11:59,So doctors now say he would have been at our hospital
00:11:59,00:12:01,about two or three days later.
00:12:01,00:12:05,"But obviously, 'cause medicine was not quite as advanced"
00:12:05,00:12:06,as it is now.
00:12:06,00:12:07,"In 1881, they just invited, like,"
00:12:07,00:12:09,dozens of doctors to his bedside
00:12:09,00:12:11,who all prodded around trying to find this bullet.
00:12:11,00:12:14,They didn't know where the bullet had gone in his body.
00:12:14,00:12:16,"So they gathered around, prodded about,"
00:12:16,00:12:17,made him worse and worse.
00:12:17,00:12:18,He stopped being able to eat.
00:12:18,00:12:21,"And obviously, if you stop being able to consume food"
00:12:21,00:12:23,"in those days, they just shoved it up your arse."
00:12:23,00:12:24,And so that's what they did.
00:12:24,00:12:26,- So does that work?
00:12:26,00:12:27,"- It does not work, no."
00:12:27,00:12:29,It was widely discredited in the early 30s.
00:12:29,00:12:32,And I think you get about an eighth of the nutrition
00:12:32,00:12:33,from some of the food.
00:12:33,00:12:36,But there's some food that you can't absorb at all.
00:12:36,00:12:38,- What I love is the list of foods
00:12:38,00:12:40,that he was fed in his mother.
00:12:40,00:12:41,"- Oh, that's good, yeah."
00:12:41,00:12:45,"- Beef, bouillon, egg yolks, milk."
00:12:45,00:12:45,- Egg yolks.
00:12:45,00:12:46,- Egg yolks.
00:12:46,00:12:48,"- Wait a second, guys."
00:12:48,00:12:50,"Egg yolks, it was only true for a while."
00:12:50,00:12:51,'Cause I was reading the doctor at the time
00:12:51,00:12:52,his report on it.
00:12:52,00:12:54,"So yeah, he was fed egg yolks for a bit of time."
00:12:54,00:12:56,And then all the surgeons complained
00:12:56,00:12:59,that it was causing annoying and offensive plateaus.
00:12:59,00:13:02,And so they ceased feeding him egg yolks.
00:13:02,00:13:03,And it deprecated.
00:13:03,00:13:06,- So they stopped it because it was annoying them.
00:13:06,00:13:08,Not the other way around.
00:13:08,00:13:09,(laughing)
00:13:09,00:13:13,"Guys, I'd be quite happy to eat an egg with my mouth."
00:13:13,00:13:15,(laughing)
00:13:15,00:13:17,That's all right by you guys.
00:13:17,00:13:19,- Apparently it's illegal to move sheep in whales
00:13:19,00:13:21,until they've been checked to see
00:13:21,00:13:23,whether they carry traces of the fallout from Chernobyl.
00:13:23,00:13:24,- Really?
00:13:24,00:13:25,- Yeah.
00:13:25,00:13:25,"- On this particular subject,"
00:13:25,00:13:26,I have a question for you guys.
00:13:26,00:13:27,- Oh yeah?
00:13:27,00:13:31,- Why shouldn't you buy trousers from the Northern Ukraine?
00:13:31,00:13:31,- I don't know.
00:13:31,00:13:34,Why shouldn't you buy trousers from the Northern Ukraine?
00:13:34,00:13:35,- Chernobyl fallout.
00:13:35,00:13:38,(laughing)
00:13:38,00:13:41,"- Ladies and gentlemen, that is the joke."
00:13:41,00:13:42,"- Yeah, just so you know,"
00:13:42,00:13:45,just as a little inside bit of behind the scenes
00:13:45,00:13:49,"information here, Anna has consistently for the last,"
00:13:49,00:13:52,"what, 14 podcasts said that same joke"
00:13:52,00:13:54,and we've cut it out every single episode.
00:13:54,00:13:56,- Anna has refused to have it in the podcast.
00:13:56,00:13:57,- This is a day.
00:13:57,00:13:58,- And you will not hear it in this one either.
00:13:58,00:13:59,- Yeah.
00:13:59,00:14:00,- Unless someone else said it.
00:14:00,00:14:01,- It's the best joke ever.
00:14:01,00:14:05,"Ambrose Pare, who was a famous doctor in the 15th century,"
00:14:05,00:14:08,saw a beggar in Paris who was begging him for money
00:14:08,00:14:11,"and who did so by, I don't actually know if we can put this"
00:14:11,00:14:12,"out, it's so gross."
00:14:12,00:14:12,- Let's just say it anyway.
00:14:12,00:14:15,"- Who did so by, she begged by lifting her skirts"
00:14:15,00:14:18,to reveal a prolapsed rectum.
00:14:18,00:14:20,"It was a horrid sight, he says."
00:14:20,00:14:23,It was over half a foot long leaking pasta light fluid
00:14:23,00:14:24,over her legs and garments.
00:14:24,00:14:28,"But his companion then attacked the woman and said,"
00:14:28,00:14:30,"you're a big faker, you don't look sick enough"
00:14:30,00:14:31,to have a prolapsed rectum.
00:14:31,00:14:33,- You have to be pretty confident that you're right
00:14:33,00:14:33,in that situation.
00:14:33,00:14:38,"- Yeah, I know prolapsed rectums and that madame."
00:14:38,00:14:42,- He beat this woman to the ground and eventually
00:14:42,00:14:44,she was forced to reveal that it was actually
00:14:44,00:14:45,the prolapsed rectum of an ox.
00:14:45,00:14:47,But she put inside her some boxes.
00:14:47,00:14:49,- It was actually a prolapsed rectum.
00:14:49,00:14:50,"- It was, it wasn't prolapsed."
00:14:50,00:14:52,"- He felt pretty silly then, didn't he?"
00:14:52,00:14:55,(all laughing)
00:14:55,00:14:57,- That's not a human prolapsed rectum.
00:14:57,00:15:00,(all laughing)
00:15:00,00:15:02,It was the prolapsed rectum of an ox.
00:15:02,00:15:03,"- Yeah, she'd put up her own bum though."
00:15:03,00:15:05,"I think, oh my God."
00:15:05,00:15:09,- I think you've gone to the trouble of doing that.
00:15:09,00:15:11,I really think you've earned your 50 cents or whatever.
00:15:11,00:15:12,- Absolutely.
00:15:12,00:15:17,But the lifting of her skirts as well.
00:15:17,00:15:19,"She could just have a sign saying,"
00:15:19,00:15:21,"prolapsed rectum, please help."
00:15:22,00:15:24,"- Wait, so if you saw someone with a sign saying,"
00:15:24,00:15:26,(all laughing)
00:15:26,00:15:28,that's probably how she starts it.
00:15:28,00:15:30,"And she's like, no one is buying this at all."
00:15:30,00:15:33,- Except Andy.
00:15:33,00:15:35,"I can show it to you, no need."
00:15:35,00:15:36,Absolutely believe you.
00:15:36,00:15:40,"- The thing is though, I would pay,"
00:15:40,00:15:44,I would pay 50p not to see a prolapsed rectum.
00:15:44,00:15:46,- That is a fair point.
00:15:46,00:15:48,- She should have done that.
00:15:48,00:15:51,- We should move on.
00:15:51,00:15:53,"- When they were building the New York subway,"
00:15:53,00:15:56,the guys who were building it were called sand hogs
00:15:56,00:15:57,'cause they dug through lots of sand.
00:15:57,00:16:01,And I was reading a newspaper report from 1916
00:16:01,00:16:05,and it was about this guy called Marshall Mabee
00:16:05,00:16:09,who was working in the tunnel to dig the subway.
00:16:09,00:16:11,And there was a pocket of compressed air
00:16:11,00:16:13,which suddenly kind of escaped.
00:16:13,00:16:16,So he's got this big shield up in the tunnel in front of him
00:16:16,00:16:18,and they're using this shield to push forward
00:16:18,00:16:19,and make the tunnel bigger.
00:16:19,00:16:23,And he said he saw an 18-inch pocket of air suddenly appear
00:16:23,00:16:26,and it sucked him towards it.
00:16:26,00:16:27,He was sucked into it.
00:16:27,00:16:29,He was blasted up through the ground.
00:16:29,00:16:32,So he was blasted up through 12 feet of riverbed
00:16:32,00:16:35,and then blasted up through the river itself
00:16:35,00:16:38,and then hurled up 25 feet in the air above the river.
00:16:38,00:16:41,"- He wasn't grinding through earth, 12 feet of earth."
00:16:41,00:16:44,"- Yeah, that's what riverbed's made of."
00:16:44,00:16:47,"It's less, it's more plausible for him to be blasted"
00:16:47,00:16:49,through 12 feet of earth and 12 feet of concrete or steel
00:16:49,00:16:50,or whatever.
00:16:50,00:16:52,"No, no, no, I was thinking was it just a tunnel?"
00:16:52,00:16:54,Like it was a hole that he was blasted through.
00:16:54,00:16:56,"It just happened to be going, don't believe it."
00:16:56,00:16:57,"- So here we go, let me,"
00:16:57,00:16:59,there's a whole interview with him and everything.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"There's a nice interview with his wife saying,"
00:17:01,00:17:02,"it's okay, he's fine."
00:17:02,00:17:04,He's looking forward to going back to work.
00:17:04,00:17:07,This is what the New York Times said at the time.
00:17:07,00:17:09,There's a pocket of compressed air
00:17:09,00:17:12,to prevent the river's bottom from caving in.
00:17:12,00:17:14,"So they have some, God, I don't know how that works."
00:17:16,00:17:19,"- But somehow it happened, guys,"
00:17:19,00:17:21,and this compressed air got loose
00:17:21,00:17:24,and he saw an 18-inch hole
00:17:24,00:17:26,"and before he knew it, he was being sucked towards it."
00:17:26,00:17:28,Two of his colleagues actually also got sucked in
00:17:28,00:17:29,and they did perish.
00:17:29,00:17:32,"And he survived by blasting up,"
00:17:32,00:17:33,putting his arm out in front of him
00:17:33,00:17:35,and blasting up through the riverbed.
00:17:35,00:17:37,- I don't believe it.
00:17:37,00:17:42,- 12 feet of riverbed and then got shot through
00:17:42,00:17:44,and then out in the air.
00:17:44,00:17:45,"There's enough force left over,"
00:17:45,00:17:49,shot through the river itself and then you had 25 feet.
00:17:49,00:17:50,- 25 feet?
00:17:50,00:17:54,- The New York Times is a very retro.
00:17:54,00:17:56,- What year is it?
00:17:56,00:17:58,"- Yeah, and what date was this?"
00:17:58,00:18:03,"- February 1916, all right, not April."
00:18:03,00:18:07,"Yeah, it was a little bit insane,"
00:18:07,00:18:10,"but there you go, there's a picture of the guy."
00:18:10,00:18:12,Pictures don't lie.
00:18:12,00:18:13,"- What, mid-flight?"
00:18:13,00:18:14,"- No, not mid-flight."
00:18:14,00:18:16,(laughs)
00:18:16,00:18:17,- That's extraordinary.
00:18:17,00:18:18,- Did you say that was in New York?
00:18:18,00:18:20,"- Yeah, it was soft ground,"
00:18:20,00:18:21,so that's why they were called the sound.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"- Oh, well, if it was soft ground, I see, yeah."
00:18:24,00:18:25,"It was still a riverbed, though, wasn't it?"
00:18:25,00:18:28,- 25 feet after 12 beds of--
00:18:28,00:18:28,- And a river.
00:18:28,00:18:30,- And a river.
00:18:30,00:18:33,- I don't know how it possibly happened.
00:18:33,00:18:36,So there was a woman in South Korea recently
00:18:36,00:18:38,"who was eating squid, so we all eat squid."
00:18:38,00:18:41,"We call it calamari for reasons I don't understand,"
00:18:41,00:18:43,"but she was eating some boiled squid in a restaurant,"
00:18:43,00:18:46,"and she suddenly felt a pain in her tongue,"
00:18:46,00:18:48,"and it turned out the squid wasn't quite dead,"
00:18:48,00:18:49,"and it was a male squid,"
00:18:49,00:18:52,"and it had deposited its sperm packet into her tongue,"
00:18:52,00:18:53,"so she felt horrible pain in her tongue,"
00:18:53,00:18:55,and then felt lots of stuff crawling around
00:18:55,00:18:57,"inside her tongue, and had to go to hospital,"
00:18:57,00:19:00,and they took out a whole bunch of sperm.
00:19:00,00:19:01,"And apparently this does happen a bit,"
00:19:01,00:19:03,like there's been reports in Japan of it happening.
00:19:03,00:19:05,"- Oh, that's so fucked up."
00:19:05,00:19:09,I will never fucking do that shit again.
00:19:09,00:19:11,- Oh my god.
00:19:11,00:19:12,- Yeah.
00:19:12,00:19:12,- Fuck it now.
00:19:12,00:19:15,(all laughing)
00:19:15,00:19:16,- Fuck that.
00:19:16,00:19:19,(all laughing)
00:19:19,00:19:21,"- Ventritarianism, here you come."
00:19:21,00:19:22,- I don't think we've mentioned this before.
00:19:22,00:19:25,This year KFC have released a novel for the first time.
00:19:25,00:19:25,- What?
00:19:25,00:19:28,"- It's a novel starring the Colonel,"
00:19:28,00:19:30,"and it's a Milsen Boone-style romance,"
00:19:30,00:19:33,"and it's called ""Tender Wings of Desire."""
00:19:33,00:19:35,- He is a sexy man.
00:19:35,00:19:36,"- Well, we ascertained before we started"
00:19:36,00:19:38,recording this podcast that you quite fancy
00:19:38,00:19:39,Richard Nixon.
00:19:39,00:19:40,- Oh yeah.
00:19:40,00:19:42,- How did we miss that when we got to that?
00:19:42,00:19:43,- We didn't ascertain that.
00:19:43,00:19:45,That's warping of the truth.
00:19:45,00:19:46,"- Oh, I'm sorry."
00:19:46,00:19:50,"- I find him not unattractive, given that there was an incident."
00:19:50,00:19:52,"- But for Andy, that's pretty much someone saying"
00:19:52,00:19:53,you're attractive.
00:19:53,00:19:55,That's the best I can hope for these days.
00:19:55,00:19:57,- I'm not physically repulsed by him.
00:19:57,00:19:58,"Great, Dave."
00:19:58,00:20:02,"He said in an interview that something like,"
00:20:02,00:20:03,"""I know how I look."
00:20:03,00:20:05,"I'm under no illusions about my appearance,"
00:20:05,00:20:07,"so I'll have to be good in other ways."""
00:20:07,00:20:07,"And I read that interview,"
00:20:07,00:20:09,"and I thought, ""Well, he is good in other ways,"
00:20:09,00:20:10,isn't he?
00:20:10,00:20:14,"Lots of ways that Richard Nixon is a very good man."""
00:20:14,00:20:15,- What would you say your--
00:20:15,00:20:17,"- Yeah, what are your top five ways"
00:20:17,00:20:19,"where she's a great guy, Hannah?"
00:20:19,00:20:22,"- When British author William Haslitt died,"
00:20:22,00:20:26,his landlady was so keen to re-let his room
00:20:26,00:20:28,that she hid his body under the bed
00:20:28,00:20:30,while she showed new tenants around.
00:20:30,00:20:33,"- And he's still there under that bed, isn't he?"
00:20:33,00:20:36,"- He's still there, yeah."
00:20:36,00:20:37,"But he was a big deal,"
00:20:37,00:20:40,and people used to go just to the Haslitt Hotel
00:20:40,00:20:42,just because that's where he lived.
00:20:42,00:20:45,"Seamus Heaney used to go there, obsessed with him,"
00:20:45,00:20:46,and they would have meet-ups there
00:20:46,00:20:49,just to be able to be in the sort of presence
00:20:49,00:20:50,of the location of this great person
00:20:50,00:20:52,"who everyone seems to have forgotten,"
00:20:52,00:20:55,"except it turns out, you, Hannah, just--"
00:20:55,00:20:57,"- I mean, people know what him Haslitt is,"
00:20:57,00:20:59,but I did happen to take a book of his essays
00:20:59,00:21:01,"on my gap here, which I know is,"
00:21:01,00:21:04,"I just told these guys back stage, I know."
00:21:04,00:21:05,"One of those guys was gonna mention it,"
00:21:05,00:21:06,so I thought I'd get in there.
00:21:06,00:21:10,- Which drug were you taking when you were reading it?
00:21:10,00:21:13,"- The essays themselves were my drug, James."
00:21:13,00:21:18,- What am I on?
00:21:18,00:21:20,I'm on chapter three.
00:21:20,00:21:28,"- I mean, they didn't come in chapters, but whatever."
00:21:28,00:21:29,"- You know, in shopping centers"
00:21:29,00:21:31,where the fish eat your dead skin?
00:21:31,00:21:32,"- I've had that once,"
00:21:32,00:21:34,and all I could think while I was having it
00:21:34,00:21:36,was reincarnation and just looking
00:21:36,00:21:38,"at the guy, ""What the fuck did you do in your last life"
00:21:38,00:21:42,"""that you have come back to eat my feet?"""
00:21:42,00:21:43,- This is--
00:21:43,00:21:45,"- I had it once, and I think I've told you guys this,"
00:21:45,00:21:47,"but I had it once in Cambodia,"
00:21:47,00:21:50,"and they had to ask me to take my feet out of the pond,"
00:21:50,00:21:53,"'cause you put your feet in with like five other people,"
00:21:53,00:21:54,and my feet is so disgusting
00:21:54,00:21:56,"that they were all coming to my feet,"
00:21:56,00:21:59,and no one else was getting their money's worth.
00:21:59,00:22:02,(audience laughing)
00:22:02,00:22:04,"That's a real, real, actually low point."
00:22:04,00:22:05,(audience laughing)
00:22:05,00:22:07,"- Proud-wise, me."
00:22:07,00:22:09,(upbeat music)
00:22:09,00:22:17,"- Okay, it's time for fact number two about Anna Tyshinski,"
00:22:17,00:22:19,and that is Andy.
00:22:19,00:22:21,"- Well, my fact is a crowdsourced fact."
00:22:21,00:22:22,- Yeah.
00:22:22,00:22:25,"- So, as you know, there's a Discord."
00:22:25,00:22:26,"If you don't know Discord,"
00:22:26,00:22:28,it's a website where you chat about stuff.
00:22:28,00:22:30,Is that what it is?
00:22:30,00:22:33,- Why did you bother explaining if you have no idea?
00:22:33,00:22:35,"It's a forum, it's a forum to chat."
00:22:35,00:22:39,"There is a fish Discord, the fish cord,"
00:22:39,00:22:44,and as part of Anna's commemoration episode.
00:22:44,00:22:47,"- Morning, morning episode, I think, yeah."
00:22:47,00:22:49,"- Morning sickness, hi-o."
00:22:49,00:22:50,(laughing)
00:22:50,00:22:55,"Dan, I think you asked for some of Anna's best bits."
00:22:55,00:22:57,- Yeah.
00:22:57,00:22:59,"- And asked what listeners, you know,"
00:22:59,00:23:02,fish fans wanted to hear again.
00:23:02,00:23:03,"I mean, various bits."
00:23:03,00:23:06,- You can make a compilation of Anna saying her own surname.
00:23:06,00:23:07,- Correctly.
00:23:07,00:23:08,- When do you say your own surname?
00:23:08,00:23:10,"- Yeah, I don't know if you can make a compilation out of that."
00:23:10,00:23:13,- You can certainly make a compilation of the evolution
00:23:13,00:23:14,of my pronunciation of your surname.
00:23:14,00:23:17,"- Yeah, a lot of people got quite sad"
00:23:17,00:23:19,"when you evolved from pronouncing it,"
00:23:19,00:23:22,"well, as some people said wrongly, Tyshinski to Tyshinski."
00:23:22,00:23:25,"- Well, yeah, and I always say that it was a bit of a,"
00:23:25,00:23:27,it was a bit unfair on me because you were right here
00:23:27,00:23:30,"to tell me I was saying it wrong for about six years,"
00:23:30,00:23:31,and no one did.
00:23:31,00:23:34,"No one did, your dad didn't, your mom didn't,"
00:23:34,00:23:36,"anytime any of your family came to our show,"
00:23:36,00:23:37,"no one would say, by the way,"
00:23:37,00:23:38,do you think you might be able to pronounce
00:23:38,00:23:39,the surname correctly?
00:23:39,00:23:40,No one said anything.
00:23:40,00:23:42,"And yours was a surname that I specifically,"
00:23:42,00:23:45,"if I would say, like, next fact is James,"
00:23:45,00:23:48,"next fact is Andy, I would say next fact, Tyshinski."
00:23:48,00:23:50,I would always say your surname.
00:23:50,00:23:51,So it was always coming up.
00:23:51,00:23:53,"- But I think, do you remember them?"
00:23:53,00:23:54,"Oh, Larry really liked it."
00:23:54,00:23:58,"'Cause then he had the Schreiber and Tyshinski cops,"
00:23:58,00:24:00,maybe who were trying to find the president's anus.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"- To your cops, yeah, we got to get to the bottom"
00:24:02,00:24:04,"of this big laundry bill, Tyshinski."
00:24:04,00:24:07,"- Oh, nice, yeah."
00:24:07,00:24:08,What's your pronunciation?
00:24:08,00:24:11,"- I say Tyshinski, but you can also say Tyshinski,"
00:24:11,00:24:13,"or a lot of people do say Tyshinski,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,and it's weird that people assume that's the way
00:24:15,00:24:16,you could say it.
00:24:16,00:24:17,It's quite different starting with a chub.
00:24:17,00:24:18,"- It's P-T, yeah."
00:24:18,00:24:20,"You don't call it a charodactyl, do you?"
00:24:20,00:24:22,"- You don't, I don't know, or a charmigan."
00:24:22,00:24:26,But I should say for actual Polish listeners
00:24:26,00:24:29,"that it's Tyshinski, so you're supposed to say the P."
00:24:29,00:24:30,"So I don't pronounce it right, either."
00:24:30,00:24:31,"- Okay, there we go."
00:24:31,00:24:34,"- And I sort of should also be Ptazinska, 'cause I'm a girl."
00:24:34,00:24:34,"- Oh, no way."
00:24:34,00:24:35,- Wow.
00:24:35,00:24:36,- I am.
00:24:36,00:24:38,(laughing)
00:24:38,00:24:42,- I don't remember this suggestion for a clip to play.
00:24:42,00:24:46,"Episode 342, no such thing as a presidential fight club."
00:24:46,00:24:48,Anna refers to a child as a wimp because he had asthma.
00:24:48,00:24:50,"- And that child, ladies and gentlemen,"
00:24:50,00:24:52,"grew up to be a podcaster, Andrew Hudson."
00:24:52,00:24:55,(laughing)
00:24:55,00:24:57,- There's probably some context that I haven't seen
00:24:57,00:24:59,"in the reports of that myself,"
00:24:59,00:25:02,"and I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation,"
00:25:02,00:25:04,but I'm gonna refer it to a committee
00:25:04,00:25:06,that we will investigate.
00:25:06,00:25:08,- You'll end up being suspended for nine months.
00:25:08,00:25:10,"It's perfect, it's a perfect crime."
00:25:10,00:25:13,"So funny what people remember, like one person wrote,"
00:25:13,00:25:15,"""I can't remember which episode."""
00:25:15,00:25:16,"So this is them, like they've literally"
00:25:16,00:25:18,"bankless in their head, you can't remember which episode,"
00:25:18,00:25:22,"but Anna calling Matanus to Tunis, mootie tootie."
00:25:22,00:25:23,(laughing)
00:25:23,00:25:25,- Lives rent free in my brain.
00:25:25,00:25:27,Mootie tootie tootie tootie tootie tootie.
00:25:27,00:25:30,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:30,00:25:32,"- I don't remember this bit at all,"
00:25:32,00:25:33,and neither does the person who said it.
00:25:33,00:25:34,"I don't remember the episode,"
00:25:34,00:25:37,"but it was about some female animal drinking semen,"
00:25:37,00:25:39,"and Anna was like, yeah, relatable."
00:25:39,00:25:41,Sometimes the tap is just too far away.
00:25:41,00:25:43,(laughing)
00:25:43,00:25:45,Don't recall that.
00:25:45,00:25:50,"- Just a few times at uni, and a terrible hangover is,"
00:25:50,00:25:54,"there's a cut by the bed, what are you gonna do?"
00:25:54,00:25:59,"- Fill me up love before you go, but then do go."
00:25:59,00:26:01,(laughing)
00:26:01,00:26:05,"- Yeah, I mean, you've had a lot of feedback"
00:26:05,00:26:10,"about your kind of quite dirty-ish potty mouth,"
00:26:10,00:26:11,I would say.
00:26:11,00:26:13,- I feel like I'm the least potty.
00:26:13,00:26:15,- I think people just notice it more when you do it.
00:26:15,00:26:17,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:26:17,00:26:19,"- I think that's it, it's everyday sexism."
00:26:19,00:26:20,"- Well, actually, there's a bit of a debate,"
00:26:20,00:26:23,"even on the Discord about you, Anna."
00:26:23,00:26:24,"So, one person says,"
00:26:24,00:26:26,"if you go back and listen to the first year's episodes,"
00:26:26,00:26:28,"Anna's so restrained and polite in comparison,"
00:26:28,00:26:29,and then she gets comfortable
00:26:29,00:26:32,"and the sarcasm starts to flow, okay?"
00:26:32,00:26:33,"Now, someone has replied to that saying,"
00:26:33,00:26:36,"""I'm on episode 39, she has never been polite."""
00:26:36,00:26:37,(laughing)
00:26:37,00:26:39,"- I think there is one episode,"
00:26:39,00:26:42,"I remember editing it, where you're polite"
00:26:42,00:26:44,"for about two thirds of the episode,"
00:26:44,00:26:45,"and then for the final third of the episode,"
00:26:45,00:26:47,you just go completely off the rails.
00:26:47,00:26:48,- Really?
00:26:48,00:26:49,- And it was the episode when you drank
00:26:49,00:26:51,a pint of champagne before the show.
00:26:51,00:26:52,"- Oh no, God, that wasn't the only one,"
00:26:52,00:26:53,one of our first live shows.
00:26:53,00:26:55,"- I think it might have been our actual first live show,"
00:26:55,00:26:56,or maybe our second.
00:26:56,00:26:57,"- It was like, it was a Christmas one,"
00:26:57,00:26:58,and it was an Aces and Aces.
00:26:58,00:26:59,- Aces and Aces.
00:26:59,00:27:00,- In North London.
00:27:00,00:27:01,- That's right.
00:27:01,00:27:03,"- And you can really, you can pinpoint"
00:27:03,00:27:05,the exact second that the champagne hits.
00:27:05,00:27:08,- What's confusing is that I'm sure Dan and I
00:27:08,00:27:09,"drunk pints of champagne for that,"
00:27:09,00:27:12,and I also am sure that Dan
00:27:12,00:27:13,is more of a lightweight than I am.
00:27:13,00:27:15,"- Yeah, but the difference is"
00:27:15,00:27:17,that Dan is never coherent.
00:27:17,00:27:17,(laughing)
00:27:17,00:27:18,- You can't tell.
00:27:18,00:27:19,- Yes.
00:27:19,00:27:20,- That's a beauty.
00:27:20,00:27:22,"- Exactly, I'm bulletproof."
00:27:22,00:27:23,"- I'm drunk now, no one's noticed."
00:27:23,00:27:24,(laughing)
00:27:24,00:27:26,- Episode 261.
00:27:26,00:27:26,- Oh yeah.
00:27:26,00:27:28,- Dan's talking about Scott of the Antarctic
00:27:28,00:27:30,taking two gramophones with him.
00:27:30,00:27:32,"Anna, he was a fucking idiot, wasn't he?"
00:27:32,00:27:35,(laughing)
00:27:35,00:27:41,"- You gotta stand by that, it's not surprising he died."
00:27:41,00:27:43,"You know, he didn't take two gramophones."
00:27:43,00:27:43,Amundsen.
00:27:43,00:27:44,- Amundsen.
00:27:44,00:27:45,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:27:45,00:27:47,"Actually, I hate saying that name so much,"
00:27:47,00:27:48,I could never say it.
00:27:48,00:27:49,- You said it quite weird.
00:27:49,00:27:49,- I know.
00:27:49,00:27:50,- Amundsen.
00:27:50,00:27:51,- Amundsen.
00:27:51,00:27:52,- Amundsen.
00:27:52,00:27:53,(laughing)
00:27:53,00:27:55,- I don't know why I see it coming up in my head.
00:27:55,00:27:57,Is this how you feel down with all words?
00:27:57,00:27:59,"- Yeah, yeah, I do."
00:27:59,00:28:01,I see them coming up on the page
00:28:01,00:28:02,and you gotta make a decision.
00:28:02,00:28:04,"You're either gonna try and pronounce it correctly,"
00:28:04,00:28:06,"get it wrong, or, and check it out"
00:28:06,00:28:07,"and get it wrong just for that,"
00:28:07,00:28:10,or you just gotta run through it.
00:28:10,00:28:11,"You just gotta, you gotta."
00:28:11,00:28:15,"- It reminds me, and I know this is a podcast about Anna,"
00:28:15,00:28:18,"but it does remind me of the first audiobook that we did,"
00:28:18,00:28:19,(laughing)
00:28:19,00:28:21,which was just after you'd had your first baby
00:28:21,00:28:23,and were very short on sleep.
00:28:23,00:28:26,"And Dan kept pronouncing the word January, February."
00:28:26,00:28:28,(laughing)
00:28:28,00:28:29,- Like six times.
00:28:29,00:28:30,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:28:30,00:28:32,"- We were like, Dan, Dan, you said February."
00:28:32,00:28:33,Can you just do it again?
00:28:33,00:28:34,"- Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:28:34,00:28:36,"- Okay, here we go."
00:28:36,00:28:37,- February.
00:28:37,00:28:39,(laughing)
00:28:39,00:28:40,- It was remarkable.
00:28:40,00:28:41,It was really something.
00:28:41,00:28:43,"- And we had to change the whole article at the end,"
00:28:43,00:28:45,"didn't we, to something that happened in February?"
00:28:45,00:28:46,- I used to love those books
00:28:46,00:28:48,'cause they were the books of the year
00:28:48,00:28:50,and it was like things that happened
00:28:50,00:28:52,between January and December that year.
00:28:52,00:28:53,"Obviously, the book came out in November,"
00:28:53,00:28:57,so it's usually January to September or October.
00:28:57,00:28:58,But Andy used to always come in
00:28:58,00:29:01,with things that had happened the previous year.
00:29:01,00:29:03,"And Anna would be like, no, this was last year."
00:29:03,00:29:07,"And he's like, yeah, but it was late 20, come on, it was December."
00:29:07,00:29:08,- My reasoning here
00:29:08,00:29:10,is that you're doing one of these books a year.
00:29:10,00:29:13,Each book has to have a 12 month catchment area.
00:29:13,00:29:15,"It's the book of, not the calendar year,"
00:29:15,00:29:16,"not the calendar year,"
00:29:16,00:29:19,"but the, like the school year or the school year."
00:29:19,00:29:21,"- Yeah, the financial year."
00:29:21,00:29:22,"- That's right, the school year."
00:29:22,00:29:24,- You started in September.
00:29:24,00:29:24,"- Everyone understands,"
00:29:24,00:29:26,otherwise you're knocking out a third of your own material.
00:29:26,00:29:28,"- Why didn't we name it the book of the school year,"
00:29:28,00:29:29,actually?
00:29:29,00:29:30,(laughing)
00:29:30,00:29:31,- So honest.
00:29:31,00:29:32,- The book of the financial year
00:29:32,00:29:34,would have really set those sales rocketing.
00:29:34,00:29:35,- Yeah.
00:29:35,00:29:38,(laughing)
00:29:38,00:29:40,"- Have we got one last one, Andy or?"
00:29:40,00:29:41,- Anna is among the 10% of people
00:29:41,00:29:44,who can lick their own nose.
00:29:44,00:29:44,- What?
00:29:44,00:29:45,- Oh.
00:29:45,00:29:46,"- We did a, okay."
00:29:46,00:29:47,"- Oh my God, yeah."
00:29:47,00:29:48,"- She's doing it, she's doing it."
00:29:48,00:29:50,- We did a fact about Buddha
00:29:50,00:29:52,and how Buddha could stick his tongue through his ear.
00:29:52,00:29:54,"- Into his ear, that was it."
00:29:54,00:29:54,- Yeah.
00:29:54,00:29:57,- And then you showed us that.
00:29:57,00:29:58,- Yeah.
00:29:58,00:30:00,"- And had lots of other stuff that I don't have, though."
00:30:00,00:30:02,- Weird body part anomalies.
00:30:02,00:30:03,"I also actually have a lot,"
00:30:03,00:30:05,but they're less sort of magical than Buddha's.
00:30:05,00:30:07,And more like get medical help.
00:30:07,00:30:08,(laughing)
00:30:08,00:30:10,"- That's good though, touching your nose."
00:30:10,00:30:11,I can't do that.
00:30:11,00:30:12,- Your tongue barely gets out of your mouth.
00:30:12,00:30:14,- I think I'm tongue tied.
00:30:14,00:30:15,"- Oh, really?"
00:30:15,00:30:17,"- And that's why you're so bad at breastfeeding, isn't it?"
00:30:17,00:30:17,- Yes.
00:30:17,00:30:20,(laughing)
00:30:20,00:30:21,- But I'm still trying.
00:30:21,00:30:23,"- Yeah, good on you."
00:30:23,00:30:24,"- That's it, we'll get you there."
00:30:24,00:30:27,"- Oh, that's a bristly experience, Dan."
00:30:27,00:30:28,You're very bearded.
00:30:28,00:30:29,(laughing)
00:30:29,00:30:30,- That's so rough.
00:30:30,00:30:31,"- Yeah, it's not good for the--"
00:30:31,00:30:33,- It's because of breast and rash happening there.
00:30:33,00:30:35,- Highly sanded boobs up here there.
00:30:35,00:30:37,(laughing)
00:30:37,00:30:39,- The nipples almost gone all together.
00:30:39,00:30:41,(laughing)
00:30:41,00:30:44,"It's just a flat, floppy out potato."
00:30:44,00:30:45,(laughing)
00:30:45,00:30:48,- It's just a flat potato.
00:30:48,00:30:49,"- Can we have some more of Anna, please?"
00:30:49,00:30:50,(laughing)
00:30:50,00:30:51,Classic Czazinski.
00:30:51,00:30:54,"- Okay, well, I'll have a look on the archives."
00:30:54,00:30:55,Let's see if we can find some of the things
00:30:55,00:30:58,that you've mentioned in the next little Anna compilation.
00:30:58,00:31:01,(upbeat music)
00:31:01,00:31:07,- My fact is that the way to recognize the Buddha
00:31:07,00:31:09,"is to look out for his webbed feet,"
00:31:09,00:31:11,"a tongue that can reach his ears,"
00:31:11,00:31:13,and withdrawn genitalia.
00:31:13,00:31:15,- That's a good excuse on a date.
00:31:15,00:31:16,"- No, no, no, it's not small."
00:31:16,00:31:19,"I'm just, I'm the Buddha, I'm the reincarnated Buddha."
00:31:19,00:31:20,"- Oh yeah, then show me your tongue,"
00:31:20,00:31:21,'cause I could get on board with this.
00:31:21,00:31:24,(laughing)
00:31:24,00:31:30,"- I read that female beetles,"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"they quench their thirst through sex,"
00:31:32,00:31:36,"and it's because of the semen and the fluids in the semen,"
00:31:36,00:31:38,"'cause they get very dehydrated,"
00:31:38,00:31:39,"and so when they have sex,"
00:31:39,00:31:41,it's actually just like having a drink for them.
00:31:41,00:31:43,"- That's the reason we all do it, Dan."
00:31:43,00:31:46,(laughing)
00:31:46,00:31:48,- Sometimes the tap is too far away.
00:31:48,00:31:50,(laughing)
00:31:50,00:31:58,- A few people who were farmers
00:31:58,00:32:01,who were involved in castrating lambs
00:32:01,00:32:04,"when they were born got very ill very quickly,"
00:32:04,00:32:06,"and there was 12 people who got ill,"
00:32:06,00:32:08,but they worked out that two of them got ill
00:32:08,00:32:11,because they were castrating with an old method
00:32:11,00:32:13,"that still goes on these days,"
00:32:13,00:32:16,"not completely, but in the 1800s all the time."
00:32:16,00:32:18,"They castrate using their teeth,"
00:32:18,00:32:21,"so these are, yeah, these are humans who go,"
00:32:21,00:32:25,and two of these guys were castrating these lambs
00:32:25,00:32:27,"with their teeth, and they got very ill."
00:32:27,00:32:31,- One of my best friends has done that in Australia.
00:32:31,00:32:32,"- Really? - West Australia, yep."
00:32:32,00:32:33,- Did they get ill?
00:32:33,00:32:36,"- Well, he's pretty insane, but he's not sick."
00:32:36,00:32:38,"- What, I think he is sick, yeah."
00:32:38,00:32:39,(laughing)
00:32:39,00:32:40,"- And they go by on a conveyor belt, right,"
00:32:40,00:32:41,"and you lie underneath them,"
00:32:41,00:32:43,and you just whip him off on by one.
00:32:43,00:32:43,- What?
00:32:43,00:32:44,- Yeah.
00:32:44,00:32:45,"- Well, you come up like Jaws,"
00:32:45,00:32:48,like you just bite off their balls?
00:32:48,00:32:50,- Is your friend Australian?
00:32:50,00:32:51,- He lived in Australia for a year.
00:32:51,00:32:53,"- Well, he was British."
00:32:53,00:32:53,- Yeah.
00:32:53,00:32:55,"- Feels like they kind of saw him coming, didn't they?"
00:32:55,00:32:56,- Yeah.
00:32:56,00:32:58,"- Yeah, we all do this, mate."
00:32:58,00:33:00,(laughing)
00:33:00,00:33:03,- This guy looks like he'll bite the balls off anything.
00:33:03,00:33:06,- I just don't get wrestling.
00:33:06,00:33:07,- What?
00:33:07,00:33:08,- It doesn't make any sense to me.
00:33:08,00:33:09,"We've covered it before on this podcast,"
00:33:09,00:33:11,"and I find it impossible to research,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,"'cause everything you read about it,"
00:33:13,00:33:15,"you're like, is this real?"
00:33:15,00:33:16,Did this really happen?
00:33:16,00:33:21,The confusion of real sport and fake acting is bewildering.
00:33:21,00:33:24,"Like, there's this fight between him and Hulk Hogan,"
00:33:24,00:33:26,"which was this really famous fight,"
00:33:26,00:33:28,and apparently it was super controversial.
00:33:28,00:33:32,"It was in 1988, and there was a referee,"
00:33:32,00:33:35,"a famous referee called Dave Hebner,"
00:33:35,00:33:37,"who was refereed wrestling matches,"
00:33:37,00:33:39,and he happened to have an identical twin.
00:33:39,00:33:40,"- Oh, yes."
00:33:40,00:33:41,- And they tracked down for this match.
00:33:41,00:33:42,- The referee?
00:33:42,00:33:44,"- Yeah, the referee had an identical twin."
00:33:44,00:33:45,"- Okay, he didn't really, I think."
00:33:45,00:33:47,"- No, he did really."
00:33:47,00:33:50,"I've seen the actual pictures, either he did,"
00:33:50,00:33:52,"or there's some amazing Photoshopping going on,"
00:33:52,00:33:54,"but he had this identical twin,"
00:33:54,00:33:58,"and so, right, Andre the Giant's agent"
00:33:58,00:34:00,"got Dave, who was supposed to referee the match,"
00:34:00,00:34:04,"locked him in a cupboard, and then bribed Earl,"
00:34:04,00:34:07,"his identical twin, to referee the game instead,"
00:34:07,00:34:10,"and he did, and then he made Andre the Giant won,"
00:34:10,00:34:12,"and then Dave broke out of his closet,"
00:34:12,00:34:14,and then him and his identical twin brother
00:34:14,00:34:16,had a big fight afterwards in front of the crowd.
00:34:16,00:34:18,- This is the weirdest conversation.
00:34:18,00:34:21,- I really wanna hear Anna doing the Coventry of WWF.
00:34:21,00:34:23,- I don't understand any of this.
00:34:23,00:34:24,Is that real?
00:34:24,00:34:25,Oh my God.
00:34:25,00:34:28,"- But there's storylines, there's storylines."
00:34:28,00:34:30,"You go to the theater all the time,"
00:34:30,00:34:30,"are you standing up and going,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,"""What the fuck is going on here?"""
00:34:32,00:34:34,"- No, no, no, because in the write-ups of the theater,"
00:34:34,00:34:37,"it doesn't say, and there was an incredibly"
00:34:37,00:34:39,controversial moment when Hamlet's mother
00:34:39,00:34:43,"remarried Hamlet's uncle, and the audience couldn't,"
00:34:43,00:34:45,"you're like, ""Okay, this is a story."""
00:34:45,00:34:48,"There was in the Wikipedia page, there's this one."
00:34:48,00:34:51,"Was it controversial, or was it all made up?"
00:34:51,00:34:52,- It's all made up.
00:34:52,00:34:53,"- It's all made up, it's all made up."
00:34:53,00:34:55,- Then why is it controversial?
00:34:55,00:34:57,- It's controversial in the world of wrestling.
00:34:57,00:34:59,- Which is a fake world.
00:34:59,00:35:00,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:35:00,00:35:01,- Okay. - Now you're getting it.
00:35:01,00:35:04,(all laughing)
00:35:04,00:35:07,"- No, it is weird how it's presented as true."
00:35:07,00:35:09,"You know, normally it plays, there is a synopsis,"
00:35:09,00:35:11,"and normally when you go out of the play,"
00:35:11,00:35:13,the thing doesn't keep happening out.
00:35:13,00:35:15,"- No, but I just think it's amazing"
00:35:15,00:35:17,that we found the edge of Anna's comfort zone.
00:35:17,00:35:19,- Yeah.
00:35:19,00:35:20,- I never thought we'd get there.
00:35:20,00:35:23,- Who would know as pro wrestling is fake?
00:35:23,00:35:24,(all laughing)
00:35:24,00:35:26,- The town choir championships.
00:35:26,00:35:28,I just think this is so amazing
00:35:28,00:35:30,that these kind of things have the budget for this.
00:35:30,00:35:31,- I've been there once.
00:35:31,00:35:32,- What?
00:35:32,00:35:33,(all laughing)
00:35:33,00:35:34,- Did not place.
00:35:34,00:35:37,(all laughing)
00:35:37,00:35:39,(all laughing)
00:35:39,00:35:44,- What?
00:35:44,00:35:46,"Do you know where they were held, the last ones?"
00:35:46,00:35:48,- The one I went to was in either Lancashire
00:35:48,00:35:49,"or Yorkshire, I can't remember."
00:35:49,00:35:52,"- Cool, the last one was in Bermuda, so I feel like."
00:35:52,00:35:53,(all laughing)
00:35:53,00:35:55,- Do you ever get the feeling you chose the wrong year?
00:35:55,00:35:57,(all laughing)
00:35:57,00:35:59,"- I mean, who was paying for town choir, it's good."
00:35:59,00:36:01,"Anyway, this year, it's the first time a Brit"
00:36:01,00:36:03,has won the town choir championship.
00:36:03,00:36:05,It was very exciting.
00:36:05,00:36:08,- Mark Wiley beat off 24 other contestants.
00:36:08,00:36:11,(all laughing)
00:36:11,00:36:13,"- And they were like, ""Oh, yay!"""
00:36:13,00:36:16,(all laughing)
00:36:16,00:36:26,- It's one of the requirements these days.
00:36:26,00:36:28,(all laughing)
00:36:28,00:36:29,He actually said.
00:36:29,00:36:32,"- For legal reasons, we have to correct that."
00:36:32,00:36:34,(all laughing)
00:36:34,00:36:39,"- Sorry, so this guy won over and above"
00:36:39,00:36:42,24 other contestants.
00:36:42,00:36:46,"What he won was an awful lot of rum, he said."
00:36:46,00:36:47,(all laughing)
00:36:47,00:36:49,Which I needed for medicinal purposes.
00:36:49,00:36:51,He explained which is understandable
00:36:51,00:36:52,"after the trauma he'd undergone, so."
00:36:52,00:36:55,(all laughing)
00:36:55,00:37:03,"- Okay, it's time for fact number three,"
00:37:03,00:37:04,and that is my fact.
00:37:04,00:37:07,My fact this week is that we're sitting here
00:37:07,00:37:09,in the Covent Garden office.
00:37:09,00:37:11,"This is a important room to us,"
00:37:11,00:37:12,and it's the last time the four of us
00:37:12,00:37:15,are ever gonna be in this room together doing the podcast
00:37:15,00:37:18,'cause Anna's going off and the offices are moving.
00:37:18,00:37:20,But it's also important for another reason
00:37:20,00:37:24,"because in 2022, Anna and I set a Guinness World Record"
00:37:24,00:37:27,right here in this room.
00:37:27,00:37:30,We became the world record holders of the longest
00:37:30,00:37:32,anyone has ever played.
00:37:32,00:37:36,"Keep the balloon in the air, tennis game between two people."
00:37:36,00:37:37,- That was amazing. - In history.
00:37:37,00:37:39,"- I remember that three weeks when you were doing that,"
00:37:39,00:37:41,it was just 'cause we were coming
00:37:41,00:37:43,and we'd have to work around you.
00:37:43,00:37:44,- Record the podcast each week.
00:37:44,00:37:46,"- Oh my God, it was so hard."
00:37:46,00:37:46,"It was tough, wasn't it?"
00:37:46,00:37:48,- And not sleeping to that level.
00:37:48,00:37:50,"I mean, the amount of Red Bull that we had to."
00:37:50,00:37:52,"- Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah."
00:37:52,00:37:54,"By the third week, I just was really surprised"
00:37:54,00:37:55,you were still doing it.
00:37:55,00:37:58,"- Yeah, so that was the rehearsal."
00:37:58,00:38:00,"When we actually did it, it was 80 minutes"
00:38:00,00:38:03,"we lost it, 80 minutes for keeping a balloon in there."
00:38:03,00:38:04,- And do you still have that record?
00:38:04,00:38:05,- We've been beaten.
00:38:05,00:38:07,"- Oh no. - Yep, we've been beaten."
00:38:07,00:38:09,Someone beat us by eight seconds.
00:38:09,00:38:11,"With, I would argue, an unfair advantage."
00:38:11,00:38:13,They had a giant balloon.
00:38:13,00:38:14,It was like the size of a beach ball.
00:38:14,00:38:16,- It should be a restriction on balloon size.
00:38:16,00:38:17,"- Well, you should have read the small print."
00:38:17,00:38:19,"- I should have read the small print, yeah."
00:38:19,00:38:21,But one thing we did manage to do
00:38:21,00:38:25,is make it into a physical Guinness World Record book.
00:38:25,00:38:26,So there's a picture of me and Anna
00:38:26,00:38:28,in the Guinness World Records 2023.
00:38:28,00:38:30,"- That's not us, what?"
00:38:30,00:38:31,"- What, that's, that's-"
00:38:31,00:38:33,"- Oh there, sorry, I was gonna get that bloke below."
00:38:33,00:38:35,- Who was the chicken in your mind when I was-
00:38:35,00:38:36,(all laughing)
00:38:36,00:38:37,- That's your man holding a chicken.
00:38:37,00:38:40,"- What about, is that Irving Finkel above you?"
00:38:40,00:38:40,- That is Irving Finkel.
00:38:40,00:38:41,- And what does it say?
00:38:41,00:38:43,Oldest depiction of a ghost.
00:38:43,00:38:44,- Oldest depiction of a ghost.
00:38:44,00:38:46,"- You're really on the best page here, right?"
00:38:46,00:38:47,"- Well, what you'll notice as well"
00:38:47,00:38:49,is I'm responsible for that ghost
00:38:49,00:38:51,"getting the Guinness World Record, yeah."
00:38:51,00:38:51,- Tell us how.
00:38:51,00:38:55,"- I took Craig Glende, who is the Guinness World Records"
00:38:55,00:38:56,editor-in-chief to the British Museum
00:38:56,00:38:58,to meet the world's oldest ghost
00:38:58,00:38:59,to give it a Guinness World Record.
00:38:59,00:39:01,"- I wonder if you're the only person in that book, Dan,"
00:39:01,00:39:03,who's got two world records.
00:39:03,00:39:04,- And that's possible.
00:39:04,00:39:04,- Is Usain Bolt in there?
00:39:04,00:39:06,"- No, you can't claim the same world record"
00:39:06,00:39:07,as Irving Finkel.
00:39:07,00:39:08,You didn't find the oldest ghost.
00:39:08,00:39:10,"- No, no, I just got the oldest ghost."
00:39:10,00:39:11,"- I just, you know."
00:39:11,00:39:12,"- I'm sorry, Dan, can I just check this book?"
00:39:12,00:39:13,Can I just have a quick look at it?
00:39:13,00:39:16,"So this is, Guinness World Records 2023."
00:39:16,00:39:17,- Yeah.
00:39:17,00:39:18,- And it's about an event that happened in 2022.
00:39:18,00:39:19,- Yeah.
00:39:19,00:39:20,(all laughing)
00:39:20,00:39:22,- And this is maybe the most successful book in history.
00:39:22,00:39:23,(all laughing)
00:39:23,00:39:26,"- Oh, okay."
00:39:26,00:39:27,Maybe it's all right sometimes.
00:39:27,00:39:30,(all laughing)
00:39:30,00:39:32,"- Yeah, but so we did that."
00:39:32,00:39:33,We did that here in this room.
00:39:33,00:39:36,"- This ghost was depicted 2,500 years ago."
00:39:36,00:39:38,(all laughing)
00:39:38,00:39:40,"- Yes, yes, the world's oldest ghost"
00:39:40,00:39:41,is not going to have appeared in 2023.
00:39:41,00:39:44,(all laughing)
00:39:44,00:39:46,"But yeah, it's, and Anna, that's for you,"
00:39:46,00:39:47,'cause I know you don't have a copy.
00:39:47,00:39:49,"So I want you to have,"
00:39:49,00:39:50,because obviously you don't have a copy.
00:39:50,00:39:52,You're not interested in this kind of stuff.
00:39:52,00:39:54,"So yeah, so now we're forcing a copy onto you."
00:39:54,00:39:56,"- I mean, we did, we cheated, didn't we?"
00:39:56,00:39:58,"- We did cheat, we didn't cheat."
00:39:58,00:39:58,"- Oh, hello."
00:39:58,00:39:59,- What are you talking about?
00:39:59,00:40:00,We didn't cheat.
00:40:00,00:40:02,"- Well, we're friends with Craig, who's fantastic,"
00:40:02,00:40:04,"who organizes all the Guinness stuff,"
00:40:04,00:40:05,and he gave us a tip-off
00:40:05,00:40:07,"that no one's tried to break this category,"
00:40:07,00:40:09,but it is a category.
00:40:09,00:40:10,So as long as you get over an hour.
00:40:10,00:40:13,"So Ashley, we went for 20 minutes more than we needed to,"
00:40:13,00:40:14,"which showed a lot of commitment,"
00:40:14,00:40:16,'cause it was pub time by then.
00:40:16,00:40:19,"- It's right, yeah, and Anna drank the whole way through."
00:40:19,00:40:21,There's a big glass of wine in her hand.
00:40:21,00:40:23,"I think I had a beer, but it was,"
00:40:23,00:40:24,I can't quite remember now.
00:40:24,00:40:25,It was daunting.
00:40:25,00:40:26,It was very scary.
00:40:26,00:40:28,"It's very scary keeping a balloon in the air, wasn't it?"
00:40:28,00:40:29,"Do you remember the like, the-"
00:40:29,00:40:32,"- I'm sorry, what is riding on it really?"
00:40:32,00:40:33,"I mean, if you-"
00:40:33,00:40:36,- There was a bomb inside and it touches the ground.
00:40:36,00:40:38,"- You literally could've just tried again the next day,"
00:40:38,00:40:39,or the next hour.
00:40:39,00:40:41,"- Do you know how tedious it is,"
00:40:41,00:40:43,saying that we're just down Shriver for almost two hours.
00:40:43,00:40:45,(all laughing)
00:40:45,00:40:46,- The record should have been
00:40:46,00:40:48,the person who spent the most time with that Shriver.
00:40:48,00:40:50,(all laughing)
00:40:50,00:40:53,- Even the Goat pissed off after 20 minutes.
00:40:53,00:40:55,"I'll tell you what, there's been a lot of adventures"
00:40:55,00:40:57,"where Anna has been the kind of,"
00:40:57,00:41:01,"the butt of the story, I would say, to an extent."
00:41:01,00:41:02,Like Little Adventures.
00:41:02,00:41:04,- The Garfield Danes of the Stories.
00:41:04,00:41:06,"- The ass, we will be missing the ass soon."
00:41:06,00:41:07,- What are you talking about?
00:41:07,00:41:09,"- I just, I get a bit upset"
00:41:09,00:41:11,"because I wasn't there for some of my favorite ones,"
00:41:11,00:41:12,and James was.
00:41:12,00:41:14,"James, you two have had quite a few adventures."
00:41:14,00:41:16,"Well, there was the time that Anna flipped over"
00:41:16,00:41:18,"her bike by canal, knocked her teeth out,"
00:41:18,00:41:21,and you had to rescue her outside a pub because-
00:41:21,00:41:23,- I wouldn't say I rescued her.
00:41:23,00:41:24,I took her to the hospital.
00:41:24,00:41:26,"- Yeah, that was very nice of you"
00:41:26,00:41:27,"'cause they didn't have a phone on me or anything,"
00:41:27,00:41:29,and so I had to wait for a pass by to come.
00:41:29,00:41:30,- Who do you think knocked you off the bike?
00:41:30,00:41:34,(all laughing)
00:41:34,00:41:36,"- Well, can I just say on that?"
00:41:36,00:41:38,"'Cause it was quite funny, 'cause we're in A&E,"
00:41:38,00:41:41,"and we were just sat there waiting for you to be seen,"
00:41:41,00:41:43,"and you just come back from Ireland,"
00:41:43,00:41:46,"you've been on holiday in Ireland,"
00:41:46,00:41:48,"and you were telling me a story about what had happened,"
00:41:48,00:41:52,"and for some reason you'd upset someone who ran a shop,"
00:41:52,00:41:55,and you upset this woman so much
00:41:55,00:41:57,"that she started shouting at you, saying,"
00:41:57,00:41:59,"""Who the hell do you think you are?"""
00:41:59,00:42:01,"And when you told me the story,"
00:42:01,00:42:04,you said it in a really thick Irish accent.
00:42:04,00:42:05,- I could do it now.
00:42:05,00:42:07,"- Well, let's not do that, but you said it"
00:42:07,00:42:10,just as the doctor was coming from behind you
00:42:10,00:42:12,"to say, ""Anatoshinsky, where are you?"""
00:42:12,00:42:15,"And so all he saw was me and you,"
00:42:15,00:42:17,"you with your face covered in blood,"
00:42:17,00:42:20,"and you yelling at me, ""Who the hell do you think you are?"""
00:42:20,00:42:24,And we just looked like some kind of domestic abuse couple.
00:42:24,00:42:25,"- Oh, my God."
00:42:25,00:42:28,"- Yes, we're working on our issues."
00:42:28,00:42:32,"Just fix my jaw, let's get out of here."
00:42:32,00:42:34,- He would have heard then you go to an English accent
00:42:34,00:42:35,"and think, ""Okay, she's seriously wobbly,"
00:42:35,00:42:38,"something's happened, we need to keep her in."""
00:42:38,00:42:40,- You just gotta have foreign accents in real life.
00:42:40,00:42:40,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:42:40,00:42:41,- Who's the president?
00:42:41,00:42:43,"- Or the T-sock, you know."
00:42:43,00:42:45,(all laughing)
00:42:45,00:42:48,"- But the best story, and I don't know if you're gonna say it,"
00:42:48,00:42:49,"I just wanna tear it up and say,"
00:42:49,00:42:50,"""I hope you'll say it."""
00:42:50,00:42:53,"And it's the regret of my life, I wasn't there for it,"
00:42:53,00:42:56,is when James and Anna went to a university
00:42:56,00:43:00,"in order to tell the students Canterbury,"
00:43:00,00:43:01,"and you stayed the night in a hotel,"
00:43:01,00:43:03,and Anna got a bit drunk.
00:43:03,00:43:04,(all laughing)
00:43:04,00:43:05,- I don't think I should tell the story.
00:43:05,00:43:07,"- I should have, I don't know."
00:43:07,00:43:10,"- I'll tell you what I remember of it,"
00:43:10,00:43:13,"which is that James and I went and,"
00:43:13,00:43:16,"yeah, Alan Davies was doing a show at Canterbury."
00:43:16,00:43:17,You went to do something.
00:43:17,00:43:18,- I think he just got like an honorary degree
00:43:18,00:43:19,or something like that.
00:43:19,00:43:21,"- Yes, he had, and so he was being interviewed,"
00:43:21,00:43:22,and it was great.
00:43:22,00:43:25,And so we went for some moral support.
00:43:25,00:43:27,"Me, James, Alan, and--"
00:43:27,00:43:28,- John Lloyd?
00:43:28,00:43:29,- John Lloyd.
00:43:29,00:43:30,- Alan went to support himself.
00:43:30,00:43:31,(all laughing)
00:43:31,00:43:33,"Do you know what, I'm gonna come along for moral support."
00:43:33,00:43:35,- For moral support.
00:43:35,00:43:37,"- Afterwards, we had quite a lot to drink in some hotel bar,"
00:43:37,00:43:39,and we were staying in this place
00:43:39,00:43:42,"that was actually next to the cathedral, which was awesome."
00:43:42,00:43:44,"- It was almost like part of the cathedral, wasn't it?"
00:43:44,00:43:45,- It was kind of appended to it.
00:43:45,00:43:47,- Certainly a place where I wouldn't do anything.
00:43:47,00:43:49,(all laughing)
00:43:49,00:43:52,- God might judge adversely.
00:43:52,00:43:54,So great night.
00:43:54,00:43:55,"I guess at about three o'clock,"
00:43:55,00:43:57,"we sort of went to, we tried to bed,"
00:43:57,00:43:58,and I have this thing often.
00:43:58,00:43:59,- In the morning.
00:43:59,00:44:01,(all laughing)
00:44:01,00:44:02,Bloody hell.
00:44:02,00:44:03,I didn't know that.
00:44:03,00:44:06,"I thought it was all happened around 11 p.m., 11.30."
00:44:06,00:44:07,Three.
00:44:07,00:44:08,- Woo.
00:44:08,00:44:10,"And he's always stopped at that bit of the story,"
00:44:10,00:44:14,"just jaw on the floor, can't hear anything else."
00:44:14,00:44:15,"- Okay, go on, go on."
00:44:15,00:44:17,- So I really love looking round places
00:44:17,00:44:19,"and sneaking into places that maybe I'm not supposed to be in,"
00:44:19,00:44:22,"and like disuse rooms and buildings,"
00:44:22,00:44:24,"and sometimes use buildings, whatever."
00:44:24,00:44:26,"And so I wasn't really tired,"
00:44:26,00:44:29,and I thought I'd go for a wander.
00:44:29,00:44:31,"So I remember first of all,"
00:44:31,00:44:33,pushing open a lot of doors in my hotel corridor
00:44:33,00:44:34,to see what opened.
00:44:34,00:44:35,(all laughing)
00:44:35,00:44:37,Managing to get into a sort of weird garden
00:44:37,00:44:38,"out of a fire escape,"
00:44:38,00:44:42,"and then climbing over a fence into the cathedral,"
00:44:42,00:44:45,"kind of the cathedral, then wandering around there."
00:44:45,00:44:47,"And then what happens often with me is,"
00:44:47,00:44:48,"you're drunk and you're in this place,"
00:44:48,00:44:49,"you're not allowed to be in,"
00:44:49,00:44:51,"and you're like, ""Well, I guess I'll go back now."""
00:44:51,00:44:54,"So climbed back over the fence, went back upstairs,"
00:44:54,00:44:56,"and I pushed another door in the hotel,"
00:44:56,00:44:59,"and ended up in this lecture theater,"
00:44:59,00:45:01,"where I sort of fanied around for a bit,"
00:45:01,00:45:02,"looked in all the cupboards,"
00:45:02,00:45:05,trying to see what I could see really.
00:45:05,00:45:07,"- You found a lot of candy, didn't you?"
00:45:07,00:45:08,- I found a lot of sweets.
00:45:08,00:45:12,"I found a massive bag of different colored sweets,"
00:45:12,00:45:15,"and I thought what would be so amusing would be,"
00:45:15,00:45:17,"if I took these all back to my room,"
00:45:17,00:45:20,"and I just took all the green ones out,"
00:45:20,00:45:22,"and then I just put it back in the room,"
00:45:22,00:45:23,and that's when I freak the shit out
00:45:23,00:45:27,"of whoever comes to get the sweets next time,"
00:45:27,00:45:30,and also greens my favorite color of sweet.
00:45:30,00:45:32,So I spent about half an hour in my room
00:45:32,00:45:35,"with a huge bag, taking out all the green sweets."
00:45:35,00:45:38,"And then I went to put the bag of sweets back,"
00:45:38,00:45:41,because I don't want to just steal all people's sweets.
00:45:41,00:45:44,"And then as I was leaving the room,"
00:45:44,00:45:46,"having replaced the bag of sweets,"
00:45:46,00:45:48,I just saw this massive whiteboard
00:45:48,00:45:49,"at the front of the room,"
00:45:49,00:45:51,"and so I thought, okay, I'll just grab a marker pen."
00:45:51,00:45:55,"I grabbed a marker pen and I wrote in big letters,"
00:45:55,00:45:57,"yippee-ki-ay, motherfuckers,"
00:45:57,00:46:01,in capitals on this whiteboard.
00:46:01,00:46:03,"And then that was actually ideal timing,"
00:46:03,00:46:05,"because I heard someone coming down the corridor,"
00:46:05,00:46:08,"and doing a bit of a, ""Oi, and what are you doing?"""
00:46:08,00:46:10,"And so then I legged it and it was a member of staff,"
00:46:10,00:46:12,so I legged it back to my room and she sort of chased me.
00:46:12,00:46:15,"- So then you went to bed, right?"
00:46:15,00:46:17,I've been asleep this whole time.
00:46:17,00:46:19,"I woke up the next morning to check out,"
00:46:19,00:46:21,and you were like a naughty school girl
00:46:21,00:46:24,"sat in the corner of the reception,"
00:46:24,00:46:26,being bollocked by someone.
00:46:26,00:46:28,(laughing)
00:46:28,00:46:31,"- Yeah, it transpired."
00:46:31,00:46:33,"It was actually very unlucky,"
00:46:33,00:46:35,because it hadn't been a whiteboard.
00:46:35,00:46:38,It had been a built-in white screen
00:46:38,00:46:40,that was part of the wall.
00:46:40,00:46:40,(laughing)
00:46:40,00:46:45,"I'd written on it in indelible, unremovable ink,"
00:46:45,00:46:48,"in large letters, yippee-ki-ay, motherfuckers."
00:46:48,00:46:50,"A die-hard quote, oh, I do remember that from the night"
00:46:50,00:46:52,"before when I was chased by the security guard,"
00:46:52,00:46:54,"I was going, ""It's a quote from die-hard."""
00:46:54,00:46:56,(laughing)
00:46:56,00:46:57,"To excuse it, like, ""I'm not saying"
00:46:57,00:46:58,"""yippee-ki-ay, motherfuckers."""
00:46:58,00:47:00,It's a quote. - It's a quote.
00:47:00,00:47:02,"- Anyway, the push comes to shove."
00:47:02,00:47:06,"""The next morning, at 9 a.m., there was a church group"
00:47:06,00:47:07,"""who had booked that room."""
00:47:07,00:47:09,(laughing)
00:47:09,00:47:14,- That did seem to be the truth of the matter.
00:47:14,00:47:16,- They walked in.
00:47:16,00:47:19,- Someone desperately scrubbing off the bottom of the pot.
00:47:19,00:47:22,"- They couldn't scrub it off, they had to cover it up."
00:47:22,00:47:24,They had to cover it up with a curtain.
00:47:24,00:47:27,And I was charged a small amount of money
00:47:27,00:47:28,for the repairs to the room.
00:47:28,00:47:29,"- Less, in fact, probably,"
00:47:29,00:47:33,than one small bag of laundry in New York City.
00:47:33,00:47:34,Pretty good going.
00:47:34,00:47:37,"- It was the funniest thing that I've ever experienced,"
00:47:37,00:47:39,being on the train coming back
00:47:39,00:47:42,"and you having to ring up our boss to tell them,"
00:47:42,00:47:46,because I think it had come off the company credit cards
00:47:46,00:47:48,"or something, so you knew that they were gonna find out."
00:47:48,00:47:51,"- No, they told our accountant at work."
00:47:51,00:47:52,"So actually, the first thing I knew was,"
00:47:52,00:47:55,"just empathize for a minute with me, please."
00:47:55,00:47:57,I'd gone to bed incredibly drunk about four in the morning.
00:47:57,00:47:59,My phone rang at 8 a.m.
00:47:59,00:48:03,"and I saw it was Liz, our lovely accountant."
00:48:03,00:48:04,And imagine the heart sinking
00:48:04,00:48:06,when I saw Liz's name come up.
00:48:06,00:48:08,"I thought, I don't know what's happening."
00:48:08,00:48:09,(laughing)
00:48:09,00:48:12,"Huff and rumble, and yeah, I picked up"
00:48:12,00:48:14,and the hotel had indeed called her.
00:48:14,00:48:15,"Yeah, it was tough."
00:48:15,00:48:16,"I thought it was gonna be fired, actually."
00:48:16,00:48:17,"We laughed now, guys, but this could have been"
00:48:17,00:48:18,the end of the podcast.
00:48:18,00:48:20,"- 'Cause I remember pretty much all the way from,"
00:48:20,00:48:23,"like, let's say, well, for about half an hour"
00:48:23,00:48:24,"on the train back, you're like,"
00:48:24,00:48:26,"""I'm gonna get fired, what are we gonna do?"""
00:48:26,00:48:27,- Yeah.
00:48:27,00:48:27,"- There'll be no more podcasts,"
00:48:27,00:48:29,'cause I won't be able to do this anymore.
00:48:29,00:48:30,"- Yeah, yeah, I'm probably going to prison."
00:48:30,00:48:31,- Yeah.
00:48:31,00:48:32,- And to hell.
00:48:32,00:48:34,Let's not forget the cathedral's right next door.
00:48:34,00:48:35,- Yeah.
00:48:35,00:48:36,- It's the greatest story ever told.
00:48:36,00:48:39,"- Anyway, good luck getting those stories"
00:48:39,00:48:41,out of these so-called guests you're having on in my house.
00:48:41,00:48:43,(laughing)
00:48:43,00:48:45,Is there a pass going to do that?
00:48:45,00:48:46,"Yeah, she probably would."
00:48:46,00:48:48,She would have been up for it.
00:48:48,00:48:49,"- Oh, well, let's have, why don't we do"
00:48:49,00:48:52,"one more batch of ""Best of Anna"""
00:48:52,00:48:54,"and just hear a bit more from ""The Greatest Hits"""
00:48:54,00:48:56,"from the last nine years, Anna Tyshensky."
00:48:56,00:48:59,(upbeat music)
00:48:59,00:49:04,- I was having a look at the Reverend Richard Coles'
00:49:04,00:49:06,"autobiography, or biography."
00:49:06,00:49:08,"And he was saying, it was just a throwaway line"
00:49:08,00:49:09,that I then looked into.
00:49:09,00:49:13,"He was saying that a lot of vickers have funny names,"
00:49:13,00:49:16,and he was saying he knew someone who insisted
00:49:16,00:49:20,"on everyone, even bishops, calling them the Reverend Gazz."
00:49:20,00:49:21,"And so then I thought, ""I wonder what funny names"
00:49:21,00:49:23,"there have been in the church over the years?"""
00:49:23,00:49:26,"There's this blog, the blog of St. Chrysostom's church"
00:49:26,00:49:30,"in Manchester, and it's really good."
00:49:30,00:49:31,You know when people put proper effort
00:49:31,00:49:33,into quite an obscure thing?
00:49:33,00:49:35,And there's a piece on funny names of church leaders
00:49:35,00:49:38,"throughout history, and there are some such good ones."
00:49:38,00:49:42,"So I like this anecdote, which is Henry Joy Fiennes Clinton,"
00:49:42,00:49:44,"who was a rector in the early 20th century,"
00:49:44,00:49:46,"who went to see the Bishop of London,"
00:49:46,00:49:48,"and the bishop said, ""Take a chair, Clinton,"""
00:49:48,00:49:51,"to which he replied, ""It's Fiennes Clinton."""
00:49:51,00:49:54,"And the bishop said, ""In that case, take two."""
00:49:54,00:49:58,"And so it's just, I think that was funny from a bishop."
00:49:58,00:50:00,"Come on, it's a... It's Bishapuma."
00:50:00,00:50:02,"It's Bishapuma. It's Bishapuma, yeah."
00:50:02,00:50:04,"Okay, we won't get him on the podcast."
00:50:04,00:50:07,"Just this is his audition tape, and I thought..."
00:50:07,00:50:08,"Oh, no, come on, give us more zingers."
00:50:08,00:50:10,"Right, wow."
00:50:10,00:50:12,Okay.
00:50:12,00:50:13,"Okay, what about this?"
00:50:13,00:50:17,"The very Reverend Gonville-Obey French Baytag,"
00:50:17,00:50:22,but French is spelled with a small F and two of them.
00:50:22,00:50:25,Is that important for the anecdote?
00:50:25,00:50:28,There's no anecdote.
00:50:28,00:50:31,"It's just the word ""French"" spelled slightly differently."
00:50:31,00:50:36,"No, Anna, we want you to tell us every single one you've found."
00:50:36,00:50:38,This is literally all I've got now.
00:50:38,00:50:41,"It's just a super, not very amusing name."
00:50:41,00:50:44,"Okay, Father John Brabazan, Brabazan Loutha."
00:50:44,00:50:46,Come on. It's two Brabazans.
00:50:46,00:50:49,"Brabazan, Brabazan."
00:50:49,00:50:51,"Oh, my God, I'm just picturing Jimmy Carr"
00:50:51,00:50:53,at the Habersmith Apollo.
00:50:53,00:50:55,The next act is a fucking killer act.
00:50:55,00:50:57,She's got some amazing anecdotes.
00:50:57,00:51:00,"Anna Tashinsky, everybody."
00:51:00,00:51:03,Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
00:51:03,00:51:06,"We've got Father Page Turner, we've got Father Pickles."
00:51:06,00:51:10,"Page Turner, open with Page Turner."
00:51:10,00:51:12,That's great. Father Pickles is funny as well.
00:51:12,00:51:13,I'll reorder the set.
00:51:13,00:51:16,"Father Careful, Father Christmas."
00:51:16,00:51:18,Okay.
00:51:18,00:51:20,"So that's the one I should stick with, Father Christmas."
00:51:20,00:51:22,You don't think stick with any of it.
00:51:22,00:51:24,Okay.
00:51:24,00:51:26,Have you guys heard of St Andrew Undershaft?
00:51:26,00:51:28,LAUGHTER
00:51:28,00:51:29,I can't believe...
00:51:29,00:51:34,You just said a name way funnier than Anna's 20 minutes.
00:51:34,00:51:36,Just upstage the full day of work.
00:51:36,00:51:37,I'm so sorry.
00:51:37,00:51:39,"I've been delving into church, aren't I?"
00:51:39,00:51:40,I'm so sorry.
00:51:40,00:51:42,This is right under your nose the whole time.
00:51:42,00:51:46,"On the subject of people being allergic to things,"
00:51:46,00:51:48,I went on to...
00:51:48,00:51:52,I continued my search.
00:51:52,00:51:54,"And I went to Yahoo Answers,"
00:51:54,00:51:57,because people often ask questions.
00:51:57,00:52:00,The best site on the internet.
00:52:00,00:52:03,This was the question.
00:52:03,00:52:06,"So, ""My girlfriend is allergic to almost every animal"
00:52:06,00:52:08,"""you'd find in a petting zoo."
00:52:08,00:52:10,"""If she inhales air that is around a horse,"
00:52:10,00:52:12,"""she can be hospitalized."
00:52:12,00:52:15,"""Now, she loves giraffes."
00:52:15,00:52:17,"""Does anyone think she'd be allergic to them too?"
00:52:17,00:52:19,"""I was thinking of surprising her on her birthday"
00:52:19,00:52:22,"""with a trip to the local zoo to pet a giraffe."""
00:52:22,00:52:24,"And the reply, the top-rated reply,"
00:52:24,00:52:26,"because that's how it works on Yahoo Answers,"
00:52:26,00:52:28,"the most voted to reply,"
00:52:28,00:52:29,"""If she's allergic to almost every animal"
00:52:29,00:52:35,"""I guarantee you the zoo will contain more than just giraffes."
00:52:35,00:52:37,"""Why don't you do something less stupid?"""
00:52:37,00:52:40,LAUGHTER
00:52:40,00:52:42,"So, where did you take her in the end, then?"
00:52:42,00:52:43,"I did, I did."
00:52:43,00:52:47,LAUGHTER
00:52:47,00:52:52,Britain's leading female table tennis player
00:52:52,00:52:56,"is this woman, this girl, called Tintin Ho."
00:52:56,00:52:58,And do you guys...
00:52:58,00:52:59,Can you guess why she's called that?
00:52:59,00:53:01,"She's got a quiff, Tintin."
00:53:01,00:53:03,"That's why I was... No, I was thinking Tintin."
00:53:03,00:53:05,Got a small dog called Snowy.
00:53:05,00:53:08,"Confusingly, it's not related to the character of Tintin."
00:53:08,00:53:11,"Wait, she hangs out with an old fisherman called Captain Haddock."
00:53:11,00:53:13,"Again, it's not like a thing."
00:53:13,00:53:16,She has a pair of twins that she hangs out with
00:53:16,00:53:17,called the Thompson twins.
00:53:17,00:53:20,"You can't just stop us making Tintin jokes, Anna, immediately."
00:53:20,00:53:24,She's got her father is called Herge.
00:53:24,00:53:27,"Right, as I have made quite clear, it's not related to Tintin,"
00:53:27,00:53:30,and there must be other avenues you can pursue.
00:53:30,00:53:31,"She's Belgian, you know?"
00:53:31,00:53:33,"Right, I'm just going to tell you, OK?"
00:53:33,00:53:35,"No, no, no, no, no. I feel like we're close."
00:53:35,00:53:37,She's made up ten.
00:53:37,00:53:41,"Yeah, he's found something different, but incorrect."
00:53:41,00:53:45,"No, it's because her dad is obsessed with table tennis."
00:53:45,00:53:46,"And actually, that's kind of weird."
00:53:46,00:53:49,"Sorry, hang on. It's coming, it's coming."
00:53:49,00:53:53,I was so sure you were going to say her dad is obsessed with Tintin.
00:53:53,00:53:58,I wish I hadn't brought this up.
00:53:58,00:54:01,He's obsessed with table tennis.
00:54:01,00:54:05,And the initials of table tennis are TT.
00:54:05,00:54:09,"So we called her Tintin, and, in fact, her brother is called Ping."
00:54:09,00:54:12,And she said it was between her being called Tintin
00:54:12,00:54:14,and her being called Pong when she was born.
00:54:14,00:54:19,Wow. And so she says that she is delighted that she didn't get bombed.
00:54:19,00:54:22,You can't have two kids who call them Ping and Pong.
00:54:22,00:54:25,The social services will get involved.
00:54:25,00:54:27,You would think.
00:54:27,00:54:33,"Aber, in 1976, they had the number one spot for 39 weeks,"
00:54:33,00:54:36,"and after 12 weeks of it, their version of Top of the Pops"
00:54:36,00:54:38,"just stopped showing the music video,"
00:54:38,00:54:40,"because you've seen it for 12 weeks, guys."
00:54:40,00:54:42,"In Australia, that one. Yeah, fans absolutely rioted."
00:54:42,00:54:44,"And that was on the Australian version of Top of the Pops,"
00:54:44,00:54:46,which was called Countdown.
00:54:46,00:54:51,"Yeah. Well, when you say fans rioted, did I say rioted?"
00:54:51,00:54:52,"Yeah. I meant, ""were furious."""
00:54:52,00:54:58,One complaint was registered with the ABC.
00:54:58,00:55:01,"No, but generally, look, when they toured, one mother ran"
00:55:01,00:55:03,and she put her baby down on the road
00:55:03,00:55:06,so that their tour caravan would stop and she could get an autograph.
00:55:06,00:55:07,Whoa. Right.
00:55:07,00:55:10,"There was a hotel which cut up their bedsheets after they'd left,"
00:55:10,00:55:11,and they sold it via newspaper.
00:55:11,00:55:14,"Oh, they do that all the time. Yeah, they did that with the Beatles as well."
00:55:14,00:55:16,"Did they? I've got about six of them. Not the baby thing, though."
00:55:16,00:55:19,I just wanted you to know we will not succumb to that kind of blackmail.
00:55:19,00:55:21,"If there's a baby in front of our tour bus, we're going straight over it."
00:55:21,00:55:27,"Who knows fish policy, right?"
00:55:27,00:55:29,(LAUGHTER)
00:55:29,00:55:35,It's very important to get that clear from the outset.
00:55:35,00:55:37,That's good.
00:55:37,00:55:40,It's very controversial the way they vote in the Grammys.
00:55:40,00:55:41,"Oh, yeah."
00:55:41,00:55:44,"Because, well, until this year, it was super secret."
00:55:44,00:55:46,It sounds quite exciting.
00:55:46,00:55:48,"And I think what used to happen was,"
00:55:48,00:55:51,"winners were decided by this, like, 12,000 strong"
00:55:51,00:55:54,Recording Academy bunch of voters.
00:55:54,00:55:58,"But then, I think, partly because the awards just kept going so wrong,"
00:55:58,00:56:01,and they just kept giving it to weird people.
00:56:01,00:56:03,"They had to change the rules, and I think the straw that broke the camel's back"
00:56:03,00:56:08,"came in the early '90s when ""Album of the Year"" was up,"
00:56:08,00:56:11,"and Bruce Springsteen's ""Born in the USA"" was released,"
00:56:11,00:56:13,"and ""Princess Purple Rain"" was released,"
00:56:13,00:56:16,"and Lionel Richie's ""Can't Slow Down"" won."
00:56:16,00:56:19,"And everyone said, ""We don't like that. That's not as good as the other two."""
00:56:19,00:56:22,"And so they formed a secret committee,"
00:56:22,00:56:25,"which basically goes through all the 12,000 votes and takes out the duds."
00:56:25,00:56:29,"Because, actually, you would think that having a larger group, 12,000,"
00:56:29,00:56:32,"would be more likely to give you a democratic answer, right?"
00:56:32,00:56:33,Yeah.
00:56:33,00:56:36,"But a democratic answer isn't necessarily the best answer, James."
00:56:36,00:56:37,Is that not right?
00:56:37,00:56:45,"That's my view, and my one-way ticket to Russia has just come through."
00:56:45,00:56:47,"Anyway, people got quite pissed off by the secret committee"
00:56:47,00:56:49,"because no one knew how they voted or why they voted,"
00:56:49,00:56:52,"and there's someone called the Weekend, I think."
00:56:52,00:56:53,"Oh, the Weekend."
00:56:53,00:56:54,The Weekend.
00:56:54,00:56:55,"Oh, right."
00:56:55,00:56:57,"Well, it's spelled the Weekend."
00:56:57,00:56:58,"Yeah, yeah."
00:56:58,00:57:00,"Um, so..."
00:57:00,00:57:03,"This show has certainly weakened over the years, hasn't it?"
00:57:03,00:57:07,"Yeah, so it's spelled like Weekend, anyway, but without any."
00:57:07,00:57:08,"So, um, he..."
00:57:08,00:57:09,"Well, with two E's."
00:57:09,00:57:15,But not three.
00:57:15,00:57:18,"Anyway, the Weekend got annoyed that he hadn't got nominated."
00:57:18,00:57:20,I think it's pronounced the Weckend.
00:57:21,00:57:24,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Weekend."
00:57:24,00:57:25,I just...
00:57:25,00:57:29,I want a new podcast where we give Anna the name of all the partners
00:57:29,00:57:32,that are in the charts and see if she can pronounce them.
00:57:32,00:57:35,They've asked me to read out the nominations next year.
00:57:35,00:57:36,I'm quite nervous now.
00:57:36,00:57:38,Lil Nas the Tenth?
00:57:38,00:57:42,I didn't know there were nine other Lil Nases.
00:57:42,00:57:45,I know how to artificially inseminate a cow
00:57:45,00:57:47,based on researching for this podcast.
00:57:47,00:57:48,Cool.
00:57:48,00:57:51,"So, about 5% of dairy cows in this country,"
00:57:51,00:57:53,"when they have to be inseminated,"
00:57:53,00:57:56,they get inseminated just by semen rather than the actual bull.
00:57:56,00:57:58,"And for some reason, I found myself reading"
00:57:58,00:58:01,this really in-depth farmer's guide to how to do it.
00:58:01,00:58:04,"And what I didn't realise was, so you get a semen gun,"
00:58:04,00:58:07,which you put the semen in.
00:58:07,00:58:10,Imagine you bring your semen gun to a gunfight.
00:58:10,00:58:12,No!
00:58:12,00:58:14,Dammit.
00:58:14,00:58:17,"You bring your semen gun to the insemination fight,"
00:58:17,00:58:20,"but what you do is, you have to..."
00:58:20,00:58:23,"So, there are two entries into a cow."
00:58:23,00:58:25,"So, it's much like a human's..."
00:58:25,00:58:26,Yeah.
00:58:26,00:58:27,You've got the...
00:58:27,00:58:29,"Oh, sorry."
00:58:29,00:58:30,There are three now.
00:58:30,00:58:32,"Oh, sorry, there are three."
00:58:32,00:58:35,We're in Devon.
00:58:35,00:58:39,Something tells me you're not the biggest expert in this room
00:58:39,00:58:43,on the number of ways into a cow.
00:58:43,00:58:46,"I know that people in Devon know all these secret ways,"
00:58:46,00:58:49,but there are two entries...
00:58:49,00:58:52,"There are two entries into the back of a cow, officially."
00:58:52,00:58:56,"And so, you know, one is the rectum, as we all have."
00:58:56,00:58:59,"Stop, Professor. Let me write this down."
00:58:59,00:59:05,"Children, wouldn't you be quiet?"
00:59:05,00:59:08,"You've got the rectum, and then you've got the sex tubes,"
00:59:08,00:59:10,and they're different...
00:59:10,00:59:13,"All right, the cervix."
00:59:13,00:59:16,"But what you do is, amazingly, when you're inseminating a cow,"
00:59:16,00:59:18,"you obviously have to stick the gun in the cervix,"
00:59:18,00:59:21,but the way you navigate the gun
00:59:21,00:59:25,"into the uterine horns, as they're called,"
00:59:25,00:59:29,is you have to put your other arm that's not holding the gun
00:59:29,00:59:32,into the rectum.
00:59:32,00:59:35,"And so, it's so amazing."
00:59:35,00:59:37,"And they say you shove your arm into the rectum,"
00:59:37,00:59:39,"insert your arm into the rectum,"
00:59:39,00:59:42,get someone else to hold the cow's tail aside while you do this.
00:59:42,00:59:45,"No, it would be a bald farmer who tried using one foot"
00:59:45,00:59:48,to pin the cow's tail.
00:59:48,00:59:53,This is the worst game of Twister I've ever played.
00:59:53,01:00:00,"It says ""left hand sex tubes."""
01:00:00,01:00:03,"Anyway, look."
01:00:03,01:00:05,"It just feels like this lesson isn't going to end,"
01:00:05,01:00:08,so you essentially use your rectum arm
01:00:08,01:00:10,"to navigate your semen gun,"
01:00:10,01:00:13,"which is in the vaginal canal,"
01:00:13,01:00:15,and you push it through.
01:00:15,01:00:17,"So you've got your arm in the rectum,"
01:00:17,01:00:19,and it's pushing against the other canal
01:00:19,01:00:21,"so that it gets into the uterus,"
01:00:21,01:00:24,and it's called rectovaginal insemination.
01:00:24,01:00:27,And that's lesson over. Enjoy.
01:00:27,01:00:34,"Well, there we go."
01:00:34,01:00:38,"There it is, some of the best of Anna Tyshinski's best bits."
01:00:38,01:00:40,"I was trying to think, you know,"
01:00:40,01:00:44,"is there some way that we could keep a bit of you here, you know?"
01:00:44,01:00:46,"Oh, God, my God."
01:00:46,01:00:48,Is there some way...
01:00:48,01:00:50,We want her to give us the finger.
01:00:50,01:00:51,Give us the finger.
01:00:51,01:00:53,"Just in spirit, you know? Just in spirit."
01:00:53,01:00:55,She's been metaphorically giving everyone the finger
01:00:55,01:00:57,for the last nine years.
01:00:57,01:00:58,"I'll tell you what, though."
01:00:58,01:01:00,I thought hard about it.
01:01:00,01:01:02,"I thought, ""How do we keep a bit of Anna here?"""
01:01:02,01:01:03,And I worked it out.
01:01:03,01:01:05,I suddenly remembered the weirdest story
01:01:05,01:01:08,"I have ever heard involving Anna Tyshinski,"
01:01:08,01:01:10,and it is this.
01:01:10,01:01:13,"There was a Christmas party that Anna once went to,"
01:01:13,01:01:15,"and part of the party, they said,"
01:01:15,01:01:16,"""We're going to do a really fun thing."
01:01:16,01:01:17,We're going to do a raffle.
01:01:17,01:01:19,"You're just going to take a ticket,"
01:01:19,01:01:20,"and you're going to get a present,"
01:01:20,01:01:23,"so everyone bring a present so you can give it to someone."""
01:01:23,01:01:26,"So, I was talking to the friend today who I bumped into."
01:01:26,01:01:28,"She gave a scarf, for example."
01:01:28,01:01:29,Right.
01:01:29,01:01:30,"Yeah, normal things."
01:01:30,01:01:32,Normal things were handed around.
01:01:32,01:01:34,"This person, whose name is Lenny,"
01:01:34,01:01:37,received her number and received her prize in the raffle.
01:01:37,01:01:38,I never met Lenny.
01:01:38,01:01:41,And this is the prize that Anna had donated.
01:01:41,01:01:44,It is her teeth.
01:01:44,01:01:45,"Oh, my God!"
01:01:45,01:01:47,That fell out of her mouth.
01:01:47,01:01:50,Lenny hasn't treasured and kept the teeth.
01:01:50,01:01:51,WTS.
01:01:51,01:01:52,She has.
01:01:52,01:01:53,They're in her home.
01:01:53,01:01:55,I went to her home today to pick it up.
01:01:55,01:01:57,This is Lenny didn't know who Anna was.
01:01:57,01:01:59,"She opens up her present,"
01:01:59,01:02:02,and there are teeth from one of the other party members there.
01:02:02,01:02:04,Were these the teeth that got knocked out
01:02:04,01:02:06,when James went to get you from...
01:02:06,01:02:07,Yeah.
01:02:07,01:02:08,"Yeah, so these are the teeth."
01:02:08,01:02:09,They got removed.
01:02:09,01:02:11,I thought they were in the canal.
01:02:11,01:02:12,They're in the canal.
01:02:12,01:02:13,We weren't looking for them.
01:02:13,01:02:14,We did.
01:02:14,01:02:16,"The fully knocked out ones were in the canal,"
01:02:16,01:02:18,and they were the ones that had to get taken out later.
01:02:18,01:02:19,Bloody hell.
01:02:19,01:02:21,"Yeah, so Anna thought it'd be normal"
01:02:21,01:02:24,to give in a raffle prize her teeth away.
01:02:24,01:02:26,"Now, Polly, who is the partner of Lenny,"
01:02:26,01:02:28,tried to get rid of Anna's teeth to begin with
01:02:28,01:02:30,because she has a fear of teeth.
01:02:30,01:02:32,She literally hates the tapping of teeth.
01:02:32,01:02:35,It was the worst present that could have arrived into the house.
01:02:35,01:02:36,"But as a result,"
01:02:36,01:02:38,"for the last couple of years since they've had these teeth,"
01:02:38,01:02:42,Lenny hides your teeth all over the house to surprise Polly.
01:02:42,01:02:44,"If she goes to sleep, she'll put it under her pillow."
01:02:44,01:02:46,"If she's opening a pencil case,"
01:02:46,01:02:48,the teeth will be inside the pencil case.
01:02:48,01:02:50,"Reverse tooth fairy, basically."
01:02:50,01:02:53,"And then they almost got given away in another raffle very recently,"
01:02:53,01:02:56,but Lenny decided to keep them because she was having too much time.
01:02:56,01:02:59,"How much did you pay for those, and have you told your wife?"
01:03:00,01:03:03,"But so, now, while you're gone, you are here."
01:03:03,01:03:05,There'll be a bit of Anna's always with us.
01:03:05,01:03:08,What we're going to do is we're going to make Sarah Pasco put some of those.
01:03:08,01:03:10,"Every time there's a guest,"
01:03:10,01:03:12,we're going to make them shove them into their face.
01:03:12,01:03:14,"It's going to make the book all sound very weird, isn't it?"
01:03:14,01:03:16,But it's worth it to get a bit of me.
01:03:16,01:03:20,"Oh, well, I'm so honoured that my teeth have had such a life beyond me, actually."
01:03:20,01:03:21,I know. It's really exciting.
01:03:21,01:03:23,"It's a weird story, Dan."
01:03:23,01:03:24,That's a weird story.
01:03:24,01:03:25,"You're responsible too, Anna."
01:03:25,01:03:27,James is the only one who gets off Scott for it.
01:03:27,01:03:28,"No, actually, you were involved in the losing of the teeth."
01:03:28,01:03:29,What? I was not.
01:03:29,01:03:33,"I'm the only one here who doesn't have any involved with this mad,"
01:03:33,01:03:35,"batshit, teeth raffle story."
01:03:35,01:03:36,You will.
01:03:36,01:03:37,I won't.
01:03:37,01:03:39,You're the next chapter.
01:03:39,01:03:46,"Anyway, let's wrap up."
01:03:46,01:03:47,That is it.
01:03:47,01:03:48,That is all of our facts.
01:03:48,01:03:49,Thank you so much for listening.
01:03:49,01:03:53,If you want to get in contact with any of us about the weird ass stories
01:03:53,01:03:55,"that we've said over the course of this podcast,"
01:03:55,01:03:56,we can all be found on our Twitter accounts.
01:03:56,01:03:59,"I'm on @Sribeland, Andy at Andrew Hunter, and James."
01:03:59,01:04:00,"Hi, James Harkin."
01:04:00,01:04:01,And Anna.
01:04:01,01:04:02,"No, you don't say anything."
01:04:02,01:04:03,You're gone.
01:04:03,01:04:05,"Yeah, I mean, you can email ScottStackUI.com,"
01:04:05,01:04:07,but good luck me ever seeing it.
01:04:07,01:04:08,Yeah.
01:04:08,01:04:10,And you'll see it and do a good impersonation
01:04:10,01:04:11,"when you reply, right?"
01:04:11,01:04:12,"Yeah, that's right."
01:04:12,01:04:15,You'll be wearing the team every time you reply to an email.
01:04:15,01:04:18,I'll time the emails all to go out between 3 and 5 a.m.
01:04:18,01:04:21,"and everyone will end Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker."
01:04:23,01:04:26,"Yeah, we're going to our group account at no such thing."
01:04:26,01:04:29,And we'll be back again next week with a really exciting guest
01:04:29,01:04:31,"as part of our big rotation of awesome guests,"
01:04:31,01:04:33,starting with Sarah Pasco.
01:04:33,01:04:35,And we'll be back with that episode next week.
01:04:35,01:04:36,We'll see you then.
