00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things A Fish live from the Cheltenham Literature Festival with a very special guest.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.000
 It was our good friend Rachel Paris.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.100
 Yes, Rachel's been on the pot a few times before and she with that Cheltenham partly because she has a brilliant new book out.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.600
 It is a pride and prejudice sequel of sorts. It's all about Charlotte Lucas.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:33.600
 You might remember Marie's Mr Collins, Big Mistake and Rachel's book is called "Introducing Mrs Collins" and it's all about what happens next.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 And it reintroduces basically the whole cast of Pride and Pride but with a focus on Charlotte, Lucas, it's a really great book.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.600
 I've just finished reading it. So much fun. It's got a lot of really funny lines in it and it's exciting too.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 Any fans of Austin or Pride and Pride I think will really like it.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:01:01.600

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:14.600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Things A Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Cheltenham Literature Festival.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:26.600
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Rachel Paris.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:35.600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.600
 Starting with fact number one and that is Rachel.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:53.600
 Oh, right. My fact is, in 1764, the Earl of Sandwich read a long erotic poem out in the House of Lords as revenge for a fellow MP setting a baboon on him.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.600
 Quite a lot. That is an amazing fact. There's a lot of different components to that fact.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.600
 Lots to process. The Earl of Sandwich who invented the sandwiches of the same guy.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.600
 I don't know. He's the fourth Earl of Sandwich John Montague. Is it the right one?

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.600
 It was. I read into it.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.600
 So we name the sandwich after him, but it feels like we should name all this other stuff after him, really, doesn't it? It's more notable.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.600
 I think if an erotic poem was called a sandwich, it wouldn't be as sexy.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.600
 I think so. I just think the word sandwich is inherently cut to Dianne. You know, I just think it's...

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.600
 No, I disagree. Yes. It sounds like a three-person activity, doesn't it?

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.600
 It gets fired off the strictly tour. Let's just say that.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:49.600
 John Wilkes, who was an MP and went on to be famous for so much more important things than baboon prankery, and Thomas Potter wrote an essay on woman, which was a parody of Alexander Pope's essay on man.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.600
 Basically, they were all members of a thing called the Hellfire Club, of which there were lots of different iterations.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:03.600
 The Hellfire Clubs were very irreverent. They were blasphemous. That was the whole thing blasphemy and pranks.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:13.600
 One of the pranks that John Wilkes did was he got a baboon. Other accounts say it was a mandrill. Don't sue me.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.600
 And dressed it up and painted it up to look like the devil and released it at one of the meetings of the Hellfire Club.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.600
 It basically came for the Earl of Sandwich. The Earl of Sandwich kind of had a moment.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.600
 You would be scared if a baboon came at you. How dangerous is a baboon?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.600
 The thing is that he wasn't massively worried about it being a baboon. He genuinely thought it was the devil.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.600
 And obviously with his name Sandwich, meaning something so sexy, he obviously thought that the devil had come for him.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.600
 And he said when the baboon came right to his face, he said, "No, I'm just, I'm not as bad a sinner as all the other people here."

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600
 Oh really?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.600
 Yeah, he dumped his friends in it and said, "Look, he's much worse than me. Go and get him, devil."

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.600
 But it was a baboon, so it didn't have the capacity to. Or a mandrill.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.600
 Or a mandrill. But don't just say, but baboons can do a lot of damage.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.600
 I wasn't questioning it. I always sort of, it was a rhetorical question.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.600
 It's like, obviously, if you let a baboon loose in my house, I'm not going to just say, "Alright kids, have fun."

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.600
 It's like, how come no one got savaged is my question?

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:25.600
 I don't know what happened apart from the, yes, I'm saying I am but half a sinner and saying everyone else here is more, is worse than that.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:35.600
 But essentially, after that in the 1760s, Wilks, John Wilks and the Earl of Samuach, who had been great friends, then had fallen out after this event.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:43.600
 And so to get him back, John Wilks and Potter had written this, yeah, this erotic, sort of erotic satirical poem.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:53.600
 And Samuach, the Earl of Samuach tried to dobb him in, basically, in the House of Lords and he read it out in full, accusing him of seditious libel, and it worked.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.600
 And it's really rude, as well, has f-bombs in it, which you wouldn't think for the 1700s, but it does.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:10.600
 And what's weird is the subject of this piece was a courtesan in London called Fanny Murray.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.600
 Any relation?

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.600
 Yes.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.600
 So, Granny Fanny Murray, right?

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.600
 Granny Fanny, as we call it, yes.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.600
 She's the subject of this piece.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.600
 It's lucky that she rhymes so well that she's in this poem, isn't it?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:42.600
 But the Earl of Samuach, who was reading it out, actually had had an affair with Fanny Murray, so it was really odd because he was sort of reading about this woman who he secretly had had an affair with.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.600
 Wow. Rich seems. Rich seems. It's one of the dirty phrases that was in the poem, essentially.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.600
 Well, when the Earl was reading it out, there was one Lord who shouted for him to stop in the Chamber of the House of Lords.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.600
 So this is appalling, this is outrageous. The other Lord, they're all shouting, "Go on, go on. They wanted to hear a bit more of it."

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.600
 Wilkes fled to France, I believe, but it also, this incident, collapsed Samuach's reputation, too.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.600
 He had a really bad reputation for a long time after this.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.600
 He's an amazingly interesting guy. I don't know if you guys researched Samuach himself.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.600
 He was first Lord of the Admiralty on three separate occasions.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:27.600
 And his main job was improving the Navy, but the main means he had to do that was to show interesting models of ships to the King to try and interest him to LA.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.600
 So he just had to take him, like, he had to commission models of ships.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.600
 It feels like a job you were made for, I think.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.600
 I would absolutely love to do that. Your Majesty, I have some new Hornby stuff if we'd like to talk about the Railways.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:46.600
 He had to commission a model of the historic dockyards. They weren't historic at the time. They could just call the dockyards.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.600
 But yeah, he was once described the island of Samuach as looking like he was walking down both sides of the street at once.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.600
 What does that mean?

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.600
 What does it mean?

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.600
 I don't know what it means.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.600
 Yeah, I mean, for the 1700s, it's stunning.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.600
 Does it mean he was carpulant?

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.600
 I just think it meant he walked funny.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.600
 Oh, sort of mean he was a bit, or he was indecisive. It's okay.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.600
 I can't pass it.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:15.600
 Because I think he was. And actually Sandwich and Wilkes, if you look at those two as a pair, they really liked insults in each other.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.600
 And they did it in Parliament quite a lot.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.600
 So there's a really famous time when that happened, which was when Sandwich said to Wilkes,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.600
 "I don't know whether you'll die upon the gallows or I'll buy the pox."

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.600
 And Wilkes said, "That depends my Lord, whether I embrace your principles or your mistresses."

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.600
 So that's like a famous one.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.600
 Very good.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.600
 It's an absolute singer.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.600
 The others, you are a fat, greasy, unprincipled villain.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.600
 Not quite as much as it is.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600
 Not sophisticated.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.600
 Not sophisticated.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:52.600
 But Wilkes, one of the slurs they used to throw him was they used to say he was the ugliest man in England.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.600
 And he kind of ate mile M&M style leaned into that and quite, he owned it.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.600
 He used to say, "Yeah, but after half an hour with my face, that goes away and the charm comes through."

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.600
 And he also used to say that if there was a rival who was a good-looking man and they were both going for the same girl,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:16.600
 if he was given a month-long advantage, he could win her over if the other guy was then introduced.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.600
 But he needed a month.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.600
 And...

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:24.600
 I read that he was advised never to risk showing his face to a pregnant woman.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.600
 Wow.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.600
 Interesting.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.600
 But she'd get pregnant twice.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.600
 Oh!

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.600
 Baby!

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.600
 I want to tell you more about the Hellfire Club.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.600
 Of which there were several iterations.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.600
 And I think it's a cool name.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.600
 So different clubs were like, "We're the Hellfire Club as well."

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.600
 But the OG Hellfire Club was founded in 1718 by the Duke of Warton.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.600
 And then it was sort of carried on by Sir Francis Dashwood in the 1730s,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.600
 which is when the baboon incident and all of this was happening.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.600
 It wasn't really called the Hellfire Club at that point until later it was known

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.600
 as the Order of the Friars of St Francis of Wickham.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.600
 That is a really random half.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.600
 Yes.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.600
 I think it's quite Monty Python.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600
 Right, right, right.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600
 To call it that.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.600
 So they called it Francis after Francis Dashwood.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.600
 And they met in high Wickham in these sort of man-made caves,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.600
 which is where what I will keep referring to as the baboon incident happened.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600
 Right.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.600
 But it was very reverent.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.600
 They would like come to meetings dressed as members of the Bible for a laugh.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.600
 They hold like lured ceremonies.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.600
 They had orgies.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.600
 They got to mischiefs general.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.600
 And I like that the original Warton Hellfire Club was not a gentleman's club.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.600
 It accepted men and women equally.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.600
 Okay.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.600
 Quite progressive.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.600
 And its motto was, "Do what thou wilt?"

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.600
 Holy.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.600
 Very nice to Crowley.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.600
 Well, I think Granny Fanny used to go there as well, dressed as a nun,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.600
 because they used to get women to dress up as nuns.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.600
 I mean, she again, like what a spectacular figure.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.600
 She was so famous in her day.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.600
 She was written about by Casanova.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.600
 She was part of the Hellfire Club.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.600
 She was read out as part of a poem in Parliament.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.600
 Like Emma, he's Nelson's mistress.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.600
 Hamilton.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.600
 She was part of the famous Harris's list,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.600
 the sort of yellow pages of women of the night that was compiled in Covent Garden.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600
 Why are they yellow?

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.600
 They're yellow.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.600
 So this was a book that you could literally buy,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.600
 and it would tell you the address and the name of the women who were living in Central London,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.600
 who were sex workers, and they would all have a check for venereal disease

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.600
 ahead of being able to be put into the book, and they had to pay for their listing.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.600
 It's almost like the Edinburgh Fringe Guide.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.600
 You get a little blurb.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.600
 You pay your money to get that in there.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.600
 There didn't know photos at the time, but yeah.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.600
 And just on Wilkes, who was the other character you mentioned about Samwich.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.600
 So Wilkes became, you said that he went to France.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.600
 He had to flee to France.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.600
 Well, the reason was he had a paper like a journal called The North Britain.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.600
 And in issue number 45, he argued that they should change Parliament

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.600
 and change the way that democracy worked.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.600
 And everyone agreed, apart from the people in charge.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.600
 And it became this massive thing.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.600
 The number 45 became absolutely massive.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.600
 If you said 45, it meant that you were in a dissident and you were against the government.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.600
 And they tried to stop people from saying it.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.600
 People would write 45 on the walls.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.600
 Really?

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.600
 They would meet in groups of 45 and eat 45 dishes.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.600
 Oh.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.600
 When Wilkes was arrested, he was then released.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:40.600
 And the club drank 45 drinks to him between 7.45pm and 12.45am.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.600
 Wow.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.600
 Wow.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.600
 Yeah.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.600
 That's amazing.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.600
 One extra tiny little nugget about John Wilkes is that there's a few pubs in London

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600
 that carry his name.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.600
 There's one called The Three John's of which he is one of the three.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.600
 There's a statue you can see of him.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.600
 But also, he was the middle name of a presidential assassin.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.600
 John Wilkes Booth.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.600
 Oh, so he was.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.600
 The Wilkes was a tribute to him.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.600
 And many sources actually say that he's a distant relative.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.600
 Because I know Shari Booth, Tony Blair's wife,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.600
 is a distant relative of the John Wilkes Booth family as well.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.600
 Well, he supported the rebels in the American War of Independence.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.600
 That's right.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600
 Yeah.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600
 Who did?

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.600
 Wilkes.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.600
 Oh, really?

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600
 So maybe that's the factor.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.600
 I have a link to this.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.600
 Guess what?

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.600
 The Boston Tea Party, which, you know, many ways kicked off the American Revolution,

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.600
 contained sandwiches because the Earl of Sandwich was present.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.600
 What?

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.600
 How good is that?

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.600
 The Earl of Sandwich.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.600
 What do you mean it?

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.600
 It wasn't an actual tea party.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.600
 No, well, he was not an actual sandwich.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.600
 He was not such an idiot.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.600
 We need to walk around with this.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.600
 I got one of the M&S platters.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.600
 I hope you don't mind.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.600
 Some of it.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.600
 Some of it.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.600
 Got a shitload of Battenberg here.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.600
 M&S platters.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.600
 You're played to the Cheltenham crowd, aren't you?

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.600
 Can I get it?

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.600
 So, no, this is an audience fact.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.600
 He got emailed in by Jessica Ringoison.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.600
 So thank you so much, Jessica.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.600
 The Earl of Sandwich.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.600
 When he was First Lord of the Emeralds,

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.600
 he was in Boston when the Tea Party broke out.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.600
 I just think that's lovely.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.600
 He watched it from a window overlooking the waft.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.600
 How lovely.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.600
 Yeah.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.600
 Yeah.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600
 Okay.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600
 We need it.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.600
 Can I just say two tiny things?

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.600
 Just because what led me to talk about that erotic poem was

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.600
 I was looking at the rise of romanticcy.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.600
 And the Victorians were absolutely obsessed with

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600
 flagellation.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.600
 And I just wanted to tell you quickly that Algin and Swinburne wrote

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.600
 a 94 stanza poem in the Victorian era called Reginald's Flogging.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.600
 And also that John Camdenhotton wrote a comic opera

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.600
 called Lady Bumtickle's Rebels.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.600
 Oh.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.600
 And we don't mean the chocolate snack.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.600
 The delicious chocolate snack, don't we?

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.600
 Who knows?

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600
 Who knows?

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:51.600
 We do need to move on to our next facts, so let's do it.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.600
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.600
 And that is Andy.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.600
 My fact is that Japan's greatest ever prison escape artist

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:06.600
 escaped four times twice by using his own miso soup.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.600
 What?

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.600
 So this is the story of Yoshishiro Tori.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.600
 Oh, that's nice.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.600
 He was a prisoner and there was a prison in Japan

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.600
 which has made itself a museum.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.600
 Well, it was closed down as a prisoner then it became a museum.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.600
 It didn't just like vote among the inmates.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.600
 You're doing 20 to 25, but we could just be curators, couldn't we?

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.600
 It's nice, it's a nicer life.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.600
 So he was a Japanese man born in 1907.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.600
 As a young man, he got into trouble.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.600
 He fell in with a gang and during a robbery of a shop,

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.600
 one of the gang stabbed a shopkeeper who very sadly died.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.600
 Yoshishiro Tori always maintained he'd never actually committed that murder.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.600
 He was just part of the gang, but he was jailed.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.600
 And yet he launched this incredible career,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.600
 escaping from four different prisons.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.600
 Progressively harder prisons as well.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.600
 It's really interesting, but what's miso soup got to do with that?

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.600
 Well, I'm glad you asked me, James.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:07.600
 So he escaped the first couple of times just through slightly different methods.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.600
 I mean, they were both very impressive as well.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.600
 And we should say the details of this, they're a little bit hazy.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.600
 He has definitely become a folk hero in Japan.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.600
 There's a statue of him in the prison that he was kept in.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.600
 But prison number three, they thought, right, you've escaped from two hard prisons.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.600
 This is a nightmare.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.600
 And he was put in special extra heavy handcuffs that were impossible to get out of.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.600
 And every day, he would drip a little bit of his miso soup onto the cuffs.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.600
 And slowly, it would erode the handcuffs over time.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.600
 And eventually, after a couple of years of doing this, he managed to...

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.600
 Okay, it's a bit gross.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.600
 He dislocated his own shoulder, but that was necessary so he could get out of the incredibly narrow slot

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.600
 that the soup was delivered through.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.600
 What? I know. Wow. As I say, folk heroes, some of the details are hazy.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.600
 And he was gone.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.600
 And then, so they thought, right, this is a nightmare.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.600
 We're going to put you in a cell where there is one window, which is the size of your head.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.600
 Try getting out of that.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.600
 Because previously, he'd done a lot of great work getting through windows.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.600
 Make it smaller than his head.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.600
 It's a good point.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.600
 Well, he thought, "I'm going to reverse you personally this."

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.600
 He went upside down, and he had a miso soup bowl.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.600
 And he used that to dig his way out of the prison.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.600
 And eventually, he was given a shorter sentence.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.600
 The thing I like about the digging is that...

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:27.600
 So, Shawshank Redemption style, you've got to get rid of all of the rubble.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.600
 And apparently, to this day, they have no idea where he put any of it.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.600
 Eight it.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.600
 Did he... Oh, and there we go. Just a guess.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.600
 Yeah, a guess. Good guess.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.600
 I don't think it's the right guess.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.600
 That's a good one. It still happens.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.600
 Incredible daring escapes from Jail still happen.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.600
 There was one that happened in France nearly on very recently,

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.600
 where one prisoner left, and then they discovered that actually two had left.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.600
 And it's because a second prisoner had snuck himself into the laundry bag

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.600
 that the guy was carrying over his shoulder.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.600
 No.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.600
 That's so basic.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.600
 Yeah, just walked out with him.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.600
 This guy just in this Hessian kind of laundry bag hanging over his shoulder.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.600
 I think it was as simple as that.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:09.600
 I've got this slippery guy, Choi Gapbok, who had practiced yoga for 23 years.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.600
 He was arrested on suspicion of robbery.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.600
 This was relatively recent times.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.600
 It was put in a detention cell.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.600
 Stayed there for five days, and he applied skin ointment.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.600
 I don't know where he got skin ointment from.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.600
 It must have been very low security prison slash spa.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.600
 He put it on the upper part of his body and slipped out

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.600
 by squeezing through a tiny food slot, like you describe.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.600
 Oh, boy.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.600
 The entire escape took 34 seconds, apparently.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.600
 Wow.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.600
 And the space, in case you were wondering, he was five foot four.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:47.600
 The space was just under six inches tall and 18 inches wide.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.600
 Right.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.600
 What kind of food are they delivering?

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.600
 It requires such a tall--

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.600
 Maybe like a wedding cake?

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.600
 I know.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.600
 Is it what?

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.600
 Can the Tony?

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.600
 We will not collapse their souffleys for them.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.600
 Well, you have to get a whole one.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.600
 No, sir, why don't you put the sausage in sideways?

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.600
 I looked into other corrosive soups.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.600
 Oh, alterific.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.600
 So apparently, I couldn't--

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.600
 I don't have the scientific know-how to have understood

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.600
 all the articles I read.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.600
 But there seems to be an understanding

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.600
 that canned chicken noodle soup is corrosive to metals.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.600
 Even though it's in a metal--

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.600
 Yeah, because it starts to corrode the metal that it is inside.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.600
 And therefore, it can, after some years, be quite bad for you.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.600
 But I wonder if he'd use chicken noodle soup it might have worked as well.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.600
 Well, there is a prisoner who was called Juan Lopez.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:42.600
 And I don't think this is true, because the story is that he escaped

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.600
 a Mexican prison using his own salsa.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.600
 Again, too.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.600
 And that's to corrode the bars of his cell.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.600
 And actually, Mythbusters, the TV show, experimented with this.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.600
 And they found that only if you could consistently add electricity.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.600
 If you could use electrolysis, you could corrode the bars using the salsa.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.600
 But he probably didn't have access to that on the inside.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.600
 Right.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.600
 So that seems to not be true, I think.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.600
 Wow.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.600
 OK, here's a quiz for you.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.600
 Stephen J. Russell, American con artist, sense prison.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.600
 He escaped using a green felt tip.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.600
 What did he do?

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.600
 Oh.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.600
 He colored his food and said, this is so badly off

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.600
 that I'm going to need to pass it back through the food slot.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.600
 And they disguised himself as a sausage.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.600
 Yes.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:38.600
 Did he use the felt tip and to make some part of his body look really ill?

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.600
 Oh, that's good.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.600
 Yes.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.600
 That's good, but not quite right.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.600
 Not quite right.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.600
 He had a white jumpsuit and he colored it in green

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.600
 and disguised himself as a doctor and walked out.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.600
 No.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.600
 Wow.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.600
 How much of that ink was in that pen?

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.600
 I get like two minutes out of a highlighter.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.600
 That's pretty impressive.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.600
 Check this guy out.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.600
 This is a phenomenal one.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.600
 There was a prison in America, which was known to be escape proof.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.600
 21st of July, 1971, a guy called Warren George Briggs escapes from it.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.600
 And four other people help him to get out.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.600
 Bullets are fired at them and he manages to escape.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.600
 He eventually turns himself in and he says the only reason that he escaped it

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.600
 is because he wanted to get some press, some PR for the fact that while inside jail

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.600
 he had invented and developed a water desalting process

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.600
 that would enable mankind to purify sea water at a reasonable price.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.600
 And he was like, no one's listening to me.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.600
 So I'm going to escape this inescapable jail and all the headlines are going to say,

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.600
 man escapes, but invent water source.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.600
 And did it work?

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.600
 Did his thing work?

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.600
 There's been no further story about Warren George Briggs.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.600
 Superb.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:53.600
 One of the archetypes of one of the places that is most famous for escapes

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.600
 is Colditz, the German castle during the Second World War,

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.600
 which was where lots of people were put and was supposedly escape proof

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.600
 and it's where lots of people who had escaped other places were sent.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.600
 Sorry to interrupt.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.600
 Like all these prisons, like stop calling them escape proof.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.600
 You can't escape, it's like calling boats unsinkable.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.600
 Like really, you're tempting fate.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.600
 You're so right.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.600
 And Colditz was a terrible place to try and keep prisoners

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.600
 at 700 rooms.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.600
 It was this huge, like it was really quite hard to defend, I would say.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.600
 And it had to have its own escape committee,

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.600
 because so many of the men in there were plotting their own escapes.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.600
 And they had to basically say, you can't escape on Tuesday.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.600
 Terry's escaping on Tuesday.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.600
 You can go Thursday 9/15 to 9/30.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.600
 But don't go over 9/30, because Barry's getting out.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.600
 And it just, some officers, this is really interesting.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.600
 Let's see if you can work out why.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.600
 Pretended to escape.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.600
 They only pretended to escape Colditz.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.600
 To see what would happen, what the punishment would be if they got caught.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.600
 Not quite.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.600
 Oh, wait, nice guess.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.600
 So they pretended as if they hid in the jail.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.600
 So then they thought he's escaped.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.600
 And then they stopped looking for him within the jail.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.600
 And then he could get a highlighter and draw all over.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.600
 You're close.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.600
 They escaped and they hid within the jail.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.600
 Yeah, within Colditz.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.600
 Rachel, do you want to have a guess?

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.600
 No.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.600
 All right.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.600
 So the reasoning was, they were escaped and then hide.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.600
 More TV quizzes should just have that as an answer.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.600
 Basically, they escaped and then they hid.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.600
 So that when a different officer actually did escape,

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.600
 the hiders would pretend to be the actual escapee

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.600
 so that they could delay their discovery.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.600
 So no one was looking for the guy who had actually escaped

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.600
 because they thought he was still there.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.600
 Right.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.600
 OK.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.600
 It feels like still only one person's escaped.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.600
 Well, look, we won the war in the end.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.600
 That's the main thing.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.600
 Can I tell you what toilets are used for in American prisons?

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.600
 Apart from the obvious.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.600
 Is it going to be a contraband thing?

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.600
 It's not.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.600
 So this is quite a few different facilities in America,

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.600
 especially Union County jail in New Jersey,

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.600
 which is where I read about it.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.600
 And some prisoners are flirting with each other using their toilets.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.600
 And what they do is they take all of the water out

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.600
 and they say, "This one's not for normal use."

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.600
 And then it's attached to all of the pipes

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.600
 and so you can yell into it.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.600
 And then people in another cell can hear what you're saying.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.600
 Romeo.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.600
 And apparently you have one cell where everyone knows

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.600
 that's the place people go for the flirting.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.600
 Like if there's, let's say, that the men's wing is on one part

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.600
 and the women's wing is somewhere else, but they're attached.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.600
 Oh, OK.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.600
 So one man would go in here, one woman would go in there,

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.600
 and they had like a special knock.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.600
 So you know that it's your particular girlfriend or boyfriend.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.600
 Oh, wow.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.600
 And yeah, this is the thing that's happening in America right now.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.600
 And it's not just they have phone sex through the toilets.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.600
 Sorry, James, how do you do phone sex through a toilet?

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.600
 Do you know all the stuff that I said a bit ago

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.600
 about how they're using it like a phone?

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.600
 Oh, OK.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.600
 No, I thought you were then introducing a phone

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.600
 as like an extra thing.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.600
 Got it.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.600
 So how will you pick phone sexes?

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.600
 You actually introduce the phone sometimes.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.600
 Actually, prism phones do have to be introduced to get them

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.600
 onto the premises.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.600
 So that's--

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.600
 I would've done on this, but you mean just spoken sex.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.600
 Well, shout it.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.600
 Shout it into it.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.600
 Shout it out.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.600
 No, no, no, no, no.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.600
 I do Rachel drink sex with my wife.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.600
 Go, honey, have you seen the new iPhone?

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.600
 She's got this new feature.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.600
 OK, so they talk, yeah.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.600
 Talk sex.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.600
 They talk sex, he works with each other.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.600
 And they also carry out religious conversions.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.600
 They pass news.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.600
 News.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.600
 What?

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.600
 You don't want to mistake it, the phone exchange,

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.600
 when that's happening to you.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:45.600
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.600
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.600
 And that is James.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.600
 OK, my fact this week is that one of Britain's greatest

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.600
 living playwrights, Tom Stoppard, wrote the final draft

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.600
 of the movie, "Bate Hulvin."

00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.600
 There you go.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.600
 So, yeah, this is Tom Stoppard, great playwright.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.600
 And he does a lot of work on the side for movies.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.600
 It turns out, which I didn't know.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.600
 He has polished scripts for 102 Dalmatians,

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.600
 Indiana Jones and the last Crusade.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.600
 And one very exciting thing that I found about

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.600
 when looking through an inventory of his papers in America

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.600
 is that I don't know if he wrote the final script,

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.600
 but he definitely did some work on Stoppard,

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.600
 my mum will shoot.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.600
 Oh, no.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.600
 Friend of the podcast.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.600
 Our white whale of a film.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.600
 Oh, absolutely.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.600
 Yeah.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.600
 But he basically says that he finds the work frustrating,

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.600
 but in a certain time wasting.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.600
 But at the end of the day, you have to wear money somehow.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.600
 And these, when you're doing it for a very big movie,

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.600
 so he worked on Indiana Jones, for instance,

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.600
 he earns an awful lot of money for it.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.600
 So much that you can't really turn it down.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.600
 Yeah, and it's not even just polishing scripts.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.600
 Like, for example, he was in the shower one day,

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.600
 and his phone was ringing and he jumped out,

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.600
 and it was Steven Spielberg, and Spielberg was like,

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.600
 "I'm filming Schindler's List right now,

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.600
 and this scene doesn't work.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.600
 What would you do in this situation?"

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.600
 And he would go, you know,

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.600
 so he's like standing naked in his shower room,

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.600
 solving problems while they're on set.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.600
 And that was part of the gig as well,

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.600
 that they would just go to him as a brain.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.600
 Is he the only person to have worked on both Schindler's List

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.600
 and Stoppard, my mum will shoot?

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.600
 It can't be a long list.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.600
 That's not going to be a huge list, no.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.600
 But we should say, so, Beethoven is a classic of the '90s.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.600
 I'm sure some of you've seen it.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.600
 The dog is a real comic character,

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.600
 full of pratfalls, making life hell for the dad of the family.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.600
 He's like, what would you call that?

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.600
 St. Bernard dog.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.600
 Yeah, it's a St. Bernard dog, and he's always like,

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.600
 if he runs, he ruins the whole house.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:51.600
 The dog that was used was a descendant of Buster Keaton's own dog.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.600
 So Buster Keaton had a dog,

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.600
 and his wife Eleanor started breeding them,

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.600
 and these St. Bernard dogs then became the stars,

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.600
 and stunt doubles of Beethoven the movie.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.600
 They have them one best picture, of course.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.600
 What? What?

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.600
 At the American Humane Society Awards,

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.600
 for outstanding words which raised public awareness of animal issues.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.600
 Other winners include Babe, Black Beauty,

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.600
 Free Willy and Chicken Run.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.600
 Do you know what? Those are all good films.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.600
 They are, in 2011, this best picture to raise awareness

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.600
 of animal issues was won by how to train your dragon.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.600
 [laughter]

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.600
 A thin year.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.600
 A thin year.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.600
 And 2012, it was won by Rise of the Planet of the Apes.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.600
 Oh, which I think is a documentary about the Earl of Sandwich, isn't it?

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.600
 But actually, Beethoven's second,

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.600
 so there have been five, actually, I think eight Beethoven movies.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.600
 But there's Beethoven, Beethoven's second,

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.600
 Beethoven's third, Beethoven's fourth,

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.600
 Beethoven's fifth.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.600
 And you kind of got the feeling that they had to do that

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.600
 to get the Beethoven's fifth joke.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.600
 That's why they did all those.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.600
 But Beethoven's second was nominated for an Academy Award.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.600
 It was.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.600
 In the category.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.600
 [laughter]

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.600
 Best dog. No, it was a best song, best original song,

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.600
 or a dolly cut and song that's in that.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.600
 Wow, that's very exciting.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.600
 Tom Back to Tom Stopbard for a second.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.600
 He wrote a play, which was called The Real Thing,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.600
 and in 2014, there was a revival of The Real Thing,

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.600
 put on stage, which he was part of,

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.600
 and you and McGregor was the lead role in it.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.600
 And during an interview, someone said,

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.600
 "Wow, what's it like working with you and McGregor again?"

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.600
 And he said, "I don't know, I've never worked with you and McGregor before."

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.600
 And he said, "No, you have."

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.600
 You did a rewrite of Star Wars Episode 3, Revenge of the Sith.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.600
 And you would have ridden some Jedi dialogue for you and McGregor.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.600
 I did look up some of the lines from that film

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.600
 just to see if any of them have the stop-hard magic.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.600
 What about the droid attack on the wookies?

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.600
 It feels like him.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:01.600
 I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.600
 Clearly stop-hard.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.600
 What stop-hardian is in the OED,

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.600
 but I never read any Tom Stop-hard.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.600
 So what is his genre? It's kind of witty.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.600
 I don't, yeah, they're brilliantly sort of funny and clever.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.600
 And for a long time, people accused him of being,

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.600
 as a ten-man of British theatre,

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.600
 because he was writing plays that were intellectually stimulating,

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.600
 but didn't kind of captivate the emotions.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.600
 I've been in the same room as him once,

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.600
 and it was so exciting.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.600
 It was really genuinely exciting.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.600
 It was the day my first ever book had come out.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.600
 And my publisher took me to dinner after the launch party,

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.600
 and it was so exciting.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.600
 And Tom Stop-hard was at a nearby table hanging out with other famous people.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.600
 I thought, "This is my life from now on. I haven't seen him since."

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.600
 I just haven't seen him since.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.600
 Did you read out those lines from Revenge of the Sith?

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.600
 His head snapped around, his eyes light up, yeah.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.600
 No, no, no.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.600
 The practice of someone taking a pass at a film script

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.600
 is quite common in Hollywood, isn't it?

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.600
 And I know there have been lots of comedy films in Hollywood

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.600
 where they've actually been offered up

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.600
 to like every British comedian I know has taken a crack

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.600
 at a few modern film scripts.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.600
 Really?

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.600
 I've done, I've had a cracker.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.600
 Oh, yeah. What are you doing?

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.600
 I'll tell you afterwards.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.600
 Oh, come on.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.600
 I don't think I got any lines in.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.600
 But I know there was like, there was one that was made recently,

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:21.600
 there was a Christmas film that I know at least 10 comedians

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.600
 who had a crack at it.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.600
 Really?

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.600
 So just adding extra lines to it?

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, submitting them and they see if they like them more.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.600
 But I wanted to tell you about one not related to Stop-hard

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.600
 that is close to my heart because my book is all about Charlotte Lucas

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.600
 from Pride and Prejudice.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.600
 And Emma Thompson famously wrote the amazing screenplay

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.600
 of sense and sensibility.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.600
 But she took a pass at the 2005 Pride and Prejudice.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.600
 And the line that became a meme that Charlotte Lucas says,

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.600
 she says, I'm 27 years old.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.600
 I've no money and no prospects.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.600
 I'm already a burden to my parents.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.600
 And I'm frightened.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.600
 And Emma Thompson wrote those lines.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.600
 Joe Wright, the director said he went to Emma Thompson said,

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.600
 can you help?

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.600
 And she said, get a notebook out.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.600
 Write this down.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.600
 And she just improvised those lines.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.600
 Wow, wow.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.600
 Yeah, that apparently among Gen Zed and millennials has become a massive meme

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.600
 for like very hard relate.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.600
 I'm 27 years old.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.600
 I've no money and no prospects.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.600
 I'm already a burden to my parents.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.600
 And I'm frightened.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.600
 That's so good.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.600
 Can I tell you one of the greatest script doctors of all time?

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.600
 Yeah.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.600
 Because lots of people, Carrie Fisher was a great she worked on loads.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.600
 Roll Dal did a little bit on you only live twice, which I find interesting.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.600
 El Ron Hubbard of the Church of Scientology founder of.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.600
 Oh, that one.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.600
 Thanks for clarifying.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.600
 So there's this really bad film called Battlefield Earth.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.600
 John Travolta.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.600
 John Travolta.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.600
 Now, Hubbard had written a book called Battlefield Earth.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.600
 And it's about aliens.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.600
 It's a saga of the year 3000.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.600
 It's a thousand pages long.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.600
 It's lightweight for real SF fans.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.600
 But he really wanted it to be a movie.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.600
 Travolta loved it, was a Scientologist.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.600
 Now Travolta really wanted to make it.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.600
 And a writer called JD Shapiro got attached to the project.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.600
 And he wrote a script.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.600
 And he got a load of script notes.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.600
 And he said, these come right from the top.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.600
 I mean, they come from El Ron Hubbard.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.600
 The interesting thing about it is, Hubbard had died about ten years before.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.600
 So as far as I could tell, the only posthumous script doctor.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.600
 Very cool.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.600
 Very cool.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.600
 Do you know the script doctoring work of M. Knight Shyamalan?

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.600
 So he wrote the sixth sense, that incredible movie.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.600
 And then that kind of plot twist reveal became kind of his signature move, right?

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.600
 So Signs was another movie of his--

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.600
 The Village.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.600
 The Village, exactly.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.600
 But he was also trying to make it as a writer.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.600
 And so had to do a lot of different projects.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.600
 At the same time, while he was doing the sixth sense.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.600
 So in the same year, he then had a movie come out in December.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.600
 His follow-up movie with his name on the credits.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.600
 And that movie was...

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.600
 Stuart Little.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.600
 Can you believe that about the cartoon mouse?

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.600
 Well, it's not cartoon.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.600
 Well, I guess it's a normal movie with animated mouse as the other lead character.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.600
 And all the humans are dead at the end.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.600
 Sorry?

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.600
 And all the humans were dead all that time.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.600
 It was, yeah.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.600
 Well, he also, he did the script doctoring for She's All That.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600
 I don't remember.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.600
 Do you remember Rachel Lee Cook?

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:37.600
 She's an incredibly hideous woman because she wears glasses.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.600
 What if she--

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.600
 If you spend half an hour with her, that wears off.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.600
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.600
 The charm begins to come through.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.600
 But classic M Night Shyamalan plot twist, she takes the glasses off.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.600
 And suddenly, she's really beautiful.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.600
 And...

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.600
 Have you ever tried that done?

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.600
 You need to wear a red dress as well.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.600
 Yeah.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.600
 Yeah.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.600
 I think-- do we have to move on there?

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.600
 We do have to move on there.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.600
 We do have to move on there.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.600
 Just going back to Tom Stophard, very briefly.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.600
 He became massive when he wrote Rosencrantz and Gilden Stern at Dead.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.600
 It's basically two characters from Hamlet and it's their story.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.600
 And I didn't know this.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.600
 It premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1966.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.600
 But it was absolutely massive there.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.600
 And then he went to London and it was absolutely massive there.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.600
 And then it went to New York.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.600
 And at the New York Premier, a journalist asked him, what is it about?

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.600
 And he said, it's about to make me a lot of money.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.600
 [laughter]

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.600
 And he was a journalist at the Bristol Evening Post when it debuted.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.600
 That's how he'd been making his living.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.600
 And again, this is an example of his amazing lines.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.600
 An editor tried to catch him out.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.600
 His news editor tried to catch him out because he said he was interested in current affairs.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.600
 And the editor said, all right, well, who's the current home secretary?

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.600
 And Stophard said, I said I was interested in politics, not obsessed by them.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.600
 [laughter]

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.600
 That's very good of us.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:59.600
 [music]

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.600
 Let's move on to our final fact.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.600
 Okay, it is time for our final fact.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.600
 And that is my fact.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:11.600
 My fact this week is, old jobs in the UK that you used to be able to do,

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:18.600
 included but-woman, baller, boner, and bottom-stainer.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:25.600
 Now, this is from the back end of a book that is called "Craftland" by James Fox,

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.600
 who was actually here at the festival earlier today doing a talk.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.600
 He did a 12 p.m. today.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:36.600
 He's released this book where he's looking into craft jobs that are either endangered in the modern world

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.600
 or people that are just carrying on with it and that we might not know about.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:46.600
 But it includes an index of all of these jobs that he says are on the brink of extinction or endangered.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.600
 I think in the case of the ones I just read, they must be basically-

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.600
 Can you tell us what they do?

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.600
 Like, what is a boner?

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.600
 A boner.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:59.600
 Okay, so a boner used to be someone who would be the insertor of whale bones into a corset.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.600
 So when you were building a corset, yeah, that used to be used to help give it-

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.600
 And, but-woman, that sounds like it's the female version of Butman.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:12.600
 Yeah, and-well, it's the seller of flatfish on a key side.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.600
 Yeah, but-well, okay.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.600
 What's a boner?

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.600
 A boner is someone who would check, let's say if you were working in textiles,

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.600
 you would check the balls of wool in advance of spinning.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.600
 So you would go around and go, "Yep, nice ball."

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:30.600
 Dan, as you're explaining that, you're doing like really egregious hand gestures

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.600
 that don't match up with what your words say.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.600
 It's just-for the room, yeah.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.600
 For all of us, yeah.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.600
 Could you give us some gestures for bottom stator?

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:46.600
 That would be putting a stain on a bottom of a boot or a shoe.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.600
 I also had a bump.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.600
 So this isn't to do with craft exactly, but bummer-y.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.600
 Oh, what's bummer-y?

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.600
 I think bummer-y.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.600
 So with a doubly at the end, which I just think sounds delightful.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.600
 Describe in 1875, this great burly fellows with bluff faces,

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:07.600
 deep chests, and still deeper voices with a smack of the watermelon about them,

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:11.600
 and a faculty for mental arithmetic, which is perfectly surprising,

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.600
 there's the words of James Greenwood.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.600
 It was a middle man on a fish market.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.600
 Usually, I think the term was attached to Billingsgate fish market, particularly.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.600
 So it was like a commerce, but it was like a retail position, basically.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.600
 But in fish, specifically.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.600
 But they obviously had this reputation for being big, burly, bluff men.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.600
 Yeah, nice. Very cool.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.600
 I mean, it's such an interesting world, the world of craft land.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.600
 This book, by the way, I'll just give a shout out to Francesca at the Margate Bookshop

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.600
 who told me about this amazing bookshop, if you haven't that bit of the country.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:45.600
 She showed it to me, and basically it covers 280 crafts that are still practice in Britain.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.600
 But what was noticed by James Fox is that half of them or more are endangered.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:54.600
 So we're sort of losing, we're getting down to the final person who is able to do certain things.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:00.600
 And there's an example that he gives of one person who is able to tune English church bells.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:05.600
 He's called Gidda Vad Hooker, and while he's doing it, he writes little things on each bell,

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.600
 almost like little mottos on it to sort of give it something extra.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.600
 Yeah, so like he'll write on, for example, on one of the bells, or...

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.600
 Don't. And he should write Tom.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.600
 Absolutely.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.600
 I've run out.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.600
 Bung and Bing. Oh, for God's idiot.

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, God.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.600
 There's a list, isn't there, of heritage crafts that are endangered?

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:33.600
 There's a list of ones that have gone completely now, and there's a list of ones that are endangered,

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:38.600
 which means there's only one or maybe two people in the country who do it.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:45.600
 So in the UK, there are only one or two people who make arrows, bells, musical bows,

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:53.600
 clogs, fans, gloves, pianos, ballet shoes, sauce, scissors, clay pipes, glass eyes, watches and horse whips.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:58.600
 So if we get cut off from the rest of the world, what's of those can we not do without?

00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.600
 Scissors.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.600
 Scissors is going to be tough. Ballet shoes, probably fine.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:07.600
 Yeah, horse whips will improvise, but scissors are fiddly.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.600
 Glass eyes?

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.600
 Oh, you don't want access.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.600
 Yeah, you never know when you need one.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.600
 Well, it's scary, scary stuff.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:19.600
 I went today to see a guy called Andy Peters, who is the only person in the UK

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.600
 who makes the wooden figure heads for boats.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.600
 Oh.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.600
 Which feels like something we could probably do without.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.600
 No, we can't.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.600
 Did you tell that to him to his face?

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:36.600
 Well, my thought was like people were doing this in the olden days, right?

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:41.600
 And it takes him like five months to make one of these things.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.600
 How do you make money like that?

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.600
 Because it's not like everyone needs one.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.600
 Pirates will pay a fortune.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.600
 An arm and a leg.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.600
 Thank you.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.600
 I haven't seen the new aircraft carriers that we've got.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.600
 Have they got some of Andy Peters' work up front?

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.600
 No, they haven't, but he does, he makes them for yachts, like super yachts sometimes.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.600
 I have genuinely seen some of his work within the last fortnight.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.600
 Really?

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.600
 Well, you're super yachts.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.600
 That's right.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.600
 I don't want super yachts to have them.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.600
 Fair enough. This is a better one.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.600
 You know Cutty Sark?

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.600
 Yeah.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:19.600
 Cutty Sark in Greenwich has a figurehead at the front, and I'm sure it's an Andy Peters thing.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.600
 I think I've read a thing.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.600
 Yeah, it is.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.600
 He did the...

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.600
 Basically, there was a restoration that was done, and then they found some old pictures

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.600
 and realized that what they'd restored looked off in light, what it originally looked like.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.600
 So they asked him to make a new one.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.600
 That's so cool.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.600
 And they have a massive collection of ships, figureheads, around the prow of the Cutty Sark.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.600
 Yeah. It's an awesome display.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:42.600
 Actually, now there are definitely more figureheads in museums than there are among ships.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.600
 Right.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:44.600
 I think that's it.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.600
 But it's interesting becoming the last person who makes something.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:53.600
 So James Fox is talking about a watchmaker who only produces five watches a year,

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.600
 but he does them entirely on his own.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.600
 And the difference is watchmakers generally don't make an entire watch on their own.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.600
 Usually, if you were making a really well-crafted one,

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.600
 would involve probably 20 different people doing different bits.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.600
 It's different disciplines coming together.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.600
 He trained himself as a kid to make watches entirely on his own.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.600
 He was a guest with this guy who was a master watchmaker.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.600
 And he brought him his first watch after a year and showed it to him.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.600
 And he said, "Rubbish, after spending a whole year on it."

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.600
 So he went away for five years and made another watch, brought it back.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.600
 And he went, "Yes, you are a watchmaker."

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.600
 So he now makes five a year.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.600
 And each one sells for roughly £300,000 per watch.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.600
 Does he write tick or talk on them as he finishes?

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.600
 Because he should.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.600
 So the Heritage Crafts website is really interesting, well worth a look.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.600
 I've just joined, you can join and sign up to support some of the craft.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.600
 It's very cool.

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:48.600
 So extinct ones are things like mouth-blown sheet glass making,

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:52.600
 which survived until 1992, which I'm quite surprised by, to be honest.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.600
 But there is one of the very oldest, in fact, sorry,

00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.600
 the oldest thing anyone's done professionally is still going strong.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:04.600
 Because they list Heritage Crafts, some of which are currently viable.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.600
 Flint napping.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:06.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.600
 I met a Flint napper like two weeks ago.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.600
 Did you?

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.600
 Yeah.

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.600
 I wish I hadn't said it because there's no anecdote that goes with it, but it's good.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.600
 Yeah.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.600
 What is it?

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.600
 What's Flint napping?

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.600
 It's like you get a piece of stone and you hit it with a harder piece of stone

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.600
 and you get tiny bits of Flint and you can use them for cutting things and for shaving.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.600
 You can either do it to sort of repair a wall, which a Flint wall,

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:32.600
 or in the old times people would be making arrowheads or sharp instruments or tools like that.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.600
 And this, I find this absolutely unbelievable.

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.600
 There are still a few people doing it these days to make rep because they bring historic objects

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.600
 and maybe ten more doing it to shape Flint for masonry.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.600
 So it is currently viable, although small.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.600
 But it is 3.3 million years old as a trade.

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.600
 Wow.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.600
 It is more than ten times as old as our species.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.600
 Wow.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.600
 It's 11 times as old as homo sapiens as a thing.

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.600
 Is it still the same family running out?

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.600
 It's the same family.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.600
 Close shop, mate.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.600
 Close shop.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.600
 They won't let you in.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.600
 We'll just find that bizarre.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.600
 Like the older shaped Flint tools.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:07.600
 But date back.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.600
 Yeah, that's very cool.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.600
 Well, interestingly, one of the old jobs that used to be able to be was a caveman.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.600
 And that was not a craft.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.600
 No, it was because you were responsible for the removal of clinkers and ashes

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.600
 from the cave or tunnel beneath a furnace.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.600
 You were called a caveman as a result.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.600
 Here's another thing.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.600
 Two things that have a different meaning today.

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.600
 A mugger.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.600
 Do you know what a mugger was?

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.600
 It was a job that you could...

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.600
 A mug maker?

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.600
 Yeah.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.600
 For the first hundred years of that word, the word mugger meant someone who sold mugs.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:43.600
 Was there an amusing crossover period where someone said, "I'm a mugger."

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.600
 I'm sorry, I've got plenty of mugs at home.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.600
 Thank you.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.600
 No, no, no, you misunderstand.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.600
 Give me your mugs.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.600
 Yeah.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.600
 And a badger.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.600
 Badger.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.600
 Badger was someone who...

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.600
 It was a bit like Rachel's fish person.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:06.600
 It was someone who got some food from one place and then took it to someone to sell it from another place.

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.600
 But they often got in trouble because they would hoard food, hoard grain and hoard bread.

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.600
 It types of, yeah.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.600
 There was also, I read also about badgers, which was like...

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.600
 There was young boys who played like a bugle or trumpet or something.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.600
 And that call was used to like call men to war.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.600
 Badgers.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.600
 Wow.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.600
 Sources needed for this.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.600
 But badgers was definitely...

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.600
 Yeah, badgers was like sort of slang term for that job.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.600
 Nice.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.600
 And also a bodger as well as a badger.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.600
 No, it's just serious.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.600
 Really?

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.600
 Yeah, bodger would have made chair legs.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.600
 That's very funny.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:38.600
 But badly.

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:39.600
 But badly.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.600
 Do any of us have a craft?

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.600
 I can't think of that.

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.600
 What do you mean you...

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.600
 This is our craft.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.600
 Stage craft.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.600
 Yeah, but a real one.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.600
 You know, like a proper one.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.600
 Yeah.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.600
 No, I don't have a craft.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.600
 Now you make like chocolate sausages or something.

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.600
 You've got like a weird...

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.600
 What?

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.600
 That's what he calls it when he's cut back for the bathroom.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.600
 It's like a chocolate sausage.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.600
 I don't want to talk about my time in the American prison system.

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.600
 All right, Dan.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.600
 But...

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.600
 God, this guy's flirting. It's really weird.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.600
 It's really weird.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.600
 Dan is referring to a private incident where I made a tasty...

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.600
 What was it?

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:14.600
 Like, what's it called?

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.600
 That sausage that you...

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.600
 What is it called?

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:19.600
 A chocolate salami.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.600
 Has anyone ever made a chocolate salad?

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.600
 It has, even worse.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.600
 It's a delicious pudding,

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.600
 but it's also an amusing trick.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.600
 Because, you know, you bring out...

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.600
 Oh, it's pudding time, everyone.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.600
 You bring out what looks like a salami.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.600
 It's covered in icing sugar.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.600
 You put netting around it.

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.600
 You put string around it.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.600
 Yeah, like a proper salami.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.600
 It's a tad.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:42.600
 Well, okay, Dan.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.600
 Well, you're off the pudding list for life now.

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:46.600
 Okay.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:53.600
 That is it, unfortunately.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.600
 That is all of our facts.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.600

 Give a quick blurb on it, Rache.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.600
