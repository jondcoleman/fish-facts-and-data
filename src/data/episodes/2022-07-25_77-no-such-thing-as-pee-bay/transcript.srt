00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,820
 This week coming to you from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,140
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,400
 I'm joined by three other QILs.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,720
 Please welcome to the stage is Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski and James Harkin.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:35,240
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,160
 from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,920
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,480
 Okay my fact this week is that dog pee makes street lights collapse.

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,160
 You've always heard the ones you love.

11
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,760
 How does it do that?

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,240
 Well it's urea that you get in dog pee and it's corrosive and all over the world street

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,560
 lights are falling down due to dog pee.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,600
 There was a report that came out in San Francisco, they were just keeling over these landposts.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,120
 The pee was really ruining them and this is a quote from them, "We encourage people and

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,160
 dogs alike to do their business in other places like a proper restroom or on one of our fire

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
 hydrants."

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,600
 The idea of the fire hydrants is they're made out of cast iron so they won't corrode.

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,480
 Okay but I didn't know that people pissing on landposts was a thing.

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,360
 I've only ever been doing it.

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,240
 I don't know, I've been clearly wasting my time.

22
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,280
 Yeah because dogs like to urinate on things in order to market as their territory don't

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
 they.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
 Whereas humans don't really have that so we could just wee anywhere.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,200
 That's a really good point.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,960
 They did some tests on dogs as well, they tested how they do it in terms of status so they

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,200
 took 48 Labrados through a course which was full of the urine of other dogs because that's

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,560
 what scientists do and they found out that animals with higher tail bases and tail positions

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,800
 of the tail was higher up, they did more urine marking so they think that that is the

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
 sign of status.

31
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,800
 You do more urine marking and you are higher status if your tail is higher.

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,680
 Wow that's the equivalent of a mansion in this dog world.

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,360
 And there are some very submissive low status animals, they just fake it.

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,240
 They left a leg and then they don't spray anything and I'm saying, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,520
 Oh maybe they just really like street lights and they don't want to wreck them.

36
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
 That would be a nice thought.

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
 The legs.

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,880
 They're like environmentally friendly dogs.

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,360
 So have we other than just encouraging people not to piss landposts to death are we doing

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
 something about physically making land?

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
 Yes we are.

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
 Oh we are, okay cool.

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,760
 There's a dog urinal in the Spanish town of El Mandrell.

44
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,840
 So they have a pole and the pole has a grid underneath it and the idea is that the dogs

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,200
 will pee on this pole.

46
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,080
 So is it law there in where was it?

47
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
 El Mandrell.

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,160
 Is it law there that you have to train your dog to recognise a dog urinal and only urinate

49
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
 into that?

50
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,640
 It isn't but there is a law in Piacenza in Italy which says that someone can be fined

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,640
 500 euros for not cleaning up after your dog urinates.

52
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
 Wow.

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
 Wow.

54
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,080
 People have to walk around with a bottle of water and kind of wash it away.

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,400
 All some kitchen towel and you just snuck on it and put it in a door.

56
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
 Wow.

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
 Good.

58
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,920
 It's also happening to a museum in Dorset.

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,000
 They're very worried about it.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,600
 It's the Bridgeport Museum and it has a really extensive archive of the town's 800 year old

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,520
 rope and netting industry and this museum is now being eroded by dog urin and they've had

62
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,440
 to release statements saying the museum, the full, the entire museum is going down.

63
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,480
 Well they just attack the wall right around and then I mean this is a great way of taking

64
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,520
 over somewhere eventually with war.

65
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
 It's weighing on it.

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,320
 You could just weigh on it enough and all collapse.

67
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
 Yeah.

68
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
 It's a long term strategy isn't it?

69
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,920
 It's not a blitzkrieg.

70
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,840
 Almost not worth having the place once you've weeded it today.

71
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
 Oh sure.

72
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,560
 But do you know why the dogs are so attracted to this rope and netting museum or is it a

73
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
 mystery?

74
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,400
 They're very interested in early fishing industries.

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
 Anyway.

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
 Anyway.

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
 We're going off topic here.

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
 Dog urin.

79
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,240
 So the innovative types are using dog feces as a solution to some problems.

80
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,760
 So what possible problem could you have?

81
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,720
 I sort of presented that quite cryptically.

82
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,000
 So if you put your dog waste in a bin then it goes to a site and then it gets burnt up and

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
 it releases lots of bad stuff into the atmosphere.

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,640
 But in Massachusetts they've created a methane digester so that you put your dog feces

85
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,320
 into this methane digester and it powers electricity.

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:45,240
 The moment it only powers one lamp I think, but it just collapsed.

87
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,880
 But they are working on it.

88
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,880
 Wow.

89
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
 Okay.

90
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,880
 There is a feces powered lamp in London, a street light.

91
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
 A feces powered.

92
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
 Really?

93
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
 Yeah.

94
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
 And it's right.

95
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
 It's really near the QI officers in Comic-Garden.

96
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
 It's by the Savoy Hotel.

97
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,160
 I can't believe people noticed me doing that, that was thing.

98
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,680
 And they used to have them, they used to be street lights which burned off the gas from the

99
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
 sewers.

100
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,720
 So the gases would come up these pipes and just be burned off at the top.

101
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,040
 And there's only one still working.

102
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,520
 But it's called the, what's it called?

103
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,400
 The karting lane patent sewer ventilating lamp.

104
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
 That's what it's called.

105
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
 It still works.

106
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
 Wow.

107
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,080
 So lamps in London, speaking of which, there are 1,500 gas lamps in London that are still

108
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,400
 powered by gas.

109
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,000
 And there's a team of five people who work for British gas, apparently.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,240
 And they are employed to go around London every night and wind up these gas lamps.

111
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,080
 So they don't actually like the fire, they wind up a clock thing which ignites the gas lamp

112
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
 on the inside.

113
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,440
 And they climb ladders and go up there and do that every single night.

114
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
 You'll see them.

115
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,160
 I have never seen them.

116
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,800
 You aren't looking up, James, because they're looking up.

117
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
 Isn't that cool?

118
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,680
 They call themselves the guardians of the lamps.

119
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
 Nice.

120
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
 British gas employees.

121
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
 Yeah.

122
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
 And cool.

123
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,000
 I've discovered a really great place to buy urine online.

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,080
 So I just a quick shout out.

125
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,600
 And if anyone here or listening needs some, they're called P-Mart, P-W-Mart.

126
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
 To be called P-Bay.

127
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
 Oh, P-Bay.

128
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
 Oh.

129
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,680
 Oh, my God, that would have been great.

130
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,000
 And it's basically, this is the sort of opening blurb.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,200
 Welcome to P-Mart, your best discount online source for 100% real undiluted predator

132
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,000
 pee and animal urine.

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,080
 So what they do is they sell to people who need urine in order to make a market smell so that

134
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,720
 they can fend off other predators coming towards them.

135
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,880
 Yeah, you can get gift cards.

136
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,720
 You can buy someone a gift card for sort of like $100 worth of pee.

137
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,120
 And that birthday's coming up that.

138
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
 Exactly.

139
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
 They invented this thing called pee.

140
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,000
 I don't know if they invented it, but they sell it's called pee gel.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,320
 And they say, this is an amazing product.

142
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
 And I agree.

143
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,640
 It's designed for indoor use.

144
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,720
 So you can have that great pee smell inside your house.

145
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,640
 And no spilling, no mess, no fuss.

146
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,400
 And it's just basically a gel rather than a liquid that you can just smear some urine smell

147
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,560
 of a coyote.

148
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,200
 It stops, I guess, other coyotes maybe coming into your house using your sofa.

149
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
 Yeah.

150
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
 Yeah.

151
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
 My sofa at home is full of coyotes all the time.

152
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
 It's absolutely.

153
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,400
 We've got a new sponsor, by the way, for this week's podcast, guys.

154
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
 It's P-Gel.

155
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
 It's P-Mart and P-Mart.

156
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
 Yeah, P-Gel.

157
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,000
 But also, so you can also go down the list of all the things that they sell.

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,280
 And there's lots of animals.

159
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
 It's really cool.

160
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,200
 And they bottle them in those kind of, you know, when you go past those health shops where

161
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,280
 they have up your mass, you know, all those big, huge bottles.

162
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
 Up your what?

163
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
 Like protein shake.

164
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
 Yeah, protein shake.

165
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
 Yeah.

166
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,960
 Let's say there's lots of different animals.

167
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,080
 My favorite one that I saw is that you can buy one gallon of pure blackberry urine.

168
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
 A gallon?

169
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
 A gallon.

170
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
 That's what I thought.

171
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
 How long must it take a bed?

172
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
 A piece of gallon of urine.

173
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
 No.

174
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
 And straight into the thing as well.

175
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
 Yeah.

176
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,320
 Must be a nightmare.

177
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,160
 That could take down a building.

178
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
 Yes.

179
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
 Yeah.

180
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,120
 Have you heard of a white-footed sportive lemurs?

181
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
 I haven't.

182
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,040
 No, neither had I until I found this out.

183
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,800
 So they're a kind of lemur and they're really anti-social.

184
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,120
 In fact, they actively avoid each other.

185
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,360
 And they go to great lengths to not see their mates or their family members or anyone else.

186
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,960
 And they only communicate using their communal toilets.

187
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
 That's what they do.

188
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
 What?

189
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
 They leave a set mark.

190
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,680
 They're writing little comments on the toilet wall.

191
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
 Yeah, basically.

192
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
 Yeah, yeah.

193
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,400
 And they just go and they say, oh, good, good, you know, mumble's here or whatever.

194
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
 And then--

195
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
 That's what I've seen.

196
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
 Your mumble's here.

197
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
 LAUGHTER

198
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:46,880
 That's being nearly 80 episodes before we had our first "Your Mum" joke on that.

199
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,040
 We stood out very well.

200
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
 Yeah.

201
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
 Other uses.

202
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,280
 Good uses for urine, which is backfired in this case, actually.

203
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,400
 A family in Bristol who tried to lure back a lost dog by leaving a trail of their own urine

204
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,800
 on the streets near their home have been criticised by the local council.

205
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
 LAUGHTER

206
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,840
 Criticised is such a nice word.

207
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,000
 LAUGHTER

208
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 What did they--

209
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,200
 They insist it's the best way they went on forums online until our dog is lost.

210
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,720
 And the people on the forum said, well, you should pee all over your town.

211
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,480
 And it'll come back and find you.

212
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,280
 Apparently, it's quite a normal way of doing it, said the owner.

213
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,800
 Because I would just put up a sign, silly me.

214
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,120
 There was a vet who was interviewed about it who said he would be pleasantly surprised

215
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
 if it works.

216
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,200
 But probably, it would be better if they could, like, place jumpers and items of owners clothing.

217
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,480
 Because they really recognise things of that owner's smell of, so he said the only way

218
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,800
 that the urine thing would work was if the owner had an incontinence problem.

219
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,600
 LAUGHTER

220
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,040
 And we're going to have to move on to the next fact in a few minutes.

221
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:57,200
 OK, there was a book called Famicopia Batiana from 1706 by George Bate, and he had a gargle

222
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,200
 for mouth ulcers, which included a white dog-turd.

223
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
 Wow.

224
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
 Yeah.

225
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,640
 How do you gargle a solid thing?

226
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,520
 I think you then dilute it in some water.

227
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
 Oh.

228
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,680
 I would say wine, actually.

229
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
 Yeah.

230
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
 Yeah, why not take the edge off it?

231
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
 LAUGHTER

232
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,720
 Some other uses for dogs, according to old medical dictionaries.

233
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,440
 Here's one from Robert James in 1743.

234
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,480
 He said, "Keeping a warm puppy next to one's upset belly will give a kindly and cherishing

235
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
 heat."

236
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
 Mmm.

237
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
 It's nice, isn't it?

238
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
 Yeah.

239
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
 And not quite as nice.

240
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,720
 Dogdung, being hot and acrid, might treat too thick.

241
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
 Might.

242
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,840
 Might as well give it a try.

243
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
 Anything else?

244
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,640
 So there's an experiment in 1955, which I really like, where the urine of

245
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:56,840
 schizophrenics was fed to spiders to find out if they made webs any differently compared

246
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,880
 to when they drank the urine of--

247
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,960
 It really sounds like they're just getting words out of the heart.

248
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,160
 Go, schizophrenic spiders urine.

249
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
 What are we going to do?

250
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
 Inject.

251
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
 OK.

252
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
 You can imagine that.

253
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,200
 They thought, I bet they make really wacky webs, but it's been crazy.

254
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
 They didn't.

255
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,000
 There was no marked difference in the webs of the spiders who drank the schizophrenics

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 urine.

257
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 I think they could go from it.

258
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,120
 The scientist said was that urine must taste extremely unpleasant.

259
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,200
 After taking just a sip, the spider's exhibited marked appearance.

260
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,840
 So if I was a spider, I would have made a web, which has said, "Screw you in the middle

261
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
 of it."

262
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
 OK.

263
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,880
 Let's move on to our next fact.

264
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,200
 Time for pack number two.

265
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,520
 And that is my fact.

266
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,080
 My fact this week is that after the button was invented, it took more than 1,000 years

267
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,880
 for someone to invent the buttonhole.

268
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,800
 What do we do with these?

269
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
 What do we do?

270
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
 Where do they go?

271
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,120
 Who keeps making them?

272
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,880
 And they were doing things like, well, I guess we'll just latch a bit of string around it.

273
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,920
 That might be the way it just no one thought to have created the buttonhole.

274
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,640
 And eventually, and I love that that must have been the biggest innovation of its day.

275
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,240
 Just a little slit in the bit of clothing.

276
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,120
 It's kind of, I mean, because the loops do work.

277
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,480
 So I think the buttonhole came about in the mid-13th century in Europe when the buttonhole came

278
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
 to being.

279
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
 But you know what I'm saying?

280
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
 So if you have a loop, that works perfectly well.

281
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,000
 I don't really see why I'm bothered to invent the buttonhole, to be honest.

282
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 That's true.

283
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,160
 And they have to be reinforced, as well, because you can't just cut a hole in your clothing,

284
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,360
 because then that'll widen, and eventually there'll be no go for a button.

285
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,080
 So they do have to be reinforced, guys.

286
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,880
 And that public service announcement was brought to you.

287
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,520
 Yeah, and they were used for decoration, as well, weren't they, because they really are Nate,

288
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,520
 and whatever.

289
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,680
 There was apparently really expensive, as well, according to Franco Giacati, who is the world's

290
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
 biggest button collector.

291
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

292
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,720
 Does he have the world's largest collection of buttons, or is he the world's biggest button collector?

293
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,280
 He has three buttons, but he's eight but six.

294
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,720
 He said that there was a time when the buttons were so expensive, you could pay off a debt

295
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,040
 by plucking the precious button from your suit and giving it to someone.

296
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
 Wow.

297
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
 Where is that?

298
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
 That's really cool.

299
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,680
 There's a really, really good article about buttons on slate.com if you want to go there

300
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,240
 afterwards for more button stuff.

301
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
 Go on.

302
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,440
 The quote is, "A button packs an extraordinary amount of information about a given time and

303
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,840
 place, its provenance onto a crowded little canvas.

304
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,800
 Children learn to button and unbutton early in life, and they keep doing it until they're

305
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
 dead."

306
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,720
 Here's a great little thing.

307
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,520
 Anyone in the audience here, anyone listening at home, all of us on this stage, most likely

308
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,960
 the one thing that unites us, is that we're all, if you have a button on you, are wearing

309
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,360
 a button that comes from the same town in China.

310
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:58,080
 There is a button city in China, it's called Chalto, and Chalto produces 15 billion buttons

311
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
 a year.

312
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,160
 And it started because I think it was three brothers.

313
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,320
 They just found a few buttons on the ground, and they started collecting buttons, and then

314
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,920
 it turned into an industry, and it became this massive thing.

315
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,760
 But now they make them rather than find them.

316
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,600
 One of those amazing things, they find 15 billion buttons a year, but nobody knows where

318
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
 they come from.

319
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,000
 Yeah, but it's not every single button in the world.

320
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,080
 But I think it's something like three out of five people, if they're wearing buttons,

321
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,080
 wear buttons from button city, and button city apparently is amazing, and it's situated

322
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,400
 very near Toothbrush city, which produces a lot of the toothbrushes in the world.

323
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,800
 You should be next to Butten the Whole city.

324
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:43,440
 Something else about buttons, lots of Birmingham is built on buttons, so stay with me.

325
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,120
 So Shell buttons used to be extremely popular buttons made from Mother of Pearl or Shell.

326
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,840
 And in the 18th century, the world's button town of the 18th century was Birmingham, but

327
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,000
 they made a huge amount of the world's Shell buttons, and the best ones apparently required

328
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,640
 80 different processes in order to just make a button.

329
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,000
 And there was so much waste shell, which they produced that they dug enormous pits to bury

330
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,120
 it all.

331
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,040
 And lots of buildings in Birmingham today, especially in the jewelry quarter, have their foundations

332
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,240
 on Mother of Pearl.

333
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,360
 So they're all on sort of buttons in Butten of Pearl.

334
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
 Wow.

335
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
 Who was that?

336
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
 I did not know that.

337
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
 It's really interesting.

338
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,560
 Did you know that cloth buttons were illegal in 17th century France?

339
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
 No.

340
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
 They sound totally useless.

341
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
 I would ban them.

342
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
 Like buttons made of cloth.

343
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
 That wasn't the reason they banned them.

344
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
 Basically, it was due to big button.

345
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
 Yeah.

346
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:39,360
 It was the handicraft industry who said that basically by making these cloth buttons it was going

347
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,960
 to make our other buttons made out of pearl or whatever, they were going to make them obsolete.

348
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,880
 And it was so bad that officials would go to houses and search them, looking for buttons.

349
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,800
 And you could be arrested for enjoying the button in the privacy of your own home.

350
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,360
 I got into this article, I read.

351
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
 Wow.

352
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,760
 When we say enjoying a button, I mean, you're enjoying a button.

353
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,960
 I think you might have to be arrested.

354
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,880
 There was, so a button alternative since we didn't really figure out the buttonhole thing

355
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,520
 in ancient Greece, in ancient Rome, was the fibula, which was a four and other safety

356
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
 pin.

357
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,280
 It essentially was exactly like a safety pin.

358
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,880
 And they had these in ancient Greece and Rome.

359
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,540
 And that's an example of one of these things, which I love, which is an invention that vanished

360
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,540
 for about 2,000 years.

361
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,880
 And a safety pin resurfaced in...

362
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,360
 So they had a safety pin in ancient Greece?

363
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
 Yeah.

364
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
 Yeah.

365
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
 So that's why they did that there.

366
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,360
 Tunex.

367
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,600
 The guy who invented the modern safety pin was called Walter Hunt, I think.

368
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,480
 And he sold his patent for $400 because he had, he had like a gambling debt or something.

369
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,720
 So he sold his patent so that he could pay off his debt because he thought, oh, it's

370
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
 a safety pin.

371
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
 It's nothing.

372
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
 It's not really important.

373
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,120
 That is how I feel about safety, it depends, to be honest, but actually, as a commercial

374
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
 person.

375
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,520
 And also, he invented, I think, like a sewing machine, like similar to, it lies how invented

376
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,920
 the actual sewing machine, but he did a precursor to it.

377
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,560
 And he didn't patent that because he thought it would put a lot of seamstresses out of

378
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
 work.

379
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
 Oh, no!

380
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
 Yeah.

381
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
 Did the opposite of that?

382
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
 [Laughter]

383
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,360
 Created a massive global industry.

384
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
 [Laughter]

385
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
 Oh, my friend.

386
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
 [Laughter]

387
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,960
 One thing that buttons, so when the buttonhole did come into being, one thing that they were

388
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,640
 useful in fashion between 13th and 15th centuries was detachable sleeves.

389
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,480
 So that was a really fashionable thing, is that you would have, you know, you could swap between

390
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
 outfits.

391
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,440
 It would look like you were wearing a different outfit every time, you had lots, you had

392
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,920
 a sleeve drawer, which was just sleeves.

393
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
 No.

394
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,920
 And you'd probably, they did.

395
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
 I don't know.

396
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
 They had lots of different sleeves.

397
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
 [Laughter]

398
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
 Where else are you going to keep the sleeves?

399
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
 That's really cool.

400
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
 That is really cool.

401
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
 That's amazing.

402
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
 Yeah.

403
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,800
 One day, you might accidentally leave the house with odd sleeves on.

404
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,120
 Oh, disaster.

405
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
 Yeah.

406
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,840
 And then some people say, he's just doing on purpose to be pretentious.

407
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
 Yeah.

408
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,680
 So, basically, before the buttonhole was invented, buttons did become very popular.

409
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,400
 Everyone was wearing them ornamentally.

410
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,040
 And one of the hangovers of that time, which we rarely think about, I was reading this in

411
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,520
 Bill Bryson's book at home.

412
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,800
 If you think about a suit coat and the buttons by the cuff, they're not practical buttons.

413
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,040
 They're just ornamental.

414
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,440
 So, do you want a mental on each side?

415
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
 Yeah, that is weird.

416
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
 Yeah.

417
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,120
 So, that's a hangover from back in the day pre-buttonhole.

418
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,320
 Well, so another hangover, which we are wearing every day, every female in the audience, symbols

419
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,600
 of sexism of the olden days, is the fact that buttons on women's clothes are on the opposite

420
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,040
 side to buttons on men's clothes.

421
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,960
 So, there are loads of theories about why that is.

422
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,000
 Well, the main theory I've heard is that women were dressed by maids.

423
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Yeah.

424
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And so, the maids who were mostly right handed would kind of be easier for them because it

425
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,960
 was on the left hand side, whereas men dressed themselves.

426
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,840
 I thought it was because all women are left handed.

427
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,280
 I've heard so, yeah, I think that is the main theory.

428
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,880
 Although, like anyway, it's just the main theory, the main theory.

429
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
 No, no, the all the family theory.

430
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
 Oh, really?

431
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
 Yeah, it's true.

432
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,040
 But another theory is that, so men have them on the right hand side because they would

433
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,160
 have their weapons in their right hand when they were kind of weapons.

434
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
 So, they would be...

435
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,080
 So, when you're trying to get undressed and kill someone at the same time.

436
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,280
 Exactly, it's much easier, one-handed.

437
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,080
 I will deal to the death, but... *laughs*

438
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
 *laughs*

439
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:24,000
 Gillian Lincoln's can't stand to be in the same room as friends and family who word buttons.

440
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Who?

441
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,800
 She's called Gillian Lincoln's and she has something called "Koom Poomophobia", which is the fear

442
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
 of buttons.

443
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,880
 She's had it since she was age seven, and her boyfriend, Nate Dorrington, can only work

444
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
 clothes with zips.

445
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
 Wow.

446
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
 Her name is Lincoln's, which is nicely ironic.

447
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
 Oh, yeah.

448
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
 Oh, yeah.

449
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
 And the function of a button.

450
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
 Do you know who else had that?

451
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
 Yeah, yeah.

452
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
 We must have read the same thing.

453
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
 Yeah, let's say it together.

454
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
 Okay, ready?

455
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
 One, two, three.

456
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
 Steve Jobs.

457
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,800
 Steve Jobs was scared of buttons, and partially there's a theory that that's why it led to the

458
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,880
 buttonless iPhone because he was so...

459
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
 *laughter*

460
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,880
 Yeah, so Steve Jobs, he actually had a fear of buttons.

461
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
 Yeah, he did say that in...

462
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
 Yeah, 2007, I think.

463
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,580
 The other person who had a fear of buttons was Napoleon's, I think, great granddaughter, Marie

464
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,580
 Bonaparte.

465
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
 Oh, really?

466
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,580
 Really?

467
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,580
 Yep.

468
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,580
 Wow.

469
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,580
 That's true.

470
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
 Is she the one who had a clitoris moved?

471
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,580
 Yeah.

472
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,580
 Moved?

473
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,580
 I don't know.

474
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,580
 We can't wait for it.

475
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,580
 Just to a holiday house.

476
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,580
 *laughter*

477
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,580
 Yeah.

478
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,080
 Very, very quickly.

479
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,240
 She did some studies where she looked at the distance between the clitoris and the vagina

480
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,800
 where there were lots of women and found out that those where it was closer had more orgasms

481
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,600
 and she wants to have more orgasms, so moved her clitoris surgically close, etc.

482
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,200
 She had to move twice and it didn't work.

483
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
 It's very sad.

484
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
 It's extremely sad.

485
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
 Yeah, yeah.

486
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
 How the mighty families have fallen.

487
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
 *laughter*

488
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,720
 Napoleon's army actually had a situation with buttons, which was that their buttons were

489
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,240
 made out of tin.

490
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
 And I've read.

491
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,320
 I don't know if this is actually a solid theory, but apparently when they were marching

492
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,640
 into Russia, it was so cold that the tin crumbled and so their uniforms opened wide up and suddenly

493
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,040
 they were exposed to the cold and that's what led to a lot of deaths, so...

494
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,680
 So, as they were invading, it was kind of like watching the full Monty coming towards you.

495
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
 *laughter*

496
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
 I've read that theory.

497
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,200
 I've read different things about it though.

498
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,920
 I've read people contradicting it and people saying yes, no, it's definitely a year.

499
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
 So, yeah, I'm not sure.

500
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
 I'm going to have to move us on.

501
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
 Go worries.

502
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
 Anyone else?

503
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
 Got something?

504
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,720
 Just that the button replacement is the zip in the modern era and you've got to be aware

505
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,280
 of the zip because it is by far and away the most common cause of penis injury.

506
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:45,360
 So, between 2002 and 2010, there were almost 18,000 people in the US alone who were hospitalised

507
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
 because of penile injury.

508
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,240
 You can imagine they all arrived on the same day.

509
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,640
 Imagine the coincidence.

510
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,880
 It was after a big charity pulled your flies up.

511
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,600
 And also, possibly not interestingly for men, but it is almost only ever the penis and not

512
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,080
 the testicles or good news of the testicles, very hard to get them caught in the zip.

513
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,320
 It's more like, it's not like no news for the testicles and very, very bad news for the penis.

514
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,640
 When they invented the zip, it was marketed as a better way to do up your trousers as you

515
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,880
 are less likely to forget to do up a zipper as you were to forget to do up buttons, but also

516
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:26,640
 less likely to chop your cock off with buttons.

517
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,440
 OK, time for fact number three and that is Andy Murray.

518
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,480
 OK, my fact is that as a baby, St Nicholas refused to drink his mother's breast milk on

519
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,000
 fast days.

520
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,760
 So on Wednesdays and Fridays, St Nicholas would refuse to suckle because he was so holy,

521
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,520
 so young, except in the evening when it was allowed because the day was over.

522
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,680
 So there are other saints where this happens.

523
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,840
 So there's a biography of the fifth century St Candid, which says that as a baby, he completely

524
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,480
 refused to suckle at his mother's right breast.

525
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,760
 But if she had eaten a delicious meal, he also refused to suckle at her left breast.

526
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
 Wow.

527
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
 What?

528
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,720
 So he wasn't allowed to enjoy it too much.

529
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,200
 So if she didn't have delicious meal, then it breastmilk is more delicious.

530
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
 Exactly.

531
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
 It was like an abstinence thing.

532
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,160
 Maybe there's so much more advance than we give them credit for.

533
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,280
 Do you know who the patron saint of breastfeeding is?

534
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
 It's not St Nicholas.

535
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,160
 No, it's St Giles.

536
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,400
 And before he became a saint, he withdrew deep into the forest near Neem, where he lived

537
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,880
 on his own.

538
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,840
 And his sole companion was a deer who sustained him with her milk.

539
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
 Oh.

540
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,320
 A weird person to nominate is a patron saint of breastfeeding because it is not a conventional

541
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
 way to breastfeed.

542
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
 Yeah.

543
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,520
 But he is also the patron saint of Edinburgh, St Giles.

544
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,240
 And the patron saint of people who are afraid of the dark.

545
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
 Wow.

546
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
 Yeah.

547
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
 That's very good knowledge.

548
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
 Wow.

549
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,440
 And the patron saint of Glasgow is St Mungo, and St Mungo died of shock after getting to a very

550
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
 hot bath.

551
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:05,160
 Guys, I think I can handle a bath.

552
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
 It is really hot, St Mungo.

553
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
 Please.

554
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,120
 Why are you calling me saint?

555
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,800
 So just one more saint. St Gwen, the white, was the mother of two young sons, and then she

556
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,640
 gave birth to a third son.

557
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,640
 And in order to help her, nursing her third infant, God miraculously gave her a third breast.

558
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,240
 And she became known as Gwen of the three paps.

559
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
 Anyway.

560
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:39,280
 St Nicholas about this fact is, so one of his miracles, which is particularly impressive,

561
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
 I think.

562
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,280
 He was someone who was selling pickled ham in a street market, and St Nicholas realised

563
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,800
 that he was not selling pickled ham as the science suggested.

564
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,680
 He was selling the pickled, chopped up bodies of three small children, and he pieced them

565
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
 together.

566
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,040
 But it's not sad because he pieced them together and he brought the children back to life

567
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
 again.

568
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,880
 So that is impressive, isn't it?

569
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
 The Gurkin triplets.

570
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,880
 Yeah.

571
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
 I got.

572
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,600
 Yeah, we should clarify that, like stories about what saints do, we're not necessarily

573
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
 presenting us.

574
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
 I know.

575
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,600
 I don't know what to write down as interesting, because it sounds like wherever he walked, he

576
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,120
 would be in a situation and he would pray it away.

577
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,040
 So he'd be like, oh, we're at the ocean, and we're in the ocean, and sailors are vomiting,

578
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
 and there's a whirlpool.

579
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
 I'll just do a quick prayer.

580
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,920
 What is true about him actually is that he slapped somebody once, and he slapped a fellow

581
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
 bishop.

582
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:30,920
 Yes, because it's the great Aryan controversy, which is the controversy about whether Jesus

583
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,120
 is actually fully divine or whether he's sort of half divine because he was also a human.

584
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,640
 And basically, it's the Nicholas strongly believed that Jesus is God, and someone suggested

585
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,920
 that Jesus wasn't quite either divine or human.

586
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,640
 And he got up, it was at some sign-on in the year 325 AD, and the Nicholas got up, crossed

587
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,920
 the room, and gave him a big slap round the face.

588
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
 Wow.

589
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:58,000
 And that is where we get the phrase, bashing the bishop.

590
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,080
 So, yeah, I'm not sure, like you're saying, the saints didn't do these things, is that?

591
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,720
 That's that religious, in any way, for instance, there are a few saints who would decapitated

592
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,320
 and carried their own heads.

593
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,840
 You're saying that that didn't happen as well?

594
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,760
 No, I definitely am not saying that.

595
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:23,240
 Saint Jean of Lajara who carried his own severed head and threw it into the throne, or Paul

596
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:30,280
 of Tarsus, who had his head shot off, and then said, "Jesus Christ, 50 times after it

597
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
 have been shot off."

598
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
 Wow.

599
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,640
 Well, you might not have said it in that way, but 50 times.

600
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,320
 50 times as a mate, or the first time it would be amazing, and then the tenth time it would

601
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,320
 be, "Okay, we've got to eat."

602
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,600
 It's about a 50th time, "Okay, can you just shut up, man?"

603
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,080
 There's actually a real problem with Saint Sue, our beheaded, and then carry their heads

604
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,600
 around where to put the halo.

605
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,120
 So, I think there's some controversy as to whether you put it over their severed neck

606
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,640
 when you're painting them, or whether you put it above the head here, and there's mixed

607
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
 views.

608
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
 We'll see both.

609
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,640
 You'll see both.

610
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
 Wow.

611
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,640
 Wow.

612
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,360
 Can I bring it back to breast milk very quickly here?

613
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,360
 Okay.

614
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
 Is this another website?

615
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,960
 So, I found a great place to buy breast milk online.

616
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,360
 So, only thebreast.com, and this genuinely is simply the breast.

617
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,160
 I know we should have been right.

618
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,720
 Think out there, guys.

619
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,160
 And this is a genuine place where people trade breast milk online, and you have all sorts

620
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,640
 of categories, subcategories of types of breast milk that you can buy and have shipped

621
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
 to your house.

622
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,480
 You can have zero to two months.

623
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,960
 There was fresh breast milk on demand, special diet, brackets, vegan, etc.

624
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,360
 And then the final one is willing to sell to men.

625
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,360
 Yeah.

626
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,000
 Pretty disgusting, right?

627
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,360
 I've heard, I don't know if this is true, that bodybuilders like to have breast milk,

628
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,120
 because they're theory, and apparently this is complete rubbish, but their theory is

629
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,120
 a baby goes from really small to quite big, and a really small amount of time.

630
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,040
 So, surely the same will happen to my muscles.

631
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,040
 Do you want to combine, marrying the two together, saints and breast milk?

632
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,040
 Oh, yeah.

633
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,960
 Have you heard of the miracle of the lactation of st. Bernard?

634
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,520
 This is where st. Bernard was praying, and the Virgin Mary, one who was praying, sprinkled

635
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:28,200
 some milk on his lips, as in her own breast milk, and there are other depictions of it,

636
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
 which are quite impressive.

637
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,440
 So, I'm quoting directly from the Wikipedia article about the lactation of st. Bernard.

638
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,440
 In art, he usually kneels before a Madonna lactens, breastfeeding Madonna, and as Jesus takes

639
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,680
 a break from feeding, the Virgin squeezes her breast, and he is hit with a squirt of milk,

640
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,880
 often shown travelling and impressive distance.

641
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
 That's true.

642
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,120
 It is across the room that it's depicted, and it's medieval artworks that you get this

643
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,120
 in.

644
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
 Yeah.

645
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
 Well, man can that take?

646
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
 Can't they?

647
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
 Yes.

648
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,960
 You've discussed it before, have you massaged your nipples enough as a man, then you can

649
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
 bring it on?

650
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,760
 Did you ever do that experiment, Andy?

651
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,240
 I was it done, who was going to do it?

652
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,240
 I did have a go, yes.

653
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,240
 Yeah.

654
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,600
 And was it successful?

655
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
 Not a dribble.

656
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
 Nothing.

657
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
 Furious.

658
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
 It's been all weeks.

659
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,880
 It's so weird on the train.

660
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
 It's research.

661
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,880
 It's a research.

662
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
 Yeah.

663
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
 No.

664
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
 No.

665
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
 No.

666
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
 Not a drop yet.

667
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
 Yeah.

668
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
 I'm not getting up.

669
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,360
 Do you want to hear about St. Philip Neary, who's known as the humorous saint?

670
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
 Wow.

671
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
 Yeah.

672
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,360
 It's like, oh, I've got a really funny mate.

673
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,360
 Yeah.

674
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
 You've got to meet him.

675
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,360
 Funny Mike.

676
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
 It really is like that.

677
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,200
 It's so sad.

678
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,640
 His basically all he did that was funny is he once shaved off half his beard as a way of

679
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,720
 poking fun at himself, and he also liked to wear a cushion on his head.

680
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
 How come?

681
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:58,560
 And he's doing his debut solo hour, sea venues.

682
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
 So he was sainted for that?

683
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,080
 He must have done some other stuff.

684
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
 I don't know.

685
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,560
 It was very much easier back then, wasn't it?

686
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,160
 We're going to have to move on very soon.

687
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,400
 Can I just tell you very quickly about the infancy gospels of Jesus, because as another

688
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,320
 young, more than a saint, he was a Jesus, wasn't he?

689
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:25,560
 So there are some second-century sources which describe what Jesus did as a very, very small

690
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,480
 boy when he was about five years old.

691
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,920
 And they're really amazing, because they're very different to the gospels.

692
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,640
 So when he was five years old, he gathered together separate rivers, which had all been

693
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,480
 desperate pools of water and he gathered them into a single pond, and he cleaned it up,

694
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,040
 and then a boy ruined them by sort of sweeping them apart with the broom.

695
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,320
 So Jesus immediately just made the boy withered.

696
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,040
 And then there was another time when a boy bumped into him and he, Jesus, immediately killed

697
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
 him.

698
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
 Wow.

699
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
 Oh my God.

700
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,440
 The parents of the boy who Jesus has killed go to Joseph saying, "Your son's killed our

701
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
 son."

702
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,080
 So Jesus simply struck blind all of his accuses.

703
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:11,120
 And then Joseph sort of boxes his ear and tells him off, "Wow, infancy gospels, look

704
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,520
 come up, they're really good."

705
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,560
 It's time for our final fact and that is Joszynski.

706
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:24,120
 Yeah, my fact is that when Ronald Reagan left office, he left a note on the White House

707
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,560
 lawn for these squirrels warning them to beware of George Bush's dogs.

708
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,080
 Yeah, it's quite sweet, isn't it?

709
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
 It's sweet.

710
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,640
 Yeah, but also he's assuming that squirrels can read, is he?

711
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,120
 Yeah, I mean he wasn't the sharpest on the shed, but he was very fond of the squirrels.

712
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,240
 And sadly, George Bush recounted later that it did absolutely no good because their dog

713
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,120
 millie beat the heck out of those squirrels whenever he could, she could.

714
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
 Oh, wow.

715
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,680
 You should have left also a sign for the dog saying, "Don't get the squirrels."

716
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,680
 I didn't need to do that.

717
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
 Yeah.

718
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,600
 They currently have, and this is like hot off the press, the White House is having squirrel

719
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,920
 issues at the moment with Michelle Obama's garden.

720
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,800
 Oh, well, because they always dig up.

721
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,080
 My friends spent an entire weekend planting lots of bulbs in her garden and went back and

722
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,880
 like a hundred bulbs of them and dug up.

723
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,880
 So it's probably that.

724
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,680
 There's a silly little legal issue that the gardeners are not allowed to touch the bit of

725
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,440
 garden that she's created, but she's away so much that she's actually not able to maintain

726
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
 it.

727
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,720
 They can't mo it, they can't weed it, they can't do anything to it, but water it, and it's

728
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,720
 just been...

729
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,320
 So they're allowed to go near the first lady's garden?

730
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,320
 Yeah.

731
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
 I cannot really.

732
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,360
 So that she's saying to them, "Please do go near it."

733
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,400
 And they're like, "We want to, but there's this clause somewhere in our legislation that

734
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,960
 says we're not allowed to touch your bit of garden."

735
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,320
 I genuinely didn't read the article.

736
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,840
 I have no idea what.

737
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
 But they are.

738
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,000
 So squirrels are prolific on the White House lawn and Reagan was really fond of them and

739
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,320
 it's kind of touching.

740
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,880
 So every time he went to Camp David, he'd bring lots of acorns back from there to feed the

741
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
 squirrels.

742
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
 I was reading a trans...

743
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
 What?

744
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,920
 Yeah, he loved to feed the squirrels.

745
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,680
 I was reading a transcript of an interview that he was having.

746
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:09,640
 I think it was with the New York Times where basically he...there was in the transcript, there's

747
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,320
 a pause at one point and he says, "Oh, sorry if I look out the window and look distracted,

748
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,600
 I'm just seeing if the squirrels are still eating the acorns that I brought in this morning."

749
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
 Oh my god.

750
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,080
 Well, it's a good thing there wasn't anything going on at the time, like the Cold War.

751
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
 Wow.

752
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,080
 Come on.

753
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,080
 It's cute.

754
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,880
 I read a thing about Reagan because Reagan was obviously...he was an actor in B-Movies.

755
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,640
 He was starting films with amazing titles.

756
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:39,360
 Accidents will happen, girls on probation, the angels wash their faces, brother, rat and

757
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,760
 a baby.

758
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,320
 But his...but his IMDB page begins with this quotation.

759
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,960
 Ronald Reagan is arguably the most successful actor in history and they've faced that on the

760
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,160
 fact that he became president of America but it's not a success as an actor.

761
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,840
 I really like the pedantic nature of that comment because he is the most successful

762
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,480
 person who has also been an actor.

763
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,480
 Yes.

764
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
 You can't fault it.

765
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
 That's true.

766
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
 That's true.

767
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,280
 Did you guys know that it is because of him that we have blue jelly beans?

768
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
 No.

769
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
 No.

770
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
 Why?

771
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
 I didn't know we have blue jelly beans actually.

772
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,440
 You always feel the skepticism emanating.

773
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
 I know.

774
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,280
 The whole room goes, it's not true, isn't it?

775
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
 It's true.

776
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,200
 It was for his inauguration.

777
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,680
 So basically, he was a massive jelly bean lover.

778
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,240
 The reason he was a massive jelly bean lover is because he had a huge pipe smoking habit

779
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,680
 and he hated it and he didn't want to smoke anymore.

780
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:38,960
 The only thing that would stop him from having any nicotine would be to have a jar of jelly

781
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
 beans.

782
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,880
 And often, if you look at photos of Ronald Reagan in all the meetings that he's in, there's

783
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,800
 a big jar of jelly beans next to him.

784
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,800
 Wow.

785
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
 And so he loved licorice.

786
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,920
 That was his favorite type of jelly bean before the inauguration because jelly bean

787
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
 caught on to it.

788
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
 They thought we're going to create one.

789
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,080
 We don't have a blue one for the red, white and blue.

790
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
 And so they created it.

791
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
 And so, yeah.

792
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
 Ronald Reagan.

793
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
 Wow.

794
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
 That is really interesting.

795
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
 Thank you.

796
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,600
 One thing he didn't like was Brussels sprouts.

797
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,800
 He once did a trip to England and he was fed so many Brussels sprouts during his trip that

798
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,040
 he swore off them for the rest of his life.

799
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,240
 But they told him they were green jelly beans as they created it in his honour.

800
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,760
 You know, when he was an actor, so I was reading, he actually wrote two autobiographies, but

801
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,640
 his later one after he was president.

802
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,200
 He told about when he was an actor.

803
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,280
 And the fact that there was a lot of talk backstage about how small his head was.

804
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,640
 And so he was there with this casting director who was saying, "What are we going to do about

805
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
 Ronald's head?"

806
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,720
 You could stay in the actors slightly further away from him.

807
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,520
 And then it would match the size of their heads from back there, yeah.

808
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,040
 But then his body looks weirdly large, so it's fine that, to be in a successful actor,

809
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,520
 he had to have very wide colours to minimise his shoulder width and have colours that

810
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,000
 were sort of open up a little bit lower.

811
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,360
 So it looked like his head was a bit bigger, I guess, to increase the amount of skin exposure

812
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
 in the head area.

813
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,600
 That's amazing.

814
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
 Yeah.

815
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
 Poor guy.

816
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:04,760
 Imagine, he was the most successful actor of all time, so that is true.

817
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,320
 Who can forget watching Brother Rattander Baby every Christmas?

818
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,560
 You know, he wrote his first autobiography 16 years before he became president?

819
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
 Wow.

820
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,400
 In 1965, he was saying, "And it was called "Where's the rest of me?"

821
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,240
 What did he talk about his head?

822
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,240
 Was this next autobiography called "Here it is?"

823
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,240
 Very forward thinking.

824
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,040
 He was once threatened by a guy who was going to attack him, and the way he was known as

825
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,920
 the Katman, and the reason was because he would send threatening letters, but also pictures

826
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,920
 of Katz.

827
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,200
 Oh, the president.

828
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
 Yeah.

829
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
 That is the precursor to the internet, I think.

830
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:53,440
 Lots of purpose was abuse, and then pictures of Katz.

831
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,000
 And the other thing that Reagan started was the idea that whenever a president leaves, he

832
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,440
 always leaves a note for the next president, and he wrote a note saying, "Don't let the

833
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,240
 turkeys get you down to George Bush."

834
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
 Sorry.

835
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,760
 What is the relevant of the turkeys?

836
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,720
 The turkeys is in the press, the other countries.

837
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,520
 Don't let the turkeys get you down.

838
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,640
 It's not about turkeys, is it?

839
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,440
 Because that's a very specifically racist thing to say when you're taking over the most

840
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,440
 powerful mission.

841
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:27,640
 So this was discovered by Brad Meltzer, not the fact that that note was left for Bush, but

842
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,000
 that Bush then said, "I left a note for Clinton."

843
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,160
 And Brad Meltzer, he's a crime writer, political thrillers.

844
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,520
 He then said, "This is apparently, he thinks this is true."

845
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,520
 Wherever Ronald Reagan went, he had a briefcase with him, and always carried a hand-held gun

846
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
 on him.

847
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
 Okay.

848
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,160
 What's the opposite of a hand-held gun?

849
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:59,240
 A foot-propelled bow and arrow.

850
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,720
 He was, I just always think this is amazing.

851
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,320
 His Chief of Staff, do people know what his Chief of Staff it's called?

852
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,320
 Ronald Reagan's.

853
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
 Yeah.

854
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,320
 No.

855
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,320
 He was called Donald Reagan.

856
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,520
 I don't understand why this isn't the most well-known fact on the base of the earth, and

857
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,680
 the Chief of Staff who preceded him was called Baker, so the Chief of Staff who preceded Donald

858
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,320
 Reagan was called Howard Baker, and the guy who came after him was called James Baker.

859
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,640
 So people say Ronald Reagan was a bit confused in the '80s, but I definitely see where he's

860
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,640
 coming from.

861
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
 Yes.

862
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:36,720
 Annoyingly, we're running out of time, in fact, we're on the time-run-out moment, so any

863
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
 last facts?

864
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
 I'm very quick.

865
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,720
 One about squirrels?

866
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
 Yeah, one.

867
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,960
 It used to be illegal, not to report a gray squirrel in your garden.

868
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,960
 Really?

869
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
 Yeah.

870
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,480
 I think that gray squirrels were brought to the UK by Benjamin Franklin.

871
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:56,240
 He brought squirrels over to the UK, according to newsforsquirrels.com, the blog.

872
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,880
 How many years does it get?

873
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,320
 It's had a lot this week.

874
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,960
 Male-caped ground squirrels have very big genitalia.

875
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:13,200
 The penises can be 40% the length of their body, and they can undo auto-filate, yeah.

876
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,180
 And according to researcher Jane Warteman, they do it to clean their genitals.

877
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,320
 Sorry, we'll send you usual buttony of this.

878
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,920
 Sorry, only 40% got it, no, no, no, no, that doesn't do it.

879
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,920
 Okay, that's it.

880
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,920
 That's all of our facts.

881
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
