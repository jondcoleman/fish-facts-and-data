00:00:00,00:00:16,"""Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast."
00:00:16,00:00:18,This week coming to you from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.
00:00:18,00:00:20,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:20,00:00:22,I'm joined by three other QILs.
00:00:22,00:00:27,"Please welcome to the stage is Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski and James Harkin."
00:00:27,00:00:35,And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:00:35,00:00:39,"from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:39,00:00:40,"Starting with you, James Harkin."
00:00:40,00:00:48,Okay my fact this week is that dog pee makes street lights collapse.
00:00:48,00:00:51,You've always heard the ones you love.
00:00:51,00:00:53,How does it do that?
00:00:53,00:00:59,Well it's urea that you get in dog pee and it's corrosive and all over the world street
00:00:59,00:01:02,lights are falling down due to dog pee.
00:01:02,00:01:06,"There was a report that came out in San Francisco, they were just keeling over these landposts."
00:01:06,00:01:10,"The pee was really ruining them and this is a quote from them, ""We encourage people and"
00:01:10,00:01:15,dogs alike to do their business in other places like a proper restroom or on one of our fire
00:01:15,00:01:16,"hydrants."""
00:01:16,00:01:20,The idea of the fire hydrants is they're made out of cast iron so they won't corrode.
00:01:20,00:01:25,Okay but I didn't know that people pissing on landposts was a thing.
00:01:25,00:01:28,I've only ever been doing it.
00:01:28,00:01:31,"I don't know, I've been clearly wasting my time."
00:01:31,00:01:36,Yeah because dogs like to urinate on things in order to market as their territory don't
00:01:36,00:01:37,they.
00:01:37,00:01:39,Whereas humans don't really have that so we could just wee anywhere.
00:01:39,00:01:43,That's a really good point.
00:01:43,00:01:48,"They did some tests on dogs as well, they tested how they do it in terms of status so they"
00:01:48,00:01:54,took 48 Labrados through a course which was full of the urine of other dogs because that's
00:01:54,00:02:00,what scientists do and they found out that animals with higher tail bases and tail positions
00:02:00,00:02:04,"of the tail was higher up, they did more urine marking so they think that that is the"
00:02:04,00:02:05,sign of status.
00:02:05,00:02:08,You do more urine marking and you are higher status if your tail is higher.
00:02:08,00:02:12,Wow that's the equivalent of a mansion in this dog world.
00:02:12,00:02:16,"And there are some very submissive low status animals, they just fake it."
00:02:16,00:02:21,"They left a leg and then they don't spray anything and I'm saying, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
00:02:21,00:02:24,Oh maybe they just really like street lights and they don't want to wreck them.
00:02:24,00:02:25,That would be a nice thought.
00:02:25,00:02:26,The legs.
00:02:26,00:02:28,They're like environmentally friendly dogs.
00:02:28,00:02:35,So have we other than just encouraging people not to piss landposts to death are we doing
00:02:35,00:02:37,something about physically making land?
00:02:37,00:02:38,Yes we are.
00:02:38,00:02:39,"Oh we are, okay cool."
00:02:39,00:02:44,There's a dog urinal in the Spanish town of El Mandrell.
00:02:44,00:02:48,So they have a pole and the pole has a grid underneath it and the idea is that the dogs
00:02:48,00:02:50,will pee on this pole.
00:02:50,00:02:53,So is it law there in where was it?
00:02:53,00:02:54,El Mandrell.
00:02:54,00:02:58,Is it law there that you have to train your dog to recognise a dog urinal and only urinate
00:02:58,00:02:59,into that?
00:02:59,00:03:03,It isn't but there is a law in Piacenza in Italy which says that someone can be fined
00:03:03,00:03:07,500 euros for not cleaning up after your dog urinates.
00:03:07,00:03:08,Wow.
00:03:08,00:03:09,Wow.
00:03:09,00:03:13,People have to walk around with a bottle of water and kind of wash it away.
00:03:13,00:03:17,All some kitchen towel and you just snuck on it and put it in a door.
00:03:17,00:03:18,Wow.
00:03:18,00:03:19,Good.
00:03:19,00:03:21,It's also happening to a museum in Dorset.
00:03:21,00:03:23,They're very worried about it.
00:03:23,00:03:28,It's the Bridgeport Museum and it has a really extensive archive of the town's 800 year old
00:03:28,00:03:34,rope and netting industry and this museum is now being eroded by dog urin and they've had
00:03:34,00:03:38,"to release statements saying the museum, the full, the entire museum is going down."
00:03:38,00:03:42,Well they just attack the wall right around and then I mean this is a great way of taking
00:03:42,00:03:44,over somewhere eventually with war.
00:03:44,00:03:45,It's weighing on it.
00:03:45,00:03:47,You could just weigh on it enough and all collapse.
00:03:47,00:03:48,Yeah.
00:03:48,00:03:50,It's a long term strategy isn't it?
00:03:50,00:03:51,It's not a blitzkrieg.
00:03:51,00:03:56,Almost not worth having the place once you've weeded it today.
00:03:56,00:03:57,Oh sure.
00:03:57,00:04:02,But do you know why the dogs are so attracted to this rope and netting museum or is it a
00:04:02,00:04:03,mystery?
00:04:03,00:04:06,They're very interested in early fishing industries.
00:04:06,00:04:07,Anyway.
00:04:07,00:04:08,Anyway.
00:04:08,00:04:09,We're going off topic here.
00:04:09,00:04:10,Dog urin.
00:04:10,00:04:15,So the innovative types are using dog feces as a solution to some problems.
00:04:15,00:04:18,So what possible problem could you have?
00:04:18,00:04:21,I sort of presented that quite cryptically.
00:04:21,00:04:26,So if you put your dog waste in a bin then it goes to a site and then it gets burnt up and
00:04:26,00:04:28,it releases lots of bad stuff into the atmosphere.
00:04:28,00:04:33,But in Massachusetts they've created a methane digester so that you put your dog feces
00:04:33,00:04:37,into this methane digester and it powers electricity.
00:04:37,00:04:45,"The moment it only powers one lamp I think, but it just collapsed."
00:04:45,00:04:47,But they are working on it.
00:04:47,00:04:48,Wow.
00:04:48,00:04:49,Okay.
00:04:49,00:04:51,"There is a feces powered lamp in London, a street light."
00:04:51,00:04:52,A feces powered.
00:04:52,00:04:53,Really?
00:04:53,00:04:54,Yeah.
00:04:54,00:04:55,And it's right.
00:04:55,00:04:56,It's really near the QI officers in Comic-Garden.
00:04:56,00:04:57,It's by the Savoy Hotel.
00:04:57,00:05:04,"I can't believe people noticed me doing that, that was thing."
00:05:04,00:05:08,"And they used to have them, they used to be street lights which burned off the gas from the"
00:05:08,00:05:09,sewers.
00:05:09,00:05:14,So the gases would come up these pipes and just be burned off at the top.
00:05:14,00:05:16,And there's only one still working.
00:05:16,00:05:17,"But it's called the, what's it called?"
00:05:17,00:05:21,The karting lane patent sewer ventilating lamp.
00:05:21,00:05:22,That's what it's called.
00:05:22,00:05:23,It still works.
00:05:23,00:05:24,Wow.
00:05:24,00:05:31,"So lamps in London, speaking of which, there are 1,500 gas lamps in London that are still"
00:05:31,00:05:32,powered by gas.
00:05:32,00:05:36,"And there's a team of five people who work for British gas, apparently."
00:05:36,00:05:40,And they are employed to go around London every night and wind up these gas lamps.
00:05:40,00:05:45,"So they don't actually like the fire, they wind up a clock thing which ignites the gas lamp"
00:05:45,00:05:46,on the inside.
00:05:46,00:05:48,And they climb ladders and go up there and do that every single night.
00:05:48,00:05:49,You'll see them.
00:05:49,00:05:51,I have never seen them.
00:05:51,00:05:55,"You aren't looking up, James, because they're looking up."
00:05:55,00:05:56,Isn't that cool?
00:05:56,00:05:58,They call themselves the guardians of the lamps.
00:05:58,00:05:59,Nice.
00:05:59,00:06:00,British gas employees.
00:06:00,00:06:01,Yeah.
00:06:01,00:06:02,And cool.
00:06:02,00:06:09,I've discovered a really great place to buy urine online.
00:06:09,00:06:10,So I just a quick shout out.
00:06:10,00:06:15,"And if anyone here or listening needs some, they're called P-Mart, P-W-Mart."
00:06:15,00:06:16,To be called P-Bay.
00:06:16,00:06:17,"Oh, P-Bay."
00:06:17,00:06:18,Oh.
00:06:18,00:06:21,"Oh, my God, that would have been great."
00:06:21,00:06:25,"And it's basically, this is the sort of opening blurb."
00:06:25,00:06:30,"Welcome to P-Mart, your best discount online source for 100% real undiluted predator"
00:06:30,00:06:32,pee and animal urine.
00:06:32,00:06:37,So what they do is they sell to people who need urine in order to make a market smell so that
00:06:37,00:06:39,they can fend off other predators coming towards them.
00:06:39,00:06:40,"Yeah, you can get gift cards."
00:06:40,00:06:44,You can buy someone a gift card for sort of like $100 worth of pee.
00:06:44,00:06:47,And that birthday's coming up that.
00:06:47,00:06:48,Exactly.
00:06:48,00:06:49,They invented this thing called pee.
00:06:49,00:06:52,"I don't know if they invented it, but they sell it's called pee gel."
00:06:52,00:06:54,"And they say, this is an amazing product."
00:06:54,00:06:56,And I agree.
00:06:56,00:06:58,It's designed for indoor use.
00:06:58,00:07:01,So you can have that great pee smell inside your house.
00:07:01,00:07:04,"And no spilling, no mess, no fuss."
00:07:04,00:07:09,And it's just basically a gel rather than a liquid that you can just smear some urine smell
00:07:09,00:07:10,of a coyote.
00:07:10,00:07:14,"It stops, I guess, other coyotes maybe coming into your house using your sofa."
00:07:14,00:07:15,Yeah.
00:07:15,00:07:16,Yeah.
00:07:16,00:07:18,My sofa at home is full of coyotes all the time.
00:07:18,00:07:19,It's absolutely.
00:07:19,00:07:21,"We've got a new sponsor, by the way, for this week's podcast, guys."
00:07:21,00:07:22,It's P-Gel.
00:07:22,00:07:23,It's P-Mart and P-Mart.
00:07:23,00:07:24,"Yeah, P-Gel."
00:07:24,00:07:28,"But also, so you can also go down the list of all the things that they sell."
00:07:28,00:07:29,And there's lots of animals.
00:07:29,00:07:30,It's really cool.
00:07:30,00:07:33,"And they bottle them in those kind of, you know, when you go past those health shops where"
00:07:33,00:07:36,"they have up your mass, you know, all those big, huge bottles."
00:07:36,00:07:37,Up your what?
00:07:37,00:07:38,Like protein shake.
00:07:38,00:07:39,"Yeah, protein shake."
00:07:39,00:07:40,Yeah.
00:07:40,00:07:42,Let's say there's lots of different animals.
00:07:42,00:07:48,My favorite one that I saw is that you can buy one gallon of pure blackberry urine.
00:07:48,00:07:49,A gallon?
00:07:49,00:07:50,A gallon.
00:07:50,00:07:51,That's what I thought.
00:07:51,00:07:52,How long must it take a bed?
00:07:52,00:07:53,A piece of gallon of urine.
00:07:53,00:07:54,No.
00:07:54,00:07:55,And straight into the thing as well.
00:07:55,00:07:56,Yeah.
00:07:56,00:07:58,Must be a nightmare.
00:07:58,00:08:00,That could take down a building.
00:08:00,00:08:01,Yes.
00:08:01,00:08:02,Yeah.
00:08:02,00:08:06,Have you heard of a white-footed sportive lemurs?
00:08:06,00:08:07,I haven't.
00:08:07,00:08:10,"No, neither had I until I found this out."
00:08:10,00:08:12,So they're a kind of lemur and they're really anti-social.
00:08:12,00:08:15,"In fact, they actively avoid each other."
00:08:15,00:08:20,And they go to great lengths to not see their mates or their family members or anyone else.
00:08:20,00:08:23,And they only communicate using their communal toilets.
00:08:23,00:08:24,That's what they do.
00:08:24,00:08:25,What?
00:08:25,00:08:26,They leave a set mark.
00:08:26,00:08:29,They're writing little comments on the toilet wall.
00:08:29,00:08:30,"Yeah, basically."
00:08:30,00:08:31,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:31,00:08:34,"And they just go and they say, oh, good, good, you know, mumble's here or whatever."
00:08:34,00:08:35,And then--
00:08:35,00:08:36,That's what I've seen.
00:08:36,00:08:37,Your mumble's here.
00:08:37,00:08:38,LAUGHTER
00:08:38,00:08:46,"That's being nearly 80 episodes before we had our first ""Your Mum"" joke on that."
00:08:46,00:08:49,We stood out very well.
00:08:49,00:08:51,Yeah.
00:08:51,00:08:52,Other uses.
00:08:52,00:08:55,"Good uses for urine, which is backfired in this case, actually."
00:08:55,00:09:00,A family in Bristol who tried to lure back a lost dog by leaving a trail of their own urine
00:09:00,00:09:04,on the streets near their home have been criticised by the local council.
00:09:04,00:09:06,LAUGHTER
00:09:06,00:09:08,Criticised is such a nice word.
00:09:08,00:09:11,LAUGHTER
00:09:11,00:09:12,What did they--
00:09:12,00:09:16,They insist it's the best way they went on forums online until our dog is lost.
00:09:16,00:09:19,"And the people on the forum said, well, you should pee all over your town."
00:09:19,00:09:21,And it'll come back and find you.
00:09:21,00:09:24,"Apparently, it's quite a normal way of doing it, said the owner."
00:09:24,00:09:28,"Because I would just put up a sign, silly me."
00:09:28,00:09:32,There was a vet who was interviewed about it who said he would be pleasantly surprised
00:09:32,00:09:33,if it works.
00:09:33,00:09:38,"But probably, it would be better if they could, like, place jumpers and items of owners clothing."
00:09:38,00:09:41,"Because they really recognise things of that owner's smell of, so he said the only way"
00:09:41,00:09:44,that the urine thing would work was if the owner had an incontinence problem.
00:09:44,00:09:47,LAUGHTER
00:09:47,00:09:50,And we're going to have to move on to the next fact in a few minutes.
00:09:50,00:09:57,"OK, there was a book called Famicopia Batiana from 1706 by George Bate, and he had a gargle"
00:09:57,00:10:01,"for mouth ulcers, which included a white dog-turd."
00:10:01,00:10:02,Wow.
00:10:02,00:10:03,Yeah.
00:10:03,00:10:05,How do you gargle a solid thing?
00:10:05,00:10:08,I think you then dilute it in some water.
00:10:08,00:10:09,Oh.
00:10:09,00:10:10,"I would say wine, actually."
00:10:10,00:10:11,Yeah.
00:10:11,00:10:13,"Yeah, why not take the edge off it?"
00:10:13,00:10:15,LAUGHTER
00:10:15,00:10:19,"Some other uses for dogs, according to old medical dictionaries."
00:10:19,00:10:23,Here's one from Robert James in 1743.
00:10:23,00:10:28,"He said, ""Keeping a warm puppy next to one's upset belly will give a kindly and cherishing"
00:10:28,00:10:29,"heat."""
00:10:29,00:10:30,Mmm.
00:10:30,00:10:31,"It's nice, isn't it?"
00:10:31,00:10:32,Yeah.
00:10:32,00:10:33,And not quite as nice.
00:10:33,00:10:37,"Dogdung, being hot and acrid, might treat too thick."
00:10:37,00:10:38,Might.
00:10:38,00:10:43,Might as well give it a try.
00:10:43,00:10:44,Anything else?
00:10:44,00:10:49,"So there's an experiment in 1955, which I really like, where the urine of"
00:10:49,00:10:56,schizophrenics was fed to spiders to find out if they made webs any differently compared
00:10:56,00:10:58,to when they drank the urine of--
00:10:58,00:11:01,It really sounds like they're just getting words out of the heart.
00:11:01,00:11:04,"Go, schizophrenic spiders urine."
00:11:04,00:11:06,What are we going to do?
00:11:06,00:11:07,Inject.
00:11:07,00:11:08,OK.
00:11:08,00:11:10,You can imagine that.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"They thought, I bet they make really wacky webs, but it's been crazy."
00:11:13,00:11:14,They didn't.
00:11:14,00:11:17,There was no marked difference in the webs of the spiders who drank the schizophrenics
00:11:17,00:11:18,urine.
00:11:18,00:11:19,I think they could go from it.
00:11:19,00:11:23,The scientist said was that urine must taste extremely unpleasant.
00:11:23,00:11:27,"After taking just a sip, the spider's exhibited marked appearance."
00:11:27,00:11:31,"So if I was a spider, I would have made a web, which has said, ""Screw you in the middle"
00:11:31,00:11:32,"of it."""
00:11:32,00:11:33,OK.
00:11:33,00:11:36,Let's move on to our next fact.
00:11:36,00:11:38,Time for pack number two.
00:11:38,00:11:39,And that is my fact.
00:11:39,00:11:45,"My fact this week is that after the button was invented, it took more than 1,000 years"
00:11:45,00:11:47,for someone to invent the buttonhole.
00:11:47,00:11:50,What do we do with these?
00:11:50,00:11:51,What do we do?
00:11:51,00:11:52,Where do they go?
00:11:52,00:11:55,Who keeps making them?
00:11:55,00:11:58,"And they were doing things like, well, I guess we'll just latch a bit of string around it."
00:11:58,00:12:01,That might be the way it just no one thought to have created the buttonhole.
00:12:01,00:12:06,"And eventually, and I love that that must have been the biggest innovation of its day."
00:12:06,00:12:09,Just a little slit in the bit of clothing.
00:12:09,00:12:11,"It's kind of, I mean, because the loops do work."
00:12:11,00:12:17,So I think the buttonhole came about in the mid-13th century in Europe when the buttonhole came
00:12:17,00:12:18,to being.
00:12:18,00:12:19,But you know what I'm saying?
00:12:19,00:12:20,"So if you have a loop, that works perfectly well."
00:12:20,00:12:23,"I don't really see why I'm bothered to invent the buttonhole, to be honest."
00:12:23,00:12:24,That's true.
00:12:24,00:12:27,"And they have to be reinforced, as well, because you can't just cut a hole in your clothing,"
00:12:27,00:12:30,"because then that'll widen, and eventually there'll be no go for a button."
00:12:30,00:12:34,"So they do have to be reinforced, guys."
00:12:34,00:12:37,And that public service announcement was brought to you.
00:12:37,00:12:41,"Yeah, and they were used for decoration, as well, weren't they, because they really are Nate,"
00:12:41,00:12:42,and whatever.
00:12:42,00:12:47,"There was apparently really expensive, as well, according to Franco Giacati, who is the world's"
00:12:47,00:12:49,biggest button collector.
00:12:49,00:12:50,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
00:12:50,00:12:54,"Does he have the world's largest collection of buttons, or is he the world's biggest button collector?"
00:12:54,00:13:00,"He has three buttons, but he's eight but six."
00:13:00,00:13:04,"He said that there was a time when the buttons were so expensive, you could pay off a debt"
00:13:04,00:13:09,by plucking the precious button from your suit and giving it to someone.
00:13:09,00:13:10,Wow.
00:13:10,00:13:11,Where is that?
00:13:11,00:13:12,That's really cool.
00:13:12,00:13:15,"There's a really, really good article about buttons on slate.com if you want to go there"
00:13:15,00:13:17,afterwards for more button stuff.
00:13:17,00:13:18,Go on.
00:13:18,00:13:22,"The quote is, ""A button packs an extraordinary amount of information about a given time and"
00:13:22,00:13:25,"place, its provenance onto a crowded little canvas."
00:13:25,00:13:29,"Children learn to button and unbutton early in life, and they keep doing it until they're"
00:13:29,00:13:30,"dead."""
00:13:30,00:13:37,Here's a great little thing.
00:13:37,00:13:42,"Anyone in the audience here, anyone listening at home, all of us on this stage, most likely"
00:13:42,00:13:46,"the one thing that unites us, is that we're all, if you have a button on you, are wearing"
00:13:46,00:13:50,a button that comes from the same town in China.
00:13:50,00:13:58,"There is a button city in China, it's called Chalto, and Chalto produces 15 billion buttons"
00:13:58,00:13:59,a year.
00:13:59,00:14:02,And it started because I think it was three brothers.
00:14:02,00:14:05,"They just found a few buttons on the ground, and they started collecting buttons, and then"
00:14:05,00:14:08,"it turned into an industry, and it became this massive thing."
00:14:08,00:14:10,But now they make them rather than find them.
00:14:10,00:14:11,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:11,00:14:16,"One of those amazing things, they find 15 billion buttons a year, but nobody knows where"
00:14:16,00:14:17,they come from.
00:14:17,00:14:20,"Yeah, but it's not every single button in the world."
00:14:20,00:14:23,"But I think it's something like three out of five people, if they're wearing buttons,"
00:14:23,00:14:27,"wear buttons from button city, and button city apparently is amazing, and it's situated"
00:14:27,00:14:31,"very near Toothbrush city, which produces a lot of the toothbrushes in the world."
00:14:31,00:14:35,You should be next to Butten the Whole city.
00:14:35,00:14:43,"Something else about buttons, lots of Birmingham is built on buttons, so stay with me."
00:14:43,00:14:48,So Shell buttons used to be extremely popular buttons made from Mother of Pearl or Shell.
00:14:48,00:14:53,"And in the 18th century, the world's button town of the 18th century was Birmingham, but"
00:14:53,00:14:58,"they made a huge amount of the world's Shell buttons, and the best ones apparently required"
00:14:58,00:15:01,80 different processes in order to just make a button.
00:15:01,00:15:06,"And there was so much waste shell, which they produced that they dug enormous pits to bury"
00:15:06,00:15:07,it all.
00:15:07,00:15:11,"And lots of buildings in Birmingham today, especially in the jewelry quarter, have their foundations"
00:15:11,00:15:12,on Mother of Pearl.
00:15:12,00:15:14,So they're all on sort of buttons in Butten of Pearl.
00:15:14,00:15:15,Wow.
00:15:15,00:15:16,Who was that?
00:15:16,00:15:17,I did not know that.
00:15:17,00:15:18,It's really interesting.
00:15:18,00:15:21,Did you know that cloth buttons were illegal in 17th century France?
00:15:21,00:15:22,No.
00:15:22,00:15:23,They sound totally useless.
00:15:23,00:15:24,I would ban them.
00:15:24,00:15:25,Like buttons made of cloth.
00:15:25,00:15:26,That wasn't the reason they banned them.
00:15:26,00:15:28,"Basically, it was due to big button."
00:15:28,00:15:29,Yeah.
00:15:29,00:15:39,It was the handicraft industry who said that basically by making these cloth buttons it was going
00:15:39,00:15:43,"to make our other buttons made out of pearl or whatever, they were going to make them obsolete."
00:15:43,00:15:49,"And it was so bad that officials would go to houses and search them, looking for buttons."
00:15:49,00:15:53,And you could be arrested for enjoying the button in the privacy of your own home.
00:15:53,00:15:56,"I got into this article, I read."
00:15:56,00:15:57,Wow.
00:15:57,00:16:00,"When we say enjoying a button, I mean, you're enjoying a button."
00:16:00,00:16:04,I think you might have to be arrested.
00:16:04,00:16:08,"There was, so a button alternative since we didn't really figure out the buttonhole thing"
00:16:08,00:16:13,"in ancient Greece, in ancient Rome, was the fibula, which was a four and other safety"
00:16:13,00:16:14,pin.
00:16:14,00:16:16,It essentially was exactly like a safety pin.
00:16:16,00:16:17,And they had these in ancient Greece and Rome.
00:16:17,00:16:21,"And that's an example of one of these things, which I love, which is an invention that vanished"
00:16:21,00:16:22,"for about 2,000 years."
00:16:22,00:16:25,And a safety pin resurfaced in...
00:16:25,00:16:28,So they had a safety pin in ancient Greece?
00:16:28,00:16:29,Yeah.
00:16:29,00:16:30,Yeah.
00:16:30,00:16:31,So that's why they did that there.
00:16:31,00:16:32,Tunex.
00:16:32,00:16:35,"The guy who invented the modern safety pin was called Walter Hunt, I think."
00:16:35,00:16:40,"And he sold his patent for $400 because he had, he had like a gambling debt or something."
00:16:40,00:16:43,"So he sold his patent so that he could pay off his debt because he thought, oh, it's"
00:16:43,00:16:44,a safety pin.
00:16:44,00:16:45,It's nothing.
00:16:45,00:16:46,It's not really important.
00:16:46,00:16:50,"That is how I feel about safety, it depends, to be honest, but actually, as a commercial"
00:16:50,00:16:51,person.
00:16:51,00:16:56,"And also, he invented, I think, like a sewing machine, like similar to, it lies how invented"
00:16:56,00:16:58,"the actual sewing machine, but he did a precursor to it."
00:16:58,00:17:02,And he didn't patent that because he thought it would put a lot of seamstresses out of
00:17:02,00:17:03,work.
00:17:03,00:17:04,"Oh, no!"
00:17:04,00:17:05,Yeah.
00:17:05,00:17:07,Did the opposite of that?
00:17:07,00:17:08,[Laughter]
00:17:08,00:17:10,Created a massive global industry.
00:17:10,00:17:11,[Laughter]
00:17:11,00:17:12,"Oh, my friend."
00:17:12,00:17:13,[Laughter]
00:17:13,00:17:17,"One thing that buttons, so when the buttonhole did come into being, one thing that they were"
00:17:17,00:17:22,useful in fashion between 13th and 15th centuries was detachable sleeves.
00:17:22,00:17:27,"So that was a really fashionable thing, is that you would have, you know, you could swap between"
00:17:27,00:17:28,outfits.
00:17:28,00:17:30,"It would look like you were wearing a different outfit every time, you had lots, you had"
00:17:30,00:17:32,"a sleeve drawer, which was just sleeves."
00:17:32,00:17:33,No.
00:17:33,00:17:34,"And you'd probably, they did."
00:17:34,00:17:35,I don't know.
00:17:35,00:17:36,They had lots of different sleeves.
00:17:36,00:17:37,[Laughter]
00:17:37,00:17:38,Where else are you going to keep the sleeves?
00:17:38,00:17:39,That's really cool.
00:17:39,00:17:40,That is really cool.
00:17:40,00:17:41,That's amazing.
00:17:41,00:17:42,Yeah.
00:17:42,00:17:45,"One day, you might accidentally leave the house with odd sleeves on."
00:17:45,00:17:47,"Oh, disaster."
00:17:47,00:17:48,Yeah.
00:17:48,00:17:51,"And then some people say, he's just doing on purpose to be pretentious."
00:17:51,00:17:52,Yeah.
00:17:52,00:17:56,"So, basically, before the buttonhole was invented, buttons did become very popular."
00:17:56,00:17:59,Everyone was wearing them ornamentally.
00:17:59,00:18:04,"And one of the hangovers of that time, which we rarely think about, I was reading this in"
00:18:04,00:18:05,Bill Bryson's book at home.
00:18:05,00:18:10,"If you think about a suit coat and the buttons by the cuff, they're not practical buttons."
00:18:10,00:18:12,They're just ornamental.
00:18:12,00:18:13,"So, do you want a mental on each side?"
00:18:13,00:18:14,"Yeah, that is weird."
00:18:14,00:18:15,Yeah.
00:18:15,00:18:17,"So, that's a hangover from back in the day pre-buttonhole."
00:18:17,00:18:22,"Well, so another hangover, which we are wearing every day, every female in the audience, symbols"
00:18:22,00:18:26,"of sexism of the olden days, is the fact that buttons on women's clothes are on the opposite"
00:18:26,00:18:28,side to buttons on men's clothes.
00:18:28,00:18:29,"So, there are loads of theories about why that is."
00:18:29,00:18:33,"Well, the main theory I've heard is that women were dressed by maids."
00:18:33,00:18:34,Yeah.
00:18:34,00:18:38,"And so, the maids who were mostly right handed would kind of be easier for them because it"
00:18:38,00:18:39,"was on the left hand side, whereas men dressed themselves."
00:18:39,00:18:42,I thought it was because all women are left handed.
00:18:42,00:18:47,"I've heard so, yeah, I think that is the main theory."
00:18:47,00:18:50,"Although, like anyway, it's just the main theory, the main theory."
00:18:50,00:18:52,"No, no, the all the family theory."
00:18:52,00:18:53,"Oh, really?"
00:18:53,00:18:54,"Yeah, it's true."
00:18:54,00:19:00,"But another theory is that, so men have them on the right hand side because they would"
00:19:00,00:19:04,have their weapons in their right hand when they were kind of weapons.
00:19:04,00:19:05,"So, they would be..."
00:19:05,00:19:08,"So, when you're trying to get undressed and kill someone at the same time."
00:19:08,00:19:11,"Exactly, it's much easier, one-handed."
00:19:11,00:19:15,"I will deal to the death, but... *laughs*"
00:19:15,00:19:17,*laughs*
00:19:17,00:19:24,Gillian Lincoln's can't stand to be in the same room as friends and family who word buttons.
00:19:24,00:19:25,Who?
00:19:25,00:19:30,"She's called Gillian Lincoln's and she has something called ""Koom Poomophobia"", which is the fear"
00:19:30,00:19:31,of buttons.
00:19:31,00:19:36,"She's had it since she was age seven, and her boyfriend, Nate Dorrington, can only work"
00:19:36,00:19:38,clothes with zips.
00:19:38,00:19:39,Wow.
00:19:39,00:19:41,"Her name is Lincoln's, which is nicely ironic."
00:19:41,00:19:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:42,00:19:43,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:43,00:19:44,And the function of a button.
00:19:44,00:19:45,Do you know who else had that?
00:19:45,00:19:46,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:46,00:19:47,We must have read the same thing.
00:19:47,00:19:48,"Yeah, let's say it together."
00:19:48,00:19:49,"Okay, ready?"
00:19:49,00:19:50,"One, two, three."
00:19:50,00:19:51,Steve Jobs.
00:19:51,00:19:57,"Steve Jobs was scared of buttons, and partially there's a theory that that's why it led to the"
00:19:57,00:19:59,buttonless iPhone because he was so...
00:19:59,00:20:01,*laughter*
00:20:01,00:20:04,"Yeah, so Steve Jobs, he actually had a fear of buttons."
00:20:04,00:20:06,"Yeah, he did say that in..."
00:20:06,00:20:07,"Yeah, 2007, I think."
00:20:07,00:20:13,"The other person who had a fear of buttons was Napoleon's, I think, great granddaughter, Marie"
00:20:13,00:20:14,Bonaparte.
00:20:14,00:20:15,"Oh, really?"
00:20:15,00:20:16,Really?
00:20:16,00:20:17,Yep.
00:20:17,00:20:18,Wow.
00:20:18,00:20:19,That's true.
00:20:19,00:20:20,Is she the one who had a clitoris moved?
00:20:20,00:20:21,Yeah.
00:20:21,00:20:22,Moved?
00:20:22,00:20:23,I don't know.
00:20:23,00:20:24,We can't wait for it.
00:20:24,00:20:25,Just to a holiday house.
00:20:25,00:20:26,*laughter*
00:20:26,00:20:27,Yeah.
00:20:27,00:20:30,"Very, very quickly."
00:20:30,00:20:34,She did some studies where she looked at the distance between the clitoris and the vagina
00:20:34,00:20:38,where there were lots of women and found out that those where it was closer had more orgasms
00:20:38,00:20:42,"and she wants to have more orgasms, so moved her clitoris surgically close, etc."
00:20:42,00:20:44,She had to move twice and it didn't work.
00:20:44,00:20:45,It's very sad.
00:20:45,00:20:46,It's extremely sad.
00:20:46,00:20:47,"Yeah, yeah."
00:20:47,00:20:49,How the mighty families have fallen.
00:20:49,00:20:51,*laughter*
00:20:51,00:20:55,"Napoleon's army actually had a situation with buttons, which was that their buttons were"
00:20:55,00:20:57,made out of tin.
00:20:57,00:20:58,And I've read.
00:20:58,00:21:00,"I don't know if this is actually a solid theory, but apparently when they were marching"
00:21:00,00:21:05,"into Russia, it was so cold that the tin crumbled and so their uniforms opened wide up and suddenly"
00:21:05,00:21:09,"they were exposed to the cold and that's what led to a lot of deaths, so..."
00:21:09,00:21:14,"So, as they were invading, it was kind of like watching the full Monty coming towards you."
00:21:14,00:21:15,*laughter*
00:21:15,00:21:16,I've read that theory.
00:21:16,00:21:18,I've read different things about it though.
00:21:18,00:21:20,"I've read people contradicting it and people saying yes, no, it's definitely a year."
00:21:20,00:21:21,"So, yeah, I'm not sure."
00:21:21,00:21:22,I'm going to have to move us on.
00:21:22,00:21:23,Go worries.
00:21:23,00:21:24,Anyone else?
00:21:24,00:21:25,Got something?
00:21:25,00:21:31,Just that the button replacement is the zip in the modern era and you've got to be aware
00:21:31,00:21:37,of the zip because it is by far and away the most common cause of penis injury.
00:21:37,00:21:45,"So, between 2002 and 2010, there were almost 18,000 people in the US alone who were hospitalised"
00:21:45,00:21:46,because of penile injury.
00:21:46,00:21:49,You can imagine they all arrived on the same day.
00:21:49,00:21:51,Imagine the coincidence.
00:21:51,00:21:54,It was after a big charity pulled your flies up.
00:21:54,00:22:00,"And also, possibly not interestingly for men, but it is almost only ever the penis and not"
00:22:00,00:22:04,"the testicles or good news of the testicles, very hard to get them caught in the zip."
00:22:04,00:22:10,"It's more like, it's not like no news for the testicles and very, very bad news for the penis."
00:22:10,00:22:13,"When they invented the zip, it was marketed as a better way to do up your trousers as you"
00:22:13,00:22:19,"are less likely to forget to do up a zipper as you were to forget to do up buttons, but also"
00:22:19,00:22:26,less likely to chop your cock off with buttons.
00:22:26,00:22:32,"OK, time for fact number three and that is Andy Murray."
00:22:32,00:22:38,"OK, my fact is that as a baby, St Nicholas refused to drink his mother's breast milk on"
00:22:38,00:22:42,fast days.
00:22:42,00:22:48,"So on Wednesdays and Fridays, St Nicholas would refuse to suckle because he was so holy,"
00:22:48,00:22:52,"so young, except in the evening when it was allowed because the day was over."
00:22:52,00:22:54,So there are other saints where this happens.
00:22:54,00:22:59,"So there's a biography of the fifth century St Candid, which says that as a baby, he completely"
00:22:59,00:23:02,refused to suckle at his mother's right breast.
00:23:02,00:23:06,"But if she had eaten a delicious meal, he also refused to suckle at her left breast."
00:23:06,00:23:07,Wow.
00:23:07,00:23:08,What?
00:23:08,00:23:10,So he wasn't allowed to enjoy it too much.
00:23:10,00:23:13,"So if she didn't have delicious meal, then it breastmilk is more delicious."
00:23:13,00:23:14,Exactly.
00:23:14,00:23:15,It was like an abstinence thing.
00:23:15,00:23:19,Maybe there's so much more advance than we give them credit for.
00:23:19,00:23:21,Do you know who the patron saint of breastfeeding is?
00:23:21,00:23:22,It's not St Nicholas.
00:23:22,00:23:24,"No, it's St Giles."
00:23:24,00:23:28,"And before he became a saint, he withdrew deep into the forest near Neem, where he lived"
00:23:28,00:23:29,on his own.
00:23:29,00:23:33,And his sole companion was a deer who sustained him with her milk.
00:23:33,00:23:34,Oh.
00:23:34,00:23:38,A weird person to nominate is a patron saint of breastfeeding because it is not a conventional
00:23:38,00:23:39,way to breastfeed.
00:23:39,00:23:40,Yeah.
00:23:40,00:23:44,"But he is also the patron saint of Edinburgh, St Giles."
00:23:44,00:23:47,And the patron saint of people who are afraid of the dark.
00:23:47,00:23:48,Wow.
00:23:48,00:23:49,Yeah.
00:23:49,00:23:50,That's very good knowledge.
00:23:50,00:23:51,Wow.
00:23:51,00:23:56,"And the patron saint of Glasgow is St Mungo, and St Mungo died of shock after getting to a very"
00:23:56,00:23:57,hot bath.
00:23:57,00:24:05,"Guys, I think I can handle a bath."
00:24:05,00:24:06,"It is really hot, St Mungo."
00:24:06,00:24:07,Please.
00:24:07,00:24:11,Why are you calling me saint?
00:24:11,00:24:16,"So just one more saint. St Gwen, the white, was the mother of two young sons, and then she"
00:24:16,00:24:18,gave birth to a third son.
00:24:18,00:24:24,"And in order to help her, nursing her third infant, God miraculously gave her a third breast."
00:24:24,00:24:27,And she became known as Gwen of the three paps.
00:24:27,00:24:28,Anyway.
00:24:28,00:24:39,"St Nicholas about this fact is, so one of his miracles, which is particularly impressive,"
00:24:39,00:24:40,I think.
00:24:40,00:24:45,"He was someone who was selling pickled ham in a street market, and St Nicholas realised"
00:24:45,00:24:47,that he was not selling pickled ham as the science suggested.
00:24:47,00:24:52,"He was selling the pickled, chopped up bodies of three small children, and he pieced them"
00:24:52,00:24:53,together.
00:24:53,00:24:57,But it's not sad because he pieced them together and he brought the children back to life
00:24:57,00:24:58,again.
00:24:58,00:24:59,"So that is impressive, isn't it?"
00:24:59,00:25:00,The Gurkin triplets.
00:25:00,00:25:01,Yeah.
00:25:01,00:25:02,I got.
00:25:02,00:25:06,"Yeah, we should clarify that, like stories about what saints do, we're not necessarily"
00:25:06,00:25:07,presenting us.
00:25:07,00:25:08,I know.
00:25:08,00:25:11,"I don't know what to write down as interesting, because it sounds like wherever he walked, he"
00:25:11,00:25:14,would be in a situation and he would pray it away.
00:25:14,00:25:18,"So he'd be like, oh, we're at the ocean, and we're in the ocean, and sailors are vomiting,"
00:25:18,00:25:19,and there's a whirlpool.
00:25:19,00:25:20,I'll just do a quick prayer.
00:25:20,00:25:23,"What is true about him actually is that he slapped somebody once, and he slapped a fellow"
00:25:23,00:25:24,bishop.
00:25:24,00:25:30,"Yes, because it's the great Aryan controversy, which is the controversy about whether Jesus"
00:25:30,00:25:36,is actually fully divine or whether he's sort of half divine because he was also a human.
00:25:36,00:25:40,"And basically, it's the Nicholas strongly believed that Jesus is God, and someone suggested"
00:25:40,00:25:43,that Jesus wasn't quite either divine or human.
00:25:43,00:25:49,"And he got up, it was at some sign-on in the year 325 AD, and the Nicholas got up, crossed"
00:25:49,00:25:51,"the room, and gave him a big slap round the face."
00:25:51,00:25:52,Wow.
00:25:52,00:25:58,"And that is where we get the phrase, bashing the bishop."
00:25:58,00:26:06,"So, yeah, I'm not sure, like you're saying, the saints didn't do these things, is that?"
00:26:06,00:26:11,"That's that religious, in any way, for instance, there are a few saints who would decapitated"
00:26:11,00:26:13,and carried their own heads.
00:26:13,00:26:14,You're saying that that didn't happen as well?
00:26:14,00:26:16,"No, I definitely am not saying that."
00:26:16,00:26:23,"Saint Jean of Lajara who carried his own severed head and threw it into the throne, or Paul"
00:26:23,00:26:30,"of Tarsus, who had his head shot off, and then said, ""Jesus Christ, 50 times after it"
00:26:30,00:26:31,"have been shot off."""
00:26:31,00:26:32,Wow.
00:26:32,00:26:34,"Well, you might not have said it in that way, but 50 times."
00:26:34,00:26:38,"50 times as a mate, or the first time it would be amazing, and then the tenth time it would"
00:26:38,00:26:39,"be, ""Okay, we've got to eat."""
00:26:39,00:26:43,"It's about a 50th time, ""Okay, can you just shut up, man?"""
00:26:43,00:26:48,"There's actually a real problem with Saint Sue, our beheaded, and then carry their heads"
00:26:48,00:26:49,around where to put the halo.
00:26:49,00:26:54,"So, I think there's some controversy as to whether you put it over their severed neck"
00:26:54,00:26:58,"when you're painting them, or whether you put it above the head here, and there's mixed"
00:26:58,00:26:59,views.
00:26:59,00:27:00,We'll see both.
00:27:00,00:27:01,You'll see both.
00:27:01,00:27:02,Wow.
00:27:02,00:27:03,Wow.
00:27:03,00:27:08,Can I bring it back to breast milk very quickly here?
00:27:08,00:27:09,Okay.
00:27:09,00:27:11,Is this another website?
00:27:11,00:27:15,"So, I found a great place to buy breast milk online."
00:27:15,00:27:21,"So, only thebreast.com, and this genuinely is simply the breast."
00:27:21,00:27:25,I know we should have been right.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"Think out there, guys."
00:27:27,00:27:33,"And this is a genuine place where people trade breast milk online, and you have all sorts"
00:27:33,00:27:36,"of categories, subcategories of types of breast milk that you can buy and have shipped"
00:27:36,00:27:37,to your house.
00:27:37,00:27:39,You can have zero to two months.
00:27:39,00:27:44,"There was fresh breast milk on demand, special diet, brackets, vegan, etc."
00:27:44,00:27:47,And then the final one is willing to sell to men.
00:27:47,00:27:48,Yeah.
00:27:48,00:27:50,"Pretty disgusting, right?"
00:27:50,00:27:54,"I've heard, I don't know if this is true, that bodybuilders like to have breast milk,"
00:27:54,00:27:59,"because they're theory, and apparently this is complete rubbish, but their theory is"
00:27:59,00:28:04,"a baby goes from really small to quite big, and a really small amount of time."
00:28:04,00:28:09,"So, surely the same will happen to my muscles."
00:28:09,00:28:12,"Do you want to combine, marrying the two together, saints and breast milk?"
00:28:12,00:28:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:28:13,00:28:16,Have you heard of the miracle of the lactation of st. Bernard?
00:28:16,00:28:22,"This is where st. Bernard was praying, and the Virgin Mary, one who was praying, sprinkled"
00:28:22,00:28:28,"some milk on his lips, as in her own breast milk, and there are other depictions of it,"
00:28:28,00:28:29,which are quite impressive.
00:28:29,00:28:33,"So, I'm quoting directly from the Wikipedia article about the lactation of st. Bernard."
00:28:33,00:28:38,"In art, he usually kneels before a Madonna lactens, breastfeeding Madonna, and as Jesus takes"
00:28:38,00:28:42,"a break from feeding, the Virgin squeezes her breast, and he is hit with a squirt of milk,"
00:28:42,00:28:44,often shown travelling and impressive distance.
00:28:44,00:28:45,That's true.
00:28:45,00:28:50,"It is across the room that it's depicted, and it's medieval artworks that you get this"
00:28:50,00:28:51,in.
00:28:51,00:28:52,Yeah.
00:28:52,00:28:53,"Well, man can that take?"
00:28:53,00:28:54,Can't they?
00:28:54,00:28:55,Yes.
00:28:55,00:28:58,"You've discussed it before, have you massaged your nipples enough as a man, then you can"
00:28:58,00:28:59,bring it on?
00:28:59,00:29:01,"Did you ever do that experiment, Andy?"
00:29:01,00:29:03,"I was it done, who was going to do it?"
00:29:03,00:29:05,"I did have a go, yes."
00:29:05,00:29:06,Yeah.
00:29:06,00:29:08,And was it successful?
00:29:08,00:29:09,Not a dribble.
00:29:09,00:29:10,Nothing.
00:29:10,00:29:11,Furious.
00:29:11,00:29:12,It's been all weeks.
00:29:12,00:29:15,It's so weird on the train.
00:29:15,00:29:16,It's research.
00:29:16,00:29:18,It's a research.
00:29:18,00:29:19,Yeah.
00:29:19,00:29:20,No.
00:29:20,00:29:21,No.
00:29:21,00:29:22,No.
00:29:22,00:29:23,Not a drop yet.
00:29:23,00:29:24,Yeah.
00:29:24,00:29:26,I'm not getting up.
00:29:26,00:29:31,"Do you want to hear about St. Philip Neary, who's known as the humorous saint?"
00:29:31,00:29:32,Wow.
00:29:32,00:29:33,Yeah.
00:29:33,00:29:34,"It's like, oh, I've got a really funny mate."
00:29:34,00:29:35,Yeah.
00:29:35,00:29:36,You've got to meet him.
00:29:36,00:29:37,Funny Mike.
00:29:37,00:29:38,It really is like that.
00:29:38,00:29:40,It's so sad.
00:29:40,00:29:44,His basically all he did that was funny is he once shaved off half his beard as a way of
00:29:44,00:29:50,"poking fun at himself, and he also liked to wear a cushion on his head."
00:29:50,00:29:51,How come?
00:29:51,00:29:58,"And he's doing his debut solo hour, sea venues."
00:29:58,00:30:00,So he was sainted for that?
00:30:00,00:30:02,He must have done some other stuff.
00:30:02,00:30:03,I don't know.
00:30:03,00:30:06,"It was very much easier back then, wasn't it?"
00:30:06,00:30:08,We're going to have to move on very soon.
00:30:08,00:30:12,"Can I just tell you very quickly about the infancy gospels of Jesus, because as another"
00:30:12,00:30:15,"young, more than a saint, he was a Jesus, wasn't he?"
00:30:15,00:30:25,"So there are some second-century sources which describe what Jesus did as a very, very small"
00:30:25,00:30:27,boy when he was about five years old.
00:30:27,00:30:31,"And they're really amazing, because they're very different to the gospels."
00:30:31,00:30:35,"So when he was five years old, he gathered together separate rivers, which had all been"
00:30:35,00:30:39,"desperate pools of water and he gathered them into a single pond, and he cleaned it up,"
00:30:39,00:30:44,and then a boy ruined them by sort of sweeping them apart with the broom.
00:30:44,00:30:47,So Jesus immediately just made the boy withered.
00:30:47,00:30:51,"And then there was another time when a boy bumped into him and he, Jesus, immediately killed"
00:30:51,00:30:52,him.
00:30:52,00:30:53,Wow.
00:30:53,00:30:54,Oh my God.
00:30:54,00:30:58,"The parents of the boy who Jesus has killed go to Joseph saying, ""Your son's killed our"
00:30:58,00:30:59,"son."""
00:30:59,00:31:05,So Jesus simply struck blind all of his accuses.
00:31:05,00:31:11,"And then Joseph sort of boxes his ear and tells him off, ""Wow, infancy gospels, look"
00:31:11,00:31:14,"come up, they're really good."""
00:31:14,00:31:18,It's time for our final fact and that is Joszynski.
00:31:18,00:31:24,"Yeah, my fact is that when Ronald Reagan left office, he left a note on the White House"
00:31:24,00:31:28,lawn for these squirrels warning them to beware of George Bush's dogs.
00:31:28,00:31:32,"Yeah, it's quite sweet, isn't it?"
00:31:32,00:31:33,It's sweet.
00:31:33,00:31:35,"Yeah, but also he's assuming that squirrels can read, is he?"
00:31:35,00:31:40,"Yeah, I mean he wasn't the sharpest on the shed, but he was very fond of the squirrels."
00:31:40,00:31:45,"And sadly, George Bush recounted later that it did absolutely no good because their dog"
00:31:45,00:31:48,"millie beat the heck out of those squirrels whenever he could, she could."
00:31:48,00:31:49,"Oh, wow."
00:31:49,00:31:52,"You should have left also a sign for the dog saying, ""Don't get the squirrels."""
00:31:52,00:31:54,I didn't need to do that.
00:31:54,00:31:55,Yeah.
00:31:55,00:32:00,"They currently have, and this is like hot off the press, the White House is having squirrel"
00:32:00,00:32:03,issues at the moment with Michelle Obama's garden.
00:32:03,00:32:05,"Oh, well, because they always dig up."
00:32:05,00:32:10,My friends spent an entire weekend planting lots of bulbs in her garden and went back and
00:32:10,00:32:11,like a hundred bulbs of them and dug up.
00:32:11,00:32:12,So it's probably that.
00:32:12,00:32:17,There's a silly little legal issue that the gardeners are not allowed to touch the bit of
00:32:17,00:32:21,"garden that she's created, but she's away so much that she's actually not able to maintain"
00:32:21,00:32:22,it.
00:32:22,00:32:25,"They can't mo it, they can't weed it, they can't do anything to it, but water it, and it's"
00:32:25,00:32:26,just been...
00:32:26,00:32:31,So they're allowed to go near the first lady's garden?
00:32:31,00:32:32,Yeah.
00:32:32,00:32:33,I cannot really.
00:32:33,00:32:35,"So that she's saying to them, ""Please do go near it."""
00:32:35,00:32:39,"And they're like, ""We want to, but there's this clause somewhere in our legislation that"
00:32:39,00:32:41,"says we're not allowed to touch your bit of garden."""
00:32:41,00:32:43,I genuinely didn't read the article.
00:32:43,00:32:45,I have no idea what.
00:32:45,00:32:46,But they are.
00:32:46,00:32:50,So squirrels are prolific on the White House lawn and Reagan was really fond of them and
00:32:50,00:32:51,it's kind of touching.
00:32:51,00:32:54,"So every time he went to Camp David, he'd bring lots of acorns back from there to feed the"
00:32:54,00:32:55,squirrels.
00:32:55,00:32:56,I was reading a trans...
00:32:56,00:32:57,What?
00:32:57,00:32:59,"Yeah, he loved to feed the squirrels."
00:32:59,00:33:03,I was reading a transcript of an interview that he was having.
00:33:03,00:33:09,"I think it was with the New York Times where basically he...there was in the transcript, there's"
00:33:09,00:33:13,"a pause at one point and he says, ""Oh, sorry if I look out the window and look distracted,"
00:33:13,00:33:16,"I'm just seeing if the squirrels are still eating the acorns that I brought in this morning."""
00:33:16,00:33:17,Oh my god.
00:33:17,00:33:21,"Well, it's a good thing there wasn't anything going on at the time, like the Cold War."
00:33:21,00:33:22,Wow.
00:33:22,00:33:23,Come on.
00:33:23,00:33:24,It's cute.
00:33:24,00:33:30,I read a thing about Reagan because Reagan was obviously...he was an actor in B-Movies.
00:33:30,00:33:33,He was starting films with amazing titles.
00:33:33,00:33:39,"Accidents will happen, girls on probation, the angels wash their faces, brother, rat and"
00:33:39,00:33:40,a baby.
00:33:40,00:33:45,But his...but his IMDB page begins with this quotation.
00:33:45,00:33:49,Ronald Reagan is arguably the most successful actor in history and they've faced that on the
00:33:49,00:33:56,fact that he became president of America but it's not a success as an actor.
00:33:56,00:34:00,I really like the pedantic nature of that comment because he is the most successful
00:34:00,00:34:02,person who has also been an actor.
00:34:02,00:34:03,Yes.
00:34:03,00:34:04,You can't fault it.
00:34:04,00:34:05,That's true.
00:34:05,00:34:06,That's true.
00:34:06,00:34:10,Did you guys know that it is because of him that we have blue jelly beans?
00:34:10,00:34:11,No.
00:34:11,00:34:12,No.
00:34:12,00:34:13,Why?
00:34:13,00:34:14,I didn't know we have blue jelly beans actually.
00:34:14,00:34:16,You always feel the skepticism emanating.
00:34:16,00:34:17,I know.
00:34:17,00:34:20,"The whole room goes, it's not true, isn't it?"
00:34:20,00:34:21,It's true.
00:34:21,00:34:23,It was for his inauguration.
00:34:23,00:34:25,"So basically, he was a massive jelly bean lover."
00:34:25,00:34:30,The reason he was a massive jelly bean lover is because he had a huge pipe smoking habit
00:34:30,00:34:32,and he hated it and he didn't want to smoke anymore.
00:34:32,00:34:38,The only thing that would stop him from having any nicotine would be to have a jar of jelly
00:34:38,00:34:39,beans.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"And often, if you look at photos of Ronald Reagan in all the meetings that he's in, there's"
00:34:42,00:34:44,a big jar of jelly beans next to him.
00:34:44,00:34:45,Wow.
00:34:45,00:34:46,And so he loved licorice.
00:34:46,00:34:50,That was his favorite type of jelly bean before the inauguration because jelly bean
00:34:50,00:34:51,caught on to it.
00:34:51,00:34:52,They thought we're going to create one.
00:34:52,00:34:55,"We don't have a blue one for the red, white and blue."
00:34:55,00:34:56,And so they created it.
00:34:56,00:34:57,"And so, yeah."
00:34:57,00:34:58,Ronald Reagan.
00:34:58,00:34:59,Wow.
00:34:59,00:35:00,That is really interesting.
00:35:00,00:35:01,Thank you.
00:35:01,00:35:03,One thing he didn't like was Brussels sprouts.
00:35:03,00:35:08,He once did a trip to England and he was fed so many Brussels sprouts during his trip that
00:35:08,00:35:11,he swore off them for the rest of his life.
00:35:11,00:35:16,But they told him they were green jelly beans as they created it in his honour.
00:35:16,00:35:20,"You know, when he was an actor, so I was reading, he actually wrote two autobiographies, but"
00:35:20,00:35:22,his later one after he was president.
00:35:22,00:35:24,He told about when he was an actor.
00:35:24,00:35:29,And the fact that there was a lot of talk backstage about how small his head was.
00:35:29,00:35:32,"And so he was there with this casting director who was saying, ""What are we going to do about"
00:35:32,00:35:33,"Ronald's head?"""
00:35:33,00:35:36,You could stay in the actors slightly further away from him.
00:35:36,00:35:39,"And then it would match the size of their heads from back there, yeah."
00:35:39,00:35:44,"But then his body looks weirdly large, so it's fine that, to be in a successful actor,"
00:35:44,00:35:48,he had to have very wide colours to minimise his shoulder width and have colours that
00:35:48,00:35:50,were sort of open up a little bit lower.
00:35:50,00:35:54,"So it looked like his head was a bit bigger, I guess, to increase the amount of skin exposure"
00:35:54,00:35:55,in the head area.
00:35:55,00:35:56,That's amazing.
00:35:56,00:35:57,Yeah.
00:35:57,00:35:58,Poor guy.
00:35:58,00:36:04,"Imagine, he was the most successful actor of all time, so that is true."
00:36:04,00:36:11,Who can forget watching Brother Rattander Baby every Christmas?
00:36:11,00:36:14,"You know, he wrote his first autobiography 16 years before he became president?"
00:36:14,00:36:15,Wow.
00:36:15,00:36:18,"In 1965, he was saying, ""And it was called ""Where's the rest of me?"""
00:36:18,00:36:22,What did he talk about his head?
00:36:22,00:36:26,"Was this next autobiography called ""Here it is?"""
00:36:26,00:36:32,Very forward thinking.
00:36:32,00:36:37,"He was once threatened by a guy who was going to attack him, and the way he was known as"
00:36:37,00:36:42,"the Katman, and the reason was because he would send threatening letters, but also pictures"
00:36:42,00:36:43,of Katz.
00:36:43,00:36:45,"Oh, the president."
00:36:45,00:36:46,Yeah.
00:36:46,00:36:48,"That is the precursor to the internet, I think."
00:36:48,00:36:53,"Lots of purpose was abuse, and then pictures of Katz."
00:36:53,00:36:57,"And the other thing that Reagan started was the idea that whenever a president leaves, he"
00:36:57,00:37:02,"always leaves a note for the next president, and he wrote a note saying, ""Don't let the"
00:37:02,00:37:05,"turkeys get you down to George Bush."""
00:37:05,00:37:06,Sorry.
00:37:06,00:37:07,What is the relevant of the turkeys?
00:37:07,00:37:10,"The turkeys is in the press, the other countries."
00:37:10,00:37:12,Don't let the turkeys get you down.
00:37:12,00:37:14,"It's not about turkeys, is it?"
00:37:14,00:37:19,Because that's a very specifically racist thing to say when you're taking over the most
00:37:19,00:37:20,powerful mission.
00:37:20,00:37:27,"So this was discovered by Brad Meltzer, not the fact that that note was left for Bush, but"
00:37:27,00:37:31,"that Bush then said, ""I left a note for Clinton."""
00:37:31,00:37:34,"And Brad Meltzer, he's a crime writer, political thrillers."
00:37:34,00:37:37,"He then said, ""This is apparently, he thinks this is true."""
00:37:37,00:37:41,"Wherever Ronald Reagan went, he had a briefcase with him, and always carried a hand-held gun"
00:37:41,00:37:42,on him.
00:37:42,00:37:43,Okay.
00:37:43,00:37:48,What's the opposite of a hand-held gun?
00:37:48,00:37:59,A foot-propelled bow and arrow.
00:37:59,00:38:01,"He was, I just always think this is amazing."
00:38:01,00:38:06,"His Chief of Staff, do people know what his Chief of Staff it's called?"
00:38:06,00:38:07,Ronald Reagan's.
00:38:07,00:38:08,Yeah.
00:38:08,00:38:09,No.
00:38:09,00:38:13,He was called Donald Reagan.
00:38:13,00:38:17,"I don't understand why this isn't the most well-known fact on the base of the earth, and"
00:38:17,00:38:21,"the Chief of Staff who preceded him was called Baker, so the Chief of Staff who preceded Donald"
00:38:21,00:38:25,"Reagan was called Howard Baker, and the guy who came after him was called James Baker."
00:38:25,00:38:29,"So people say Ronald Reagan was a bit confused in the '80s, but I definitely see where he's"
00:38:29,00:38:30,coming from.
00:38:30,00:38:31,Yes.
00:38:31,00:38:36,"Annoyingly, we're running out of time, in fact, we're on the time-run-out moment, so any"
00:38:36,00:38:37,last facts?
00:38:37,00:38:38,I'm very quick.
00:38:38,00:38:39,One about squirrels?
00:38:39,00:38:40,"Yeah, one."
00:38:40,00:38:43,"It used to be illegal, not to report a gray squirrel in your garden."
00:38:43,00:38:44,Really?
00:38:44,00:38:45,Yeah.
00:38:45,00:38:49,I think that gray squirrels were brought to the UK by Benjamin Franklin.
00:38:49,00:38:56,"He brought squirrels over to the UK, according to newsforsquirrels.com, the blog."
00:38:56,00:38:57,How many years does it get?
00:38:57,00:39:02,It's had a lot this week.
00:39:02,00:39:05,Male-caped ground squirrels have very big genitalia.
00:39:05,00:39:13,"The penises can be 40% the length of their body, and they can undo auto-filate, yeah."
00:39:13,00:39:17,"And according to researcher Jane Warteman, they do it to clean their genitals."
00:39:17,00:39:20,"Sorry, we'll send you usual buttony of this."
00:39:20,00:39:25,"Sorry, only 40% got it, no, no, no, no, that doesn't do it."
00:39:25,00:39:26,"Okay, that's it."
00:39:26,00:39:27,That's all of our facts.
00:39:27,00:39:28,"Thank you so much for being here, guys."
