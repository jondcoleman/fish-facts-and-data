1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 What do you think about it?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:15,520
 Hello and welcome to another episode and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,080
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,080
 My name is Dan Triber.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,440
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski, and special guest Tim

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
 mentioned.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,440
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,760
 seven days, and in a particular order, here we go, starting with you, Tim.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:45,200
 Okay, my fact is that Bulgaria has an agency that shoots rockets to kill Hale, to kill it.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
 To kill it.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,200
 Well, to minimise it.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,080
 It's a preemptive strike, Hale strike.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,760
 So I thought all this weather manipulation technology was bollocks, but apparently it's

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,760
 not.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:08,200
 So, Bulgaria has lots of agrarian, Bulgarian land, and they grow stuff, and Hale damages

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
 crops a lot.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,040
 And because of its geography and its variable landscape, there's lots of Hale.

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,480
 And so they use seeding techniques to, well, there are various ways you can lower hailstones

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
 by seeding.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,680
 So, do you want to know about it?

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
 It's super boring.

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,680
 Yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,520
 I'll try and make it more boring than it actually is.

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,320
 So, you basically, they discovered in 1946 or something that if you put dry ice, solid

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,880
 carbon dioxide into clouds, you can increase precipitation, basically, and later they found

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,360
 out that something silver iodide and potassium iodide also do, there's various techniques,

27
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,640
 and you can drop them from a plane or shoot them up from a rocket, which is what the Bulgarians

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
 do.

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,960
 But in terms of fighting too much Hale, the main technique is basically that you shoot these

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
 chemicals up.

31
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,360
 It changes the chemical structure of the stuff within the cloud, and it actually makes

32
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,440
 more small hailstones that compete for the available water.

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,560
 So, by the time they hit the ground, they're no longer hailstones because they started

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
 too small.

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,520
 I think I've misunderstood the fact because I thought they were shooting rockets at falling

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
 Hale.

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,280
 I assumed it was like there was an attack happening, and they were like when you shoot

38
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,880
 a missile at a plane to take out a war.

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,200
 Like a game of space invaders.

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
 Like a game of space invaders.

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,320
 That would be amazing, and with enough people and enough tiny rockets.

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
 That would probably work.

43
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,600
 Or it's like, you know, those meteor disaster movies, you basically got one massive hailstone

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,040
 coming towards Sayonade Bruce Willis, and that guy who sings "Love in an Elevator"

45
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
 or his daughter.

46
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,160
 Do you know the armageddon facts about the fact that NASA, so they don't do it officially,

47
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,440
 but they unofficially show people who are being recruited for NASA, the movie of Armageddon,

48
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,200
 and the job is to spot as many inaccuracies as possible.

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
 Oh good.

50
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
 I think the...

51
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
 It's over a hundred, isn't it?

52
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
 Yeah, I think there's over two.

53
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
 I can't.

54
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
 Poor space facts.

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
 Yeah, exactly.

56
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
 Yeah.

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
 So that's actually a thing that they sit down here.

58
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
 So I can't get a song in my head.

59
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
 "Don't want a clue."

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
 Oh, no one.

61
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
 That's the guy.

62
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,200
 "I'll sleep because I miss you baby."

63
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,680
 Oh, so that's not inaccurate.

64
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
 That's perfect.

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
 Do I spot the rest of that?

66
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,680
 It was the only bit they didn't quibble with.

67
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
 I did the songs.

68
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,680
 But there's sort of dodgy technology.

69
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,680
 There's things called "Hail cannons."

70
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,680
 So in medieval times, they used to ring church bells and fire cannons into the sky

71
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
 and to try and stop hail.

72
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
 Oh, wow.

73
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,240
 But they have things that are still in modern times called "Hail cannons," which basically

74
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,320
 make an explosion at the bottom of what looks like a large, loud, hailer, ironically.

75
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,320
 They send up a sound wave and it's meant to distribute hail in the end of it.

76
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
 And they said she don't want to do that.

77
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
 But they're still marketed everywhere.

78
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,320
 If you look up kind of wine growers tips and stuff in Europe, people will try to sell those things.

79
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
 And they are like gigantic ice cream cones.

80
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
 They're the same ones.

81
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
 They look like huge cones.

82
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,320
 What you're saying about bell ringing, they used to do that to get rid of thunder, didn't they, as well?

83
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
 Oh, yeah.

84
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,320
 So they would send people up a massive tower with a bell in it to ring the bell to get rid of the thunder.

85
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
 And again, they're electrocuted.

86
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
 Yeah.

87
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,320
 They're like extra massive metal things, really high up.

88
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
 Yeah.

89
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,320
 I was reading just the other day about a miracle in the Middle Ages, which was where the church bell started to ring by themselves.

90
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,320
 Because they were so happy.

91
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
 So windy.

92
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,320
 That a particular, they were really thrilled that a particular religious event or celebration.

93
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,320
 So they started to ring by themselves.

94
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
 Yeah, that's nice.

95
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:44,320
 Do you know what my favorite thing about this fact is that the person who discovered that silver iodide works as well or better than

96
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,320
 solid carbon dioxide in cloud heating was guy called Bernard Vonnegut.

97
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
 Right.

98
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
 And in 1946.

99
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,320
 And I just, which is so weird and it's just Kurt Vonnegut's brother.

100
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
 Get out.

101
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,320
 And the weird thing is whenever I think of cloud heating, I think of Kat's cradle.

102
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,320
 I think of ice nine.

103
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
 Yeah.

104
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,320
 And Kat's cradle is all about an isotope that freezes liquid on contact.

105
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:17,320
 And it's, so that's obviously what he was reading and thinking about his big brother was, because he was a science nerd, but I didn't know it.

106
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
 That's extraordinary.

107
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
 It's one of my favorite.

108
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
 It's a great book.

109
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
 That's an incredible book.

110
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
 Yeah.

111
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
 It's a scary book.

112
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
 Glad for this hail fan.

113
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
 What?

114
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
 Yeah.

115
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,320
 So the thing that you were saying earlier about cloud seeding, not thinking that I had no idea that worked.

116
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
 And apparently it does.

117
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:45,320
 I was reading that the, the, the Beijing Olympics for their opening ceremony, they made sure that they had no clouds by doing literally that firing rockets into the sky in order to knock them out.

118
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
 And is it proper science?

119
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,320
 Well, there are also question marks over it.

120
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
 Okay, sometimes it works.

121
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
 So it might have been a coincidence that there just was no clouds.

122
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,320
 Yeah, it's always hard to tell, basically, because you can't say it definitely would have rained.

123
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
 There's no control group.

124
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:06,320
 Yeah, no. And that's, and because the data set of any weather is chaotic, not climate, but weather is chaotic.

125
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,320
 You can, you can always draw inference where there was an inference, you know.

126
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,320
 But, but there's no way, I mean, the Chinese government of course would say, like, we got rid of the cloud.

127
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
 That's very in character, bless them.

128
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:27,320
 But, um, but we, uh, but, but it's not pseudo science because you can measure impact, but the impact is never from 100 to zero.

129
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,320
 It's, um, it's percentages of, of manipulation.

130
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
 Okay.

131
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,320
 Have you read the, um, accounts of people going in and doing cloud seeding?

132
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
 No.

133
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
 It's so hard.

134
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
 People in plain.

135
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, the people go in the plain.

136
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:47,320
 So a journal, a Bloomberg journalist went up with a couple of cloud seeders, um, in who are doing cloud seeding in Bangalore because India has drought problems.

137
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,320
 So they were trying to solve that by generating a bit of rain.

138
00:06:51,320 --> 00:07:00,320
 And it's, so what you do is you go under the huge storm cloud you can find and there's a big updraft in the middle of it and you fly underneath that in your little plane.

139
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,320
 And you let yourself get sucked up and I think you get sucked up.

140
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
 You get sucked up at 800 feet per minute.

141
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,320
 And so this journalist was just like, I was in the back behind them, just vomiting the whole time.

142
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,320
 So then they've got to fly into clouds, are you?

143
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
 Now, they've all these rockets on the wing.

144
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:23,320
 And they've got, I think he had eight rockets on each wing and it fires the substances off into the clouds and then allows them to seed.

145
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
 But it sounds absolutely terrifying.

146
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
 Wow.

147
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,320
 He said he couldn't lift his hands off his lap because you're going up so fast.

148
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:36,320
 There was a thing about, so this is when the USA was starting to get involved in a really serious way because they tried it over.

149
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:43,320
 It was loud during the Vietnam War, but also the USA had a national hail research experiment in the 70s and that was different four years.

150
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,320
 And I think they closed it down because they hadn't got the technology right.

151
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:55,320
 But when they were doing it, some farmers were very angry about the idea because they thought that cloud seeding would reduce the rainfall and damage their crops the other way.

152
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,320
 And some of them fired shots at aircraft which they thought were doing cloud seeding.

153
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
 So adding to the risk.

154
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:13,320
 You don't know, this isn't very cheerful at all, but I haven't remembered it since I went there about ten years ago is the most bombed country per square kilometre in the world because of during the Vietnam War.

155
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,320
 Oh, it's good to have a record of some description.

156
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
 Yeah, exactly.

157
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
 It's very proud of it.

158
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
 Yeah, it's on all their places.

159
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
 The only other thing is they have all those jars.

160
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,320
 They have the plane of jars full of unexplained jars.

161
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,320
 We think they might have been for funeral uses.

162
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
 Or they might have been for storing grain.

163
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,320
 There's just hundreds and hundreds of massive human sized jars on a plane.

164
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
 Wow, fantastic.

165
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
 We don't know why they're...

166
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
 Jaws on a plane.

167
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
 Coming this summer.

168
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,320
 Do you know the biggest hailstone?

169
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
 No.

170
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,320
 2010.

171
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,320
 A hailstone larger than the bowling ball fell on Vivian during an exceptional hail stop.

172
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
 Wow.

173
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
 Vivian is a town in South Dakota.

174
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
 Thank goodness.

175
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,320
 It's going to say you didn't even get a surname, Jaws.

176
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
 It was just a special...

177
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
 It was like Madonna.

178
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
 Yeah.

179
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,320
 The hailstone obliterated her surname on her name tag.

180
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
 Wow.

181
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:16,320
 Have you heard about the guy who had weird blue hailfall in his garden in 2012?

182
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
 No.

183
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
 Did you think it was urine from a plane or something?

184
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,320
 He didn't, because my urine isn't blue, Jaws.

185
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
 Is yours?

186
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,320
 I am going to have to see a doctor.

187
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
 Jaws.

188
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
 Jaws the third had blue urine, didn't they?

189
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
 He was a papyrus.

190
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
 That's okay.

191
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,320
 So this was in Jaws the third's urine being catapulted out of a plane.

192
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
 But this was a guy called Steve Hornsby.

193
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
 He lived in Bournemouth.

194
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,320
 And there it was in the middle of a hail storm.

195
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,320
 And these jelly-like three-centimeter diameter balls, blue balls fell in his garden.

196
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
 I think about a dozen of them fell in his garden.

197
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
 And he said they were like squishy jelly-ish eggs.

198
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
 And they don't know what they were.

199
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,320
 One of the researchers said that it might have been a bird's egg.

200
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
 Like an undeveloped bird's egg.

201
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,320
 And she said bird's eggs have been implicated in previous strange goo incidents.

202
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,320
 And apparently, because birds hold their eggs in their claws when they're flying.

203
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
 But if they're hit by a hail, then they let go of them in a panic.

204
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,320
 And so this guy just had 12 birds hold their eggs in their claws when they're flying.

205
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
 Apparently.

206
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
 I didn't notice the premise of my movie.

207
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,320
 The whole first scene is a bird flying with an egg in its claws.

208
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
 So I hope that's right.

209
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
 It's actually a good spoiler, thanks.

210
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
 We've got a scoop there.

211
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
 It's not in the beginning.

212
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,320
 Do you think critics will walk out if it's actually an accurate writers?

213
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:32,320
 I can just pitch a little kid next door to that guy in Bournemouth just throwing blue jelly over them.

214
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
 Watching the dude's face and laugh.

215
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
 Watching the journalist show up.

216
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
 Can you have my dog in this sort of car?

217
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,320
 I have a couple things on Bulgaria.

218
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
 Oh, yeah.

219
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
 No, but do it.

220
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
 Okay.

221
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,320
 First off, I try to find a famous Bulgarian, which is quite hard.

222
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
 There isn't really any.

223
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
 Christel Steichkov.

224
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
 Okay, so we've got one.

225
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
 Yeah.

226
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
 Any lead on one?

227
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
 I've got Simeon Saxo-Coba-Gotha.

228
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,320
 Okay, so who's your, who's your football player?

229
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
 Yeah, and yours?

230
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,320
 Mine was the prime minister of Bulgaria till 2005.

231
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
 But here's the cool thing.

232
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,320
 He was, he is one of the only two who had blue urine.

233
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,320
 Blue urine.

234
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,320
 He's one of the only two people who's currently alive who was ahead of state during the Second World War.

235
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
 Yeah.

236
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,320
 He was the czar of Bulgaria in 1943 when he was six years old.

237
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,320
 And the Soviets invaded and he was exiled.

238
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,320
 And then he stayed alive and stayed alive for a long time.

239
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,320
 And then won an election in his native country in 2001.

240
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
 Oh, wow, that's so cool.

241
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
 How cool is that?

242
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
 That is cool.

243
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
 Yeah.

244
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,320
 I'll be back.

245
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,320
 So you've got no, no Bulgarians.

246
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
 No, I do.

247
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,320
 I should just qualify and say internationally famous Bulgarians.

248
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,320
 But it turns out that the grandparents of Mark Zuckerberg are Bulgarian.

249
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,320
 And he's named after his Bulgarian grandfather, Marco.

250
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,320
 So he's, he's there trying to claim him as Bulgarian.

251
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:09,320
 Also, I found one very good politician from Bulgaria who got fired in 2010 because he was playing too much Farmville while they were trying to say Farmville's a game on a, on a nap.

252
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,320
 And he was fired and he was dismissed and they added in his dismissal that he would now have more time to tend to his virtual farm.

253
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,320
 With his, with his hail cannons.

254
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,320
 Send him down, send him down to be Minister for Agriculture.

255
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:32,320
 And when he was, when he was dismissed, he came back and he said that he basically tried to explain himself and tried to say that he wasn't the worst.

256
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
 He said he'd only reached level 40.

257
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,320
 Well, his Daniella Jelokovov had the counselor from the right as Democrats of the strong Bulgarian party was ready at level 46.

258
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
 So he was furious.

259
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
 All right.

260
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,320
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Chisinski.

261
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,320
 My fact this week is that we judge music more on how it looks than how it sounds.

262
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
 What?

263
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
 What am I talking about?

264
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,320
 So this is an experiment that was done by researchers at UCL in 2013.

265
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:12,320
 And it was actually a sequence of seven experiments and it involved over 800 participants and some of them are musical experts.

266
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,320
 They were professional classical music judges and some of them were just amateurs, just plebps like you and me.

267
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
 And they...

268
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
 I take exceptions to that.

269
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
 Except you James.

270
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
 We're different types of plebps.

271
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
 Yep.

272
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:34,320
 And they got them to listen to recordings of people who've been entered into classical music competitions and to tell the participants who they thought would want these competitions.

273
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:43,320
 And when the participants just heard a recording of the recitals, they had no better chance than just random chance at knowing who'd won the contest.

274
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:51,320
 And when they were watching the person performing at the same time as listening to them performing, they also had no better chance than just what would be random chance.

275
00:13:51,320 --> 00:14:02,320
 But if you muted the visuals and they just watched the person on the piano during the classical music recital, suddenly the chance of them guessing who'd won the competition went way up.

276
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,320
 And they got like, they were more than twice as likely to...

277
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
 I don't think that's the case.

278
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:17,320
 At the start of the study, like 96% of the professionals and 88% of the amateurs said that they would judge on this entirely on sound.

279
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,320
 But actually they think that we use visual cues, so we don't quite realise it.

280
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,320
 But when they say what they appreciate in the music, they'll say something like passion.

281
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,320
 And actually they're getting passionate out of the way that a performer's moving.

282
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,320
 And they're thinking, "Oh, I'm really enjoying hearing this piece. I'm really appreciating the nuances in the music."

283
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,320
 But actually they're just enjoying watching someone look like they're passionate.

284
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,320
 I just thought it was really interesting that...

285
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
 Yeah, that is interesting.

286
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,320
 So, when I'm seeing a band play, the one that's coming to mind is Mumford and Sons.

287
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
 There's a guy on the keyboard, it's right.

288
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,320
 If I ever see it in a festival, and he goes for it, and he's like, he's rocking on it, but you know he's just playing a G.

289
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,320
 It's just a G over and over and it's like, "Why are you putting..."

290
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
 That was beautiful.

291
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:07,320
 It's not an acoustic instrument, so you can't get more out of it by hitting it harder or throwing it.

292
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,320
 But it's the same watching a pianist play a beautiful acoustic piano.

293
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:18,320
 And you'll watch some classical pianist sort of ease their body in and their wrist down.

294
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,320
 And they'll just sort of place their finger on the key.

295
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,320
 And most of the cue you're getting from that, the reason that sounds like a beautiful note is because of the approach.

296
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
 Yeah.

297
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,320
 And you could go... you could get a robot to go...

298
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,320
 And it would sound exactly the same.

299
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,320
 Well, this is the thing, this is why they have blind auditions for orchestras these days.

300
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
 Yes.

301
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
 Because they've noticed that they were...

302
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
 An agenda bias.

303
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
 Exactly.

304
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
 Exactly in the same.

305
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,320
 Yeah, and until the 70s or the 90s, about 5% of an orchestra was with female musicians.

306
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,320
 Which is obviously statistically surprising.

307
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:58,320
 Well, but the, of course, the assumption was, well, you know, their brains are different and they're physically not as capable.

308
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
 And so they can't cut it.

309
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
 Yeah.

310
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,320
 And everyone just took that as given, well, you know, women aren't as good as men at music.

311
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
 And then they started blinding the auditions.

312
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
 Yeah.

313
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
 And it's, guess what?

314
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
 It's like 50/50.

315
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
 Nothing to do with it.

316
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,320
 But they had some where they had blind auditions and still many more men were being chosen for the orchestra in the moment.

317
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:23,320
 When they worked out a possible explanation, which was that the women were going and wearing high heels to the blind auditions.

318
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
 So they were a clip-glop.

319
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,320
 You heard the sound of their feet and that might have been subconsciously affecting people.

320
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
 Full.

321
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
 They should have known.

322
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
 I mean, women are idiots.

323
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
 I'm sorry.

324
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
 They shouldn't have worn high heels.

325
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 That was a special point.

326
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
 That was the point I was trying to make their own.

327
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
 Yes.

328
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
 That women are idiots.

329
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
 Great.

330
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
 Yes.

331
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
 It's pretty depressing.

332
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:49,320
 It reminds me this is a digression that of blinding instrument tests, because have you guys discussed this?

333
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,320
 No, no, I don't think we are about the strata various effects.

334
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,320
 The knowledge that an instrument is, I guess it is very related.

335
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:05,320
 The knowledge that an instrument is worth a million quid changes not only the audience's appreciation, but the musician.

336
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:16,320
 The first chair, or a soloist, classical violinist will, you know, get on the lease or buy if they're very lucky, a strata various worth a million bucks.

337
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
 And they'll play it.

338
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,320
 Now everyone will swear black and blue that it sounds better.

339
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:28,320
 But if you blinding this is quite hard, because the wood smells different and it feels different and stuff.

340
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:38,320
 But if you control as much as you can for those variables, putting blocking their noses and just get the players to play it and hear it.

341
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,320
 They can't pick a strata various from a thousand dollar Chinese.

342
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
 And this has been true for about 200 years.

343
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
 They've been doing these studies and it always shows.

344
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,320
 But then every single year you get another thing saying it's because of the wood, it's a special kind of that.

345
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
 Do you know what's valid though?

346
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:09,320
 I was thinking about this today with disease and psychosomatic illness and stuff that if you have someone with one of these umbrella diagnoses like chronic fatigue or they'll be this outrage.

347
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:23,320
 If anyone suggests there's a psychological element to their disease, but that that assumes a dichotomy between neurology and physiology that is something that increasingly we don't we realize is not true.

348
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:30,320
 Like that a disease has a psychological element or a neurological element, psychological and neurological kind of indistinct.

349
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,320
 If it does have a psychological element, it doesn't mean you're not still sick.

350
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
 It's just you're not necessarily sick.

351
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:43,320
 These people want it desperately to be a tick or a some kind of pathogen.

352
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,320
 But if you tell them it's neurological, they're like no, it's not all in my head and it's like it doesn't matter.

353
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,320
 It's all in your head in the end, pain and sickness and it's all interpreted.

354
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:01,320
 And so with this violin thing, maybe it doesn't matter that it's bollocks because the musician feels more passionate about the music when they play it.

355
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,320
 And maybe it changes their body language and changes the audience experience.

356
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,320
 And the fact that a psychological is fine, it's part of our experience.

357
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,320
 It is, it's good stuff.

358
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
 We should keep lying.

359
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:19,320
 Well, let's just re-label all violins. Let's try that out. Let's just do it.

360
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,320
 If we sell them all for £200,000. If we do it, we're going to lose the point.

361
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,320
 If we do it and we cover it up 200 years from now, people will be enjoying music much more.

362
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,320
 Let's say there was this guy, he made thousands and thousands and thousands of violin.

363
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,320
 It's still making them. It's amazing.

364
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,320
 Quick thing about cognitive bias, which this is kind of a bow.

365
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,320
 This is about, which is how we convince ourselves of things that aren't true.

366
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,320
 Almost everyone thinks they're above average.

367
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,320
 And if you present people with most skills and you do studies on how good they think they are at skills,

368
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,320
 and then you test how good they are at skills, people will think they're better than average at most things.

369
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,320
 So I think some things are particularly high, so there was a study in 1977, which is quite famous,

370
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,320
 where 94% of professors said they were above average in relation to their peers.

371
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,320
 So obviously this is people, we are so good at convincing ourselves of certain things.

372
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,320
 Yeah, it's driving a lot.

373
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,320
 Driving, I think.

374
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,320
 Is there a gender thing there? I bet men are worse.

375
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,320
 In driving, I think actually it was gender equal, because I was expecting that as well.

376
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,320
 I bet men are better. I bet I'm above average at thinking I'm better than you at things.

377
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,320
 Do you know about that you guys discussed the down-and-cruelier effects?

378
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,320
 There's also a correlation between how bad you are.

379
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:52,320
 It's slightly a misinterpreted thing, but the gap between how good you are and how good you think you are increases as you get worse at a thing.

380
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
 It's amazing.

381
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,320
 So it's sort of like the less you know about other things, the less you know how bad you are at the thing.

382
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:06,320
 Yeah, so people, and the thing that people make a mistake with this data, which is very interesting data,

383
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,320
 is they think, "Are those people as so dumb they don't know how dumb they are?"

384
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
 But it's actually all of us.

385
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:17,320
 In all of us we have things where the down-and-cruelier effect, the point is it's the things we're shit at that we don't know we're so shit at.

386
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
 You've basically written a song about that, haven't you?

387
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320
 The first song in Matilda is basically like that.

388
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
 Oh yeah, I guess so.

389
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,320
 The idea that everyone thinks their kid is above average.

390
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,320
 The best honest is Derrigger above average as average go figure.

391
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
 It's one of my best friends.

392
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
 It's a children's musical.

393
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,320
 You've got to go and see it here.

394
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,320
 Come on, you're fable.

395
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,320
 Okay, it's time to move on to fact number three, and that is James.

396
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:49,320
 Okay, my fact this week is that the BFG's Dream Powder also helps against constipation.

397
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
 Oh, bless.

398
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
 Is that an edited chapter?

399
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:00,320
 So, this is not in the book. This is a thing that I read by a failure Dal who was Roll Dal's daughter.

400
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
 And she was talking about her childhood.

401
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,320
 And before Roll Dal wrote the BFG, he kind of had this idea already.

402
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,320
 And his kids couldn't sleep and he was like, "Oh, you know what?

403
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,320
 There's a kind of a dream powder that people blow into your bedroom and it gives you good dreams.

404
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,320
 But it also helps for anything from maths problems to constipation."

405
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,320
 Okay, and then the kids kind of went to sleep and then he ran outside, got his ladder,

406
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,320
 put it up against the wall, ran up, put a bamboo pole into the bedroom

407
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
 and pretended to blow in sleep.

408
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
 Wow.

409
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
 And then from there, that's where the idea from the book came.

410
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,320
 Was there supposedly they knew that it wasn't that it was him, but they pretended to him afterwards.

411
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,320
 And was there a lot of constipation in the Dal family?

412
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,320
 Not after this.

413
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,320
 They all immediately shut themselves into the Dal family.

414
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,320
 Oh my God.

415
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,320
 They did want to get suspicious, I think.

416
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,320
 So they said, "How are we supposed to know that this is real, Daddy?"

417
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,320
 And so they went downstairs and confronted him and he said, "How dare you question my truthfulness?"

418
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,320
 And then the next day they said they woke up and opened the curtains

419
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,320
 and they saw the letters BFG burned into their lawn.

420
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,320
 And he loved his lawn so much and apparently he was very angry about this

421
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
 and that proved to them that the BFG existed.

422
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,320
 Oh, it's very easily convinced.

423
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
 Yeah.

424
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
 He sounds like a great dad.

425
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
 Yeah.

426
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,320
 I was reading about the first movie of the BFG, the animation.

427
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,320
 And the original voice was meant to be Spike Milligan.

428
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:33,320
 And I'm very upset that it's not because I look at the BFG's face and I see Spike Milligan now.

429
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
 Right.

430
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,320
 And when he showed up to the audition, they said he had to go home and shave.

431
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,320
 I don't know why, because it was a voice job.

432
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
 Well, Dal hated Beards.

433
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
 Oh, really?

434
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
 He hated Beards, yeah.

435
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,320
 He would be a Pog and a Folbe.

436
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
 Totally.

437
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
 What?

438
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
 That's what.

439
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
 Oh, is that the Twits?

440
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
 That was the man's Twitter.

441
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
 He hates it.

442
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
 He hates Mr Twit.

443
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
 I mean, that's really real.

444
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,320
 I've talked to Lissy about that.

445
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
 He really didn't like Beards.

446
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
 Yeah, I think he wrote an essay in The Times.

447
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,320
 It only came out quite recently saying there are hairy smoke screen

448
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,320
 behind which people hide.

449
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
 And yeah, he really loath them.

450
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,320
 But is this true about Beards?

451
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,320
 So this is difficult because he said that it was a bad representation of male vanity

452
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
 and no man should be vain.

453
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
 But I would have thought that it's much more effort to shave.

454
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,320
 But he said, I think it must take at least twice as long to wash thoroughly a face that is matted with bristly vegetation

455
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,320
 so that no dirt or food remains among the hairs than simply to shave.

456
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,320
 But I didn't realise Beards required that level of cleaning.

457
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,320
 That does sound phobic, doesn't it?

458
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,320
 I mean, I've never considered washing my beard.

459
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,320
 Oh, do you have to clean like comb food out of your beard every night before you get to sleep?

460
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
 No.

461
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
 Should I?

462
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
 Quite a doll.

463
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,320
 That does sound phobic, doesn't it?

464
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
 Yeah, sort of fantasy version of what a beard might be like.

465
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,320
 Or maybe sort of just sort of thinking of big dostoyevsk in Beards.

466
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
 Yeah.

467
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
 I don't know.

468
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,320
 So he had supposedly this cabinet of curiosities sort of odd things in his shed.

469
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
 And I imagine he would have seen all of these.

470
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,320
 Yeah, I was actually one of the last people to see it before it moved.

471
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
 Wow.

472
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
 And now it's in the museum in Great Missenden.

473
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
 Yeah.

474
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,320
 And he had some of his spine in a jar.

475
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
 Yeah.

476
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,320
 Because he had a terrible spinal injury when he had a plane crash in the Libyan desert during the Second World War.

477
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,320
 And he also had, he had a draw on one of his filing cabinets.

478
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:27,320
 And the handle of it was a steel bit of steel, which had been put into his pelvis during an unsuccessful hip replacement.

479
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
 Wow.

480
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
 And so he said a lot to stand that into a handle for a filing cabinet.

481
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
 That's great.

482
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:37,320
 He was medically, he was extremely unlucky, I think, in terms of people around him and himself, wasn't he?

483
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,320
 Sad. So he lost his daughter and that obviously just destroyed him.

484
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:50,320
 But then Theo got, you know, his son got hit by a car in New York when he was a little tiny infant in a, in a pram.

485
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,320
 But he invented this shunt.

486
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,320
 He got a model maker from down the road and a doctor who turned out bizarrely.

487
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,320
 After I'd written Matilda, I found out as a friend of my grandad's.

488
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
 Wow.

489
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,320
 Wow. My mum was reading his biography and went, Dave, this is your father's friend.

490
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,320
 So that was very exciting when mum got to meet Lissy.

491
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,320
 But yeah, he just felt that he should be able to fix stuff, you know.

492
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:23,320
 And such an interesting brain, this darkness and light and the pragmatic versus the fantastical, you know.

493
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
 Yeah.

494
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,320
 Absolutely intriguing guy.

495
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,320
 And it did, you know, you hear about people patenting things and being a bit wacky.

496
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,320
 His invention genuinely did save thousands and thousands.

497
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,320
 Yeah, last year, it was so much.

498
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,320
 It was superseded quite quickly, but it was huge.

499
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
 I think it was, yeah, very effective in this time.

500
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
 Three thousand children, I think, had it fitted.

501
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
 And that is charity saves a whole lot more.

502
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
 And it's pretty incredible.

503
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
 You know, you had no teeth.

504
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,320
 Really?

505
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
 He had them all out in his 20s.

506
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,320
 It would have been a spy because he was a spy briefly.

507
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
 Military attaché in Washington and the wall.

508
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
 But he would have been a spy with no teeth.

509
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,320
 That's an awesome time.

510
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
 That's a great book isn't it?

511
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
 A spy with no teeth.

512
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,320
 It's on Ian Fleming's backup list.

513
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
 Yeah.

514
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
 Doctor No teeth.

515
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,320
 They were friends actually, weren't they?

516
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
 Well done on Ian Fleming.

517
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
 They worked together a fair bit.

518
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
 Or they knew each other release and had a mutual respect for each other.

519
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,320
 And they both sort of worked for MI5 together at that time.

520
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
 One, they worked on two movies as well.

521
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
 Yes, and they worked on films together afterwards.

522
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
 So did he do the spy who...

523
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
 No, he did you and lived twice.

524
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
 No, he did you and lived twice.

525
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
 And he also did chili, chili bang bang.

526
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
 Yes.

527
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
 Darl, this is a thing I found out that I had no idea.

528
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,320
 Is that he was buried with a power saw.

529
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
 Yeah.

530
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,320
 Not that it was used to dig the grave.

531
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,320
 I mean, he was literally, he's got a power...

532
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
 In his coffin with him, or sort of in the...

533
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
 I'm not sure whether it's a tomb.

534
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
 But he was buried with his snooker cues.

535
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
 Yeah.

536
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,320
 Some burgundy, chocolates, HB pencils and a power saw.

537
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
 We need to find that tomb.

538
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,320
 Yeah.

539
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:05,360
 He used to write for Playboy, didn't he? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Rute Playboy stories. In fact, Hugh

540
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:12,480
 Heffner did a thing where in one of the editions of Playboy, he included ten golden tickets.

541
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,640
 And if you got a golden ticket in the Playboy copy, you then got to go to the Playboy mansion

542
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:27,080
 to an exerated wonderland, a chocolate factory. Nine-year-old asthma's dramatic day of his life.

543
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:35,480
 This is just one tiny fact about dreaming, because the BFG's about dreams, am I right? Yeah.

544
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:42,280
 Yeah. So there was a study done in Germany about nightmares, and five most common themes for nightmares

545
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:49,560
 are falling, being chased, being paralyzed, the death of family or friends, and being late.

546
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:56,760
 If people, is that up there with all these other traumatic things that could possibly ever happen to you?

547
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,440
 Not knowing your lines. That's what I get. Really? Yeah. Having to go on, not knowing my lines.

548
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,880
 Often Shakespeare. Having to go on in a Shakespeare and not knowing my lines.

549
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,240
 Would that be worse, because a lot of people are just going to know all the lines anyway?

550
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,320
 Yeah, probably. Shouting it out. Yeah. That one's not going to be!

551
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:27,000
 I have a fact about constipation. So, you know, the Guardian used to do notes and queries,

552
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,240
 and they would sometimes find the very old columns online, basically. They have one question

553
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,720
 in the load of people answer. Have they stopped doing it now? I'm not sure, but a lot of them look archive now,

554
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,560
 basically. But they've got, there was a thing about old books, right? And a couple of people wrote in,

555
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:46,120
 and one person wrote in saying, "The father of a friend of mine used to find that breathing in the

556
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,560
 atmosphere of a well-stocked secondhand bookshop, the mustier the better, was a certain cure for his

557
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:57,640
 acute constipation now." That sounds like a very good Aoki phenomenon. Exactly. There's a phenomenon

558
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,080
 we've talked about on this podcast, which is this woman, I think, Mariko Aoki, where she was overwhelmed

559
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,600
 by the urge to have poo when she was in a bookshop. I wonder, and there's another letter whose another

560
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,960
 person second down wrote, "I first became aware of this little-known side effect of my interest in old

561
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,360
 books some years ago, and have been plagued by it ever since. I'm reassured to know there are other

562
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,800
 sufferers. I think we might have cracked the phenomenon." Well, you do get a lot of kind of

563
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:30,920
 not bacteria, but fungal spars, don't you, in all books. So maybe it speeds up the process. Yeah, it must do.

564
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:37,640
 I thought it might be associative, so these people who read their old books on the loo, and their brain

565
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,560
 goes, "Oh, old book, poo time." That's an amazing theory. Can I just, there's one cure for constipation,

566
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:50,360
 though? I like that I didn't know about, which is the Violet Ray device, and so I think this was

567
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:56,600
 sort of invented by Tesla, so it's an electrical device, which was used to cure a whole bunch of

568
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:03,800
 stuff, as well as later as the 1930s, and it basically used electro-therapy to, and you put the instrument

569
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,880
 that puts an electric current through whatever bit of your body is ailing, you put it on that, and it

570
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,080
 cures it, and you were supposed to put it into your rectum, and you saw an electric current up there,

571
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,880
 and it relieves constipation. It feels like it would work. So use it in the 1930s, if you look at

572
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,280
 newspaper adverts, it's all over it, the Violet Ray device. They use Violet Ray therapy.

573
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:28,680
 I think, kind of, but plugs to get Seaman from Rhino's, I happen to know. Oh yeah, yeah. There's Rhino,

574
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,640
 one of you on my neck.

575
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:40,040
 Okay, it's time for a final fact of the show, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

576
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,800
 My fact is that Britain has only one performing circus recouping.

577
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:49,320
 So I found this fact in the spectator, it's from the House of Commons papers, and

578
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,760
 there are not many animals performing in circuses left in the UK, and elephants and big cats have

579
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,760
 both been banned from British circuses. There are now two travelling circuses.

580
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,720
 Those are turning up drunk.

581
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,680
 Just make it sound like they've misbehaved.

582
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:10,200
 I can't come to a circus drunk, like there's raccoons on Stair, I don't get their job.

583
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:17,320
 So there's the circus monday, who have horses, camels, llamas, meals, donkeys, reindeer, and one zebra.

584
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:23,960
 Okay, and there's Peter's jolly circus, which I, and I phoned up both of these circuses.

585
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,080
 Yeah, I had a chat with them, and Peter's jolly circus has horses, donkeys, ponies,

586
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,920
 a camel, two zebra's llamas, a parrot, and Reggie the raccoon.

587
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,560
 I spoke to the guy who keeps it.

588
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,760
 Well, he does a lot of stuff. Firstly, he didn't have that with Gary Linnaker.

589
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,720
 I imagine it was a crisp at that.

590
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,560
 Reggie salted.

591
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,920
 Very good. Very good.

592
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:54,520
 So I thought you guys might ask, what does Reggie do?

593
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,880
 And I asked the keeper, and he said, he basically, I'm paraphrasing, but he said,

594
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,320
 he basically walks around the ring fence and goes up on a ramp onto a platform,

595
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,560
 and goes in and out of poles, like dogs do for there's agility things, and then comes back down.

596
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,160
 So maybe that's why there's only one fantastic.

597
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,600
 But the keeper wasn't paying to point out, he's not the UK's only performing raccoon,

598
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,960
 because there's a lady who did Britain's Got Talent with the raccoon.

599
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,080
 With the raccoons.

600
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,480
 So raccoons have public toilets.

601
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,960
 I don't know, they have their own latrine area raccoons, and we don't know why they do it,

602
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,080
 whether it's from a sense of cleanliness, or one, the article's really said,

603
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,840
 maybe for communication purposes, but they have the group of raccoons

604
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,600
 who are designated toilet place, and they all go and shit there, and that's where they do that.

605
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,760
 Well, raccoon droppings are very poisonous.

606
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,320
 They have little nematold worms in them that can kill you.

607
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,040
 To pay, and I think there's like even no giara something.

608
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,480
 That's why I was wondering why quite a lot of the warnings are very alarmist

609
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,280
 about raccoon latrines, and how bad it is if you find them in your garden,

610
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,440
 and you shouldn't touch them, but that probably explains that.

611
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,880
 The government of the Bahamas were protecting the Bahamian raccoon,

612
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:04,200
 and then someone did some DNA test and found it was exactly the same as North American common raccoon.

613
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,120
 And so overnight they went from protecting them to setting up an eradication.

614
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,800
 Such a horrible news to wake up to is those raccoons in their foreboast of beds.

615
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,880
 Darling, what's wrong?

616
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:25,080
 I have a few facts about circus things.

617
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:32,280
 So I found an unbelievably good book called "Beastly London" by Hannah Velton.

618
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,760
 It's so good. It's a history of almost every animal that's ever been in London, and it's incredible.

619
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:45,400
 So just a few circus shows that happened. There was the singing mouse, which appeared in 1843

620
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,680
 at some private rooms in Redund Street, and apparently it could wobble incessantly for a quarter of an hour.

621
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,160
 Even better on mute.

622
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,560
 And then a few years later there was a rival singing mouse,

623
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,120
 we just sat up off the strand, which were very near at the moment,

624
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,360
 at a hairdresser's and tickets for six pints.

625
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,320
 But if you got a haircut, it was free to see the mouse.

626
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,520
 It's weird enough that I'm asking a thing that's incredible.

627
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,480
 I just remember that I went to a circus museum in Florida.

628
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,800
 I can't remember if it's somewhere in Florida. I can't remember what it is.

629
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,200
 And then they had a load of weird people who did weird things on one of them

630
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,480
 went downstairs on his head, and that was his whole act.

631
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,200
 That's good.

632
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,880
 He was just like using his hands.

633
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,560
 Without using his hands, he would just kind of get on the top step with his head,

634
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,960
 and then I guess using neck muscles or something.

635
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,080
 One of the first ever circus performers rode a horse standing on his head.

636
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,400
 Was he an ass, one of asses, a lot?

637
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,960
 I think he was pretty assly, so it wasn't actually circus,

638
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
 because Philip Astley's the guy who invented the circus.

639
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,880
 But he did a lot of weird kind of...

640
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,040
 Astley did incredible horse riding, yeah.

641
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,760
 There was a guy called Daniel Wildman, who was so good, 1772, this is.

642
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,560
 He could ride a horse while standing upright, pretty good,

643
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
 with a mask of bees on his face.

644
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,360
 It's awesome.

645
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,560
 Isn't that incredible?

646
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:04,200
 I'd like to see him riding a bee with a mask of asses on his face.

647
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,000
 So just one sentence about him.

648
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,360
 He rides standing up on the saddle with the bridle in his mouth,

649
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,600
 and by firing a pistol makes one part of the bee's mount over the table,

650
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,400
 and the other parts swarm in the air and return to that proper place.

651
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,160
 So he was doing tricks, kind of show jumping with the bees while riding a horse,

652
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,240
 but apparently, he held the queen bee in his hand,

653
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,720
 so to sort of get them to follow along.

654
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,680
 Yeah, that sounds amazing.

655
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,640
 That sounds ridiculous sort of level of imagination

656
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,080
 to work on the scale of a horse and the scale of a bee at the same time.

657
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,760
 Have you guys heard of the Dog's Toilet Club?

658
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,000
 Have we heard of the Dog's Toilet Club?

659
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,680
 I reckon I've accidentally stumbled into it.

660
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,560
 What is it?

661
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,200
 It was an establishment on Bond Street in the early 20th century.

662
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,840
 Unfortunately, it's not quite as good as it sounds.

663
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:57,880
 It was where you could buy nice things for dogs, like toilet in the sense of toilet water.

664
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,000
 And it was incredibly lavish because it was on Bond Street,

665
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,760
 so you could get scented baths or hankies for your dog or jeweled collars or fur coats.

666
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,560
 When was that?

667
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,160
 Early 20th century.

668
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
 That's where the people have been doing that for so long.

669
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,440
 Yeah, so that Dog's Toilet Club is also in the beastly London book.

670
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,640
 I cannot recommend it enough.

671
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:21,160
 One of my favorite circus facts of recent times is that John Majors' dad,

672
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,320
 former Prime Minister of England, John Majors, his dad was in the circus.

673
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,880
 And by all accounts, I'm going to actually probably read about him.

674
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,160
 Sounds like an extraordinary guy, Tom Major.

675
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,840
 And the idea that everyone says is fact,

676
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,920
 although I don't think David Bowie actually said it,

677
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,720
 is that he used to see the poster of Tom Major.

678
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,600
 That was Major Tom.

679
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,520
 And that was Major Tom, and that was in Brixton,

680
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,760
 and that was where Bowie was at the time.

681
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,760
 So originally, when this is ground control to Tom Major.

682
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,920
 Well, the roar of John Major.

683
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,280
 You will be the Prime Minister.

684
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,720
 (Laughter)

685
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,920
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

686
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,280
 Thank you so much for listening.

687
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,160
