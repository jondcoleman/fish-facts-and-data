00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.740
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.820
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.500
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.840
 from Glasgow!

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.840
 (audience cheering)

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.240
 Yes!

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.340
 I am sitting here with Anna Toshinsky,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.040
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.660
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.640
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.920
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.600
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.720
 - My fact is that in 1907, a man named Charles W. Aldrieve

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.720
 won a huge bet, simply by walking 1,500 miles on water.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.600
 (audience laughing)

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.560
 I've gone for the mysterious fact.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.080
 - Was that a bet with Jesus?

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.880
 - It was a bet with Jesus, yeah,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.320
 who got furthest about thinking, "No, this is the guy here."

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.760
 So just for the people in the room,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.800
 this is him, Charles Aldrieve.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.200
 Aldrieve was such a hero, okay,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.880
 he was nicknamed the human water spider.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.880
 And he basically, he had a career,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.120
 he had a career, which just evolved

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.400
 going around walking on water,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.800
 and crowds absolutely ate it up.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.860
 And this was 1907, and there was a big bet,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.800
 and he stood to gain $5,000,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.680
 which was obviously way more at the time.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.840
 He was walking from Cincinnati to New Orleans,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.720
 and he had to do it, but every step had to be on water.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.480
 And he had these special shoes,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.480
 which were massive, obviously, about four feet long, and--

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.840
 - Apparently it took him five years

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.640
 to learn how to turn properly.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.080
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.880
 - It was a full, he was well-trained, yeah.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880
 - It was really, it was described as kind of like

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.120
 walking through mud,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.160
 the way that he was propelling himself forward.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.600
 So he had, as the listener will have to picture it,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.000
 but it's a sort of like a long boat of a shoe,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.600
 and he would wear a Wellington boot

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.800
 before he put his foot in,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.200
 and then he would put a sort of watertight,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.960
 sort of elastic around it, so that water couldn't get in.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.440
 So if he flipped over, he couldn't get out of there,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.080
 it was just, he was stuck.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.400
 - Very dangerous.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.600
 But he was a very dangerous guy, like he was a showman,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 so he used to do things like take a stick of dynamite

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.200
 out of his back, and he would light his cigar

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.840
 with the dynamite, and then chuck it into the water,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.760
 and giant shooting 20 meter tall foot waves

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.680
 would go into the air on the back of it.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.040
 Cool, dude. - He was incredible.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.720
 - It was weird that he was so into this very specific trick

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.760
 for his entire life, like three decades, basically.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.560
 So he claimed in 1898,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.200
 he was actually gonna walk across the Atlantic Ocean,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.760
 which would have been a much better fact

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.200
 if he had actually done it.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.240
 I mean, it's unbelievable he thought he could do this.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.480
 He was planning to walk to Paris,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.280
 I think 'cause he wanted to walk to the Paris Exposition

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.000
 or something, but he said he was inspired to do this

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.840
 when he was giving a demonstration

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.640
 of his walking on water shoes on a beach in Florida,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.080
 and he got sucked out to sea by a current,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.200
 and the boat that went to rescue him capsized,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.120
 they couldn't rescue him, and everyone was like,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.440
 "Oh, God, we've lost him, he's gone forever."

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.160
 - He's like, "I've already done half a mile,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.600
 "I might as well do the rest."

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.200
 (laughing)

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.440
 - Well, he got dragged out to sea, you know, a mile or two,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.640
 and once the wind had died down,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.880
 he was seen mounting the horizon

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.600
 and walking back towards the beach on the sea,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.600
 and he thought, "God, if I survive that,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.440
 "I reckon I could do the whole ocean."

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.640
 - His idea was that he would walk along the water,

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.360
 and whenever there was like a big swell of a wave,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.720
 he would let it bring him up,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.680
 and then he would kind of ski down the end of the wave,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.720
 and then just wait for them to come.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.280
 But you say it's like, it's an impossible thing,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.760
 but someone has done that.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.760
 There's a guy called Remy Bricker from France.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.320
 - I bet he was indeed bricking it for most of the swim.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.640
 - Sorry, he was, but he walked from Tenerife to Trinidad

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.560
 on boat, you know, boats.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.640
 - It was the 80s, it was 1988,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.920
 and he survived, Remy Bricker, the French guy,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.760
 he survived by eating plankton, he claimed.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.600
 (laughing)

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.760
 - So, the Guardian said that,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.680
 so what did he, like, if a blue whale eats plankton,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.240
 it kind of just opens its mouth and just lets it go in.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.200
 Is that what he was doing?

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.400
 - Exactly, it was, yeah, and he was French,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.560
 so he probably cooked them very brilliantly as well

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.360
 along the way, and he had these polyester skiing floats.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.120
 He was doing the same thing, basically.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.160
 He did suffer extreme hunger and vision problems

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.800
 as he tried to cross the Atlantic, he did 40 days.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.360
 But then, Remy Bricker said,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.800
 "Okay, I've done the Atlantic on water,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.640
 "I'm gonna go for the Pacific."

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.640
 And when asked why, I just love this answer, okay,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.160
 so French, he said, "In this life, I have flesh and bone.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.200
 "I know our time goes very quickly.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.040
 "In eternity, our time is one second.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.200
 "In this one second, I will use my time

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.920
 "to realise my dream."

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.240
 (laughing)

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.880
 - And one second later, he drowned.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.200
 (laughing)

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.960
 - Well, he failed, he absolutely failed.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.120
 He failed despite the fact he was sponsored

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.240
 by an American sauerkraut company called Stuffler.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.040
 - What, despite that?

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.080
 - Well, he was dragging 22 pounds of sauerkraut with him

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.680
 as he tried to cross the Pacific.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.520
 - You need something to go with that plankton on the side.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.240
 - You've got to keep the microbiome healthy

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.720
 when you're out at sea.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.320
 - In normal life, he is a one-man band.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.960
 He, you know the guys with the--

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.400
 - I was literally one-man band.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.000
 - Yeah, he's actually, in French, an homme orchestre.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.840
 - Right.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.680
 - That's the French for a one-man band.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.960
 - As in he has lots of instruments,

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.400
 I mean, you've mined it there, but just to be clear,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.880
 he has lots of instruments rigged up on his body, does he?

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.160
 - We all know the one-man band.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.080
 - We're just saying that mimes don't work with a podcast.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.720
 - True, 'cause he's French,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.160
 I think I was thinking the mime would work, yeah.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.880
 - Why is he not combined the two?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.920
 Why is he not bringing the band with him on the water?

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.480
 - I think if he can't bring a simple thing

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.600
 like 22 pounds of sauerkraut as he walks across an ocean.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600
 - The full drum kit is probably crazy to admit.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.720
 - I guess there's some similar skills, isn't there?

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.920
 Like it's lots of moving around, moving your legs and stuff.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.280
 He didn't make it like you say,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.960
 but it was because on the first day,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.120
 Storm wrecked the catamaran that he towed behind him.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.120
 So all of his food and all of his bed

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.000
 and all of his supplies just went down on the first day.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.680
 - He was towing a whole catamaran.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.080
 - The interesting thing about, well, it wasn't catamaran

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.160
 in the case that it had two bows, right?

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.560
 But the interesting thing about that

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.440
 is when Old Reeve was gonna walk over the Atlantic,

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.040
 he decided, like I said, he was gonna ski down these swells,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.880
 but he reckoned that when it was really calm weather,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.320
 he would tow a boat with him.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.720
 So there would be, there was a boat nearby

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.000
 that would kind of follow him with supplies.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.200
 And he thought that what I would do is when it's calm,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.520
 I'll just tow the boat, it doesn't need sales.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.480
 - That's brilliant.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.200
 - In 1898, he walked from New York harbour

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.360
 to Governor's Island, which is where the army base was.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.000
 And the New York Journal reported that when he arrived

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.320
 at the army base, the commandant felt the wonderful fine muscles

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.000
 of the man who had made so wonderful a trip.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.440
 - Ooh!

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.440
 - That... - Wow.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.080
 - That... - (LAUGHS)

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.480
 - Glass goes out for it, but... - (LAUGHTER)

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.880
 - That feels a bit like an excuse, doesn't it?

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.440
 Or you've made such a wonderful trip,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.280
 your thigh muscles must be wonderful as well,

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.000
 and so that feels a bit of a pretext.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.560
 - I wonder, because it's a military base, right?

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.640
 Do they think he was the sort of advance arm of an attack, I wonder?

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.280
 - Well, that was the thing, though, wasn't it?

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.440
 People were doing this already.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.040
 They were trying to make boat shoes and go out and walk waters,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.920
 and someone had an idea that what if we created an army battalion

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.560
 that could walk across water?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.160
 - That we would lose every one.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.120
 - (LAUGHTER)

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.680
 - And that's why it didn't happen.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.160
 - But it was... Yeah, this guy, Robert Kjellberg,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.240
 he trained some soldiers to wear a heavy backpack

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.280
 and fire a rifle while walking on water.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.360
 And he toured the whole of England.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.240
 He was known as the Water King, and this was a huge, huge thing.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.200
 - It's not huge, it wasn't a huge thing.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.800
 - And also, he was known as the Water King.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.440
 He wasn't the Water King!

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.360
 (LAUGHTER)

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.640
 - Oh, look, it's the Water King!

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.960
 - It would definitely have the element of surprise, I think.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.160
 - Exactly! The Water King!

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.880
 (LAUGHTER)

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.800
 - Yeah, especially presented like that.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.920
 - Yeah.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.200
 - There's another thing where you have these kind of round shoes

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.840
 that ninjas are supposed to have used to walk on water with.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.120
 So they're probably about the size of a dustbin lid.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.400
 And you strap your feet to them.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.920
 And the idea was that ninjas could get across moats and things like that.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.800
 And I've been to ninja school, and that's what they say.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.960
 - "Beep, beep, beep, look back up!"

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.320
 - Yeah, okay.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.400
 - You've been to ninja school?

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.800
 - I've been to ninja school, and that's what they say anyway.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.680
 So the interesting thing... - No, no, no, no, no, no, obviously...

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.240
 - When did you go to ninja school?

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.920
 - What qualification? - Well, I was in Kyoto.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.680
 - Okay, that checks out so far.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:03.520
 - So, what qualifications did you do ninja GCSEs?

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.520
 (LAUGHTER)

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.880
 - I did, but I'm not allowed to show you the certificate.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.840
 - Wait, that's Spice! That's different!

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.840
 - No, I am... Well, look, I did do that thing, so...

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.560
 I think how about I mentioned before that they taught me how to throw ninja stars.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.400
 - Oh, yeah. - And they taught me how to throw chopsticks so I could kill a man.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.560
 - Really?

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.760
 (LAUGHTER)

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.040
 - Wow.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.480
 - Right. - Have you proofed it?

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.800
 - Let's do it. - Are you volunteering?

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.600
 - Who's got chopsticks? Come on.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.160
 Dan, you stand over there.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.560
 - I'll see you in Wagga Mamas after the show.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.560
 Anyway, the point that I was trying to make is that they told me this in ninja school,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.760
 but there's some new research.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.760
 (LAUGHTER)

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.160
 - Some old ninja documents. - Hey, Huckin, you're late.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.240
 I'm not late. I've been here for 45 minutes.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.000
 - The other thing they teach you how to do is to walk backwards

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.880
 while there are drawing pins on the floor.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.560
 - OK. - What?

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.600
 The walking backwards thing, do you just keep your feet,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.200
 your soles of the feet on the ground so you push the drawing pins out of the way?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.360
 Like a moonwalk, basically.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.000
 - It's not like a moonwalk. You kind of walk backwards,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.680
 but you sweep your back foot, and they also teach how to walk very slowly,

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.160
 so no one can hear you walking.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.080
 - It was like curling backwards with your feet. - Exactly.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.880
 - Nice. - I feel like we've gone off the point of this.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.640
 - I'm loving this. I'm loving it. - I'm loving it.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.080
 - The amount of shit I got when I said I'd been to clown school for a short course.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.480
 (LAUGHTER)

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.360
 This is all my Christmas is at once, you know?

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.440
 - Anyway, so they said this at ninja school,

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.400
 and there's been some new research,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.320
 and they found old ninja documents about these things called Mizugumo,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.360
 and they found the word "sit" next to them,

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.320
 and what they reckon is they weren't actually used by ninjas to walk on water.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.280
 They were actually like little boats you would sit on and paddle along.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.720
 - Ah! - Obviously!

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.240
 Why didn't they draw that conclusion

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.840
 when they first saw these round things that go on water?

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.400
 Why did they assume there were shoes before they assumed they were boats?

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.920
 - Cos the ninjas spread the myth that they can walk on water, you know?

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.120
 - Oh, it's a clever bit of PR. - It's PR, yeah.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.760
 - They're good on PR. - Very good on PR.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:22.280
 - Just on the elephant in the room, Jesus of Nazareth. - Yeah.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.160
 - We... - Has he caught that very often? - Yeah, please.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.840
 We've all been dancing around it.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.160
 Obviously, the Jesus Walking on Water thing on the Sea of Galilee.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.200
 In 2006, there was a suggestion,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.120
 and it was published in a proper academic journal

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.600
 called The Journal of Paleo-Lymnology,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.200
 the study of ancient lakes, obviously,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.880
 which suggested that there was ice in the Sea of Galilee.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.840
 It's more of a lake than a sea, I think.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.680
 And so, it has this rare property due to the salty and fresh water that feeds it.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.480
 And it has this rare property where you could have these bits of ice forming.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.920
 You know, like, part of it freezes over and part of it doesn't.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.480
 - Really? I mean, it's in the Middle East, isn't it?

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.640
 Yeah, but it gets cold sometimes, you know?

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.440
 And the suggestion is that spring's ice could have formed and made it look like Jesus was walking on water.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.280
 So, do you think they said to Jesus, "Can you do that trick again?

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.000
 "Walk on water?" He's like, "Oh, give me a few months."

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.240
 - Yeah, it's more of a Christmas miracle than anything. - Mists.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.680
 - Sorry, me-mists. Oh, whatever, mind. - Mists.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.440
 - But I saw... Genuinely, on the way here today,

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.440
 I saw a duck basically doing this in a pond.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.080
 It looked like it was walking on water,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.040
 but actually it was just standing on a stone that was near the surface of the water.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.320
 But it does make you think, doesn't it?

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.360
 - Well, on that note... - I guess it does.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.840
 - We should move on to our next fact. - Fact.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.960
 - Thank you, Andy. - Thank you.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:56.920
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:04.440
 My fact this week is that zebra spiders chase laser pointers exactly like a cat does.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.600
 So, this is a very exciting fact.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.280
 This is a discovery that basically zebra spiders, which are jumping spiders,

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.960
 are really similar to cats in quite a lot of ways.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.240
 Come on, mate. It's a disappointed kid you've got.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.320
 If they've asked for a pet cat, you come home with a microscopic spider

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.240
 and say, "They're really similar. I had it on a podcast."

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.560
 I didn't know what these spiders were until you said zebra spiders.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.880
 And then I looked them up, and basically, you know the tiny ones

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.960
 that sort of jerk in their movements.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.160
 - They hear, then they jerk, then they jerk again. - Yeah.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.640
 And they're very... Well, they pounce, right? That's their big thing.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.520
 And this was noticed by a scientist.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.880
 She was in her lab, and she had these spiders that were falling off her roof,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.920
 and then someone said, "Hey, have you seen that if you use a laser pointer,

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.520
 "that you can actually get them to chase it?"

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.800
 And she tested it out with another colleague, and that's what happened.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.080
 And they thought this is absolutely amazing.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.120
 And basically, what they think is like a cat,

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.920
 that this is something that I need to attack, kill, and eat.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.200
 And so, when they see the green laser pointer, that's what they do.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.000
 - But they can't because it's a laser. - Laser.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.520
 - But it's very exciting. - It's really cool, isn't it?

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.840
 This is, by the way, this from Ed Young article,

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.280
 who we had on the podcast not too long ago.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.600
 He said that we do raid his articles, and once again, we have plagiarised his work.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.440
 So, thank you, Ed.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.440
 Sorry, Ed, the fact ninjas have been in.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.360
 You'll never notice.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:27.120
 The thing I thought was that these astronomers' lab needs a clean.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.440
 Really? Who's got spiders falling off the ceilings of their lab?

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.200
 And also, you're supposed to be astronomers, you're not naturalists.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.080
 What if they... Did they miss an eclipse?

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.040
 You know, they're just coaxing spiders around.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:44.200
 - I think part of it was also to work out what jumping spiders can see with their eyes. - Yeah.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.640
 Because their eyes are a bit like telescopes in that they're kind of a tube,

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.600
 and there's a lens at both ends.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.360
 And you can work out what a telescope can see

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.240
 by working out the different lenses and the different distances and stuff like that.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.000
 And they worked out that most jumping spiders would be able to see the moon.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.320
 - Yeah, which is amazing. - Yeah, that's really cool.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.360
 Because they're small, so it doesn't sound amazing.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.880
 I wasn't amazed. If it makes you feel better, anyone who doesn't think it's amazing,

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.680
 I wasn't amazed at first, because I thought, "Well, I can see the moon."

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.960
 But it's much harder to see the moon if you don't look at me.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.440
 How many legs have you got?

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.280
 They're 5 to 9 millimetres. You're exactly... That's tiny to see the moon.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.920
 But I just don't think of what can see the moon.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.320
 And now here we are thinking about it.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.760
 I mean, moths can see the moon, can't they?

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.560
 Well, ah, but can they?

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.520
 Yeah, they can, cos then they think lights are the moon, and they're pretty small.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.560
 Come on, I think the spider spider's bragging about this moon seeing is...

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.480
 But that means they presumably can see your face.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.680
 Cos your face is a bit distant, it's a bit bigger.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.640
 In fact, it's way bigger than the moon, normally.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.480
 - And they think your face is weird. - And they think your face is weird.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.400
 If you want to move around like a ninja, do it when there's no moon.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.480
 - Oh! - God!

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.320
 But it's weird to think of a spider that can see your face.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.280
 - Why is that weird? - I don't know.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.960
 Cos I don't think of a spider as having a face.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.080
 Spiders absolutely have faces, right? They have eyes.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.720
 - What are you talking about? - They've got eyes.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.800
 But they don't have a face, a proper face.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.000
 So you think if you don't have a proper face, you shouldn't be allowed to see other faces?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 No, I'm not saying that. I'm not thinking at all.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.760
 I'm just saying it's a surprise to think that they could look up and think,

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.040
 "Oh, there's Dan." That's a weird thing.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.680
 Can I just jump in here for a second?

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.680
 - Can I ask? - Oh, we didn't see you, though!

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:38.200
 Dan, I told you to put more drawing pins down before the show started.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.760
 I want to know if you're surprised/interested in this.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.360
 And that is that there is a spider called the Ogre-Faced Spider.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.440
 And by looking at their eyes, we can work out that they can make out

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.600
 the Andromeda galaxy in the sky.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.760
 - What?! - That's cool.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.440
 - Can we see that? - Yeah, well...

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.280
 You can just about on a really dark day in the middle of nowhere, yeah.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.400
 Do they know what it is? Do they say, "See Andromeda again?"

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.120
 No, they aren't cool.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.920
 One thing that zebra spiders do specifically, apparently,

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.560
 is they do respond to humans,

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.320
 which I do think is something that we don't think of non-mammals as doing.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.640
 Like, you see a cat, it sees you, it responds to you.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.640
 And if a human walks into the room while they're going about their business,

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.640
 they'll sort of turn around and look up at you.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.920
 And they do have... Andi says they can see our faces,

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.920
 but we can see theirs as well, obviously.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.360
 And they do have such good faces, Jumping Spiders,

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.200
 because they've got those two giant...

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.200
 They just look like something out of sci-fi.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.200
 There's two giant eyes in the middle,

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.600
 and then two slightly smaller eyes either side.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.040
 - Look 'em up. They're great stuff. - They are very cool.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.480
 Excitingly, Jumping Spiders, these specific zebra Jumping Spiders,

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.160
 have been to space.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.840
 This is cool, so they've got closer to the moon

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.840
 or other things they can see, which is great.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.320
 - Oh, must have been massive up there. - Must have been amazing.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.320
 Yeah, yeah, it must be really cool.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.320
 So there was this theory that...

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.880
 Because they jump and they pounce onto their prey,

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.880
 they obviously take gravity into account when they're jumping.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.080
 So they jump, they know they're going to fall at a certain rate,

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.480
 they know they're going to hit the prey.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.280
 And there was a theory, a question.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.560
 If we take them to a tiny microgravity environment

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.400
 and they jump, they're not going to jump the same way,

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.040
 will they keep on missing their prey,

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.920
 or will they be able to learn about space, basically,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.400
 learn about microgravity?

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.000
 And this was an 18-year-old guy from Egypt called Amon Mohammed,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.960
 and he won a competition to do this experiment on the ISS.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.120
 Not to go himself, but just to, like, have the experiment done.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.640
 And the thesis was they won't be able to learn, and they did learn.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.160
 - Yeah. - They learned how to adapt to zero gravity,

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.840
 - which is very exciting. - And what they did was,

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.400
 instead of jumping on their prey, they kind of just sidled up to it.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.400
 - Yeah, yeah. - Didn't they?

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.280
 - And just went, "Hey..." - Yeah, there was one thought that they would...

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:48.920
 What they do do on Earth is that if they're jumping down from above on a prey,

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.840
 they need to make sure that they're going to land on the target.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.800
 So they tether themselves with one of their silk webs.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.640
 But it's a bit like Mission Impossible.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.000
 - Tom Cruise going down. - Which one?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.680
 - Mission Impossible 1. - Yep.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.560
 So they're sort of jumping down bungee-style,

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.880
 but if they need to pull the cord to stop,

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.640
 they can do that and bring themselves back up

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.160
 if they can see they're missing the prey.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.440
 So one of the thoughts in space was they might be using their line

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.240
 to sort of tether themselves, bring themselves back down,

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.840
 and help them along, but no, instead, they just walked up and ate.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.880
 It says to me the fruit flies that they deployed

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.480
 were not that energetic, to be honest.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.400
 If you can just stroll up to your fly.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.040
 Or it says that the pounce is just absolutely unnecessary on Earth as well.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.720
 - Exactly. - Just walk, mate.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.800
 Walk up to it.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.840
 It was this... Again, I think I've said this before,

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.040
 but I do find it funny the stuff they make these astronauts do in space.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.720
 And this one fell to Sunita Williams.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.680
 And I guess they dished them out at the start of an expedition.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.720
 They're like, "Do you want to do this random 16-year-old's idea?"

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.560
 She was the one who activated the flies every day,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.600
 and she sort of would release a plunger,

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.840
 which released all these flies into the den,

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.800
 and then the spiders would go for it.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.560
 And it was one zebra spider and one red-backed jumping spider.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.040
 And they were called Cleopatra and Nefertiti,

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.360
 and they did jolly well, but then, of course,

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.040
 they did plummet towards Earth at breakneck speeds

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.880
 at the end of the mission, and immediately the zebra spider died on impact.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.040
 - No, they were inside a capsule just to add quickly. - No, they weren't inside a capsule just to add quickly.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.320
 - It sounds like they just dug them out, like, from Argonne. - Yeah, they did.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.240
 No, no, they gave them a little spaceship.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.840
 What, like, the force of the re-entry killed them?

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.400
 It's not actually true. It's not both of them.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.520
 It was just the zebra spider, actually, Cleopatra.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.640
 And they're not clear on why she died, but it's something about the impact.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.640
 But Nefertiti did survive and went to the Smithsonian

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.760
 to live out her remaining sort of two months before she did.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.760
 - Copped it as well. - I think she lived in an actual, like,

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.720
 - display in a museum that you could visit, right? - Yeah, she did.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.480
 - So people visited Nefertiti. - But the other interesting thing,

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.280
 I think, that they found is that she learned how to do it the old way afterwards.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.880
 - Oh, my God, that's so clever. - Which I think that's really interesting.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.880
 - Yeah. - Yeah, that's so cool.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.520
 This is slightly off-topic, but I found out about a spider hunting thing.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:57.520
 - OK. - And it's a moth specifically called the metal-mark moth,

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.720
 which pretends to be a spider, right?

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.600
 So its wings have these marks on which look like big spider eyes,

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.680
 and other parts of its wings look like the furry legs of a spider.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.800
 It looks like a huge spider, actually, to other spiders,

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.280
 and it moves a bit like one.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.320
 And it's so good that actual jumping spiders will flirt with it

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.160
 - rather than try to kill it. - Oh, yeah. - Really? - Yeah.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.840
 I think it was said before that they're kind of not that picky jumping spiders, are they?

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.760
 Then we said that they sometimes just dance with other spiders

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.120
 that are not jumping spiders, and most of the time get eaten.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.040
 - Oh, yeah. - But that's the theory of the dance.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.600
 So they do this like courtship dance before the mating.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.400
 And the idea is, the reason they do that is so that there is certain distance away

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.080
 from the female that if they decide it's not worth it,

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.800
 then they have a chance to run away.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.600
 And apparently, there are certain moves that they have to do,

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.520
 and if they do a perfect dance, then they're guaranteed to have sex.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.080
 So it's like, you know, in Strictly, where if everyone gets tense...

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.160
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.080
 It works, the same in Strictly, doesn't it?

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.640
 - I believe so, yeah. - Wow.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.520
 But is there a thing where, if you don't do it perfectly,

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.240
 you will be killed and eaten?

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.640
 - You must. - Which also, weirdly, happens on Strictly.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.880
 Time to move on to our next fact.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.000
 It's time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.920
 OK, my fact this week is that according to a law of 1656,

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.880
 chicken owners on the Scottish borders had to give their chickens clogs.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.880
 - OK. - Right.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:41.520
 So, this is a thing that happened, not just down the road from here.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.920
 It's from the Records of Pebbles.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:50.360
 And this was about complaints of scraping of fowls in houses and yards,

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.600
 as in they'd been pooing over their neighbour's yards.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:59.000
 And they said that everyone who owned a hen or a capon, so any kind of chicken,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.160
 would have to tie such a weight of timber to the foot

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.360
 that would stop them from flying.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.440
 And then it specifically says that they are clogs,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:12.440
 and it says that forchilling would be paid to the owner of any fowl

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.840
 going without the clog, sorry, they would have to pay forchilling.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.880
 The thing was, if you were to come across any chicken without clogs in that area,

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.080
 then you were allowed to dispose of that chicken.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.160
 - But most people have... - That's sinister.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.880
 - I guess by eating it. - Yeah, sounds like it, yeah, yeah.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.960
 Most people have a lot of chickens, which means...

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.880
 Have a lot of chickens, you mean? Have a lot of chickens? Sorry.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.200
 - Let's do a poll of the room. - Yeah.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.680
 - Do most people in the room have a lot of chickens? - OK.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.760
 - One, thank you. - One, thank you.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.840
 So, what I meant to say was, you know that guy in the crowd

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.800
 who came to our show tonight, who has lots of chickens?

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.360
 Out of curiosity, how many have you got?

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.440
 - Loads. - Thank you.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.360
 - Loads. - So, my point says...

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.920
 - Who invited the colonel? - Yeah.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.000
 So, you know how that guy has loads of chickens?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 - Yes. - I'm actually starting to doubt his account,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.040
 if Harry's got loads of chickens now.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.480
 I'm just questioning how many clogs you need to buy,

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.280
 the price point of the clogs...

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.240
 I don't think these are beautiful, carved, painted clogs

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.880
 made by Dutch artisans.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.640
 I think it's more like a lump of wood tied to your chicken's foot.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.120
 I'm afraid so, but they called them clogs in the law.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.080
 So, they didn't even carve an inside to put there?

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.440
 We don't own any of these in any museum.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.920
 Surely they would have had some insoles, at least,

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.520
 so they'd be comfortable as they walked around.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.520
 Apology for me hearing a fact that said they wear clogs

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.840
 and assuming that maybe they wore a fucking clog.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.400
 Clogs are like... Clogs can be anything, you know.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.800
 No, they can't. If I got you some clogs to wear,

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.400
 I'm not going to hand you a block of wood.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.800
 I'm going to give you a shoe.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.520
 - Just on clogs. - Oh, yeah.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.280
 So, you guys are familiar with clog fighting?

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.680
 - Oh, yeah. - This is the thing.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.160
 Is that just a stick fight?

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.720
 So, this is...

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.240
 Fair enough. That's fair.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.000
 - This is human clog fighting. - Uh-huh.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:12.160
 And this was, I think, a Lancashire sport/way of fighting someone else,

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.000
 - where you... - We call that spot in Lancashire.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.360
 It was known as fighting Wigan fashion, which is great.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.680
 You would just kick each other.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.800
 You and one other person would just repeatedly kick each other

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.600
 while wearing heavy wooden clogs.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.200
 And you would either... This is the great thing.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.400
 You would either be wearing your finest clothing

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.360
 - or be completely naked. - LAUGHTER

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.480
 You would hope that you would, like, work that out before the day.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.720
 - Oh, God, so bouncy. - 'Cause if you're awful,

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.000
 if they turned up in their finest clothing, then you'd...

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.840
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.520
 - It sounds so rough. - So, what you would do is...

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.880
 You would hold onto each other's shoulders,

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.840
 and then you were wearing very heavy clogs,

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.760
 and they would kind of, you know, say that you should sharpen them, really.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.920
 And you would just keep kicking until one of you shouted, "Sufficient!"

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.360
 - LAUGHTER - This is shin-kicking, right?

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.080
 This is Lancastrian Purin.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.960
 It was known as Purin, or, like you say, Wigan fashion fighting.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.800
 And they thought that it was, like, really turn of the 20th century,

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.800
 that it happened, and then it died out.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.280
 But a friend of mine called Anna F.C. Smith, who's an artist in Lancashire,

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.320
 she managed to find evidence of it up until the '50s.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.080
 - So, people are still doing it in the '50s. - '50s? Wow.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.880
 - Oh, that's incredible. - Were there rules on the, like, the size...

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.600
 Like, could Charles Aldreave have come with his big dog shoes?

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.880
 - LAUGHTER - That's a really good point.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.600
 They would be your actual clogs,

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.040
 because people in Lancashire wore clogs in those days,

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.920
 and so you would wear your normal clogs, but you might sharpen them.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.440
 You might put bits of metal on them,

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.720
 because sometimes the rules were the first to draw blood

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.480
 would be the one who got the... - Right. - ..who got the win.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.440
 There was a thing... I read a story from 1838,

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.200
 where there was such a brutal, clogged fight

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.440
 that one of the guys fighting went deaf in one ear

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.000
 from being kicked in the leg... - Wow. - That's amazing.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.240
 That's not... There's no connection between those two.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.320
 - No. It's sort of like a weird kind of reflexology. - Yeah.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.880
 Your shin is connected to your ear.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.920
 And there was another thing where you would be holding...

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.560
 This is another method of clog fighting.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.240
 Both of you hold a handkerchief between your teeth,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.000
 and the one who drops it first loses.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.520
 Like a tug of war with the handkerchief.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.920
 - Yeah, but no, no, no, no. - Is it the same handkerchief?

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.000
 You're holding the same handkerchief between your two teeth,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.760
 and the one who drops it from there and loses.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.600
 - But I think that is... - Because you might go, "Ah!"

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.920
 - And then it falls out. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.880
 But I think there's a way of winning the fight.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.920
 Never mind your legs, you just start eating the handkerchief, right?

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.080
 - I'm not like Lady and the Tramp. - Like Lady and the Tramp.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.920
 - Right. - And then...

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.520
 If you've got the handkerchief in your mouth, he's lost the fight.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.840
 - Yeah. - It depends how deep you want your opponent

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.360
 to get inside your own mouth.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.040
 You might prefer to just be kicked in the shin.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.880
 - You're both naked. - You're already on pretty intimate terms.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.560
 They weren't, the Lancashians were very into clogs, weren't they?

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.800
 - Yeah. - And they're clogged dancing.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.760
 They were very into that when they weren't fighting with them.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.120
 They were dancing with them.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.640
 And it seemed very specific from about 1880 to 1904 or '05.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.200
 And people speculate that the reason they got into clogged dancing

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.040
 was partly to warm up in the cold, industrial, northern towns.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.200
 Which, I don't know, it's not that much colder.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.520
 But, yeah, it was as popular as wrestling, boxing, clogged dancing.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.480
 - It was. - The three big draws.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.160
 There was a group called the J.W. Jackson's Clog Dancers.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.840
 And they're a group of young boys.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.440
 And they would wear football jerseys.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.600
 And they had clogs with buckles on and bits of metal.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.640
 So that sometimes when you did your dance, they would do sparks.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.000
 And they actually tore the whole of the UK.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.440
 They were absolutely massive.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.680
 And one of the original guys dropped out in 1896.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.880
 And he was replaced by an eight-year-old called Charlie Chaplin.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.760
 - Oh. - Oh.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.000
 - The same. - The same?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.440
 - No, completely the same. - Wow.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.280
 - Very cool. - So was that his first job, basically?

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.560
 - Eight years old, he'd been working for like eight years at that point.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.000
 The clog itself, the full wooden one, the clump, the clumpen.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.880
 - Clumpen, yeah. - It's really interesting reading about them

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.320
 because they're actually really safe shoes for you to wear.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.800
 If you're doing hard labour, if you're building on a building side,

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.840
 you're down in a coal mine or whatever, they're incredibly sturdy.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.000
 But also, they're much better than, say, like a modern boot

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.720
 with a steel cap inside.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.760
 Because if something drops on them,

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.440
 the metal of a boot can bend inward and crush your foot

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.480
 and you get stuck in there.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.120
 Whereas with this, it just kind of splits the shoe open.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.640
 So at least you're not sort of mangled within the shoe.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.920
 - Yeah. - I feel like the makers of steel-capped shoes

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.320
 might object to the, like, they're much safer.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.840
 But this basically came out because the EU said in the '90s,

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.960
 clogs aren't safe.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.200
 And a lot of people in the Netherlands still then traditionally,

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.360
 and still sometimes now traditionally, wore clogs.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.320
 So farmers, fishermen, factory workers, you know,

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.760
 there are lots of jobs where clogs would be the workman's boot of choice.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.520
 And the EU said these haven't been tested properly.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.560
 And so I'm afraid you're going to have to ditch the clogs

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.280
 and wear steel-capped shoes.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.480
 And so the Netherlands organisation for Applied Scientific Research

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.840
 ran a whole bunch of tests to prove that they were as safe.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.800
 So they got all these clogs in to the factory

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.240
 and they bashed them with a mechanical hammer.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.640
 They compared, they put one tonne weights on them

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.080
 to see how they survived so that it was like being run over by a car.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.480
 They pierced the soles with nails, they submerged them in water,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.960
 they baked them in ovens at 300 degrees.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.680
 - What? - Wow.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.280
 I don't know in what circumstances, you're suddenly in a furnace.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.520
 Like, if you're there, only your feet.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.760
 We've got great news, the clogs have survived.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.480
 We managed to save his feet.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.440
 Here's the facts about Dutch wooden shoes.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.160
 Apparently, there was a traditional Dutch marriage proposal

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.880
 where if you fancied someone, you would buy a pair of very ornate clogs

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:56.200
 and then you would secretly, at night, put them on the doorstep

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.400
 of the person you wanted to marry.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.040
 Well, that'd be very hard to do, James.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.240
 I mean, you'd need someone with special training at...

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.080
 LAUGHTER

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.960
 ..sneaking around in the dark.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.360
 Am I just trying to speak around in clogs?

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.600
 Clog, Ninjas.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.400
 I don't think you have to wear the clogs to eat before you deposit

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:20.360
 because that's why the Dutch have no ninja skills whatsoever.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.840
 Well, the idea was then you would return the next morning

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.440
 and if your beloved was wearing the clogs,

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.640
 that meant she had accepted the proposal.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.480
 Oh, my God!

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.560
 And then she would wear them till her wedding day.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.560
 OK, question.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.240
 Does she... Have you left a note to say these are from me?

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.800
 It's really interesting.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.640
 Does she put them on and think, "Yes, James has proposed!"

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.640
 And then... I fear that might have been it

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.360
 because as far as I can tell, there's no notes from the source

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.360
 that I read.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.240
 I assume you've let her know that that's going to happen

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.080
 or something because otherwise it's a bit of a shot in the dark,

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.080
 isn't it?

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.240
 Or maybe everyone had those doorbell cans back in medieval...

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.240
 ..medalines.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.720
 LAUGHTER

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.200
 We're going to have to move on very soon.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.200
 Oh, righty.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.200
 Yeah.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.360
 I noticed very recently, there's a new trend for...

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.880
 We're talking about animals wearing shoes.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.640
 There's a new trend for dogs wearing shoes.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.920
 I found the company...

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.920
 Well, to begin with, I got quite excited

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.960
 because Dolly Parton has started a new company for animals.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.760
 It's like a parol for animals called Doggy Parton.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.880
 And it's specifically for her dogs.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.960
 So you can get cowgirl hats for your dog.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.400
 You can get Dolly Parton-esque wigs for your dog.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.120
 There's pink high heels, but it turns out it's a stuffed toy,

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.760
 so that doesn't count.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.000
 The dog's not in...

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 But then there's another company that's just started.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.560
 I think it was last year called Riff Ruff,

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.520
 who has designed all these dog shoes for...

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.560
 And I think it was a pug in the website that I saw,

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.600
 and they kind of look like they're wearing, like, Nike shoes

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.640
 and Adidas, and they've made a hoodie as well,

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.440
 and it seems to be coming back in.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.440
 To what extent...

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.480
 I haven't seen, so far, dogs strutting the streets of Glasgow,

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.720
 certainly, with their stilettos on.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.000
 No, but if you use the offercode "FISH",

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.720
 you can get 20% off your first dog shoe on Riff Ruff.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.520
 # #

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.280
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.240
 and that is Anna.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.480
 My fact this week is that Einstein was so famous

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.240
 that women reportedly fainted in his presence,

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.880
 and a mob once broke down the door of a lecture hall

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.080
 screening one of his films.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.440
 Yeah, he made films.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:34.120
 He was a big director, he was like Spielberg of his day.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.120
 He's not thinking of Robert Pattinson.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.520
 That's who I'm thinking of.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.480
 He was the Robert Pattinson of his day.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.680
 I had no idea that he was such a heartthrob

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.280
 and just such a big celeb.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:51.600
 So this particular lecture screening incident

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.640
 was quite a big deal.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.520
 I think it was called, like, the New York Einstein riots

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.200
 or something, but it was 1930,

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.840
 and the New York Amateur Astronomers Association

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.240
 was doing a showing...

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.600
 Einstein wasn't even coming.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.440
 They were just doing a showing of a film

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.880
 explaining his theory of relativity.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.120
 So, you know, stuff that Einstein's, you know, recently got into

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.080
 and everyone sort of started reading about,

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.320
 and they sent out 1,500 invitations to their members,

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.720
 and 4,500 people turned up, and they mobbed the place,

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.200
 and the guards couldn't keep control of them.

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.680
 They were sort of bashing into exhibits and stuff

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.320
 in the, you know, in the central hall.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.680
 They had to call the police to try and calm them down,

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.840
 and they did break down the door to the lecture theatre

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.160
 in order to see the movie.

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.280
 - Right. - Wow.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.520
 - What year was that, sorry? - 1930.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.880
 - 1930. - 'Cause he became quite big

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.960
 just after the First World War, didn't he?

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.480
 - Yeah. - And that was one of the reasons.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.920
 So he kind of made this prediction of where stars would be

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.920
 at a certain time due to his theory of relativity,

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.920
 and there had been an eclipse,

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.280
 and so because there was an eclipse there,

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.080
 they could measure these stars.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.360
 And the interesting thing was that the people who did the

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.280
 measurement were British,

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.320
 and so it was kind of seeing this great moment,

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.720
 so the war's finished, but we have the British scientists

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.800
 and the German scientists coming together

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.960
 and proving this new theory, and that is what the result is.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.000
 - Eddington. Was it Eddington? - Yeah, exactly.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.360
 So that's kind of why he became so famous at the time.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.400
 - Right. - Yeah.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.760
 He actually said, 'cause he, as you say,

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.240
 it was the eclipse in, was it 1919?

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.320
 - Yeah. - Eclipse?

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.600
 Total eclipse, that sort of verified

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.880
 his theory of general relativity,

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.360
 which was basically explaining a way

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.760
 Newton's theory of gravity.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.600
 So it was saying, actually, gravity is explained

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.480
 by kind of a bends in the, you know, in space-time.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.600
 I think a really good analogy I read was,

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.760
 he explained that if you have a huge mass,

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.480
 then it bends space-time in the same way

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.760
 if you drop a heavy ball on a trampoline,

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.920
 then it creates a dent in the trampoline,

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.040
 and that pulls other objects on the trampoline

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.120
 a bit towards it, and in the same way it bends space-time.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.960
 But so it took the eclipse to prove this to everyone else,

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.120
 but Einstein had his theory proved to himself in 1915,

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.120
 'cause he saw something in the orbit of Mercury

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.760
 that wasn't quite right, and the only way to explain it

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.560
 was that his theory of general relativity was correct,

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.560
 and he said when he found that anomaly

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.800
 in the orbit of Mercury, he was so excited

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.520
 that he had heart palpitations and couldn't work for three days.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.160
 - Yeah, wow. - Yeah.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.360
 The one in 1919 took a lot of people by surprise.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.360
 They didn't realize it was gonna be so huge,

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.120
 and so the New York Times wanted to get someone

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.640
 to interview him or to, you know, go to his lectures,

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.280
 but they didn't have anyone there who really understood it,

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.080
 so they sent a guy called Henry Crouch,

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.960
 who was their golfing correspondent.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.480
 - Wow. - And Henry Crouch wasn't just...

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.640
 Didn't just not know anything about physics.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.400
 Because he didn't know anything about physics,

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.800
 they wouldn't let him into the press conference,

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.840
 but he still had to send something to the New York Times,

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.520
 and so he sent them an article that was headlined,

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.640
 "Stars, not where they seemed or calculated to be,

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.360
 "but nobody need worry."

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.960
 - OK. - That's so good.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:04.360
 I read this theory that Einstein mania was actually a mistake.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:08.640
 - OK. - So, he came to New York in 1921,

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.000
 and there was this huge crowd.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.680
 It was so exciting, you know,

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.200
 there were thousands of people lining the streets waiting for him.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.440
 There's a really good theory that actually they weren't there for him at all.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.680
 - What? - I know.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.960
 So, he visited. He was on someone else's trip.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.480
 There was a politician called Chaim Weitzman.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.520
 He was a politician, and he was a poster child

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.080
 for creating an Israel, basically.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.640
 He was a Zionist politician,

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.200
 and Einstein was the most famous Jewish person in the world,

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:36.040
 and Einstein just sort of said, "OK, I'll come along to be there."

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.320
 So, when the ship docked, thousands of supporters came to cheer.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.320
 They weren't cheering for Einstein, they were cheering for Weitzman,

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.120
 and all the Yiddish newspapers reported,

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.360
 "Oh, big crowd turned out for Weitzman, that's great."

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.080
 But all the English newspapers just thought,

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:54.280
 "Oh, Einstein, he's a crazy physicist, he plays the violin, he's so funny."

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.720
 And they were all here for Einstein, and then it turned into mega-Einstein mania.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.760
 - What did the banners say? Come on, surely they were waving posters?

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.160
 - What are they screaming? - Yeah.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.200
 - Because he was undeniably huge in America. - He was also famous, in fact.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.400
 There was this rumour that women fainted in his presence.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.200
 He was mobbed wherever he went, he'd land in airports,

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.040
 and the London Palladium, after he'd been to New York

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.520
 and they'd seen this huge reception,

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.520
 the London Palladium asked him to do a three-week-long one-man show,

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.840
 which he'd turned down the idiot.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.520
 - Well, we did a one-day-long four-man show. - Yeah?

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:33.000
 Yeah, we're one-twenty-first of an Einstein between us.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.720
 I think about him as well, is that he really intimidated people.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.840
 You know, if you were in the presence of Einstein...

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.720
 - It's... - How?

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.360
 Well, it's kind of... Actually, I kind of remember the very first time

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.400
 when I started QI and met Stephen Fry.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.120
 I genuinely felt intimidated that I was meeting someone of great intellect,

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.920
 that I just said stupid things the whole time.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.880
 But he also intimidates people for fun, with a knuckle duster.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.840
 Yeah, I mean, that was a bit weird, yeah.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.880
 And his real accent as well, "All right, mate, how's it going?"

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.040
 I didn't... That was a shock, I gotta say.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.840
 Um...

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.840
 Anyway, my legs are not broken anymore.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.840
 Oh, man.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.480
 But I remember seeing him going at you with those clogs.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.920
 - It was something... - Oh, my God.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.240
 That's going to suffice!

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.720
 (LAUGHTER)

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.320
 But so, there was a story, and this was published in The New York Times,

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.880
 that when he was ill in 1928, there was a New York physician

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.120
 who attended to him while he was in Germany.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.440
 And the physician used to tell him anecdotes.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.400
 Like, he had just anecdote after anecdote after anecdote.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.280
 And everyone thought that he was doing this

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.640
 because he was just wanting to make Einstein cheerful.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.960
 But he said, "Not at all."

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.360
 He memorized 150 anecdotes

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.640
 because he was so worried of Einstein asking him any questions

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.080
 and the ignorance of his answers coming out

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.000
 that he quickly diverted everything into,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.400
 "Oh, did you hear the one about the time when the person did that?"

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.640
 And he had 150 of them at the ready...

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.240
 - That's amazing. - ...so that he would never run out.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.920
 I want to see his one-man show, to be honest.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.240
 - That would be good. - That's very...

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.320
 He was a real player.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.560
 - Um... Or... - Yeah?

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:07.320
 Or tart, um, depending on which way you look at it.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.400
 - Wow. - Um...

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.560
 From the age of about 15, he was kind of had various girlfriends,

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:15.760
 and he ended up age 17, um, in love with this...

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.000
 other fellow physicist, the only female physicist studying where he was studying,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.240
 Milaver Marich.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:23.960
 And they did love each other, I think, and he actually did get her pregnant.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.800
 But we have no idea what happened to that child.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.000
 Liesl, we have no idea because she...

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.160
 They couldn't marry because he didn't have a job yet.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.320
 She went away, child disappeared.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.520
 But anyway, he didn't stick with her for that long.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.520
 He fell in love with someone else while he was married to Milaver.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.440
 He fell in love with Elsa.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.800
 But then I think, as he was in love with Elsa,

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.360
 he also fell in love with her daughter, Elsa.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.120
 - Sorry? - Elsa and Elsa.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.560
 - Wait, hang on. - Elsa and Elsa.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.600
 - Elsa... - Yeah.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.520
 - Elsa was his first cousin. - Yeah.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:57.280
 But also, on the other side of her family, she was his second cousin.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.200
 - Yeah. - Ah.

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.040
 Is it possible Elsa and Elsa were the same woman?

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.920
 - No, it was definitely Elsa's daughter. - OK, OK, OK.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.920
 - Because they talked about it, because eventually... - This is why he was into relativity.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.120
 - Oh, God! - LAUGHTER

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.520
 Good.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.000
 - Very nice. - Um...

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.040
 No, definitely two different people, because he basically said to them,

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.960
 "I really want to marry you both."

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.320
 And, "Do you want to choose which one I marry?"

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.400
 And sort of proposed to the daughter, and the daughter eventually said,

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.320
 "I actually think of you as more like a father."

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.720
 Um, and so, John and Mary, my mum instead.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.240
 - And so, he did. - What?

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:38.040
 And that was just the kind of free-love situation he ended up in.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.960
 We mentioned ages ago on the podcast that his adopted granddaughter

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.880
 was someone who actually believed that she was the love child

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.280
 and was actually the daughter of Albert Einstein.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.600
 And she went to her grave believing this and pushing this,

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.440
 because she had people write to her, various people who knew Einstein.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.240
 She didn't even really meet him, I think possibly she only met him once.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.720
 - Yeah. - He didn't know some of his grandchildren.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.080
 Einstein once gave his grandson Cesar a three-hour lecture

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:08.200
 on the mathematical properties of soap bubbles.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.960
 Despite the fact that at the time, Cesar was eight years old.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.680
 - Right. - He took him out on a boat trip

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.520
 and would not stop talking about soap bubbles for three hours.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.960
 - They are quite interesting, though, aren't they? - They're quite interesting, yeah.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.440
 And eight years... I mean, Charlie Chaplin was club-dancing at eight years old.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.520
 - You know, he can listen to a three-hour lecture. - Yeah, yeah.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.720
 And some maybe other famous people, like, um,

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.200
 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, very famous, uh, in his time.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:37.560
 Uh, and because he was so famous, he became really, really paranoid.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.640
 And at one stage, he thought that everyone was sending him

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.720
 these, um, fan art, and they were so bad

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.960
 that he thought there was a conspiracy happened

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.080
 that people were mocking him with their terrible pictures.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.720
 Wow, I didn't think fan art existed like that at the time.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:56.480
 It did. People made drawings of him and paintings of him.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.640
 - Wow. - Uh, and he once had a visit from a couple of friends

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.080
 called, uh, Monsieur Madame Brett.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:05.520
 Uh, and he found out that Madame Brett had an engraving of him

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:09.280
 that she kept above her mantelpiece, and she really loved it.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.520
 And he completely fell out with her

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.240
 because he thought this was such a bad bit of fan art

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.000
 that he didn't want to be friends with anyone

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.400
 who could even look at it.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.000
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.600
 - That's a high friend bar. - That's amazing.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.440
 I mean, I've been to all of your houses,

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.880
 and I don't think much of the art on your walls, but I don't.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.200
 - Well, I've got a massive painting of you over my fireplace, Anna.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.720
 I can't believe you. - Yeah, and I take it as a parody of me,

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.720
 and I'm mostly offended.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.960
 Um, I'm gonna have to wrap us up in a sec.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.880
 I've got, uh, just a quick thing.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.640
 James, you mentioned earlier, Robert Pattinson.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.280
 - Oh, yeah. - Which you provided me.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.320
 There's a story, and, you know, these celebrity stories,

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.680
 God knows if they're true, but, um, he obviously has a lot of fans.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.560
 He was in Twilight. He's the new Batman.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.800
 Um, and he had a stalker as well,

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.320
 and he actually kind of hit it head-on,

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.360
 and he took the stalker to dinner.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:00.400
 Um, but at the dinner, he complained about his life so much

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:04.320
 that she got really bored and quit stalking him.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:10.000
 - That's such a good idea. - That's how you deal with it, yeah.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 - Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.800
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.040

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.680
 We're also doing these really fun behind-the-scene episodes as well,

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.080
 so do check that out.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.520
 But the main thing to say is, Glasgow,

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.480
 thank you so much for having us tonight.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.760
 We will be back again, and for the Lesnar at home,

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.960
 we'll be back again specifically next week.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.160

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.080
