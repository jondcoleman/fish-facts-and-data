1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,740
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,820
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,500
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,840
 from Glasgow!

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,840
 (audience cheering)

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,240
 Yes!

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,340
 I am sitting here with Anna Toshinsky,

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,040
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,660
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,640
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,920
 and in no particular order, here we go.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,600
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,720
 - My fact is that in 1907, a man named Charles W. Aldrieve

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,720
 won a huge bet, simply by walking 1,500 miles on water.

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,600
 (audience laughing)

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,560
 I've gone for the mysterious fact.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,080
 - Was that a bet with Jesus?

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,880
 - It was a bet with Jesus, yeah,

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,320
 who got furthest about thinking, "No, this is the guy here."

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,760
 So just for the people in the room,

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,800
 this is him, Charles Aldrieve.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,200
 Aldrieve was such a hero, okay,

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,880
 he was nicknamed the human water spider.

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,880
 And he basically, he had a career,

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,120
 he had a career, which just evolved

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,400
 going around walking on water,

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,800
 and crowds absolutely ate it up.

30
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,860
 And this was 1907, and there was a big bet,

31
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,800
 and he stood to gain $5,000,

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,680
 which was obviously way more at the time.

33
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,840
 He was walking from Cincinnati to New Orleans,

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,720
 and he had to do it, but every step had to be on water.

35
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,480
 And he had these special shoes,

36
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,480
 which were massive, obviously, about four feet long, and--

37
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,840
 - Apparently it took him five years

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,640
 to learn how to turn properly.

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,080
 - Really? - Yeah.

40
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,880
 - It was a full, he was well-trained, yeah.

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
 - It was really, it was described as kind of like

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,120
 walking through mud,

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,160
 the way that he was propelling himself forward.

44
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,600
 So he had, as the listener will have to picture it,

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,000
 but it's a sort of like a long boat of a shoe,

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
 and he would wear a Wellington boot

47
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,800
 before he put his foot in,

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
 and then he would put a sort of watertight,

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,960
 sort of elastic around it, so that water couldn't get in.

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,440
 So if he flipped over, he couldn't get out of there,

51
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,080
 it was just, he was stuck.

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
 - Very dangerous.

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,600
 But he was a very dangerous guy, like he was a showman,

54
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,600
 so he used to do things like take a stick of dynamite

55
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,200
 out of his back, and he would light his cigar

56
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,840
 with the dynamite, and then chuck it into the water,

57
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,760
 and giant shooting 20 meter tall foot waves

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,680
 would go into the air on the back of it.

59
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,040
 Cool, dude. - He was incredible.

60
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,720
 - It was weird that he was so into this very specific trick

61
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,760
 for his entire life, like three decades, basically.

62
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,560
 So he claimed in 1898,

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,200
 he was actually gonna walk across the Atlantic Ocean,

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,760
 which would have been a much better fact

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,200
 if he had actually done it.

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,240
 I mean, it's unbelievable he thought he could do this.

67
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,480
 He was planning to walk to Paris,

68
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,280
 I think 'cause he wanted to walk to the Paris Exposition

69
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
 or something, but he said he was inspired to do this

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,840
 when he was giving a demonstration

71
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,640
 of his walking on water shoes on a beach in Florida,

72
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,080
 and he got sucked out to sea by a current,

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,200
 and the boat that went to rescue him capsized,

74
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,120
 they couldn't rescue him, and everyone was like,

75
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,440
 "Oh, God, we've lost him, he's gone forever."

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,160
 - He's like, "I've already done half a mile,

77
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,600
 "I might as well do the rest."

78
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,200
 (laughing)

79
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,440
 - Well, he got dragged out to sea, you know, a mile or two,

80
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,640
 and once the wind had died down,

81
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,880
 he was seen mounting the horizon

82
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,600
 and walking back towards the beach on the sea,

83
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
 and he thought, "God, if I survive that,

84
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,440
 "I reckon I could do the whole ocean."

85
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,640
 - His idea was that he would walk along the water,

86
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,360
 and whenever there was like a big swell of a wave,

87
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,720
 he would let it bring him up,

88
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,680
 and then he would kind of ski down the end of the wave,

89
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,720
 and then just wait for them to come.

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,280
 But you say it's like, it's an impossible thing,

91
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,760
 but someone has done that.

92
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,760
 There's a guy called Remy Bricker from France.

93
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,320
 - I bet he was indeed bricking it for most of the swim.

94
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,640
 - Sorry, he was, but he walked from Tenerife to Trinidad

95
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,560
 on boat, you know, boats.

96
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,640
 - It was the 80s, it was 1988,

97
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,920
 and he survived, Remy Bricker, the French guy,

98
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,760
 he survived by eating plankton, he claimed.

99
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,600
 (laughing)

100
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,760
 - So, the Guardian said that,

101
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,680
 so what did he, like, if a blue whale eats plankton,

102
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,240
 it kind of just opens its mouth and just lets it go in.

103
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,200
 Is that what he was doing?

104
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,400
 - Exactly, it was, yeah, and he was French,

105
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,560
 so he probably cooked them very brilliantly as well

106
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,360
 along the way, and he had these polyester skiing floats.

107
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,120
 He was doing the same thing, basically.

108
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,160
 He did suffer extreme hunger and vision problems

109
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,800
 as he tried to cross the Atlantic, he did 40 days.

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,360
 But then, Remy Bricker said,

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,800
 "Okay, I've done the Atlantic on water,

112
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,640
 "I'm gonna go for the Pacific."

113
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,640
 And when asked why, I just love this answer, okay,

114
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,160
 so French, he said, "In this life, I have flesh and bone.

115
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,200
 "I know our time goes very quickly.

116
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,040
 "In eternity, our time is one second.

117
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,200
 "In this one second, I will use my time

118
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,920
 "to realise my dream."

119
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,240
 (laughing)

120
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,880
 - And one second later, he drowned.

121
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,200
 (laughing)

122
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,960
 - Well, he failed, he absolutely failed.

123
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,120
 He failed despite the fact he was sponsored

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,240
 by an American sauerkraut company called Stuffler.

125
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,040
 - What, despite that?

126
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,080
 - Well, he was dragging 22 pounds of sauerkraut with him

127
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,680
 as he tried to cross the Pacific.

128
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,520
 - You need something to go with that plankton on the side.

129
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,240
 - You've got to keep the microbiome healthy

130
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,720
 when you're out at sea.

131
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,320
 - In normal life, he is a one-man band.

132
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,960
 He, you know the guys with the--

133
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

134
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,400
 - I was literally one-man band.

135
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,000
 - Yeah, he's actually, in French, an homme orchestre.

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,840
 - Right.

137
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,680
 - That's the French for a one-man band.

138
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,960
 - As in he has lots of instruments,

139
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,400
 I mean, you've mined it there, but just to be clear,

140
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,880
 he has lots of instruments rigged up on his body, does he?

141
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,160
 - We all know the one-man band.

142
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,080
 - We're just saying that mimes don't work with a podcast.

143
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,720
 - True, 'cause he's French,

144
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,160
 I think I was thinking the mime would work, yeah.

145
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,880
 - Why is he not combined the two?

146
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,920
 Why is he not bringing the band with him on the water?

147
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,480
 - I think if he can't bring a simple thing

148
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,600
 like 22 pounds of sauerkraut as he walks across an ocean.

149
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
 - The full drum kit is probably crazy to admit.

150
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,720
 - I guess there's some similar skills, isn't there?

151
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,920
 Like it's lots of moving around, moving your legs and stuff.

152
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,280
 He didn't make it like you say,

153
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,960
 but it was because on the first day,

154
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,120
 Storm wrecked the catamaran that he towed behind him.

155
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
 So all of his food and all of his bed

156
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,000
 and all of his supplies just went down on the first day.

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,680
 - He was towing a whole catamaran.

158
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,080
 - The interesting thing about, well, it wasn't catamaran

159
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,160
 in the case that it had two bows, right?

160
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,560
 But the interesting thing about that

161
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,440
 is when Old Reeve was gonna walk over the Atlantic,

162
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,040
 he decided, like I said, he was gonna ski down these swells,

163
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,880
 but he reckoned that when it was really calm weather,

164
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,320
 he would tow a boat with him.

165
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,720
 So there would be, there was a boat nearby

166
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,000
 that would kind of follow him with supplies.

167
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,200
 And he thought that what I would do is when it's calm,

168
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,520
 I'll just tow the boat, it doesn't need sales.

169
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,480
 - That's brilliant.

170
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,200
 - In 1898, he walked from New York harbour

171
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,360
 to Governor's Island, which is where the army base was.

172
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,000
 And the New York Journal reported that when he arrived

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,320
 at the army base, the commandant felt the wonderful fine muscles

174
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,000
 of the man who had made so wonderful a trip.

175
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,440
 - Ooh!

176
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,440
 - That... - Wow.

177
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,080
 - That... - (LAUGHS)

178
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,480
 - Glass goes out for it, but... - (LAUGHTER)

179
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,880
 - That feels a bit like an excuse, doesn't it?

180
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,440
 Or you've made such a wonderful trip,

181
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,280
 your thigh muscles must be wonderful as well,

182
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,000
 and so that feels a bit of a pretext.

183
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,560
 - I wonder, because it's a military base, right?

184
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,640
 Do they think he was the sort of advance arm of an attack, I wonder?

185
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,280
 - Well, that was the thing, though, wasn't it?

186
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,440
 People were doing this already.

187
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,040
 They were trying to make boat shoes and go out and walk waters,

188
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,920
 and someone had an idea that what if we created an army battalion

189
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,560
 that could walk across water?

190
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,160
 - That we would lose every one.

191
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,120
 - (LAUGHTER)

192
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,680
 - And that's why it didn't happen.

193
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,160
 - But it was... Yeah, this guy, Robert Kjellberg,

194
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,240
 he trained some soldiers to wear a heavy backpack

195
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,280
 and fire a rifle while walking on water.

196
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,360
 And he toured the whole of England.

197
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,240
 He was known as the Water King, and this was a huge, huge thing.

198
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,200
 - It's not huge, it wasn't a huge thing.

199
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,800
 - And also, he was known as the Water King.

200
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,440
 He wasn't the Water King!

201
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,360
 (LAUGHTER)

202
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,640
 - Oh, look, it's the Water King!

203
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,960
 - It would definitely have the element of surprise, I think.

204
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,160
 - Exactly! The Water King!

205
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,880
 (LAUGHTER)

206
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,800
 - Yeah, especially presented like that.

207
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,920
 - Yeah.

208
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,200
 - There's another thing where you have these kind of round shoes

209
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,840
 that ninjas are supposed to have used to walk on water with.

210
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,120
 So they're probably about the size of a dustbin lid.

211
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,400
 And you strap your feet to them.

212
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,920
 And the idea was that ninjas could get across moats and things like that.

213
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,800
 And I've been to ninja school, and that's what they say.

214
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,960
 - "Beep, beep, beep, look back up!"

215
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,320
 - Yeah, okay.

216
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,400
 - You've been to ninja school?

217
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,800
 - I've been to ninja school, and that's what they say anyway.

218
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,680
 So the interesting thing... - No, no, no, no, no, no, obviously...

219
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,240
 - When did you go to ninja school?

220
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,920
 - What qualification? - Well, I was in Kyoto.

221
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,680
 - Okay, that checks out so far.

222
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,520
 - So, what qualifications did you do ninja GCSEs?

223
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
 (LAUGHTER)

224
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,880
 - I did, but I'm not allowed to show you the certificate.

225
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,840
 - Wait, that's Spice! That's different!

226
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,840
 - No, I am... Well, look, I did do that thing, so...

227
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,560
 I think how about I mentioned before that they taught me how to throw ninja stars.

228
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,400
 - Oh, yeah. - And they taught me how to throw chopsticks so I could kill a man.

229
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,560
 - Really?

230
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,760
 (LAUGHTER)

231
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,040
 - Wow.

232
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,480
 - Right. - Have you proofed it?

233
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,800
 - Let's do it. - Are you volunteering?

234
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,600
 - Who's got chopsticks? Come on.

235
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,160
 Dan, you stand over there.

236
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,560
 - I'll see you in Wagga Mamas after the show.

237
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,560
 Anyway, the point that I was trying to make is that they told me this in ninja school,

238
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,760
 but there's some new research.

239
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,760
 (LAUGHTER)

240
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,160
 - Some old ninja documents. - Hey, Huckin, you're late.

241
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,240
 I'm not late. I've been here for 45 minutes.

242
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,000
 - The other thing they teach you how to do is to walk backwards

243
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,880
 while there are drawing pins on the floor.

244
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,560
 - OK. - What?

245
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,600
 The walking backwards thing, do you just keep your feet,

246
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,200
 your soles of the feet on the ground so you push the drawing pins out of the way?

247
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,360
 Like a moonwalk, basically.

248
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,000
 - It's not like a moonwalk. You kind of walk backwards,

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,680
 but you sweep your back foot, and they also teach how to walk very slowly,

250
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,160
 so no one can hear you walking.

251
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,080
 - It was like curling backwards with your feet. - Exactly.

252
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,880
 - Nice. - I feel like we've gone off the point of this.

253
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,640
 - I'm loving this. I'm loving it. - I'm loving it.

254
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,080
 - The amount of shit I got when I said I'd been to clown school for a short course.

255
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,480
 (LAUGHTER)

256
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,360
 This is all my Christmas is at once, you know?

257
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,440
 - Anyway, so they said this at ninja school,

258
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,400
 and there's been some new research,

259
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,320
 and they found old ninja documents about these things called Mizugumo,

260
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,360
 and they found the word "sit" next to them,

261
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,320
 and what they reckon is they weren't actually used by ninjas to walk on water.

262
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,280
 They were actually like little boats you would sit on and paddle along.

263
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,720
 - Ah! - Obviously!

264
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,240
 Why didn't they draw that conclusion

265
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,840
 when they first saw these round things that go on water?

266
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,400
 Why did they assume there were shoes before they assumed they were boats?

267
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,920
 - Cos the ninjas spread the myth that they can walk on water, you know?

268
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,120
 - Oh, it's a clever bit of PR. - It's PR, yeah.

269
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,760
 - They're good on PR. - Very good on PR.

270
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,280
 - Just on the elephant in the room, Jesus of Nazareth. - Yeah.

271
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,160
 - We... - Has he caught that very often? - Yeah, please.

272
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,840
 We've all been dancing around it.

273
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,160
 Obviously, the Jesus Walking on Water thing on the Sea of Galilee.

274
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,200
 In 2006, there was a suggestion,

275
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,120
 and it was published in a proper academic journal

276
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,600
 called The Journal of Paleo-Lymnology,

277
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,200
 the study of ancient lakes, obviously,

278
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,880
 which suggested that there was ice in the Sea of Galilee.

279
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,840
 It's more of a lake than a sea, I think.

280
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,680
 And so, it has this rare property due to the salty and fresh water that feeds it.

281
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,480
 And it has this rare property where you could have these bits of ice forming.

282
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,920
 You know, like, part of it freezes over and part of it doesn't.

283
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,480
 - Really? I mean, it's in the Middle East, isn't it?

284
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,640
 Yeah, but it gets cold sometimes, you know?

285
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,440
 And the suggestion is that spring's ice could have formed and made it look like Jesus was walking on water.

286
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,280
 So, do you think they said to Jesus, "Can you do that trick again?

287
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,000
 "Walk on water?" He's like, "Oh, give me a few months."

288
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,240
 - Yeah, it's more of a Christmas miracle than anything. - Mists.

289
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,680
 - Sorry, me-mists. Oh, whatever, mind. - Mists.

290
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,440
 - But I saw... Genuinely, on the way here today,

291
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,440
 I saw a duck basically doing this in a pond.

292
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,080
 It looked like it was walking on water,

293
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,040
 but actually it was just standing on a stone that was near the surface of the water.

294
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,320
 But it does make you think, doesn't it?

295
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,360
 - Well, on that note... - I guess it does.

296
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,840
 - We should move on to our next fact. - Fact.

297
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,960
 - Thank you, Andy. - Thank you.

298
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:56,920
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

299
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:04,440
 My fact this week is that zebra spiders chase laser pointers exactly like a cat does.

300
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,600
 So, this is a very exciting fact.

301
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,280
 This is a discovery that basically zebra spiders, which are jumping spiders,

302
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,960
 are really similar to cats in quite a lot of ways.

303
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,240
 Come on, mate. It's a disappointed kid you've got.

304
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,320
 If they've asked for a pet cat, you come home with a microscopic spider

305
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,240
 and say, "They're really similar. I had it on a podcast."

306
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,560
 I didn't know what these spiders were until you said zebra spiders.

307
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,880
 And then I looked them up, and basically, you know the tiny ones

308
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,960
 that sort of jerk in their movements.

309
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,160
 - They hear, then they jerk, then they jerk again. - Yeah.

310
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,640
 And they're very... Well, they pounce, right? That's their big thing.

311
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,520
 And this was noticed by a scientist.

312
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,880
 She was in her lab, and she had these spiders that were falling off her roof,

313
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,920
 and then someone said, "Hey, have you seen that if you use a laser pointer,

314
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,520
 "that you can actually get them to chase it?"

315
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,800
 And she tested it out with another colleague, and that's what happened.

316
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,080
 And they thought this is absolutely amazing.

317
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,120
 And basically, what they think is like a cat,

318
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,920
 that this is something that I need to attack, kill, and eat.

319
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,200
 And so, when they see the green laser pointer, that's what they do.

320
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,000
 - But they can't because it's a laser. - Laser.

321
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,520
 - But it's very exciting. - It's really cool, isn't it?

322
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,840
 This is, by the way, this from Ed Young article,

323
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,280
 who we had on the podcast not too long ago.

324
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,600
 He said that we do raid his articles, and once again, we have plagiarised his work.

325
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,440
 So, thank you, Ed.

326
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,440
 Sorry, Ed, the fact ninjas have been in.

327
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,360
 You'll never notice.

328
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,120
 The thing I thought was that these astronomers' lab needs a clean.

329
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,440
 Really? Who's got spiders falling off the ceilings of their lab?

330
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,200
 And also, you're supposed to be astronomers, you're not naturalists.

331
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,080
 What if they... Did they miss an eclipse?

332
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,040
 You know, they're just coaxing spiders around.

333
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:44,200
 - I think part of it was also to work out what jumping spiders can see with their eyes. - Yeah.

334
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,640
 Because their eyes are a bit like telescopes in that they're kind of a tube,

335
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,600
 and there's a lens at both ends.

336
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,360
 And you can work out what a telescope can see

337
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,240
 by working out the different lenses and the different distances and stuff like that.

338
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,000
 And they worked out that most jumping spiders would be able to see the moon.

339
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,320
 - Yeah, which is amazing. - Yeah, that's really cool.

340
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,360
 Because they're small, so it doesn't sound amazing.

341
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,880
 I wasn't amazed. If it makes you feel better, anyone who doesn't think it's amazing,

342
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,680
 I wasn't amazed at first, because I thought, "Well, I can see the moon."

343
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,960
 But it's much harder to see the moon if you don't look at me.

344
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,440
 How many legs have you got?

345
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,280
 They're 5 to 9 millimetres. You're exactly... That's tiny to see the moon.

346
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,920
 But I just don't think of what can see the moon.

347
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,320
 And now here we are thinking about it.

348
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,760
 I mean, moths can see the moon, can't they?

349
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,560
 Well, ah, but can they?

350
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,520
 Yeah, they can, cos then they think lights are the moon, and they're pretty small.

351
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,560
 Come on, I think the spider spider's bragging about this moon seeing is...

352
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,480
 But that means they presumably can see your face.

353
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,680
 Cos your face is a bit distant, it's a bit bigger.

354
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,640
 In fact, it's way bigger than the moon, normally.

355
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,480
 - And they think your face is weird. - And they think your face is weird.

356
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,400
 If you want to move around like a ninja, do it when there's no moon.

357
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,480
 - Oh! - God!

358
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,320
 But it's weird to think of a spider that can see your face.

359
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,280
 - Why is that weird? - I don't know.

360
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,960
 Cos I don't think of a spider as having a face.

361
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,080
 Spiders absolutely have faces, right? They have eyes.

362
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,720
 - What are you talking about? - They've got eyes.

363
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,800
 But they don't have a face, a proper face.

364
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,000
 So you think if you don't have a proper face, you shouldn't be allowed to see other faces?

365
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 No, I'm not saying that. I'm not thinking at all.

366
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,760
 I'm just saying it's a surprise to think that they could look up and think,

367
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,040
 "Oh, there's Dan." That's a weird thing.

368
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,680
 Can I just jump in here for a second?

369
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
 - Can I ask? - Oh, we didn't see you, though!

370
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:38,200
 Dan, I told you to put more drawing pins down before the show started.

371
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,760
 I want to know if you're surprised/interested in this.

372
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,360
 And that is that there is a spider called the Ogre-Faced Spider.

373
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,440
 And by looking at their eyes, we can work out that they can make out

374
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,600
 the Andromeda galaxy in the sky.

375
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,760
 - What?! - That's cool.

376
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,440
 - Can we see that? - Yeah, well...

377
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,280
 You can just about on a really dark day in the middle of nowhere, yeah.

378
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,400
 Do they know what it is? Do they say, "See Andromeda again?"

379
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,120
 No, they aren't cool.

380
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,920
 One thing that zebra spiders do specifically, apparently,

381
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,560
 is they do respond to humans,

382
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,320
 which I do think is something that we don't think of non-mammals as doing.

383
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,640
 Like, you see a cat, it sees you, it responds to you.

384
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,640
 And if a human walks into the room while they're going about their business,

385
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
 they'll sort of turn around and look up at you.

386
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,920
 And they do have... Andi says they can see our faces,

387
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
 but we can see theirs as well, obviously.

388
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,360
 And they do have such good faces, Jumping Spiders,

389
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,200
 because they've got those two giant...

390
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,200
 They just look like something out of sci-fi.

391
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
 There's two giant eyes in the middle,

392
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
 and then two slightly smaller eyes either side.

393
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,040
 - Look 'em up. They're great stuff. - They are very cool.

394
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,480
 Excitingly, Jumping Spiders, these specific zebra Jumping Spiders,

395
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,160
 have been to space.

396
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,840
 This is cool, so they've got closer to the moon

397
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
 or other things they can see, which is great.

398
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,320
 - Oh, must have been massive up there. - Must have been amazing.

399
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
 Yeah, yeah, it must be really cool.

400
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
 So there was this theory that...

401
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,880
 Because they jump and they pounce onto their prey,

402
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,880
 they obviously take gravity into account when they're jumping.

403
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,080
 So they jump, they know they're going to fall at a certain rate,

404
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,480
 they know they're going to hit the prey.

405
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,280
 And there was a theory, a question.

406
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,560
 If we take them to a tiny microgravity environment

407
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,400
 and they jump, they're not going to jump the same way,

408
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,040
 will they keep on missing their prey,

409
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,920
 or will they be able to learn about space, basically,

410
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,400
 learn about microgravity?

411
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,000
 And this was an 18-year-old guy from Egypt called Amon Mohammed,

412
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,960
 and he won a competition to do this experiment on the ISS.

413
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,120
 Not to go himself, but just to, like, have the experiment done.

414
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,640
 And the thesis was they won't be able to learn, and they did learn.

415
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,160
 - Yeah. - They learned how to adapt to zero gravity,

416
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,840
 - which is very exciting. - And what they did was,

417
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,400
 instead of jumping on their prey, they kind of just sidled up to it.

418
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
 - Yeah, yeah. - Didn't they?

419
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,280
 - And just went, "Hey..." - Yeah, there was one thought that they would...

420
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,920
 What they do do on Earth is that if they're jumping down from above on a prey,

421
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,840
 they need to make sure that they're going to land on the target.

422
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,800
 So they tether themselves with one of their silk webs.

423
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,640
 But it's a bit like Mission Impossible.

424
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,000
 - Tom Cruise going down. - Which one?

425
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,680
 - Mission Impossible 1. - Yep.

426
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,560
 So they're sort of jumping down bungee-style,

427
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,880
 but if they need to pull the cord to stop,

428
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,640
 they can do that and bring themselves back up

429
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,160
 if they can see they're missing the prey.

430
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,440
 So one of the thoughts in space was they might be using their line

431
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,240
 to sort of tether themselves, bring themselves back down,

432
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,840
 and help them along, but no, instead, they just walked up and ate.

433
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,880
 It says to me the fruit flies that they deployed

434
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,480
 were not that energetic, to be honest.

435
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,400
 If you can just stroll up to your fly.

436
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,040
 Or it says that the pounce is just absolutely unnecessary on Earth as well.

437
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,720
 - Exactly. - Just walk, mate.

438
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,800
 Walk up to it.

439
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,840
 It was this... Again, I think I've said this before,

440
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,040
 but I do find it funny the stuff they make these astronauts do in space.

441
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,720
 And this one fell to Sunita Williams.

442
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,680
 And I guess they dished them out at the start of an expedition.

443
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,720
 They're like, "Do you want to do this random 16-year-old's idea?"

444
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,560
 She was the one who activated the flies every day,

445
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,600
 and she sort of would release a plunger,

446
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,840
 which released all these flies into the den,

447
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,800
 and then the spiders would go for it.

448
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,560
 And it was one zebra spider and one red-backed jumping spider.

449
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,040
 And they were called Cleopatra and Nefertiti,

450
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,360
 and they did jolly well, but then, of course,

451
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,040
 they did plummet towards Earth at breakneck speeds

452
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,880
 at the end of the mission, and immediately the zebra spider died on impact.

453
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,040
 - No, they were inside a capsule just to add quickly. - No, they weren't inside a capsule just to add quickly.

454
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,320
 - It sounds like they just dug them out, like, from Argonne. - Yeah, they did.

455
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,240
 No, no, they gave them a little spaceship.

456
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,840
 What, like, the force of the re-entry killed them?

457
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,400
 It's not actually true. It's not both of them.

458
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,520
 It was just the zebra spider, actually, Cleopatra.

459
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,640
 And they're not clear on why she died, but it's something about the impact.

460
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,640
 But Nefertiti did survive and went to the Smithsonian

461
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,760
 to live out her remaining sort of two months before she did.

462
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,760
 - Copped it as well. - I think she lived in an actual, like,

463
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,720
 - display in a museum that you could visit, right? - Yeah, she did.

464
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,480
 - So people visited Nefertiti. - But the other interesting thing,

465
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,280
 I think, that they found is that she learned how to do it the old way afterwards.

466
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,880
 - Oh, my God, that's so clever. - Which I think that's really interesting.

467
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,880
 - Yeah. - Yeah, that's so cool.

468
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,520
 This is slightly off-topic, but I found out about a spider hunting thing.

469
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,520
 - OK. - And it's a moth specifically called the metal-mark moth,

470
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,720
 which pretends to be a spider, right?

471
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,600
 So its wings have these marks on which look like big spider eyes,

472
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,680
 and other parts of its wings look like the furry legs of a spider.

473
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,800
 It looks like a huge spider, actually, to other spiders,

474
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,280
 and it moves a bit like one.

475
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,320
 And it's so good that actual jumping spiders will flirt with it

476
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,160
 - rather than try to kill it. - Oh, yeah. - Really? - Yeah.

477
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,840
 I think it was said before that they're kind of not that picky jumping spiders, are they?

478
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,760
 Then we said that they sometimes just dance with other spiders

479
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,120
 that are not jumping spiders, and most of the time get eaten.

480
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,040
 - Oh, yeah. - But that's the theory of the dance.

481
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,600
 So they do this like courtship dance before the mating.

482
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,400
 And the idea is, the reason they do that is so that there is certain distance away

483
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,080
 from the female that if they decide it's not worth it,

484
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,800
 then they have a chance to run away.

485
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,600
 And apparently, there are certain moves that they have to do,

486
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,520
 and if they do a perfect dance, then they're guaranteed to have sex.

487
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,080
 So it's like, you know, in Strictly, where if everyone gets tense...

488
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,160
 Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

489
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,080
 It works, the same in Strictly, doesn't it?

490
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,640
 - I believe so, yeah. - Wow.

491
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,520
 But is there a thing where, if you don't do it perfectly,

492
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,240
 you will be killed and eaten?

493
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,640
 - You must. - Which also, weirdly, happens on Strictly.

494
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,880
 Time to move on to our next fact.

495
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,000
 It's time for fact number three, and that is James.

496
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,920
 OK, my fact this week is that according to a law of 1656,

497
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,880
 chicken owners on the Scottish borders had to give their chickens clogs.

498
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,880
 - OK. - Right.

499
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:41,520
 So, this is a thing that happened, not just down the road from here.

500
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,920
 It's from the Records of Pebbles.

501
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:50,360
 And this was about complaints of scraping of fowls in houses and yards,

502
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,600
 as in they'd been pooing over their neighbour's yards.

503
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,000
 And they said that everyone who owned a hen or a capon, so any kind of chicken,

504
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,160
 would have to tie such a weight of timber to the foot

505
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,360
 that would stop them from flying.

506
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,440
 And then it specifically says that they are clogs,

507
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,440
 and it says that forchilling would be paid to the owner of any fowl

508
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,840
 going without the clog, sorry, they would have to pay forchilling.

509
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,880
 The thing was, if you were to come across any chicken without clogs in that area,

510
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,080
 then you were allowed to dispose of that chicken.

511
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,160
 - But most people have... - That's sinister.

512
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,880
 - I guess by eating it. - Yeah, sounds like it, yeah, yeah.

513
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,960
 Most people have a lot of chickens, which means...

514
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,880
 Have a lot of chickens, you mean? Have a lot of chickens? Sorry.

515
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,200
 - Let's do a poll of the room. - Yeah.

516
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,680
 - Do most people in the room have a lot of chickens? - OK.

517
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,760
 - One, thank you. - One, thank you.

518
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,840
 So, what I meant to say was, you know that guy in the crowd

519
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,800
 who came to our show tonight, who has lots of chickens?

520
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,360
 Out of curiosity, how many have you got?

521
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,440
 - Loads. - Thank you.

522
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,360
 - Loads. - So, my point says...

523
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,920
 - Who invited the colonel? - Yeah.

524
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,000
 So, you know how that guy has loads of chickens?

525
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 - Yes. - I'm actually starting to doubt his account,

526
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,040
 if Harry's got loads of chickens now.

527
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,480
 I'm just questioning how many clogs you need to buy,

528
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,280
 the price point of the clogs...

529
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,240
 I don't think these are beautiful, carved, painted clogs

530
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,880
 made by Dutch artisans.

531
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,640
 I think it's more like a lump of wood tied to your chicken's foot.

532
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,120
 I'm afraid so, but they called them clogs in the law.

533
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,080
 So, they didn't even carve an inside to put there?

534
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,440
 We don't own any of these in any museum.

535
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,920
 Surely they would have had some insoles, at least,

536
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,520
 so they'd be comfortable as they walked around.

537
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,520
 Apology for me hearing a fact that said they wear clogs

538
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,840
 and assuming that maybe they wore a fucking clog.

539
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,400
 Clogs are like... Clogs can be anything, you know.

540
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,800
 No, they can't. If I got you some clogs to wear,

541
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,400
 I'm not going to hand you a block of wood.

542
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,800
 I'm going to give you a shoe.

543
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,520
 - Just on clogs. - Oh, yeah.

544
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,280
 So, you guys are familiar with clog fighting?

545
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,680
 - Oh, yeah. - This is the thing.

546
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,160
 Is that just a stick fight?

547
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,720
 So, this is...

548
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,240
 Fair enough. That's fair.

549
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,000
 - This is human clog fighting. - Uh-huh.

550
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,160
 And this was, I think, a Lancashire sport/way of fighting someone else,

551
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,000
 - where you... - We call that spot in Lancashire.

552
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,360
 It was known as fighting Wigan fashion, which is great.

553
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,680
 You would just kick each other.

554
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,800
 You and one other person would just repeatedly kick each other

555
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,600
 while wearing heavy wooden clogs.

556
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
 And you would either... This is the great thing.

557
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,400
 You would either be wearing your finest clothing

558
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,360
 - or be completely naked. - LAUGHTER

559
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,480
 You would hope that you would, like, work that out before the day.

560
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,720
 - Oh, God, so bouncy. - 'Cause if you're awful,

561
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,000
 if they turned up in their finest clothing, then you'd...

562
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,840
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

563
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,520
 - It sounds so rough. - So, what you would do is...

564
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,880
 You would hold onto each other's shoulders,

565
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,840
 and then you were wearing very heavy clogs,

566
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,760
 and they would kind of, you know, say that you should sharpen them, really.

567
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,920
 And you would just keep kicking until one of you shouted, "Sufficient!"

568
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,360
 - LAUGHTER - This is shin-kicking, right?

569
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,080
 This is Lancastrian Purin.

570
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,960
 It was known as Purin, or, like you say, Wigan fashion fighting.

571
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,800
 And they thought that it was, like, really turn of the 20th century,

572
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
 that it happened, and then it died out.

573
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,280
 But a friend of mine called Anna F.C. Smith, who's an artist in Lancashire,

574
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,320
 she managed to find evidence of it up until the '50s.

575
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,080
 - So, people are still doing it in the '50s. - '50s? Wow.

576
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,880
 - Oh, that's incredible. - Were there rules on the, like, the size...

577
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,600
 Like, could Charles Aldreave have come with his big dog shoes?

578
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,880
 - LAUGHTER - That's a really good point.

579
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,600
 They would be your actual clogs,

580
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,040
 because people in Lancashire wore clogs in those days,

581
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,920
 and so you would wear your normal clogs, but you might sharpen them.

582
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,440
 You might put bits of metal on them,

583
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,720
 because sometimes the rules were the first to draw blood

584
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,480
 would be the one who got the... - Right. - ..who got the win.

585
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,440
 There was a thing... I read a story from 1838,

586
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,200
 where there was such a brutal, clogged fight

587
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,440
 that one of the guys fighting went deaf in one ear

588
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,000
 from being kicked in the leg... - Wow. - That's amazing.

589
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,240
 That's not... There's no connection between those two.

590
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,320
 - No. It's sort of like a weird kind of reflexology. - Yeah.

591
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,880
 Your shin is connected to your ear.

592
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,920
 And there was another thing where you would be holding...

593
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,560
 This is another method of clog fighting.

594
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,240
 Both of you hold a handkerchief between your teeth,

595
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,000
 and the one who drops it first loses.

596
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,520
 Like a tug of war with the handkerchief.

597
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,920
 - Yeah, but no, no, no, no. - Is it the same handkerchief?

598
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,000
 You're holding the same handkerchief between your two teeth,

599
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,760
 and the one who drops it from there and loses.

600
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,600
 - But I think that is... - Because you might go, "Ah!"

601
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,920
 - And then it falls out. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

602
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,880
 But I think there's a way of winning the fight.

603
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,920
 Never mind your legs, you just start eating the handkerchief, right?

604
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,080
 - I'm not like Lady and the Tramp. - Like Lady and the Tramp.

605
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,920
 - Right. - And then...

606
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,520
 If you've got the handkerchief in your mouth, he's lost the fight.

607
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,840
 - Yeah. - It depends how deep you want your opponent

608
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,360
 to get inside your own mouth.

609
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,040
 You might prefer to just be kicked in the shin.

610
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,880
 - You're both naked. - You're already on pretty intimate terms.

611
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,560
 They weren't, the Lancashians were very into clogs, weren't they?

612
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,800
 - Yeah. - And they're clogged dancing.

613
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,760
 They were very into that when they weren't fighting with them.

614
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,120
 They were dancing with them.

615
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,640
 And it seemed very specific from about 1880 to 1904 or '05.

616
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,200
 And people speculate that the reason they got into clogged dancing

617
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,040
 was partly to warm up in the cold, industrial, northern towns.

618
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,200
 Which, I don't know, it's not that much colder.

619
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,520
 But, yeah, it was as popular as wrestling, boxing, clogged dancing.

620
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,480
 - It was. - The three big draws.

621
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,160
 There was a group called the J.W. Jackson's Clog Dancers.

622
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,840
 And they're a group of young boys.

623
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,440
 And they would wear football jerseys.

624
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,600
 And they had clogs with buckles on and bits of metal.

625
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,640
 So that sometimes when you did your dance, they would do sparks.

626
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,000
 And they actually tore the whole of the UK.

627
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,440
 They were absolutely massive.

628
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,680
 And one of the original guys dropped out in 1896.

629
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,880
 And he was replaced by an eight-year-old called Charlie Chaplin.

630
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,760
 - Oh. - Oh.

631
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,000
 - The same. - The same?

632
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,440
 - No, completely the same. - Wow.

633
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,280
 - Very cool. - So was that his first job, basically?

634
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,560
 - Eight years old, he'd been working for like eight years at that point.

635
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:04,000
 The clog itself, the full wooden one, the clump, the clumpen.

636
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,880
 - Clumpen, yeah. - It's really interesting reading about them

637
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,320
 because they're actually really safe shoes for you to wear.

638
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,800
 If you're doing hard labour, if you're building on a building side,

639
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,840
 you're down in a coal mine or whatever, they're incredibly sturdy.

640
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,000
 But also, they're much better than, say, like a modern boot

641
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,720
 with a steel cap inside.

642
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,760
 Because if something drops on them,

643
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,440
 the metal of a boot can bend inward and crush your foot

644
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,480
 and you get stuck in there.

645
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,120
 Whereas with this, it just kind of splits the shoe open.

646
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,640
 So at least you're not sort of mangled within the shoe.

647
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,920
 - Yeah. - I feel like the makers of steel-capped shoes

648
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,320
 might object to the, like, they're much safer.

649
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,840
 But this basically came out because the EU said in the '90s,

650
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,960
 clogs aren't safe.

651
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,200
 And a lot of people in the Netherlands still then traditionally,

652
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,360
 and still sometimes now traditionally, wore clogs.

653
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,320
 So farmers, fishermen, factory workers, you know,

654
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,760
 there are lots of jobs where clogs would be the workman's boot of choice.

655
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,520
 And the EU said these haven't been tested properly.

656
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,560
 And so I'm afraid you're going to have to ditch the clogs

657
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,280
 and wear steel-capped shoes.

658
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,480
 And so the Netherlands organisation for Applied Scientific Research

659
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,840
 ran a whole bunch of tests to prove that they were as safe.

660
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,800
 So they got all these clogs in to the factory

661
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,240
 and they bashed them with a mechanical hammer.

662
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,640
 They compared, they put one tonne weights on them

663
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,080
 to see how they survived so that it was like being run over by a car.

664
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,480
 They pierced the soles with nails, they submerged them in water,

665
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,960
 they baked them in ovens at 300 degrees.

666
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,680
 - What? - Wow.

667
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,280
 I don't know in what circumstances, you're suddenly in a furnace.

668
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,520
 Like, if you're there, only your feet.

669
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,760
 We've got great news, the clogs have survived.

670
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,480
 We managed to save his feet.

671
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,440
 Here's the facts about Dutch wooden shoes.

672
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,160
 Apparently, there was a traditional Dutch marriage proposal

673
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,880
 where if you fancied someone, you would buy a pair of very ornate clogs

674
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:56,200
 and then you would secretly, at night, put them on the doorstep

675
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,400
 of the person you wanted to marry.

676
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,040
 Well, that'd be very hard to do, James.

677
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,240
 I mean, you'd need someone with special training at...

678
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,080
 LAUGHTER

679
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,960
 ..sneaking around in the dark.

680
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,360
 Am I just trying to speak around in clogs?

681
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,600
 Clog, Ninjas.

682
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,400
 I don't think you have to wear the clogs to eat before you deposit

683
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,360
 because that's why the Dutch have no ninja skills whatsoever.

684
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,840
 Well, the idea was then you would return the next morning

685
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,440
 and if your beloved was wearing the clogs,

686
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,640
 that meant she had accepted the proposal.

687
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,480
 Oh, my God!

688
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,560
 And then she would wear them till her wedding day.

689
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,560
 OK, question.

690
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,240
 Does she... Have you left a note to say these are from me?

691
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,800
 It's really interesting.

692
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,640
 Does she put them on and think, "Yes, James has proposed!"

693
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,640
 And then... I fear that might have been it

694
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,360
 because as far as I can tell, there's no notes from the source

695
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,360
 that I read.

696
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,240
 I assume you've let her know that that's going to happen

697
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,080
 or something because otherwise it's a bit of a shot in the dark,

698
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
 isn't it?

699
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,240
 Or maybe everyone had those doorbell cans back in medieval...

700
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
 ..medalines.

701
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,720
 LAUGHTER

702
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,200
 We're going to have to move on very soon.

703
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
 Oh, righty.

704
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,200
 Yeah.

705
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,360
 I noticed very recently, there's a new trend for...

706
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,880
 We're talking about animals wearing shoes.

707
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,640
 There's a new trend for dogs wearing shoes.

708
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,920
 I found the company...

709
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
 Well, to begin with, I got quite excited

710
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,960
 because Dolly Parton has started a new company for animals.

711
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,760
 It's like a parol for animals called Doggy Parton.

712
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,880
 And it's specifically for her dogs.

713
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,960
 So you can get cowgirl hats for your dog.

714
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,400
 You can get Dolly Parton-esque wigs for your dog.

715
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,120
 There's pink high heels, but it turns out it's a stuffed toy,

716
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,760
 so that doesn't count.

717
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,000
 The dog's not in...

718
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 But then there's another company that's just started.

719
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,560
 I think it was last year called Riff Ruff,

720
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,520
 who has designed all these dog shoes for...

721
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,560
 And I think it was a pug in the website that I saw,

722
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,600
 and they kind of look like they're wearing, like, Nike shoes

723
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,640
 and Adidas, and they've made a hoodie as well,

724
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,440
 and it seems to be coming back in.

725
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
 To what extent...

726
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,480
 I haven't seen, so far, dogs strutting the streets of Glasgow,

727
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,720
 certainly, with their stilettos on.

728
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,000
 No, but if you use the offercode "FISH",

729
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,720
 you can get 20% off your first dog shoe on Riff Ruff.

730
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,520
 # #

731
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,280
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

732
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,240
 and that is Anna.

733
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,480
 My fact this week is that Einstein was so famous

734
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,240
 that women reportedly fainted in his presence,

735
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,880
 and a mob once broke down the door of a lecture hall

736
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,080
 screening one of his films.

737
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,440
 Yeah, he made films.

738
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,120
 He was a big director, he was like Spielberg of his day.

739
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,120
 He's not thinking of Robert Pattinson.

740
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,520
 That's who I'm thinking of.

741
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,480
 He was the Robert Pattinson of his day.

742
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,680
 I had no idea that he was such a heartthrob

743
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,280
 and just such a big celeb.

744
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,600
 So this particular lecture screening incident

745
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,640
 was quite a big deal.

746
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,520
 I think it was called, like, the New York Einstein riots

747
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,200
 or something, but it was 1930,

748
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,840
 and the New York Amateur Astronomers Association

749
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,240
 was doing a showing...

750
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,600
 Einstein wasn't even coming.

751
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,440
 They were just doing a showing of a film

752
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,880
 explaining his theory of relativity.

753
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,120
 So, you know, stuff that Einstein's, you know, recently got into

754
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,080
 and everyone sort of started reading about,

755
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,320
 and they sent out 1,500 invitations to their members,

756
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,720
 and 4,500 people turned up, and they mobbed the place,

757
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,200
 and the guards couldn't keep control of them.

758
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,680
 They were sort of bashing into exhibits and stuff

759
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,320
 in the, you know, in the central hall.

760
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,680
 They had to call the police to try and calm them down,

761
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,840
 and they did break down the door to the lecture theatre

762
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,160
 in order to see the movie.

763
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,280
 - Right. - Wow.

764
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,520
 - What year was that, sorry? - 1930.

765
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,880
 - 1930. - 'Cause he became quite big

766
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,960
 just after the First World War, didn't he?

767
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,480
 - Yeah. - And that was one of the reasons.

768
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,920
 So he kind of made this prediction of where stars would be

769
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,920
 at a certain time due to his theory of relativity,

770
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,920
 and there had been an eclipse,

771
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,280
 and so because there was an eclipse there,

772
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,080
 they could measure these stars.

773
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,360
 And the interesting thing was that the people who did the

774
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,280
 measurement were British,

775
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,320
 and so it was kind of seeing this great moment,

776
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,720
 so the war's finished, but we have the British scientists

777
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,800
 and the German scientists coming together

778
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,960
 and proving this new theory, and that is what the result is.

779
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,000
 - Eddington. Was it Eddington? - Yeah, exactly.

780
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,360
 So that's kind of why he became so famous at the time.

781
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,400
 - Right. - Yeah.

782
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,760
 He actually said, 'cause he, as you say,

783
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,240
 it was the eclipse in, was it 1919?

784
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,320
 - Yeah. - Eclipse?

785
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,600
 Total eclipse, that sort of verified

786
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,880
 his theory of general relativity,

787
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,360
 which was basically explaining a way

788
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,760
 Newton's theory of gravity.

789
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,600
 So it was saying, actually, gravity is explained

790
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,480
 by kind of a bends in the, you know, in space-time.

791
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,600
 I think a really good analogy I read was,

792
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,760
 he explained that if you have a huge mass,

793
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,480
 then it bends space-time in the same way

794
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,760
 if you drop a heavy ball on a trampoline,

795
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,920
 then it creates a dent in the trampoline,

796
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,040
 and that pulls other objects on the trampoline

797
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,120
 a bit towards it, and in the same way it bends space-time.

798
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,960
 But so it took the eclipse to prove this to everyone else,

799
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,120
 but Einstein had his theory proved to himself in 1915,

800
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,120
 'cause he saw something in the orbit of Mercury

801
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,760
 that wasn't quite right, and the only way to explain it

802
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,560
 was that his theory of general relativity was correct,

803
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,560
 and he said when he found that anomaly

804
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,800
 in the orbit of Mercury, he was so excited

805
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,520
 that he had heart palpitations and couldn't work for three days.

806
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,160
 - Yeah, wow. - Yeah.

807
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,360
 The one in 1919 took a lot of people by surprise.

808
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,360
 They didn't realize it was gonna be so huge,

809
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,120
 and so the New York Times wanted to get someone

810
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,640
 to interview him or to, you know, go to his lectures,

811
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,280
 but they didn't have anyone there who really understood it,

812
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,080
 so they sent a guy called Henry Crouch,

813
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,960
 who was their golfing correspondent.

814
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,480
 - Wow. - And Henry Crouch wasn't just...

815
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,640
 Didn't just not know anything about physics.

816
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,400
 Because he didn't know anything about physics,

817
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,800
 they wouldn't let him into the press conference,

818
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,840
 but he still had to send something to the New York Times,

819
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,520
 and so he sent them an article that was headlined,

820
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,640
 "Stars, not where they seemed or calculated to be,

821
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,360
 "but nobody need worry."

822
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,960
 - OK. - That's so good.

823
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,360
 I read this theory that Einstein mania was actually a mistake.

824
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,640
 - OK. - So, he came to New York in 1921,

825
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,000
 and there was this huge crowd.

826
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,680
 It was so exciting, you know,

827
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,200
 there were thousands of people lining the streets waiting for him.

828
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,440
 There's a really good theory that actually they weren't there for him at all.

829
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,680
 - What? - I know.

830
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,960
 So, he visited. He was on someone else's trip.

831
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,480
 There was a politician called Chaim Weitzman.

832
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,520
 He was a politician, and he was a poster child

833
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,080
 for creating an Israel, basically.

834
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,640
 He was a Zionist politician,

835
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,200
 and Einstein was the most famous Jewish person in the world,

836
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,040
 and Einstein just sort of said, "OK, I'll come along to be there."

837
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,320
 So, when the ship docked, thousands of supporters came to cheer.

838
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,320
 They weren't cheering for Einstein, they were cheering for Weitzman,

839
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,120
 and all the Yiddish newspapers reported,

840
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,360
 "Oh, big crowd turned out for Weitzman, that's great."

841
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,080
 But all the English newspapers just thought,

842
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:54,280
 "Oh, Einstein, he's a crazy physicist, he plays the violin, he's so funny."

843
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,720
 And they were all here for Einstein, and then it turned into mega-Einstein mania.

844
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,760
 - What did the banners say? Come on, surely they were waving posters?

845
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,160
 - What are they screaming? - Yeah.

846
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,200
 - Because he was undeniably huge in America. - He was also famous, in fact.

847
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,400
 There was this rumour that women fainted in his presence.

848
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,200
 He was mobbed wherever he went, he'd land in airports,

849
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,040
 and the London Palladium, after he'd been to New York

850
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,520
 and they'd seen this huge reception,

851
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,520
 the London Palladium asked him to do a three-week-long one-man show,

852
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,840
 which he'd turned down the idiot.

853
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,520
 - Well, we did a one-day-long four-man show. - Yeah?

854
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,000
 Yeah, we're one-twenty-first of an Einstein between us.

855
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,720
 I think about him as well, is that he really intimidated people.

856
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,840
 You know, if you were in the presence of Einstein...

857
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,720
 - It's... - How?

858
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,360
 Well, it's kind of... Actually, I kind of remember the very first time

859
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,400
 when I started QI and met Stephen Fry.

860
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,120
 I genuinely felt intimidated that I was meeting someone of great intellect,

861
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,920
 that I just said stupid things the whole time.

862
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,880
 But he also intimidates people for fun, with a knuckle duster.

863
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,840
 Yeah, I mean, that was a bit weird, yeah.

864
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,880
 And his real accent as well, "All right, mate, how's it going?"

865
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,040
 I didn't... That was a shock, I gotta say.

866
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,840
 Um...

867
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,840
 Anyway, my legs are not broken anymore.

868
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,840
 Oh, man.

869
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,480
 But I remember seeing him going at you with those clogs.

870
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,920
 - It was something... - Oh, my God.

871
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,240
 That's going to suffice!

872
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,720
 (LAUGHTER)

873
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,320
 But so, there was a story, and this was published in The New York Times,

874
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,880
 that when he was ill in 1928, there was a New York physician

875
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,120
 who attended to him while he was in Germany.

876
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,440
 And the physician used to tell him anecdotes.

877
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,400
 Like, he had just anecdote after anecdote after anecdote.

878
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,280
 And everyone thought that he was doing this

879
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,640
 because he was just wanting to make Einstein cheerful.

880
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,960
 But he said, "Not at all."

881
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,360
 He memorized 150 anecdotes

882
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,640
 because he was so worried of Einstein asking him any questions

883
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,080
 and the ignorance of his answers coming out

884
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,000
 that he quickly diverted everything into,

885
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,400
 "Oh, did you hear the one about the time when the person did that?"

886
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,640
 And he had 150 of them at the ready...

887
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,240
 - That's amazing. - ...so that he would never run out.

888
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,920
 I want to see his one-man show, to be honest.

889
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,240
 - That would be good. - That's very...

890
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,320
 He was a real player.

891
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,560
 - Um... Or... - Yeah?

892
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,320
 Or tart, um, depending on which way you look at it.

893
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,400
 - Wow. - Um...

894
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,560
 From the age of about 15, he was kind of had various girlfriends,

895
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,760
 and he ended up age 17, um, in love with this...

896
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,000
 other fellow physicist, the only female physicist studying where he was studying,

897
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,240
 Milaver Marich.

898
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,960
 And they did love each other, I think, and he actually did get her pregnant.

899
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,800
 But we have no idea what happened to that child.

900
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,000
 Liesl, we have no idea because she...

901
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,160
 They couldn't marry because he didn't have a job yet.

902
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,320
 She went away, child disappeared.

903
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,520
 But anyway, he didn't stick with her for that long.

904
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,520
 He fell in love with someone else while he was married to Milaver.

905
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,440
 He fell in love with Elsa.

906
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,800
 But then I think, as he was in love with Elsa,

907
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,360
 he also fell in love with her daughter, Elsa.

908
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,120
 - Sorry? - Elsa and Elsa.

909
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,560
 - Wait, hang on. - Elsa and Elsa.

910
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,600
 - Elsa... - Yeah.

911
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,520
 - Elsa was his first cousin. - Yeah.

912
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,280
 But also, on the other side of her family, she was his second cousin.

913
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,200
 - Yeah. - Ah.

914
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,040
 Is it possible Elsa and Elsa were the same woman?

915
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,920
 - No, it was definitely Elsa's daughter. - OK, OK, OK.

916
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,920
 - Because they talked about it, because eventually... - This is why he was into relativity.

917
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,120
 - Oh, God! - LAUGHTER

918
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,520
 Good.

919
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,000
 - Very nice. - Um...

920
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,040
 No, definitely two different people, because he basically said to them,

921
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,960
 "I really want to marry you both."

922
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,320
 And, "Do you want to choose which one I marry?"

923
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,400
 And sort of proposed to the daughter, and the daughter eventually said,

924
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,320
 "I actually think of you as more like a father."

925
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,720
 Um, and so, John and Mary, my mum instead.

926
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,240
 - And so, he did. - What?

927
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,040
 And that was just the kind of free-love situation he ended up in.

928
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,960
 We mentioned ages ago on the podcast that his adopted granddaughter

929
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,880
 was someone who actually believed that she was the love child

930
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,280
 and was actually the daughter of Albert Einstein.

931
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,600
 And she went to her grave believing this and pushing this,

932
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,440
 because she had people write to her, various people who knew Einstein.

933
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,240
 She didn't even really meet him, I think possibly she only met him once.

934
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,720
 - Yeah. - He didn't know some of his grandchildren.

935
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,080
 Einstein once gave his grandson Cesar a three-hour lecture

936
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,200
 on the mathematical properties of soap bubbles.

937
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,960
 Despite the fact that at the time, Cesar was eight years old.

938
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,680
 - Right. - He took him out on a boat trip

939
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,520
 and would not stop talking about soap bubbles for three hours.

940
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,960
 - They are quite interesting, though, aren't they? - They're quite interesting, yeah.

941
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,440
 And eight years... I mean, Charlie Chaplin was club-dancing at eight years old.

942
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,520
 - You know, he can listen to a three-hour lecture. - Yeah, yeah.

943
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,720
 And some maybe other famous people, like, um,

944
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,200
 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, very famous, uh, in his time.

945
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,560
 Uh, and because he was so famous, he became really, really paranoid.

946
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,640
 And at one stage, he thought that everyone was sending him

947
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,720
 these, um, fan art, and they were so bad

948
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,960
 that he thought there was a conspiracy happened

949
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,080
 that people were mocking him with their terrible pictures.

950
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,720
 Wow, I didn't think fan art existed like that at the time.

951
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,480
 It did. People made drawings of him and paintings of him.

952
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,640
 - Wow. - Uh, and he once had a visit from a couple of friends

953
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,080
 called, uh, Monsieur Madame Brett.

954
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,520
 Uh, and he found out that Madame Brett had an engraving of him

955
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,280
 that she kept above her mantelpiece, and she really loved it.

956
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,520
 And he completely fell out with her

957
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,240
 because he thought this was such a bad bit of fan art

958
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,000
 that he didn't want to be friends with anyone

959
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,400
 who could even look at it.

960
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,000
 - Wow. - Wow.

961
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,600
 - That's a high friend bar. - That's amazing.

962
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,440
 I mean, I've been to all of your houses,

963
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,880
 and I don't think much of the art on your walls, but I don't.

964
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,200
 - Well, I've got a massive painting of you over my fireplace, Anna.

965
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,720
 I can't believe you. - Yeah, and I take it as a parody of me,

966
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,720
 and I'm mostly offended.

967
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,960
 Um, I'm gonna have to wrap us up in a sec.

968
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,880
 I've got, uh, just a quick thing.

969
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,640
 James, you mentioned earlier, Robert Pattinson.

970
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,280
 - Oh, yeah. - Which you provided me.

971
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,320
 There's a story, and, you know, these celebrity stories,

972
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,680
 God knows if they're true, but, um, he obviously has a lot of fans.

973
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,560
 He was in Twilight. He's the new Batman.

974
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,800
 Um, and he had a stalker as well,

975
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,320
 and he actually kind of hit it head-on,

976
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,360
 and he took the stalker to dinner.

977
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,400
 Um, but at the dinner, he complained about his life so much

978
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,320
 that she got really bored and quit stalking him.

979
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:10,000
 - That's such a good idea. - That's how you deal with it, yeah.

980
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 - Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

981
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,800
 Thank you so much for listening.

982
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,040

 so do check that out.

997
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,520

998
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,480
 thank you so much for having us tonight.

999
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,760
