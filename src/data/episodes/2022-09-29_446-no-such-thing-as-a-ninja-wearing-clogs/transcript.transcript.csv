00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:15,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:15,00:00:17,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:17,00:00:21,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live
00:00:21,00:00:22,from Glasgow!
00:00:22,00:00:25,(audience cheering)
00:00:26,00:00:27,Yes!
00:00:27,00:00:33,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:33,00:00:35,"I am sitting here with Anna Toshinsky,"
00:00:35,00:00:38,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:38,00:00:40,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:40,00:00:43,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:43,00:00:46,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:46,00:00:50,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:50,00:00:54,"- My fact is that in 1907, a man named Charles W. Aldrieve"
00:00:54,00:00:59,"won a huge bet, simply by walking 1,500 miles on water."
00:00:59,00:01:03,(audience laughing)
00:01:03,00:01:05,I've gone for the mysterious fact.
00:01:05,00:01:07,- Was that a bet with Jesus?
00:01:07,00:01:09,"- It was a bet with Jesus, yeah,"
00:01:09,00:01:12,"who got furthest about thinking, ""No, this is the guy here."""
00:01:12,00:01:13,"So just for the people in the room,"
00:01:13,00:01:15,"this is him, Charles Aldrieve."
00:01:15,00:01:17,"Aldrieve was such a hero, okay,"
00:01:17,00:01:19,he was nicknamed the human water spider.
00:01:19,00:01:22,"And he basically, he had a career,"
00:01:23,00:01:26,"he had a career, which just evolved"
00:01:26,00:01:27,"going around walking on water,"
00:01:27,00:01:29,and crowds absolutely ate it up.
00:01:29,00:01:32,"And this was 1907, and there was a big bet,"
00:01:32,00:01:34,"and he stood to gain $5,000,"
00:01:34,00:01:36,which was obviously way more at the time.
00:01:36,00:01:38,"He was walking from Cincinnati to New Orleans,"
00:01:38,00:01:41,"and he had to do it, but every step had to be on water."
00:01:41,00:01:44,"And he had these special shoes,"
00:01:44,00:01:49,"which were massive, obviously, about four feet long, and--"
00:01:49,00:01:51,- Apparently it took him five years
00:01:51,00:01:53,to learn how to turn properly.
00:01:53,00:01:55,- Really? - Yeah.
00:01:55,00:01:56,"- It was a full, he was well-trained, yeah."
00:01:56,00:01:58,"- It was really, it was described as kind of like"
00:01:58,00:02:00,"walking through mud,"
00:02:00,00:02:02,the way that he was propelling himself forward.
00:02:02,00:02:05,"So he had, as the listener will have to picture it,"
00:02:05,00:02:08,"but it's a sort of like a long boat of a shoe,"
00:02:08,00:02:09,and he would wear a Wellington boot
00:02:09,00:02:10,"before he put his foot in,"
00:02:10,00:02:13,"and then he would put a sort of watertight,"
00:02:13,00:02:15,"sort of elastic around it, so that water couldn't get in."
00:02:15,00:02:18,"So if he flipped over, he couldn't get out of there,"
00:02:18,00:02:20,"it was just, he was stuck."
00:02:21,00:02:22,- Very dangerous.
00:02:22,00:02:24,"But he was a very dangerous guy, like he was a showman,"
00:02:24,00:02:27,so he used to do things like take a stick of dynamite
00:02:27,00:02:30,"out of his back, and he would light his cigar"
00:02:30,00:02:32,"with the dynamite, and then chuck it into the water,"
00:02:32,00:02:35,and giant shooting 20 meter tall foot waves
00:02:35,00:02:37,would go into the air on the back of it.
00:02:37,00:02:40,"Cool, dude. - He was incredible."
00:02:40,00:02:43,- It was weird that he was so into this very specific trick
00:02:43,00:02:46,"for his entire life, like three decades, basically."
00:02:46,00:02:48,"So he claimed in 1898,"
00:02:48,00:02:51,"he was actually gonna walk across the Atlantic Ocean,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,which would have been a much better fact
00:02:53,00:02:55,if he had actually done it.
00:02:55,00:02:58,"I mean, it's unbelievable he thought he could do this."
00:02:58,00:02:59,"He was planning to walk to Paris,"
00:02:59,00:03:01,I think 'cause he wanted to walk to the Paris Exposition
00:03:01,00:03:04,"or something, but he said he was inspired to do this"
00:03:04,00:03:05,when he was giving a demonstration
00:03:05,00:03:09,"of his walking on water shoes on a beach in Florida,"
00:03:09,00:03:12,"and he got sucked out to sea by a current,"
00:03:12,00:03:14,"and the boat that went to rescue him capsized,"
00:03:14,00:03:16,"they couldn't rescue him, and everyone was like,"
00:03:16,00:03:17,"""Oh, God, we've lost him, he's gone forever."""
00:03:17,00:03:19,"- He's like, ""I've already done half a mile,"
00:03:19,00:03:20,"""I might as well do the rest."""
00:03:20,00:03:22,(laughing)
00:03:22,00:03:25,"- Well, he got dragged out to sea, you know, a mile or two,"
00:03:25,00:03:27,"and once the wind had died down,"
00:03:27,00:03:29,he was seen mounting the horizon
00:03:29,00:03:32,"and walking back towards the beach on the sea,"
00:03:32,00:03:34,"and he thought, ""God, if I survive that,"
00:03:34,00:03:36,"""I reckon I could do the whole ocean."""
00:03:36,00:03:39,"- His idea was that he would walk along the water,"
00:03:39,00:03:42,"and whenever there was like a big swell of a wave,"
00:03:42,00:03:43,"he would let it bring him up,"
00:03:43,00:03:46,"and then he would kind of ski down the end of the wave,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,and then just wait for them to come.
00:03:48,00:03:51,"But you say it's like, it's an impossible thing,"
00:03:51,00:03:52,but someone has done that.
00:03:52,00:03:55,There's a guy called Remy Bricker from France.
00:03:55,00:03:58,- I bet he was indeed bricking it for most of the swim.
00:03:58,00:04:02,"- Sorry, he was, but he walked from Tenerife to Trinidad"
00:04:02,00:04:04,"on boat, you know, boats."
00:04:04,00:04:07,"- It was the 80s, it was 1988,"
00:04:07,00:04:09,"and he survived, Remy Bricker, the French guy,"
00:04:09,00:04:12,"he survived by eating plankton, he claimed."
00:04:12,00:04:13,(laughing)
00:04:13,00:04:15,"- So, the Guardian said that,"
00:04:15,00:04:18,"so what did he, like, if a blue whale eats plankton,"
00:04:18,00:04:21,it kind of just opens its mouth and just lets it go in.
00:04:21,00:04:22,Is that what he was doing?
00:04:22,00:04:24,"- Exactly, it was, yeah, and he was French,"
00:04:24,00:04:26,so he probably cooked them very brilliantly as well
00:04:26,00:04:29,"along the way, and he had these polyester skiing floats."
00:04:29,00:04:31,"He was doing the same thing, basically."
00:04:31,00:04:34,He did suffer extreme hunger and vision problems
00:04:34,00:04:36,"as he tried to cross the Atlantic, he did 40 days."
00:04:36,00:04:39,"But then, Remy Bricker said,"
00:04:39,00:04:41,"""Okay, I've done the Atlantic on water,"
00:04:41,00:04:43,"""I'm gonna go for the Pacific."""
00:04:43,00:04:46,"And when asked why, I just love this answer, okay,"
00:04:46,00:04:51,"so French, he said, ""In this life, I have flesh and bone."
00:04:51,00:04:53,"""I know our time goes very quickly."
00:04:53,00:04:56,"""In eternity, our time is one second."
00:04:56,00:04:59,"""In this one second, I will use my time"
00:04:59,00:05:00,"""to realise my dream."""
00:05:00,00:05:02,(laughing)
00:05:02,00:05:03,"- And one second later, he drowned."
00:05:03,00:05:05,(laughing)
00:05:05,00:05:06,"- Well, he failed, he absolutely failed."
00:05:06,00:05:09,He failed despite the fact he was sponsored
00:05:09,00:05:12,by an American sauerkraut company called Stuffler.
00:05:12,00:05:14,"- What, despite that?"
00:05:14,00:05:17,"- Well, he was dragging 22 pounds of sauerkraut with him"
00:05:17,00:05:18,as he tried to cross the Pacific.
00:05:18,00:05:21,- You need something to go with that plankton on the side.
00:05:21,00:05:23,- You've got to keep the microbiome healthy
00:05:23,00:05:24,when you're out at sea.
00:05:24,00:05:27,"- In normal life, he is a one-man band."
00:05:27,00:05:28,"He, you know the guys with the--"
00:05:28,00:05:29,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah."
00:05:29,00:05:31,- I was literally one-man band.
00:05:31,00:05:35,"- Yeah, he's actually, in French, an homme orchestre."
00:05:35,00:05:35,- Right.
00:05:35,00:05:36,- That's the French for a one-man band.
00:05:36,00:05:37,"- As in he has lots of instruments,"
00:05:37,00:05:40,"I mean, you've mined it there, but just to be clear,"
00:05:40,00:05:42,"he has lots of instruments rigged up on his body, does he?"
00:05:42,00:05:44,- We all know the one-man band.
00:05:44,00:05:47,- We're just saying that mimes don't work with a podcast.
00:05:47,00:05:48,"- True, 'cause he's French,"
00:05:48,00:05:51,"I think I was thinking the mime would work, yeah."
00:05:51,00:05:52,- Why is he not combined the two?
00:05:52,00:05:55,Why is he not bringing the band with him on the water?
00:05:55,00:05:57,- I think if he can't bring a simple thing
00:05:57,00:06:01,like 22 pounds of sauerkraut as he walks across an ocean.
00:06:01,00:06:03,- The full drum kit is probably crazy to admit.
00:06:03,00:06:05,"- I guess there's some similar skills, isn't there?"
00:06:05,00:06:08,"Like it's lots of moving around, moving your legs and stuff."
00:06:08,00:06:10,"He didn't make it like you say,"
00:06:10,00:06:11,"but it was because on the first day,"
00:06:11,00:06:15,Storm wrecked the catamaran that he towed behind him.
00:06:15,00:06:17,So all of his food and all of his bed
00:06:17,00:06:21,and all of his supplies just went down on the first day.
00:06:21,00:06:23,- He was towing a whole catamaran.
00:06:23,00:06:27,"- The interesting thing about, well, it wasn't catamaran"
00:06:27,00:06:30,"in the case that it had two bows, right?"
00:06:30,00:06:31,But the interesting thing about that
00:06:31,00:06:34,"is when Old Reeve was gonna walk over the Atlantic,"
00:06:34,00:06:38,"he decided, like I said, he was gonna ski down these swells,"
00:06:38,00:06:40,"but he reckoned that when it was really calm weather,"
00:06:40,00:06:44,he would tow a boat with him.
00:06:44,00:06:46,"So there would be, there was a boat nearby"
00:06:46,00:06:49,that would kind of follow him with supplies.
00:06:49,00:06:51,"And he thought that what I would do is when it's calm,"
00:06:51,00:06:53,"I'll just tow the boat, it doesn't need sales."
00:06:53,00:06:54,- That's brilliant.
00:06:54,00:06:57,"- In 1898, he walked from New York harbour"
00:06:57,00:07:00,"to Governor's Island, which is where the army base was."
00:07:00,00:07:03,And the New York Journal reported that when he arrived
00:07:03,00:07:07,"at the army base, the commandant felt the wonderful fine muscles"
00:07:07,00:07:11,of the man who had made so wonderful a trip.
00:07:11,00:07:12,- Ooh!
00:07:12,00:07:14,- That... - Wow.
00:07:14,00:07:16,- That... - (LAUGHS)
00:07:16,00:07:18,"- Glass goes out for it, but... - (LAUGHTER)"
00:07:18,00:07:20,"- That feels a bit like an excuse, doesn't it?"
00:07:20,00:07:22,"Or you've made such a wonderful trip,"
00:07:22,00:07:24,"your thigh muscles must be wonderful as well,"
00:07:24,00:07:27,and so that feels a bit of a pretext.
00:07:27,00:07:28,"- I wonder, because it's a military base, right?"
00:07:28,00:07:32,"Do they think he was the sort of advance arm of an attack, I wonder?"
00:07:32,00:07:34,"- Well, that was the thing, though, wasn't it?"
00:07:34,00:07:35,People were doing this already.
00:07:35,00:07:39,"They were trying to make boat shoes and go out and walk waters,"
00:07:39,00:07:42,and someone had an idea that what if we created an army battalion
00:07:42,00:07:44,that could walk across water?
00:07:44,00:07:46,- That we would lose every one.
00:07:46,00:07:47,- (LAUGHTER)
00:07:47,00:07:48,- And that's why it didn't happen.
00:07:48,00:07:52,"- But it was... Yeah, this guy, Robert Kjellberg,"
00:07:52,00:07:55,he trained some soldiers to wear a heavy backpack
00:07:55,00:07:58,and fire a rifle while walking on water.
00:07:58,00:08:00,And he toured the whole of England.
00:08:00,00:08:04,"He was known as the Water King, and this was a huge, huge thing."
00:08:04,00:08:06,"- It's not huge, it wasn't a huge thing."
00:08:06,00:08:07,"- And also, he was known as the Water King."
00:08:07,00:08:09,He wasn't the Water King!
00:08:09,00:08:11,(LAUGHTER)
00:08:11,00:08:12,"- Oh, look, it's the Water King!"
00:08:12,00:08:14,"- It would definitely have the element of surprise, I think."
00:08:14,00:08:16,- Exactly! The Water King!
00:08:16,00:08:18,(LAUGHTER)
00:08:18,00:08:20,"- Yeah, especially presented like that."
00:08:20,00:08:21,- Yeah.
00:08:21,00:08:26,- There's another thing where you have these kind of round shoes
00:08:26,00:08:29,that ninjas are supposed to have used to walk on water with.
00:08:29,00:08:33,So they're probably about the size of a dustbin lid.
00:08:33,00:08:35,And you strap your feet to them.
00:08:35,00:08:38,And the idea was that ninjas could get across moats and things like that.
00:08:38,00:08:41,"And I've been to ninja school, and that's what they say."
00:08:41,00:08:43,"- ""Beep, beep, beep, look back up!"""
00:08:43,00:08:45,"- Yeah, okay."
00:08:45,00:08:46,- You've been to ninja school?
00:08:46,00:08:48,"- I've been to ninja school, and that's what they say anyway."
00:08:48,00:08:51,"So the interesting thing... - No, no, no, no, no, no, obviously..."
00:08:51,00:08:53,- When did you go to ninja school?
00:08:53,00:08:55,"- What qualification? - Well, I was in Kyoto."
00:08:55,00:08:57,"- Okay, that checks out so far."
00:08:57,00:09:03,"- So, what qualifications did you do ninja GCSEs?"
00:09:03,00:09:05,(LAUGHTER)
00:09:05,00:09:08,"- I did, but I'm not allowed to show you the certificate."
00:09:08,00:09:10,"- Wait, that's Spice! That's different!"
00:09:10,00:09:14,"- No, I am... Well, look, I did do that thing, so..."
00:09:14,00:09:19,I think how about I mentioned before that they taught me how to throw ninja stars.
00:09:19,00:09:23,"- Oh, yeah. - And they taught me how to throw chopsticks so I could kill a man."
00:09:23,00:09:24,- Really?
00:09:24,00:09:25,(LAUGHTER)
00:09:25,00:09:27,- Wow.
00:09:27,00:09:30,- Right. - Have you proofed it?
00:09:30,00:09:32,- Let's do it. - Are you volunteering?
00:09:32,00:09:35,- Who's got chopsticks? Come on.
00:09:35,00:09:39,"Dan, you stand over there."
00:09:39,00:09:42,- I'll see you in Wagga Mamas after the show.
00:09:42,00:09:46,"Anyway, the point that I was trying to make is that they told me this in ninja school,"
00:09:46,00:09:49,but there's some new research.
00:09:49,00:09:52,(LAUGHTER)
00:09:52,00:09:55,"- Some old ninja documents. - Hey, Huckin, you're late."
00:09:55,00:09:59,I'm not late. I've been here for 45 minutes.
00:09:59,00:10:03,- The other thing they teach you how to do is to walk backwards
00:10:03,00:10:05,while there are drawing pins on the floor.
00:10:05,00:10:07,- OK. - What?
00:10:07,00:10:09,"The walking backwards thing, do you just keep your feet,"
00:10:09,00:10:12,your soles of the feet on the ground so you push the drawing pins out of the way?
00:10:12,00:10:13,"Like a moonwalk, basically."
00:10:13,00:10:16,"- It's not like a moonwalk. You kind of walk backwards,"
00:10:16,00:10:19,"but you sweep your back foot, and they also teach how to walk very slowly,"
00:10:19,00:10:21,so no one can hear you walking.
00:10:21,00:10:25,- It was like curling backwards with your feet. - Exactly.
00:10:25,00:10:27,- Nice. - I feel like we've gone off the point of this.
00:10:27,00:10:29,- I'm loving this. I'm loving it. - I'm loving it.
00:10:29,00:10:33,- The amount of shit I got when I said I'd been to clown school for a short course.
00:10:33,00:10:35,(LAUGHTER)
00:10:35,00:10:38,"This is all my Christmas is at once, you know?"
00:10:38,00:10:41,"- Anyway, so they said this at ninja school,"
00:10:41,00:10:43,"and there's been some new research,"
00:10:43,00:10:48,"and they found old ninja documents about these things called Mizugumo,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,"and they found the word ""sit"" next to them,"
00:10:50,00:10:54,and what they reckon is they weren't actually used by ninjas to walk on water.
00:10:54,00:10:57,They were actually like little boats you would sit on and paddle along.
00:10:57,00:10:58,- Ah! - Obviously!
00:10:58,00:11:00,Why didn't they draw that conclusion
00:11:00,00:11:02,when they first saw these round things that go on water?
00:11:02,00:11:06,Why did they assume there were shoes before they assumed they were boats?
00:11:06,00:11:09,"- Cos the ninjas spread the myth that they can walk on water, you know?"
00:11:09,00:11:13,"- Oh, it's a clever bit of PR. - It's PR, yeah."
00:11:13,00:11:15,- They're good on PR. - Very good on PR.
00:11:15,00:11:22,"- Just on the elephant in the room, Jesus of Nazareth. - Yeah."
00:11:22,00:11:26,"- We... - Has he caught that very often? - Yeah, please."
00:11:26,00:11:27,We've all been dancing around it.
00:11:27,00:11:31,"Obviously, the Jesus Walking on Water thing on the Sea of Galilee."
00:11:31,00:11:33,"In 2006, there was a suggestion,"
00:11:33,00:11:36,and it was published in a proper academic journal
00:11:36,00:11:39,"called The Journal of Paleo-Lymnology,"
00:11:39,00:11:43,"the study of ancient lakes, obviously,"
00:11:43,00:11:46,which suggested that there was ice in the Sea of Galilee.
00:11:46,00:11:48,"It's more of a lake than a sea, I think."
00:11:48,00:11:53,"And so, it has this rare property due to the salty and fresh water that feeds it."
00:11:53,00:11:57,And it has this rare property where you could have these bits of ice forming.
00:11:57,00:12:00,"You know, like, part of it freezes over and part of it doesn't."
00:12:00,00:12:03,"- Really? I mean, it's in the Middle East, isn't it?"
00:12:03,00:12:05,"Yeah, but it gets cold sometimes, you know?"
00:12:05,00:12:09,And the suggestion is that spring's ice could have formed and made it look like Jesus was walking on water.
00:12:09,00:12:12,"So, do you think they said to Jesus, ""Can you do that trick again?"
00:12:12,00:12:15,"""Walk on water?"" He's like, ""Oh, give me a few months."""
00:12:15,00:12:18,"- Yeah, it's more of a Christmas miracle than anything. - Mists."
00:12:18,00:12:21,"- Sorry, me-mists. Oh, whatever, mind. - Mists."
00:12:21,00:12:25,"- But I saw... Genuinely, on the way here today,"
00:12:25,00:12:29,I saw a duck basically doing this in a pond.
00:12:29,00:12:31,"It looked like it was walking on water,"
00:12:31,00:12:35,but actually it was just standing on a stone that was near the surface of the water.
00:12:35,00:12:37,"But it does make you think, doesn't it?"
00:12:37,00:12:41,"- Well, on that note... - I guess it does."
00:12:41,00:12:44,- We should move on to our next fact. - Fact.
00:12:44,00:12:46,"- Thank you, Andy. - Thank you."
00:12:46,00:12:56,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:12:56,00:13:04,My fact this week is that zebra spiders chase laser pointers exactly like a cat does.
00:13:04,00:13:06,"So, this is a very exciting fact."
00:13:06,00:13:11,"This is a discovery that basically zebra spiders, which are jumping spiders,"
00:13:11,00:13:13,are really similar to cats in quite a lot of ways.
00:13:13,00:13:16,"Come on, mate. It's a disappointed kid you've got."
00:13:16,00:13:19,"If they've asked for a pet cat, you come home with a microscopic spider"
00:13:19,00:13:22,"and say, ""They're really similar. I had it on a podcast."""
00:13:22,00:13:25,I didn't know what these spiders were until you said zebra spiders.
00:13:25,00:13:27,"And then I looked them up, and basically, you know the tiny ones"
00:13:27,00:13:29,that sort of jerk in their movements.
00:13:29,00:13:32,"- They hear, then they jerk, then they jerk again. - Yeah."
00:13:32,00:13:34,"And they're very... Well, they pounce, right? That's their big thing."
00:13:34,00:13:36,And this was noticed by a scientist.
00:13:36,00:13:40,"She was in her lab, and she had these spiders that were falling off her roof,"
00:13:40,00:13:43,"and then someone said, ""Hey, have you seen that if you use a laser pointer,"
00:13:43,00:13:45,"""that you can actually get them to chase it?"""
00:13:45,00:13:48,"And she tested it out with another colleague, and that's what happened."
00:13:48,00:13:51,And they thought this is absolutely amazing.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"And basically, what they think is like a cat,"
00:13:53,00:13:55,"that this is something that I need to attack, kill, and eat."
00:13:55,00:13:59,"And so, when they see the green laser pointer, that's what they do."
00:13:59,00:14:03,- But they can't because it's a laser. - Laser.
00:14:03,00:14:05,"- But it's very exciting. - It's really cool, isn't it?"
00:14:05,00:14:07,"This is, by the way, this from Ed Young article,"
00:14:07,00:14:10,who we had on the podcast not too long ago.
00:14:10,00:14:14,"He said that we do raid his articles, and once again, we have plagiarised his work."
00:14:14,00:14:16,"So, thank you, Ed."
00:14:16,00:14:19,"Sorry, Ed, the fact ninjas have been in."
00:14:19,00:14:22,You'll never notice.
00:14:22,00:14:27,The thing I thought was that these astronomers' lab needs a clean.
00:14:27,00:14:30,Really? Who's got spiders falling off the ceilings of their lab?
00:14:30,00:14:33,"And also, you're supposed to be astronomers, you're not naturalists."
00:14:33,00:14:35,What if they... Did they miss an eclipse?
00:14:35,00:14:38,"You know, they're just coaxing spiders around."
00:14:38,00:14:44,- I think part of it was also to work out what jumping spiders can see with their eyes. - Yeah.
00:14:44,00:14:47,"Because their eyes are a bit like telescopes in that they're kind of a tube,"
00:14:47,00:14:49,and there's a lens at both ends.
00:14:49,00:14:52,And you can work out what a telescope can see
00:14:52,00:14:56,by working out the different lenses and the different distances and stuff like that.
00:14:56,00:15:01,And they worked out that most jumping spiders would be able to see the moon.
00:15:01,00:15:03,"- Yeah, which is amazing. - Yeah, that's really cool."
00:15:03,00:15:06,"Because they're small, so it doesn't sound amazing."
00:15:06,00:15:09,"I wasn't amazed. If it makes you feel better, anyone who doesn't think it's amazing,"
00:15:09,00:15:12,"I wasn't amazed at first, because I thought, ""Well, I can see the moon."""
00:15:12,00:15:16,But it's much harder to see the moon if you don't look at me.
00:15:16,00:15:19,How many legs have you got?
00:15:19,00:15:23,They're 5 to 9 millimetres. You're exactly... That's tiny to see the moon.
00:15:23,00:15:25,But I just don't think of what can see the moon.
00:15:25,00:15:29,And now here we are thinking about it.
00:15:29,00:15:32,"I mean, moths can see the moon, can't they?"
00:15:32,00:15:36,"Well, ah, but can they?"
00:15:36,00:15:40,"Yeah, they can, cos then they think lights are the moon, and they're pretty small."
00:15:40,00:15:44,"Come on, I think the spider spider's bragging about this moon seeing is..."
00:15:44,00:15:48,But that means they presumably can see your face.
00:15:48,00:15:50,"Cos your face is a bit distant, it's a bit bigger."
00:15:50,00:15:52,"In fact, it's way bigger than the moon, normally."
00:15:52,00:15:54,- And they think your face is weird. - And they think your face is weird.
00:15:54,00:15:58,"If you want to move around like a ninja, do it when there's no moon."
00:15:58,00:16:00,- Oh! - God!
00:16:00,00:16:03,But it's weird to think of a spider that can see your face.
00:16:03,00:16:06,- Why is that weird? - I don't know.
00:16:06,00:16:08,Cos I don't think of a spider as having a face.
00:16:08,00:16:12,"Spiders absolutely have faces, right? They have eyes."
00:16:12,00:16:13,- What are you talking about? - They've got eyes.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"But they don't have a face, a proper face."
00:16:15,00:16:19,"So you think if you don't have a proper face, you shouldn't be allowed to see other faces?"
00:16:19,00:16:21,"No, I'm not saying that. I'm not thinking at all."
00:16:21,00:16:23,"I'm just saying it's a surprise to think that they could look up and think,"
00:16:23,00:16:26,"""Oh, there's Dan."" That's a weird thing."
00:16:26,00:16:28,Can I just jump in here for a second?
00:16:28,00:16:30,"- Can I ask? - Oh, we didn't see you, though!"
00:16:30,00:16:38,"Dan, I told you to put more drawing pins down before the show started."
00:16:38,00:16:41,I want to know if you're surprised/interested in this.
00:16:41,00:16:45,And that is that there is a spider called the Ogre-Faced Spider.
00:16:45,00:16:48,"And by looking at their eyes, we can work out that they can make out"
00:16:48,00:16:50,the Andromeda galaxy in the sky.
00:16:50,00:16:52,- What?! - That's cool.
00:16:52,00:16:54,"- Can we see that? - Yeah, well..."
00:16:54,00:16:58,"You can just about on a really dark day in the middle of nowhere, yeah."
00:16:58,00:17:01,"Do they know what it is? Do they say, ""See Andromeda again?"""
00:17:01,00:17:05,"No, they aren't cool."
00:17:05,00:17:07,"One thing that zebra spiders do specifically, apparently,"
00:17:07,00:17:09,"is they do respond to humans,"
00:17:09,00:17:13,which I do think is something that we don't think of non-mammals as doing.
00:17:13,00:17:15,"Like, you see a cat, it sees you, it responds to you."
00:17:15,00:17:18,"And if a human walks into the room while they're going about their business,"
00:17:18,00:17:20,they'll sort of turn around and look up at you.
00:17:20,00:17:22,"And they do have... Andi says they can see our faces,"
00:17:22,00:17:24,"but we can see theirs as well, obviously."
00:17:24,00:17:27,"And they do have such good faces, Jumping Spiders,"
00:17:27,00:17:29,because they've got those two giant...
00:17:29,00:17:31,They just look like something out of sci-fi.
00:17:31,00:17:33,"There's two giant eyes in the middle,"
00:17:33,00:17:35,and then two slightly smaller eyes either side.
00:17:35,00:17:38,- Look 'em up. They're great stuff. - They are very cool.
00:17:38,00:17:42,"Excitingly, Jumping Spiders, these specific zebra Jumping Spiders,"
00:17:42,00:17:44,have been to space.
00:17:44,00:17:46,"This is cool, so they've got closer to the moon"
00:17:46,00:17:48,"or other things they can see, which is great."
00:17:48,00:17:51,"- Oh, must have been massive up there. - Must have been amazing."
00:17:51,00:17:53,"Yeah, yeah, it must be really cool."
00:17:53,00:17:55,So there was this theory that...
00:17:55,00:17:57,"Because they jump and they pounce onto their prey,"
00:17:57,00:18:00,they obviously take gravity into account when they're jumping.
00:18:00,00:18:03,"So they jump, they know they're going to fall at a certain rate,"
00:18:03,00:18:04,they know they're going to hit the prey.
00:18:04,00:18:06,"And there was a theory, a question."
00:18:06,00:18:09,If we take them to a tiny microgravity environment
00:18:09,00:18:12,"and they jump, they're not going to jump the same way,"
00:18:12,00:18:14,"will they keep on missing their prey,"
00:18:14,00:18:17,"or will they be able to learn about space, basically,"
00:18:17,00:18:19,learn about microgravity?
00:18:19,00:18:23,"And this was an 18-year-old guy from Egypt called Amon Mohammed,"
00:18:23,00:18:25,and he won a competition to do this experiment on the ISS.
00:18:25,00:18:29,"Not to go himself, but just to, like, have the experiment done."
00:18:29,00:18:32,"And the thesis was they won't be able to learn, and they did learn."
00:18:32,00:18:35,"- Yeah. - They learned how to adapt to zero gravity,"
00:18:35,00:18:36,"- which is very exciting. - And what they did was,"
00:18:36,00:18:40,"instead of jumping on their prey, they kind of just sidled up to it."
00:18:40,00:18:41,"- Yeah, yeah. - Didn't they?"
00:18:41,00:18:44,"- And just went, ""Hey..."" - Yeah, there was one thought that they would..."
00:18:44,00:18:48,"What they do do on Earth is that if they're jumping down from above on a prey,"
00:18:48,00:18:51,they need to make sure that they're going to land on the target.
00:18:51,00:18:54,So they tether themselves with one of their silk webs.
00:18:54,00:18:56,But it's a bit like Mission Impossible.
00:18:56,00:18:58,- Tom Cruise going down. - Which one?
00:18:58,00:18:59,- Mission Impossible 1. - Yep.
00:18:59,00:19:02,"So they're sort of jumping down bungee-style,"
00:19:02,00:19:04,"but if they need to pull the cord to stop,"
00:19:04,00:19:06,they can do that and bring themselves back up
00:19:06,00:19:08,if they can see they're missing the prey.
00:19:08,00:19:11,So one of the thoughts in space was they might be using their line
00:19:11,00:19:14,"to sort of tether themselves, bring themselves back down,"
00:19:14,00:19:16,"and help them along, but no, instead, they just walked up and ate."
00:19:16,00:19:19,It says to me the fruit flies that they deployed
00:19:19,00:19:21,"were not that energetic, to be honest."
00:19:21,00:19:23,If you can just stroll up to your fly.
00:19:23,00:19:27,Or it says that the pounce is just absolutely unnecessary on Earth as well.
00:19:27,00:19:28,"- Exactly. - Just walk, mate."
00:19:28,00:19:29,Walk up to it.
00:19:29,00:19:31,"It was this... Again, I think I've said this before,"
00:19:31,00:19:35,but I do find it funny the stuff they make these astronauts do in space.
00:19:35,00:19:37,And this one fell to Sunita Williams.
00:19:37,00:19:40,And I guess they dished them out at the start of an expedition.
00:19:40,00:19:43,"They're like, ""Do you want to do this random 16-year-old's idea?"""
00:19:43,00:19:46,"She was the one who activated the flies every day,"
00:19:46,00:19:48,"and she sort of would release a plunger,"
00:19:48,00:19:50,"which released all these flies into the den,"
00:19:50,00:19:52,and then the spiders would go for it.
00:19:52,00:19:56,And it was one zebra spider and one red-backed jumping spider.
00:19:56,00:19:59,"And they were called Cleopatra and Nefertiti,"
00:19:59,00:20:01,"and they did jolly well, but then, of course,"
00:20:01,00:20:04,they did plummet towards Earth at breakneck speeds
00:20:04,00:20:06,"at the end of the mission, and immediately the zebra spider died on impact."
00:20:06,00:20:11,"- No, they were inside a capsule just to add quickly. - No, they weren't inside a capsule just to add quickly."
00:20:11,00:20:14,"- It sounds like they just dug them out, like, from Argonne. - Yeah, they did."
00:20:14,00:20:16,"No, no, they gave them a little spaceship."
00:20:16,00:20:19,"What, like, the force of the re-entry killed them?"
00:20:19,00:20:21,It's not actually true. It's not both of them.
00:20:21,00:20:23,"It was just the zebra spider, actually, Cleopatra."
00:20:23,00:20:26,"And they're not clear on why she died, but it's something about the impact."
00:20:26,00:20:29,But Nefertiti did survive and went to the Smithsonian
00:20:29,00:20:32,to live out her remaining sort of two months before she did.
00:20:32,00:20:35,"- Copped it as well. - I think she lived in an actual, like,"
00:20:35,00:20:37,"- display in a museum that you could visit, right? - Yeah, she did."
00:20:37,00:20:40,"- So people visited Nefertiti. - But the other interesting thing,"
00:20:40,00:20:44,"I think, that they found is that she learned how to do it the old way afterwards."
00:20:44,00:20:45,"- Oh, my God, that's so clever. - Which I think that's really interesting."
00:20:45,00:20:47,"- Yeah. - Yeah, that's so cool."
00:20:47,00:20:52,"This is slightly off-topic, but I found out about a spider hunting thing."
00:20:52,00:20:57,"- OK. - And it's a moth specifically called the metal-mark moth,"
00:20:57,00:20:59,"which pretends to be a spider, right?"
00:20:59,00:21:02,"So its wings have these marks on which look like big spider eyes,"
00:21:02,00:21:05,and other parts of its wings look like the furry legs of a spider.
00:21:05,00:21:08,"It looks like a huge spider, actually, to other spiders,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,and it moves a bit like one.
00:21:10,00:21:14,And it's so good that actual jumping spiders will flirt with it
00:21:14,00:21:17,"- rather than try to kill it. - Oh, yeah. - Really? - Yeah."
00:21:17,00:21:20,"I think it was said before that they're kind of not that picky jumping spiders, are they?"
00:21:20,00:21:23,Then we said that they sometimes just dance with other spiders
00:21:23,00:21:27,"that are not jumping spiders, and most of the time get eaten."
00:21:27,00:21:30,"- Oh, yeah. - But that's the theory of the dance."
00:21:30,00:21:33,So they do this like courtship dance before the mating.
00:21:33,00:21:37,"And the idea is, the reason they do that is so that there is certain distance away"
00:21:37,00:21:40,"from the female that if they decide it's not worth it,"
00:21:40,00:21:41,then they have a chance to run away.
00:21:41,00:21:44,"And apparently, there are certain moves that they have to do,"
00:21:44,00:21:49,"and if they do a perfect dance, then they're guaranteed to have sex."
00:21:49,00:21:52,"So it's like, you know, in Strictly, where if everyone gets tense..."
00:21:52,00:21:54,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:21:54,00:21:56,"It works, the same in Strictly, doesn't it?"
00:21:56,00:21:57,"- I believe so, yeah. - Wow."
00:21:57,00:22:00,"But is there a thing where, if you don't do it perfectly,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,you will be killed and eaten?
00:22:02,00:22:05,"- You must. - Which also, weirdly, happens on Strictly."
00:22:12,00:22:14,Time to move on to our next fact.
00:22:14,00:22:18,"It's time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:22:18,00:22:22,"OK, my fact this week is that according to a law of 1656,"
00:22:22,00:22:27,chicken owners on the Scottish borders had to give their chickens clogs.
00:22:27,00:22:32,- OK. - Right.
00:22:32,00:22:41,"So, this is a thing that happened, not just down the road from here."
00:22:41,00:22:43,It's from the Records of Pebbles.
00:22:43,00:22:50,"And this was about complaints of scraping of fowls in houses and yards,"
00:22:50,00:22:53,as in they'd been pooing over their neighbour's yards.
00:22:53,00:22:59,"And they said that everyone who owned a hen or a capon, so any kind of chicken,"
00:22:59,00:23:02,would have to tie such a weight of timber to the foot
00:23:02,00:23:04,that would stop them from flying.
00:23:04,00:23:07,"And then it specifically says that they are clogs,"
00:23:07,00:23:12,and it says that forchilling would be paid to the owner of any fowl
00:23:12,00:23:15,"going without the clog, sorry, they would have to pay forchilling."
00:23:15,00:23:20,"The thing was, if you were to come across any chicken without clogs in that area,"
00:23:20,00:23:23,then you were allowed to dispose of that chicken.
00:23:23,00:23:26,- But most people have... - That's sinister.
00:23:26,00:23:28,"- I guess by eating it. - Yeah, sounds like it, yeah, yeah."
00:23:28,00:23:31,"Most people have a lot of chickens, which means..."
00:23:31,00:23:34,"Have a lot of chickens, you mean? Have a lot of chickens? Sorry."
00:23:34,00:23:37,- Let's do a poll of the room. - Yeah.
00:23:37,00:23:40,- Do most people in the room have a lot of chickens? - OK.
00:23:40,00:23:42,"- One, thank you. - One, thank you."
00:23:42,00:23:45,"So, what I meant to say was, you know that guy in the crowd"
00:23:45,00:23:48,"who came to our show tonight, who has lots of chickens?"
00:23:48,00:23:51,"Out of curiosity, how many have you got?"
00:23:51,00:23:53,- Loads. - Thank you.
00:23:53,00:23:55,"- Loads. - So, my point says..."
00:23:55,00:23:57,- Who invited the colonel? - Yeah.
00:23:57,00:24:01,"So, you know how that guy has loads of chickens?"
00:24:01,00:24:03,"- Yes. - I'm actually starting to doubt his account,"
00:24:03,00:24:05,if Harry's got loads of chickens now.
00:24:05,00:24:08,"I'm just questioning how many clogs you need to buy,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,the price point of the clogs...
00:24:10,00:24:14,"I don't think these are beautiful, carved, painted clogs"
00:24:14,00:24:15,made by Dutch artisans.
00:24:15,00:24:18,I think it's more like a lump of wood tied to your chicken's foot.
00:24:18,00:24:22,"I'm afraid so, but they called them clogs in the law."
00:24:22,00:24:25,"So, they didn't even carve an inside to put there?"
00:24:25,00:24:28,We don't own any of these in any museum.
00:24:28,00:24:30,"Surely they would have had some insoles, at least,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,so they'd be comfortable as they walked around.
00:24:32,00:24:35,Apology for me hearing a fact that said they wear clogs
00:24:35,00:24:37,and assuming that maybe they wore a fucking clog.
00:24:37,00:24:41,"Clogs are like... Clogs can be anything, you know."
00:24:41,00:24:43,"No, they can't. If I got you some clogs to wear,"
00:24:43,00:24:45,I'm not going to hand you a block of wood.
00:24:45,00:24:47,I'm going to give you a shoe.
00:24:47,00:24:50,"- Just on clogs. - Oh, yeah."
00:24:50,00:24:54,"So, you guys are familiar with clog fighting?"
00:24:54,00:24:55,"- Oh, yeah. - This is the thing."
00:24:55,00:24:57,Is that just a stick fight?
00:24:57,00:25:00,"So, this is..."
00:25:00,00:25:02,Fair enough. That's fair.
00:25:02,00:25:06,- This is human clog fighting. - Uh-huh.
00:25:06,00:25:12,"And this was, I think, a Lancashire sport/way of fighting someone else,"
00:25:12,00:25:16,- where you... - We call that spot in Lancashire.
00:25:16,00:25:21,"It was known as fighting Wigan fashion, which is great."
00:25:21,00:25:22,You would just kick each other.
00:25:22,00:25:25,You and one other person would just repeatedly kick each other
00:25:25,00:25:27,while wearing heavy wooden clogs.
00:25:27,00:25:29,And you would either... This is the great thing.
00:25:29,00:25:31,You would either be wearing your finest clothing
00:25:31,00:25:35,- or be completely naked. - LAUGHTER
00:25:35,00:25:38,"You would hope that you would, like, work that out before the day."
00:25:38,00:25:39,"- Oh, God, so bouncy. - 'Cause if you're awful,"
00:25:39,00:25:44,"if they turned up in their finest clothing, then you'd..."
00:25:44,00:25:44,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:25:44,00:25:47,"- It sounds so rough. - So, what you would do is..."
00:25:47,00:25:49,"You would hold onto each other's shoulders,"
00:25:49,00:25:51,"and then you were wearing very heavy clogs,"
00:25:51,00:25:55,"and they would kind of, you know, say that you should sharpen them, really."
00:25:55,00:25:59,"And you would just keep kicking until one of you shouted, ""Sufficient!"""
00:25:59,00:26:04,"- LAUGHTER - This is shin-kicking, right?"
00:26:04,00:26:06,This is Lancastrian Purin.
00:26:06,00:26:09,"It was known as Purin, or, like you say, Wigan fashion fighting."
00:26:09,00:26:13,"And they thought that it was, like, really turn of the 20th century,"
00:26:13,00:26:15,"that it happened, and then it died out."
00:26:15,00:26:19,"But a friend of mine called Anna F.C. Smith, who's an artist in Lancashire,"
00:26:19,00:26:22,she managed to find evidence of it up until the '50s.
00:26:22,00:26:25,"- So, people are still doing it in the '50s. - '50s? Wow."
00:26:25,00:26:27,"- Oh, that's incredible. - Were there rules on the, like, the size..."
00:26:27,00:26:30,"Like, could Charles Aldreave have come with his big dog shoes?"
00:26:30,00:26:33,- LAUGHTER - That's a really good point.
00:26:33,00:26:35,"They would be your actual clogs,"
00:26:35,00:26:38,"because people in Lancashire wore clogs in those days,"
00:26:38,00:26:40,"and so you would wear your normal clogs, but you might sharpen them."
00:26:40,00:26:43,"You might put bits of metal on them,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,because sometimes the rules were the first to draw blood
00:26:46,00:26:49,would be the one who got the... - Right. - ..who got the win.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"There was a thing... I read a story from 1838,"
00:26:52,00:26:55,"where there was such a brutal, clogged fight"
00:26:55,00:26:58,that one of the guys fighting went deaf in one ear
00:26:58,00:27:02,from being kicked in the leg... - Wow. - That's amazing.
00:27:02,00:27:05,That's not... There's no connection between those two.
00:27:05,00:27:08,- No. It's sort of like a weird kind of reflexology. - Yeah.
00:27:08,00:27:09,Your shin is connected to your ear.
00:27:09,00:27:11,And there was another thing where you would be holding...
00:27:11,00:27:13,This is another method of clog fighting.
00:27:13,00:27:17,"Both of you hold a handkerchief between your teeth,"
00:27:17,00:27:20,and the one who drops it first loses.
00:27:20,00:27:21,Like a tug of war with the handkerchief.
00:27:21,00:27:23,"- Yeah, but no, no, no, no. - Is it the same handkerchief?"
00:27:23,00:27:26,"You're holding the same handkerchief between your two teeth,"
00:27:26,00:27:27,and the one who drops it from there and loses.
00:27:27,00:27:29,"- But I think that is... - Because you might go, ""Ah!"""
00:27:29,00:27:30,"- And then it falls out. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:30,00:27:32,But I think there's a way of winning the fight.
00:27:32,00:27:36,"Never mind your legs, you just start eating the handkerchief, right?"
00:27:36,00:27:39,- I'm not like Lady and the Tramp. - Like Lady and the Tramp.
00:27:39,00:27:40,- Right. - And then...
00:27:40,00:27:43,"If you've got the handkerchief in your mouth, he's lost the fight."
00:27:43,00:27:45,- Yeah. - It depends how deep you want your opponent
00:27:45,00:27:47,to get inside your own mouth.
00:27:47,00:27:50,You might prefer to just be kicked in the shin.
00:27:50,00:27:53,- You're both naked. - You're already on pretty intimate terms.
00:27:53,00:27:56,"They weren't, the Lancashians were very into clogs, weren't they?"
00:27:56,00:27:58,- Yeah. - And they're clogged dancing.
00:27:58,00:28:00,They were very into that when they weren't fighting with them.
00:28:00,00:28:02,They were dancing with them.
00:28:02,00:28:05,And it seemed very specific from about 1880 to 1904 or '05.
00:28:05,00:28:09,And people speculate that the reason they got into clogged dancing
00:28:09,00:28:13,"was partly to warm up in the cold, industrial, northern towns."
00:28:13,00:28:15,"Which, I don't know, it's not that much colder."
00:28:15,00:28:19,"But, yeah, it was as popular as wrestling, boxing, clogged dancing."
00:28:19,00:28:21,- It was. - The three big draws.
00:28:21,00:28:25,There was a group called the J.W. Jackson's Clog Dancers.
00:28:25,00:28:26,And they're a group of young boys.
00:28:26,00:28:29,And they would wear football jerseys.
00:28:29,00:28:32,And they had clogs with buckles on and bits of metal.
00:28:32,00:28:35,"So that sometimes when you did your dance, they would do sparks."
00:28:35,00:28:38,And they actually tore the whole of the UK.
00:28:38,00:28:39,They were absolutely massive.
00:28:39,00:28:42,And one of the original guys dropped out in 1896.
00:28:42,00:28:45,And he was replaced by an eight-year-old called Charlie Chaplin.
00:28:45,00:28:47,- Oh. - Oh.
00:28:47,00:28:49,- The same. - The same?
00:28:49,00:28:51,"- No, completely the same. - Wow."
00:28:51,00:28:55,"- Very cool. - So was that his first job, basically?"
00:28:55,00:28:58,"- Eight years old, he'd been working for like eight years at that point."
00:28:58,00:29:04,"The clog itself, the full wooden one, the clump, the clumpen."
00:29:04,00:29:06,"- Clumpen, yeah. - It's really interesting reading about them"
00:29:06,00:29:10,because they're actually really safe shoes for you to wear.
00:29:10,00:29:13,"If you're doing hard labour, if you're building on a building side,"
00:29:13,00:29:16,"you're down in a coal mine or whatever, they're incredibly sturdy."
00:29:16,00:29:20,"But also, they're much better than, say, like a modern boot"
00:29:20,00:29:21,with a steel cap inside.
00:29:21,00:29:23,"Because if something drops on them,"
00:29:23,00:29:27,the metal of a boot can bend inward and crush your foot
00:29:27,00:29:28,and you get stuck in there.
00:29:28,00:29:31,"Whereas with this, it just kind of splits the shoe open."
00:29:31,00:29:33,So at least you're not sort of mangled within the shoe.
00:29:33,00:29:35,- Yeah. - I feel like the makers of steel-capped shoes
00:29:35,00:29:38,"might object to the, like, they're much safer."
00:29:38,00:29:41,"But this basically came out because the EU said in the '90s,"
00:29:41,00:29:42,clogs aren't safe.
00:29:42,00:29:46,"And a lot of people in the Netherlands still then traditionally,"
00:29:46,00:29:48,"and still sometimes now traditionally, wore clogs."
00:29:48,00:29:51,"So farmers, fishermen, factory workers, you know,"
00:29:51,00:29:55,there are lots of jobs where clogs would be the workman's boot of choice.
00:29:55,00:29:58,And the EU said these haven't been tested properly.
00:29:58,00:30:00,And so I'm afraid you're going to have to ditch the clogs
00:30:00,00:30:02,and wear steel-capped shoes.
00:30:02,00:30:06,And so the Netherlands organisation for Applied Scientific Research
00:30:06,00:30:09,ran a whole bunch of tests to prove that they were as safe.
00:30:09,00:30:12,So they got all these clogs in to the factory
00:30:12,00:30:15,and they bashed them with a mechanical hammer.
00:30:15,00:30:17,"They compared, they put one tonne weights on them"
00:30:17,00:30:21,to see how they survived so that it was like being run over by a car.
00:30:21,00:30:23,"They pierced the soles with nails, they submerged them in water,"
00:30:23,00:30:25,they baked them in ovens at 300 degrees.
00:30:25,00:30:27,- What? - Wow.
00:30:27,00:30:31,"I don't know in what circumstances, you're suddenly in a furnace."
00:30:31,00:30:33,"Like, if you're there, only your feet."
00:30:33,00:30:37,"We've got great news, the clogs have survived."
00:30:37,00:30:40,We managed to save his feet.
00:30:40,00:30:43,Here's the facts about Dutch wooden shoes.
00:30:43,00:30:47,"Apparently, there was a traditional Dutch marriage proposal"
00:30:47,00:30:51,"where if you fancied someone, you would buy a pair of very ornate clogs"
00:30:51,00:30:56,"and then you would secretly, at night, put them on the doorstep"
00:30:56,00:30:58,of the person you wanted to marry.
00:30:58,00:31:00,"Well, that'd be very hard to do, James."
00:31:00,00:31:02,"I mean, you'd need someone with special training at..."
00:31:02,00:31:04,LAUGHTER
00:31:04,00:31:06,..sneaking around in the dark.
00:31:06,00:31:10,Am I just trying to speak around in clogs?
00:31:10,00:31:12,"Clog, Ninjas."
00:31:12,00:31:15,I don't think you have to wear the clogs to eat before you deposit
00:31:15,00:31:20,because that's why the Dutch have no ninja skills whatsoever.
00:31:20,00:31:23,"Well, the idea was then you would return the next morning"
00:31:23,00:31:26,"and if your beloved was wearing the clogs,"
00:31:26,00:31:28,that meant she had accepted the proposal.
00:31:28,00:31:29,"Oh, my God!"
00:31:29,00:31:31,And then she would wear them till her wedding day.
00:31:31,00:31:32,"OK, question."
00:31:32,00:31:37,Does she... Have you left a note to say these are from me?
00:31:37,00:31:38,It's really interesting.
00:31:38,00:31:41,"Does she put them on and think, ""Yes, James has proposed!"""
00:31:41,00:31:43,And then... I fear that might have been it
00:31:43,00:31:46,"because as far as I can tell, there's no notes from the source"
00:31:46,00:31:47,that I read.
00:31:47,00:31:50,I assume you've let her know that that's going to happen
00:31:50,00:31:53,"or something because otherwise it's a bit of a shot in the dark,"
00:31:53,00:31:54,isn't it?
00:31:54,00:31:58,Or maybe everyone had those doorbell cans back in medieval...
00:31:58,00:31:59,..medalines.
00:31:59,00:32:01,LAUGHTER
00:32:01,00:32:03,We're going to have to move on very soon.
00:32:03,00:32:04,"Oh, righty."
00:32:04,00:32:05,Yeah.
00:32:05,00:32:07,"I noticed very recently, there's a new trend for..."
00:32:07,00:32:08,We're talking about animals wearing shoes.
00:32:08,00:32:11,There's a new trend for dogs wearing shoes.
00:32:11,00:32:12,I found the company...
00:32:12,00:32:14,"Well, to begin with, I got quite excited"
00:32:14,00:32:17,because Dolly Parton has started a new company for animals.
00:32:17,00:32:20,It's like a parol for animals called Doggy Parton.
00:32:20,00:32:23,And it's specifically for her dogs.
00:32:23,00:32:26,So you can get cowgirl hats for your dog.
00:32:26,00:32:30,You can get Dolly Parton-esque wigs for your dog.
00:32:30,00:32:33,"There's pink high heels, but it turns out it's a stuffed toy,"
00:32:33,00:32:34,so that doesn't count.
00:32:34,00:32:36,The dog's not in...
00:32:36,00:32:38,But then there's another company that's just started.
00:32:38,00:32:39,"I think it was last year called Riff Ruff,"
00:32:39,00:32:43,who has designed all these dog shoes for...
00:32:43,00:32:46,"And I think it was a pug in the website that I saw,"
00:32:46,00:32:48,"and they kind of look like they're wearing, like, Nike shoes"
00:32:48,00:32:50,"and Adidas, and they've made a hoodie as well,"
00:32:50,00:32:53,and it seems to be coming back in.
00:32:53,00:32:54,To what extent...
00:32:54,00:32:57,"I haven't seen, so far, dogs strutting the streets of Glasgow,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,"certainly, with their stilettos on."
00:32:59,00:33:02,"No, but if you use the offercode ""FISH"","
00:33:02,00:33:06,you can get 20% off your first dog shoe on Riff Ruff.
00:33:07,00:33:12,# #
00:33:12,00:33:15,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:33:15,00:33:17,and that is Anna.
00:33:17,00:33:20,My fact this week is that Einstein was so famous
00:33:20,00:33:23,"that women reportedly fainted in his presence,"
00:33:23,00:33:25,and a mob once broke down the door of a lecture hall
00:33:25,00:33:28,screening one of his films.
00:33:28,00:33:29,"Yeah, he made films."
00:33:29,00:33:34,"He was a big director, he was like Spielberg of his day."
00:33:34,00:33:36,He's not thinking of Robert Pattinson.
00:33:36,00:33:37,That's who I'm thinking of.
00:33:37,00:33:40,He was the Robert Pattinson of his day.
00:33:40,00:33:44,I had no idea that he was such a heartthrob
00:33:44,00:33:47,and just such a big celeb.
00:33:47,00:33:51,So this particular lecture screening incident
00:33:51,00:33:52,was quite a big deal.
00:33:52,00:33:55,"I think it was called, like, the New York Einstein riots"
00:33:55,00:33:58,"or something, but it was 1930,"
00:33:58,00:34:01,and the New York Amateur Astronomers Association
00:34:01,00:34:03,was doing a showing...
00:34:03,00:34:04,Einstein wasn't even coming.
00:34:04,00:34:06,They were just doing a showing of a film
00:34:06,00:34:08,explaining his theory of relativity.
00:34:08,00:34:12,"So, you know, stuff that Einstein's, you know, recently got into"
00:34:12,00:34:14,"and everyone sort of started reading about,"
00:34:14,00:34:17,"and they sent out 1,500 invitations to their members,"
00:34:17,00:34:21,"and 4,500 people turned up, and they mobbed the place,"
00:34:21,00:34:24,and the guards couldn't keep control of them.
00:34:24,00:34:26,They were sort of bashing into exhibits and stuff
00:34:26,00:34:28,"in the, you know, in the central hall."
00:34:28,00:34:30,"They had to call the police to try and calm them down,"
00:34:30,00:34:33,and they did break down the door to the lecture theatre
00:34:33,00:34:35,in order to see the movie.
00:34:35,00:34:36,- Right. - Wow.
00:34:36,00:34:38,"- What year was that, sorry? - 1930."
00:34:38,00:34:40,- 1930. - 'Cause he became quite big
00:34:40,00:34:42,"just after the First World War, didn't he?"
00:34:42,00:34:44,- Yeah. - And that was one of the reasons.
00:34:44,00:34:48,So he kind of made this prediction of where stars would be
00:34:48,00:34:51,"at a certain time due to his theory of relativity,"
00:34:51,00:34:53,"and there had been an eclipse,"
00:34:53,00:34:55,"and so because there was an eclipse there,"
00:34:55,00:34:57,they could measure these stars.
00:34:57,00:35:00,And the interesting thing was that the people who did the
00:35:00,00:35:02,"measurement were British,"
00:35:02,00:35:04,"and so it was kind of seeing this great moment,"
00:35:04,00:35:06,"so the war's finished, but we have the British scientists"
00:35:06,00:35:08,and the German scientists coming together
00:35:08,00:35:10,"and proving this new theory, and that is what the result is."
00:35:10,00:35:13,"- Eddington. Was it Eddington? - Yeah, exactly."
00:35:13,00:35:15,So that's kind of why he became so famous at the time.
00:35:15,00:35:16,- Right. - Yeah.
00:35:16,00:35:18,"He actually said, 'cause he, as you say,"
00:35:18,00:35:21,"it was the eclipse in, was it 1919?"
00:35:21,00:35:22,- Yeah. - Eclipse?
00:35:22,00:35:24,"Total eclipse, that sort of verified"
00:35:24,00:35:25,"his theory of general relativity,"
00:35:25,00:35:28,which was basically explaining a way
00:35:28,00:35:29,Newton's theory of gravity.
00:35:29,00:35:31,"So it was saying, actually, gravity is explained"
00:35:31,00:35:35,"by kind of a bends in the, you know, in space-time."
00:35:35,00:35:37,"I think a really good analogy I read was,"
00:35:37,00:35:40,"he explained that if you have a huge mass,"
00:35:40,00:35:42,then it bends space-time in the same way
00:35:42,00:35:44,"if you drop a heavy ball on a trampoline,"
00:35:44,00:35:46,"then it creates a dent in the trampoline,"
00:35:46,00:35:49,and that pulls other objects on the trampoline
00:35:49,00:35:52,"a bit towards it, and in the same way it bends space-time."
00:35:52,00:35:54,"But so it took the eclipse to prove this to everyone else,"
00:35:54,00:35:59,"but Einstein had his theory proved to himself in 1915,"
00:35:59,00:36:01,'cause he saw something in the orbit of Mercury
00:36:01,00:36:03,"that wasn't quite right, and the only way to explain it"
00:36:03,00:36:06,"was that his theory of general relativity was correct,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,and he said when he found that anomaly
00:36:08,00:36:10,"in the orbit of Mercury, he was so excited"
00:36:10,00:36:13,that he had heart palpitations and couldn't work for three days.
00:36:13,00:36:16,"- Yeah, wow. - Yeah."
00:36:16,00:36:18,The one in 1919 took a lot of people by surprise.
00:36:18,00:36:20,"They didn't realize it was gonna be so huge,"
00:36:20,00:36:23,and so the New York Times wanted to get someone
00:36:23,00:36:26,"to interview him or to, you know, go to his lectures,"
00:36:26,00:36:30,"but they didn't have anyone there who really understood it,"
00:36:30,00:36:32,"so they sent a guy called Henry Crouch,"
00:36:32,00:36:33,who was their golfing correspondent.
00:36:33,00:36:37,- Wow. - And Henry Crouch wasn't just...
00:36:37,00:36:39,Didn't just not know anything about physics.
00:36:39,00:36:41,"Because he didn't know anything about physics,"
00:36:41,00:36:43,"they wouldn't let him into the press conference,"
00:36:43,00:36:46,"but he still had to send something to the New York Times,"
00:36:46,00:36:49,"and so he sent them an article that was headlined,"
00:36:49,00:36:52,"""Stars, not where they seemed or calculated to be,"
00:36:52,00:36:54,"""but nobody need worry."""
00:36:54,00:36:57,- OK. - That's so good.
00:36:57,00:37:04,I read this theory that Einstein mania was actually a mistake.
00:37:04,00:37:08,"- OK. - So, he came to New York in 1921,"
00:37:08,00:37:11,and there was this huge crowd.
00:37:11,00:37:12,"It was so exciting, you know,"
00:37:12,00:37:15,there were thousands of people lining the streets waiting for him.
00:37:15,00:37:18,There's a really good theory that actually they weren't there for him at all.
00:37:18,00:37:19,- What? - I know.
00:37:19,00:37:21,"So, he visited. He was on someone else's trip."
00:37:21,00:37:24,There was a politician called Chaim Weitzman.
00:37:24,00:37:26,"He was a politician, and he was a poster child"
00:37:26,00:37:28,"for creating an Israel, basically."
00:37:28,00:37:29,"He was a Zionist politician,"
00:37:29,00:37:32,"and Einstein was the most famous Jewish person in the world,"
00:37:32,00:37:36,"and Einstein just sort of said, ""OK, I'll come along to be there."""
00:37:36,00:37:39,"So, when the ship docked, thousands of supporters came to cheer."
00:37:39,00:37:42,"They weren't cheering for Einstein, they were cheering for Weitzman,"
00:37:42,00:37:45,"and all the Yiddish newspapers reported,"
00:37:45,00:37:47,"""Oh, big crowd turned out for Weitzman, that's great."""
00:37:47,00:37:49,"But all the English newspapers just thought,"
00:37:49,00:37:54,"""Oh, Einstein, he's a crazy physicist, he plays the violin, he's so funny."""
00:37:54,00:37:57,"And they were all here for Einstein, and then it turned into mega-Einstein mania."
00:37:57,00:38:01,"- What did the banners say? Come on, surely they were waving posters?"
00:38:01,00:38:03,- What are they screaming? - Yeah.
00:38:03,00:38:07,"- Because he was undeniably huge in America. - He was also famous, in fact."
00:38:07,00:38:10,There was this rumour that women fainted in his presence.
00:38:10,00:38:13,"He was mobbed wherever he went, he'd land in airports,"
00:38:13,00:38:16,"and the London Palladium, after he'd been to New York"
00:38:16,00:38:17,"and they'd seen this huge reception,"
00:38:17,00:38:21,"the London Palladium asked him to do a three-week-long one-man show,"
00:38:21,00:38:24,which he'd turned down the idiot.
00:38:24,00:38:28,"- Well, we did a one-day-long four-man show. - Yeah?"
00:38:28,00:38:33,"Yeah, we're one-twenty-first of an Einstein between us."
00:38:33,00:38:36,"I think about him as well, is that he really intimidated people."
00:38:36,00:38:38,"You know, if you were in the presence of Einstein..."
00:38:38,00:38:39,- It's... - How?
00:38:39,00:38:42,"Well, it's kind of... Actually, I kind of remember the very first time"
00:38:42,00:38:44,when I started QI and met Stephen Fry.
00:38:44,00:38:48,"I genuinely felt intimidated that I was meeting someone of great intellect,"
00:38:48,00:38:49,that I just said stupid things the whole time.
00:38:49,00:38:52,"But he also intimidates people for fun, with a knuckle duster."
00:38:52,00:38:54,"Yeah, I mean, that was a bit weird, yeah."
00:38:54,00:38:57,"And his real accent as well, ""All right, mate, how's it going?"""
00:38:57,00:39:01,"I didn't... That was a shock, I gotta say."
00:39:01,00:39:02,Um...
00:39:02,00:39:05,"Anyway, my legs are not broken anymore."
00:39:05,00:39:06,"Oh, man."
00:39:06,00:39:09,But I remember seeing him going at you with those clogs.
00:39:09,00:39:11,"- It was something... - Oh, my God."
00:39:11,00:39:13,That's going to suffice!
00:39:13,00:39:15,(LAUGHTER)
00:39:15,00:39:19,"But so, there was a story, and this was published in The New York Times,"
00:39:19,00:39:22,"that when he was ill in 1928, there was a New York physician"
00:39:22,00:39:25,who attended to him while he was in Germany.
00:39:25,00:39:28,And the physician used to tell him anecdotes.
00:39:28,00:39:31,"Like, he had just anecdote after anecdote after anecdote."
00:39:31,00:39:33,And everyone thought that he was doing this
00:39:33,00:39:35,because he was just wanting to make Einstein cheerful.
00:39:35,00:39:36,"But he said, ""Not at all."""
00:39:36,00:39:40,He memorized 150 anecdotes
00:39:40,00:39:43,because he was so worried of Einstein asking him any questions
00:39:43,00:39:46,and the ignorance of his answers coming out
00:39:46,00:39:48,"that he quickly diverted everything into,"
00:39:48,00:39:51,"""Oh, did you hear the one about the time when the person did that?"""
00:39:51,00:39:53,And he had 150 of them at the ready...
00:39:53,00:39:55,- That's amazing. - ...so that he would never run out.
00:39:55,00:39:56,"I want to see his one-man show, to be honest."
00:39:56,00:39:59,- That would be good. - That's very...
00:39:59,00:40:01,He was a real player.
00:40:01,00:40:03,- Um... Or... - Yeah?
00:40:03,00:40:07,"Or tart, um, depending on which way you look at it."
00:40:07,00:40:08,- Wow. - Um...
00:40:08,00:40:11,"From the age of about 15, he was kind of had various girlfriends,"
00:40:11,00:40:15,"and he ended up age 17, um, in love with this..."
00:40:15,00:40:19,"other fellow physicist, the only female physicist studying where he was studying,"
00:40:19,00:40:20,Milaver Marich.
00:40:20,00:40:23,"And they did love each other, I think, and he actually did get her pregnant."
00:40:23,00:40:26,But we have no idea what happened to that child.
00:40:26,00:40:29,"Liesl, we have no idea because she..."
00:40:29,00:40:31,They couldn't marry because he didn't have a job yet.
00:40:31,00:40:33,"She went away, child disappeared."
00:40:33,00:40:35,"But anyway, he didn't stick with her for that long."
00:40:35,00:40:38,He fell in love with someone else while he was married to Milaver.
00:40:38,00:40:41,He fell in love with Elsa.
00:40:41,00:40:43,"But then I think, as he was in love with Elsa,"
00:40:43,00:40:46,"he also fell in love with her daughter, Elsa."
00:40:46,00:40:48,- Sorry? - Elsa and Elsa.
00:40:48,00:40:49,"- Wait, hang on. - Elsa and Elsa."
00:40:49,00:40:50,- Elsa... - Yeah.
00:40:50,00:40:53,- Elsa was his first cousin. - Yeah.
00:40:53,00:40:57,"But also, on the other side of her family, she was his second cousin."
00:40:57,00:40:58,- Yeah. - Ah.
00:40:58,00:41:00,Is it possible Elsa and Elsa were the same woman?
00:41:00,00:41:01,"- No, it was definitely Elsa's daughter. - OK, OK, OK."
00:41:01,00:41:04,"- Because they talked about it, because eventually... - This is why he was into relativity."
00:41:04,00:41:08,"- Oh, God! - LAUGHTER"
00:41:08,00:41:09,Good.
00:41:13,00:41:15,- Very nice. - Um...
00:41:15,00:41:19,"No, definitely two different people, because he basically said to them,"
00:41:19,00:41:20,"""I really want to marry you both."""
00:41:20,00:41:23,"And, ""Do you want to choose which one I marry?"""
00:41:23,00:41:26,"And sort of proposed to the daughter, and the daughter eventually said,"
00:41:26,00:41:28,"""I actually think of you as more like a father."""
00:41:28,00:41:31,"Um, and so, John and Mary, my mum instead."
00:41:31,00:41:33,"- And so, he did. - What?"
00:41:33,00:41:38,And that was just the kind of free-love situation he ended up in.
00:41:38,00:41:42,We mentioned ages ago on the podcast that his adopted granddaughter
00:41:42,00:41:46,was someone who actually believed that she was the love child
00:41:46,00:41:49,and was actually the daughter of Albert Einstein.
00:41:49,00:41:52,"And she went to her grave believing this and pushing this,"
00:41:52,00:41:55,"because she had people write to her, various people who knew Einstein."
00:41:55,00:41:59,"She didn't even really meet him, I think possibly she only met him once."
00:41:59,00:42:01,- Yeah. - He didn't know some of his grandchildren.
00:42:01,00:42:05,Einstein once gave his grandson Cesar a three-hour lecture
00:42:05,00:42:08,on the mathematical properties of soap bubbles.
00:42:08,00:42:11,"Despite the fact that at the time, Cesar was eight years old."
00:42:11,00:42:14,- Right. - He took him out on a boat trip
00:42:14,00:42:17,and would not stop talking about soap bubbles for three hours.
00:42:17,00:42:19,"- They are quite interesting, though, aren't they? - They're quite interesting, yeah."
00:42:19,00:42:23,"And eight years... I mean, Charlie Chaplin was club-dancing at eight years old."
00:42:23,00:42:26,"- You know, he can listen to a three-hour lecture. - Yeah, yeah."
00:42:26,00:42:29,"And some maybe other famous people, like, um,"
00:42:29,00:42:33,"Jean-Jacques Rousseau, very famous, uh, in his time."
00:42:33,00:42:37,"Uh, and because he was so famous, he became really, really paranoid."
00:42:37,00:42:40,"And at one stage, he thought that everyone was sending him"
00:42:40,00:42:44,"these, um, fan art, and they were so bad"
00:42:44,00:42:46,that he thought there was a conspiracy happened
00:42:46,00:42:50,that people were mocking him with their terrible pictures.
00:42:50,00:42:52,"Wow, I didn't think fan art existed like that at the time."
00:42:52,00:42:56,It did. People made drawings of him and paintings of him.
00:42:56,00:42:59,"- Wow. - Uh, and he once had a visit from a couple of friends"
00:42:59,00:43:02,"called, uh, Monsieur Madame Brett."
00:43:02,00:43:05,"Uh, and he found out that Madame Brett had an engraving of him"
00:43:05,00:43:09,"that she kept above her mantelpiece, and she really loved it."
00:43:09,00:43:11,And he completely fell out with her
00:43:11,00:43:14,because he thought this was such a bad bit of fan art
00:43:14,00:43:16,that he didn't want to be friends with anyone
00:43:16,00:43:17,who could even look at it.
00:43:17,00:43:19,- Wow. - Wow.
00:43:19,00:43:20,- That's a high friend bar. - That's amazing.
00:43:20,00:43:22,"I mean, I've been to all of your houses,"
00:43:22,00:43:24,"and I don't think much of the art on your walls, but I don't."
00:43:24,00:43:28,"- Well, I've got a massive painting of you over my fireplace, Anna."
00:43:28,00:43:30,"I can't believe you. - Yeah, and I take it as a parody of me,"
00:43:30,00:43:32,and I'm mostly offended.
00:43:32,00:43:34,"Um, I'm gonna have to wrap us up in a sec."
00:43:34,00:43:36,"I've got, uh, just a quick thing."
00:43:36,00:43:39,"James, you mentioned earlier, Robert Pattinson."
00:43:39,00:43:41,"- Oh, yeah. - Which you provided me."
00:43:41,00:43:43,"There's a story, and, you know, these celebrity stories,"
00:43:43,00:43:46,"God knows if they're true, but, um, he obviously has a lot of fans."
00:43:46,00:43:48,He was in Twilight. He's the new Batman.
00:43:48,00:43:50,"Um, and he had a stalker as well,"
00:43:50,00:43:53,"and he actually kind of hit it head-on,"
00:43:53,00:43:55,and he took the stalker to dinner.
00:43:55,00:44:00,"Um, but at the dinner, he complained about his life so much"
00:44:00,00:44:04,that she got really bored and quit stalking him.
00:44:04,00:44:10,"- That's such a good idea. - That's how you deal with it, yeah."
00:44:10,00:44:18,"- Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts."
00:44:18,00:44:19,Thank you so much for listening.
