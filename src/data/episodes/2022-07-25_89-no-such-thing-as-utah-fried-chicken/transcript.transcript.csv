00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:05,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:05,00:00:14,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:14,00:00:17,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:17,00:00:19,this week coming to you from Cambridge.
00:00:19,00:00:21,My name is Dan Treiber and please welcome
00:00:21,00:00:23,"to the stage, it's the regular elves,"
00:00:23,00:00:26,"Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski, and James Harkin."
00:00:26,00:00:29,(audience cheering)
00:00:29,00:00:31,(audience applauding)
00:00:31,00:00:34,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:34,00:00:37,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:37,00:00:39,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:39,00:00:42,"Starting with you, Andy Murray."
00:00:42,00:00:46,"- My fact this week is that before trains had corridors,"
00:00:46,00:00:49,guards had to climb along the outside of the carriage
00:00:49,00:00:50,to check your ticket.
00:00:50,00:00:53,(audience laughing)
00:00:53,00:00:54,That is so amazing.
00:00:54,00:00:56,- And they did it while the train was moving.
00:00:56,00:00:59,"- And this was a thing, this happened."
00:00:59,00:01:02,"Carriages used to not be, you couldn't go through a carriage."
00:01:02,00:01:04,"You would get in at one end, they closed the door,"
00:01:04,00:01:07,"they'd lock it, you were locked in for the whole journey,"
00:01:07,00:01:09,"then at the other end they'd unlock it, and that you'd get."
00:01:09,00:01:10,"And it was just across the train,"
00:01:10,00:01:12,instead of front to back through the train.
00:01:12,00:01:15,- Well you locked in for health and safety reasons.
00:01:15,00:01:17,- I think partly you were locked in
00:01:17,00:01:19,so you wouldn't try and sneak into first class.
00:01:19,00:01:20,"- Wow, yeah."
00:01:20,00:01:21,- I don't think they were that bothered about
00:01:21,00:01:23,"health and safety, if you have a guy climbing"
00:01:23,00:01:24,on the outside of the carriage.
00:01:24,00:01:27,"- Indeed, that's where it seems to fall down."
00:01:27,00:01:29,"How did it get, was there a ledge?"
00:01:29,00:01:31,"- There was a little, they call it a running board."
00:01:31,00:01:33,So just on the outside of the carriage
00:01:33,00:01:35,"at the bus, there's a little plate that you could climb on."
00:01:35,00:01:37,"But it wasn't even a continuous running board,"
00:01:37,00:01:39,"it was intermittent, so you had to climb along"
00:01:39,00:01:41,"between the beds, and the people did suggest,"
00:01:41,00:01:43,why don't we give people a continuous running board?
00:01:43,00:01:44,"And the train company said,"
00:01:44,00:01:47,"""No, no, passengers will use them to sneak into first class."""
00:01:47,00:01:50,(audience laughing)
00:01:50,00:01:52,- How good was first class?
00:01:52,00:01:55,"- It was, it was awful, 'cause it was 1840."
00:01:55,00:01:58,"- Oh yeah, these people's are desperate."
00:01:58,00:02:00,- I bet in those days you just had to always
00:02:00,00:02:03,"know where your ticket was, 'cause if you were stuck"
00:02:03,00:02:05,"there going, ""Oh, where is it in this guy's outside going?"
00:02:05,00:02:07,"""Find the ticket!"""
00:02:07,00:02:09,There is a tunnel coming.
00:02:09,00:02:11,(audience laughing)
00:02:11,00:02:13,- How fast did the trains used to go?
00:02:13,00:02:15,"- Well, these were really early ones, so maybe,"
00:02:15,00:02:18,"I mean, about 40 miles an hour comfortably."
00:02:18,00:02:20,"- People thought that if they went over a certain speed,"
00:02:20,00:02:23,"then your body wouldn't be able to deal with it, didn't they?"
00:02:23,00:02:26,"- Yeah, they said that the human body would not be able"
00:02:26,00:02:28,to endure speeds of 25 miles per hour.
00:02:28,00:02:30,Someone said that to start off with.
00:02:30,00:02:33,And then someone else in America wrote that if a woman's body
00:02:33,00:02:35,"accelerated past 50 miles an hour,"
00:02:35,00:02:38,then her uterus would go shooting out of her body.
00:02:38,00:02:41,(audience laughing)
00:02:41,00:02:43,- And that's the plot of speed three.
00:02:43,00:02:46,(audience laughing)
00:02:46,00:02:47,- You'll never look as tangible
00:02:47,00:02:48,like the same way again.
00:02:50,00:02:53,"- When trains first got to the Isle of White,"
00:02:53,00:02:55,"well, they were taken to the Isle of White, obviously."
00:02:55,00:02:58,(audience laughing)
00:02:58,00:03:01,"Wasn't a rogue train, which went off the rails."
00:03:01,00:03:03,(audience laughing)
00:03:03,00:03:06,"- So the first ever journey, it was a four mile track"
00:03:06,00:03:08,and it went along its route in less than 10 minutes.
00:03:08,00:03:11,"And I think that's, I've worked it out about 30 miles an hour,"
00:03:11,00:03:13,"give or take, we're not sure exactly at the time."
00:03:13,00:03:16,But that was apparently faster than anyone had ever traveled
00:03:16,00:03:19,on the Isle of White until that point in history.
00:03:19,00:03:20,- That's pretty cool.
00:03:20,00:03:23,"I was reading about in the 1800s, 1827,"
00:03:23,00:03:27,there was a race between a train and a horse.
00:03:27,00:03:30,"But, and check it out, this is a bit unfair on the horse's side."
00:03:30,00:03:31,The horse was towing a train.
00:03:31,00:03:34,(audience laughing)
00:03:34,00:03:35,- It was unfair.
00:03:35,00:03:37,(audience laughing)
00:03:37,00:03:40,- It was back in the day when horses used to pull trains
00:03:40,00:03:41,prior to the engine.
00:03:41,00:03:43,And so this was an example of showing
00:03:43,00:03:47,that potentially an engine could beat a horse.
00:03:47,00:03:49,"And it probably would have, but one of the wheels"
00:03:49,00:03:51,or a little band around the wheels burst.
00:03:51,00:03:52,And so they had to stop the train.
00:03:52,00:03:54,So it wasn't the lead and then the horse took over.
00:03:54,00:03:56,"But there was an actual, let's have this as a big race,"
00:03:56,00:03:58,horse versus train.
00:03:58,00:04:00,- So things were always going wrong.
00:04:00,00:04:03,"So at the 1829 display of, you know,"
00:04:03,00:04:05,"which train is the best train,"
00:04:05,00:04:08,10 different types of train entered this competition.
00:04:08,00:04:10,Five of them didn't even show up on the day.
00:04:10,00:04:14,So I think broke down before they made it to the venue.
00:04:14,00:04:15,So five trains entered.
00:04:15,00:04:17,Stevenson's rocket being one of them.
00:04:17,00:04:19,And only one of them completed the trial.
00:04:19,00:04:21,So Stevenson's rocket didn't win because it was the best.
00:04:21,00:04:23,It won because it was the only train
00:04:23,00:04:24,that managed to not break.
00:04:24,00:04:27,"Or so the cycloped, do you remember the cycloped train,"
00:04:27,00:04:28,which was one of the--
00:04:28,00:04:30,- I remember it personally.
00:04:30,00:04:31,"- I mean, I know I'm old."
00:04:31,00:04:32,"- I didn't think of you, but."
00:04:32,00:04:35,- I did look at you directly there for a reason.
00:04:35,00:04:37,"- The cycloped train sounds like a quite a cool design,"
00:04:37,00:04:40,"which is a, it's led by a horse,"
00:04:40,00:04:41,but it's a horse on a treadmill.
00:04:41,00:04:43,"And the horse, the treadmill that the horse is walking"
00:04:43,00:04:44,on powers the train.
00:04:44,00:04:45,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:04:45,00:04:47,"- Yeah, so really cool."
00:04:47,00:04:49,"But the horse, the demonstrations,"
00:04:49,00:04:51,the horse fell through the floor of the train.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"And so that failed, obviously."
00:04:54,00:04:56,- I once fell on a treadmill.
00:04:56,00:04:57,(laughing)
00:04:57,00:04:58,Anyone want to hear that?
00:04:58,00:04:59,No.
00:04:59,00:05:00,Really?
00:05:00,00:05:01,"Oh, okay, I was a kid."
00:05:01,00:05:02,It was my first time on a treadmill.
00:05:02,00:05:05,So one of the ones that you put the actual is electric
00:05:05,00:05:06,and it was going like crazy.
00:05:06,00:05:09,I put it up to 10 and I thought this is going to be incredible.
00:05:09,00:05:11,"And I tested with my hands on the side,"
00:05:11,00:05:12,whether I could run on it.
00:05:12,00:05:13,"And I thought, yeah, that's easy."
00:05:13,00:05:16,"So, with one jump, I just jumped onto it"
00:05:16,00:05:18,"and immediately my two legs went,"
00:05:18,00:05:18,"""Whoop!"""
00:05:18,00:05:20,And I fell on my face on it.
00:05:20,00:05:22,"I got shot off the back, but it was on a carpet."
00:05:22,00:05:25,And so everything went right off it except for my face.
00:05:25,00:05:26,"And for about half a minute,"
00:05:26,00:05:29,"I was going, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb."
00:05:29,00:05:31,That explains an awful lot.
00:05:31,00:05:32,(laughing)
00:05:32,00:05:35,"- It does also explain why I didn't get into, ""Okay, go."""
00:05:35,00:05:37,(laughing)
00:05:37,00:05:41,- Do you guys know about the city of crush in Texas?
00:05:41,00:05:44,"- No, it was from an extremely brief period,"
00:05:44,00:05:46,the second largest city in Texas.
00:05:46,00:05:47,This was in 1896.
00:05:47,00:05:50,"And that was because 40,000 people came to it."
00:05:50,00:05:54,And that was because someone had decided to stage
00:05:54,00:05:56,a train crash.
00:05:56,00:05:59,"So this was 40,000 people went to,"
00:05:59,00:06:03,it was organized by this guy called William Krush.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"And he said, I guess we're going to say, yeah."
00:06:06,00:06:09,He said he was going to just fire two trains towards each other.
00:06:09,00:06:12,So he had like four miles of track created for the purpose.
00:06:12,00:06:13,"And 40,000 people came."
00:06:13,00:06:15,And there was such demand that people did have to sit
00:06:15,00:06:17,on top of trains in order to get there
00:06:17,00:06:19,'cause they couldn't squeeze into the carriages.
00:06:19,00:06:23,"And then at 5 p.m., these two trains started going towards"
00:06:23,00:06:25,"each other, picking up speed, picking up speed."
00:06:25,00:06:28,And Krush stood right in the middle of the railway
00:06:28,00:06:30,"on a white horse and then he waved a big flag,"
00:06:30,00:06:31,saying they're coming.
00:06:31,00:06:32,"It's all right, he survived."
00:06:32,00:06:33,"- Oh, thank God."
00:06:33,00:06:33,(laughing)
00:06:33,00:06:35,- He stepped out of the way sort of at the last minute.
00:06:35,00:06:37,The two trains crashed into each other.
00:06:37,00:06:40,Both of their boilers exploded and a bunch of people died.
00:06:40,00:06:45,"- So when he said it's all right, it wasn't completely all right."
00:06:45,00:06:46,"- Well, here's the thing."
00:06:46,00:06:49,Krush got fired that evening and then the company
00:06:49,00:06:51,"that he worked for, Relented and Hired him again,"
00:06:51,00:06:52,"the next day, the rail company."
00:06:52,00:06:54,And he worked at the same rail company
00:06:54,00:06:55,for the rest of his life.
00:06:55,00:06:56,- What?
00:06:56,00:06:57,- We're going to need to move on
00:06:57,00:06:58,"to the next fact soon, ish."
00:06:58,00:07:01,"- Okay, so there's a guy called Andrew Dowd."
00:07:01,00:07:03,"He's from Wiggin, up in my neck of the woods."
00:07:03,00:07:08,"And he visited all 2,548 railway stations in Britain"
00:07:08,00:07:12,between 2010 and 2014 in his car.
00:07:12,00:07:14,(laughing)
00:07:14,00:07:17,- Need we ask why?
00:07:17,00:07:21,"- Well, people asked him that in the newspaper articles,"
00:07:21,00:07:23,but he didn't really kind of have a very good reason.
00:07:23,00:07:26,"He said, I started doing it round near where I lived"
00:07:26,00:07:27,and I kind of enjoyed it.
00:07:27,00:07:28,So I thought I'd do the whole country.
00:07:28,00:07:31,"And they said to him, asked him what he did."
00:07:31,00:07:34,"And he said, I take a little look around if it's interesting,"
00:07:34,00:07:36,"but most out, very interesting."
00:07:36,00:07:38,(laughing)
00:07:38,00:07:39,- Wow.
00:07:39,00:07:40,- Why not?
00:07:40,00:07:41,- Yeah.
00:07:41,00:07:42,- I like to think there's an equivalent train driver
00:07:42,00:07:44,who's planning to visit all the petrol stations
00:07:44,00:07:46,in Britain on the train.
00:07:46,00:07:48,(laughing)
00:07:48,00:07:50,- Wouldn't it be visiting all the car parking spaces?
00:07:50,00:07:52,"- Yeah, right, there was a bad analogy."
00:07:52,00:07:53,"Yeah, that's better."
00:07:53,00:07:55,"- No, it was harder to visit all the car parking spaces"
00:07:55,00:07:57,'cause there are so many these days.
00:07:57,00:07:58,(laughing)
00:07:58,00:07:59,Anyway.
00:07:59,00:08:00,(laughing)
00:08:00,00:08:04,"- Okay, time for fact number two."
00:08:04,00:08:06,(laughing)
00:08:06,00:08:08,And that is James Harkin.
00:08:08,00:08:13,"- Okay, my fact this week is that Ernest Shackleton's"
00:08:13,00:08:16,"dog's names included slippery sloppers,"
00:08:16,00:08:20,"satin, painful, swanker, bummer, and bob."
00:08:20,00:08:23,(laughing)
00:08:23,00:08:25,"It's swankish over, he's the wanker."
00:08:25,00:08:26,(laughing)
00:08:26,00:08:27,Do you know the history?
00:08:27,00:08:29,"- Well, they all had different names for different reasons."
00:08:29,00:08:32,I got this fact actually from a guy on Twitter called
00:08:32,00:08:35,"@davepain164, and it made me laugh,"
00:08:35,00:08:37,"and so I thought I'd use it on the podcast,"
00:08:37,00:08:39,"and it kind of fits in with one thing that I like,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,which is just going through lists of ridiculous data
00:08:41,00:08:43,and trying to find funny bits or whatever.
00:08:43,00:08:46,But they got the names for lots of different reasons.
00:08:46,00:08:49,Some of them were nicknames that are people on the ship.
00:08:49,00:08:51,"So it could have been short for he's a wanker, I guess."
00:08:51,00:08:53,It's possible.
00:08:53,00:08:56,The dogs all came from Canada and they had names already.
00:08:56,00:08:58,"So some of them like Bob was already a name,"
00:08:58,00:08:59,and they just kept that.
00:08:59,00:09:02,"So some of them were changed like Bismarck, Napoleon,"
00:09:02,00:09:05,and three dogs all named Carlos.
00:09:05,00:09:06,(laughing)
00:09:06,00:09:07,They had to change all of those.
00:09:07,00:09:08,(laughing)
00:09:08,00:09:10,- What a great name for a dog.
00:09:10,00:09:11,(laughing)
00:09:11,00:09:14,"- What's the, in just like a basic two sentences"
00:09:14,00:09:17,"or a few more, Shackleton, just the background of Shackleton?"
00:09:17,00:09:18,- Polar Explorer.
00:09:18,00:09:21,"Went down to try and get to the South Pole, didn't quite make it."
00:09:21,00:09:25,Became the furthest South of that anyone had ever got.
00:09:25,00:09:27,"Abinson beat him to the South Pole,"
00:09:27,00:09:29,and so he went on another expedition
00:09:29,00:09:31,to go across the whole of the South Pole from one side
00:09:31,00:09:34,"to the other, and then ended in disaster again."
00:09:34,00:09:36,And he became famous for a big sort of escape
00:09:36,00:09:40,from the ice-filled islands of Elephant's Island.
00:09:40,00:09:41,- Okay.
00:09:41,00:09:43,- And now you don't need to watch the 12-part documentary
00:09:43,00:09:44,(laughing)
00:09:44,00:09:45,Shackleton.
00:09:45,00:09:47,I like this.
00:09:47,00:09:49,So there were a bunch of quite interesting people
00:09:49,00:09:51,on board the expedition.
00:09:51,00:09:55,"So they had like official photographer, Frank Hurley,"
00:09:55,00:09:58,who used to like risk his life trying to get good photos
00:09:58,00:10:01,because his only priority on this life-and-daging expedition
00:10:01,00:10:03,was to make sure he could make money when he saw the pictures
00:10:03,00:10:05,when he got back so he'd climb right to the top of the mast
00:10:05,00:10:08,or go out onto the yard arm and hang from it to take good photos.
00:10:08,00:10:12,And they also had an on-ship artist.
00:10:12,00:10:13,"And I just like this quote,"
00:10:13,00:10:15,I kind of remember where I read this in an account
00:10:15,00:10:17,of when they were stranded on Elephant Island.
00:10:17,00:10:19,"So they were sort of like, we're definitely going to die now."
00:10:19,00:10:20,No one's going to find us here.
00:10:20,00:10:22,How on earth are we going to survive?
00:10:22,00:10:24,"And at one point, it was said this ship's artist,"
00:10:24,00:10:27,"George Marston, allowed his remaining oil paints"
00:10:27,00:10:31,to be used as glue to make the canvases cover the shelter properly.
00:10:31,00:10:34,And I like the idea that there was a little bit of a debate there.
00:10:34,00:10:36,I have more facts about the dogs.
00:10:36,00:10:36,I do want.
00:10:36,00:10:38,So they were trapped on the ice for months and months and months.
00:10:38,00:10:42,"I think 15 months, maybe, and an amazing amount of time."
00:10:42,00:10:44,So Frank Hurley wrote loads of notes about all the dogs.
00:10:44,00:10:48,"And there was Shakespeare, a steamer, Wallaby Satan,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,who was a treacherous brute.
00:10:50,00:10:52,Sue is a flirt.
00:10:52,00:10:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:55,00:10:58,"They've been on the ice for a long time, haven't they?"
00:10:58,00:10:59,Bummer.
00:10:59,00:11:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:02,00:11:03,And then there was Snapper.
00:11:03,00:11:04,It does not snap at all.
00:11:04,00:11:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:06,00:11:08,And they built the dogs a town.
00:11:08,00:11:09,They built a little town.
00:11:09,00:11:10,They called Dog Town.
00:11:10,00:11:14,They built a lot of dog igloos out of ice and wood.
00:11:14,00:11:17,And they built a pup-loo for the puppies that have been born.
00:11:17,00:11:20,And they built a pig-loo because they had some pigs with them as well.
00:11:20,00:11:20,A pig-loo.
00:11:20,00:11:21,"Yeah, that's great, isn't it?"
00:11:21,00:11:22,It's pretty cool.
00:11:22,00:11:25,But they ate a lot of these animals.
00:11:25,00:11:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:26,00:11:28,And they had a ship's cat as well.
00:11:28,00:11:29,They did.
00:11:29,00:11:30,The ship's cat was called Mr. Chippy.
00:11:30,00:11:32,Mrs. Chippy?
00:11:32,00:11:33,"Yes, Mrs. Chippy."
00:11:33,00:11:34,It was always a male.
00:11:34,00:11:35,Yeah.
00:11:35,00:11:38,"And it belonged to the cruise carpenter, Harry McNiss."
00:11:38,00:11:42,And they decided to kill it because it was using up a lot of the meat.
00:11:42,00:11:44,But Harry McNiss was not very happy about that at all
00:11:44,00:11:47,"and got into a massive fight with Shackleton, didn't he?"
00:11:47,00:11:48,Yeah.
00:11:48,00:11:49,"He was Scottish, wasn't he?"
00:11:49,00:11:49,"Yeah, that's right."
00:11:49,00:11:50,Harry McNiss.
00:11:50,00:11:53,And someone who met him said the only thing I ever heard him talk about
00:11:53,00:11:56,"was the fact that Shackleton killed his cat, which, you know,"
00:11:56,00:11:59,"they were in a difficult spot, I think."
00:11:59,00:12:01,But he then really got furious.
00:12:01,00:12:03,"And he and Shackleton, as you say, had a huge route."
00:12:03,00:12:05,And he was the only one of the expedition.
00:12:05,00:12:07,I think all 28 men survived.
00:12:07,00:12:09,There was a separate supply mission where a few of them end up.
00:12:09,00:12:11,But all of the men with Shackleton survived.
00:12:11,00:12:12,It was this huge survival story.
00:12:12,00:12:16,He was the only one later denied this polar medal
00:12:16,00:12:18,that all the others got for insubordination.
00:12:18,00:12:19,Wow.
00:12:19,00:12:21,You know that Shackleton's medals went up for sale
00:12:21,00:12:23,in auction not too long ago.
00:12:23,00:12:25,And they got a ridiculous amount of money.
00:12:25,00:12:27,"It was about 800,000 pounds."
00:12:27,00:12:29,And I started looking into the kind of stuff
00:12:29,00:12:32,that gets auctioned off from those trips.
00:12:32,00:12:35,Discovered that-- this is quite recent--
00:12:35,00:12:37,one of the biscuits that they didn't eat
00:12:37,00:12:42,"went up for auction recently and was bought for 1,250 euros."
00:12:42,00:12:43,I definitely would have bought that.
00:12:43,00:12:44,That's so cheap.
00:12:44,00:12:46,"A biscuit from a Shackleton, isn't it?"
00:12:46,00:12:51,They ate the dogs before eating that biscuit.
00:12:51,00:12:53,"No, because probably someone went when we bring this back,"
00:12:53,00:12:55,this biscuit will be worth a fortune.
00:12:55,00:12:58,"No, but so apparently Shackleton was giving"
00:12:58,00:13:00,one of his fellow explorers Frank wild a biscuit
00:13:00,00:13:02,from one of the rations.
00:13:02,00:13:04,And while recorded in the diary--
00:13:04,00:13:06,and this is how spare food was back then--
00:13:06,00:13:09,thousands of pounds would not have bought that biscuit.
00:13:09,00:13:10,So that's how great it was.
00:13:10,00:13:12,And so it's quite nice that now it has gone
00:13:12,00:13:14,"for over 1,000 pounds."
00:13:14,00:13:18,"I love-- so I read also as well recently in an auction,"
00:13:18,00:13:21,"the head of the scouts, Robert Baden-Powell,"
00:13:21,00:13:23,a letter that he wrote to an autograph hunter saying
00:13:23,00:13:25,"you should not become an autograph hunter,"
00:13:25,00:13:29,recently sold at an auction to an autograph hunter.
00:13:29,00:13:32,It's great when auctions have that little twist on them.
00:13:32,00:13:33,There was another biscuit.
00:13:33,00:13:36,Do you want to hear about the world's most expensive biscuit?
00:13:36,00:13:37,Yeah.
00:13:37,00:13:39,Do you just happen to have a biscuit factor?
00:13:39,00:13:41,"Well, I've also saw the thing about the Shackleton biscuit."
00:13:41,00:13:45,"All right, and then I thought, what's the most a biscuit's ever gone for?"
00:13:45,00:13:48,"So a few weeks ago, it happened in October this year."
00:13:48,00:13:50,A biscuit from the Titanic was auctioned.
00:13:50,00:13:51,What?
00:13:51,00:13:52,Yeah.
00:13:52,00:13:53,"It's old for 15,000 pounds."
00:13:53,00:13:54,"Wait, how?"
00:13:54,00:13:59,How did a biscuit survive had made its way into a lifeboat?
00:13:59,00:14:05,"Sorry, I mean, it was in a box and someone took the box"
00:14:05,00:14:06,and when they escaped the ship on a line.
00:14:06,00:14:08,And it was in a sealed iron box or something.
00:14:08,00:14:11,And that was one of the lifeboats which was picked up.
00:14:11,00:14:14,"So yeah, so that's the most expensive biscuit ever so far."
00:14:14,00:14:19,"Yeah, I don't want to rule out any future biscuits to go for more."
00:14:19,00:14:26,I had a look for some unusual dog names and there was a website called petinsurance.com
00:14:26,00:14:29,that collected a load of unusual dog names.
00:14:29,00:14:34,"But at the same time, by coincidence, I also found a list of the most unusual nicknames"
00:14:34,00:14:38,that men have for their genitals.
00:14:38,00:14:39,Are we going to play dog or genitals?
00:14:39,00:14:46,"OK, I'll just read them in the order I have them."
00:14:46,00:14:48,Baron von Ferry Pants.
00:14:48,00:14:50,Oh!
00:14:50,00:14:51,Dog.
00:14:51,00:14:52,Correct.
00:14:52,00:14:53,Ah!
00:14:53,00:14:55,Lord Chubby Pruneface.
00:14:55,00:14:56,Genital.
00:14:56,00:14:57,Genital.
00:14:57,00:15:00,"No, that's a dog as well."
00:15:00,00:15:01,"Oh, no."
00:15:01,00:15:03,Simon Wiggles Patello.
00:15:03,00:15:05,Simon Wiggles Patello.
00:15:05,00:15:07,Simon Wiggles Patello.
00:15:07,00:15:08,Genital.
00:15:08,00:15:09,Genital.
00:15:09,00:15:10,"No, dog."
00:15:10,00:15:11,Ah!
00:15:11,00:15:12,You got a dirty mind.
00:15:12,00:15:13,OK.
00:15:13,00:15:17,"Prince Patches, oh, wholy having the third of Wilsher."
00:15:17,00:15:18,Dog.
00:15:18,00:15:19,Dog.
00:15:19,00:15:20,Yeah.
00:15:20,00:15:21,They were all dogs.
00:15:21,00:15:24,I wouldn't give you any genitals.
00:15:24,00:15:29,"In the 15th century, the Duke of York, this is what he spent his time doing in those days,"
00:15:29,00:15:35,"he wrote a list of 1,100 names that he considered appropriate for hunting dogs to advise people"
00:15:35,00:15:43,"on what to call their dogs, so there were things like Troy, Genitals, Genital, yeah, nose wise,"
00:15:43,00:15:51,"nameless, perony, clench, bragg, ringwood and hold fast."
00:15:51,00:15:52,So there you go.
00:15:52,00:15:54,"That's what you're allowed to call your dogs, they're going to the Duke of York in the 15th"
00:15:54,00:15:57,"century, if you ever find yourself there."
00:15:57,00:15:58,Can I bring up a famous dog name?
00:15:58,00:15:59,"Yes, please."
00:15:59,00:16:00,So Lassie.
00:16:00,00:16:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:01,00:16:04,"Lassie was originally called Paul, and that was the dog's name, Paul."
00:16:04,00:16:06,"Paul did all the movies, it was the single dog that did it."
00:16:06,00:16:11,"So when Paul died, they then took the litter, and when they grew up, they replaced Lassie,"
00:16:11,00:16:13,they became the next lassies.
00:16:13,00:16:18,So every single lassie that you'd see in the early days was a descendant of the original
00:16:18,00:16:19,lassie.
00:16:19,00:16:20,Yeah.
00:16:20,00:16:24,"And then there was a huge controversy, I think it was in 1997, where suddenly the first non-blood-related"
00:16:24,00:16:28,"lassie was used, and they were, yeah."
00:16:28,00:16:30,And there were genuine protests.
00:16:30,00:16:34,"And people said, this is not on, and they were like, well, no, but we don't."
00:16:34,00:16:38,"And so they buckled, and then they did bring in another descendant of one of the descendants"
00:16:38,00:16:39,of Lassie.
00:16:39,00:16:44,"And then again, when another revival happened, they brought in another unrelated non-blood-line"
00:16:44,00:16:45,dog.
00:16:45,00:16:50,"Again, people freaked out, and it's been like that for ages up until very recently."
00:16:50,00:16:55,And now one of the bloodline has come back into the fold and is the current lassie.
00:16:55,00:17:02,But that's like saying that James Bond should be played by Sean Connery's grandson.
00:17:02,00:17:08,"I just, I love that somewhere in the world, someone is protesting strongly against something,"
00:17:08,00:17:10,and we have no idea for years and years.
00:17:10,00:17:13,"Do we know how many, was it like, Iraq, war, style, level?"
00:17:13,00:17:14,No.
00:17:14,00:17:18,"It was me, my mum, my sister, at least six of us."
00:17:18,00:17:19,"Yeah, I don't know, to be honest."
00:17:19,00:17:22,"So, shall I put it out a stowaway on board, didn't he?"
00:17:22,00:17:23,Did he?
00:17:23,00:17:24,"Yeah, he did."
00:17:24,00:17:27,And he regretted that decision.
00:17:27,00:17:30,Should be landing in a nice one country by now.
00:17:30,00:17:31,What happened?
00:17:31,00:17:38,"He was a guy called, he was a sailor called Perse Blackboro, and he was actually helped to"
00:17:38,00:17:39,sneak on board.
00:17:39,00:17:42,"He just really wanted to be part of the expedition, and he was discovered after three days, as I"
00:17:42,00:17:43,assume he expected to be.
00:17:43,00:17:44,What was he going to do?
00:17:44,00:17:45,I hide on the ship for a year.
00:17:45,00:17:50,"And so he was discovered after three days, and Shackleton, you know, threatened him"
00:17:50,00:17:52,"a little bit, and said, ""I can't believe you've done this, you're bastard."""
00:17:52,00:17:56,"And eventually he said, ""Okay, you can stay, but only if you sign this agreement saying,"
00:17:56,00:18:00,"if you stay, you'll be the first person to be eaten if we need to start eating each other."""
00:18:00,00:18:04,"And so he signed that agreement, and if they had had to eat each other, he would have"
00:18:04,00:18:06,been the first person to go.
00:18:06,00:18:07,The nibbly got him.
00:18:07,00:18:11,"He's going, ""But there's biscuits now."""
00:18:11,00:18:17,"Okay, time for our next fact, fact number three, and that's my fact."
00:18:17,00:18:24,"My fact this week is that, according to a recent theory, Stonehenge was built as part of a team"
00:18:24,00:18:29,building exercise.
00:18:29,00:18:30,I love that.
00:18:30,00:18:31,I love that.
00:18:31,00:18:32,Big away day.
00:18:32,00:18:38,"So this is, there are a lot of theories, by the way, about how Stonehenge came about, but"
00:18:38,00:18:43,"the idea is that rather than it being a place that people returned to and so on, they seemed"
00:18:43,00:18:47,"to have found evidence that it was occupied for about a decade, and that so it must have"
00:18:47,00:18:52,"been built in that period of years, and then they left it once it was done, because apparently"
00:18:52,00:18:55,"there weren't a lot of people back then, and the idea was to create something where people"
00:18:55,00:18:59,"could come together, get to know each other, but do something that was a team building exercise,"
00:18:59,00:19:02,and the guy described it as glass refesible and a motorway building scheme at the same
00:19:02,00:19:03,time.
00:19:03,00:19:04,That's what it was.
00:19:04,00:19:05,Yeah.
00:19:05,00:19:06,Really?
00:19:06,00:19:07,"Someone said, ""We're having a team building exercise."
00:19:07,00:19:11,"You need to book the next 10 years of work."""
00:19:11,00:19:13,"Yeah, that's true."
00:19:13,00:19:16,"So when I read that sentence, I thought, ""Oh, I bet that's a really mad idea,"" which"
00:19:16,00:19:20,"obviously it probably is, but I did think it was druids that had built it and that it was"
00:19:20,00:19:25,"part of this religion thing, this cult thing that they were doing, and it turns out that"
00:19:25,00:19:27,just we have no idea how it got there.
00:19:27,00:19:30,"There were so many theories, and they're all amazing theories, another recent theory."
00:19:30,00:19:35,"It's a prehistoric blockage feel, because apparently if you hit it, it rings in a really"
00:19:35,00:19:36,nice way.
00:19:36,00:19:38,"Acoustically, it's very amazing."
00:19:38,00:19:43,"So the hitting, hitting the stone thing does seem like a bridge too far for me, but it"
00:19:43,00:19:48,"doesn't have exactly the same acoustics as a concert hall or a theatre or something, or a"
00:19:48,00:19:52,"particular way you'd have musicals on, and so they do think that it was designed specifically"
00:19:52,00:19:54,"so that the music, like any sounds inside it, would."
00:19:54,00:19:55,That is good.
00:19:55,00:19:56,Rebound.
00:19:56,00:20:00,The thing that Dan said about the druids having built it is quite interesting that there is
00:20:00,00:20:06,evidence that people were doing something at Stonehenge for every period from when it
00:20:06,00:20:11,"was built to now, apart from the late high-end age, which is a very time when the druids"
00:20:11,00:20:14,"were supposed to have been around, and that's the only time in history."
00:20:14,00:20:18,We don't really have any evidence of anything having happened there.
00:20:18,00:20:19,They did have a load of druids there.
00:20:19,00:20:26,"They had a ceremony there in 1905 where 259 druids were inducted into druidism, but they"
00:20:26,00:20:29,were really mercilessly teased by the press on account of the fact that a lot of them had
00:20:29,00:20:30,fake bids.
00:20:30,00:20:38,"Well, here's a very interesting fact about Stonehenge."
00:20:38,00:20:40,Someone actually bought it at one point.
00:20:40,00:20:41,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:41,00:20:46,"He was sold at auction in a lot, and this husband called Cecille Shubb was sent by his wife to"
00:20:46,00:20:50,"go to this auction, and he saw it was up for sale, and he thought, ""Oh, that'll be a nice"
00:20:50,00:20:52,"present for my wife."""
00:20:52,00:20:54,"But when he got home, she was furious at him."
00:20:54,00:21:01,"She sent him to the auction to buy codons that she liked, and he came back with a hinge."
00:21:01,00:21:03,He said that he bought it on a whim in the auction room.
00:21:03,00:21:04,Yes.
00:21:04,00:21:07,"He said, ""I just thought a local guy should own it, because he lived really nearby."""
00:21:07,00:21:10,So it's sort of a nice story that he bought it for his wife.
00:21:10,00:21:14,"And the thing about curtains is kind of too good to check, but it's right, okay."
00:21:14,00:21:19,"Another recent theory, it was a barbecue site."
00:21:19,00:21:23,"This is so they found a bunch of bones of animals, and when they were looking at their bones,"
00:21:23,00:21:27,"they could see burn marks on it that suggested that quite like an Aussie barbecue, they were"
00:21:27,00:21:30,just sort of turning them over and cooking them nicely.
00:21:30,00:21:33,"It's amazing what they can do with the archaeology, they find bones, and they assume that it"
00:21:33,00:21:35,must be a barbecue or whatever.
00:21:35,00:21:41,"I read one thing that in the Iron Age in Wales, they had an annual party where the guests"
00:21:41,00:21:45,only ever had the right foreleg of pigs.
00:21:45,00:21:49,"And they found that, because they just found a big pile of the specific one leg of pigs"
00:21:49,00:21:53,"all the time, and they lasted for years and years and years, and it seemed like they came"
00:21:53,00:21:56,"from one year after another, after another, and they assumed that they just must have had"
00:21:56,00:21:59,this big party where you just got one leg off a pig and everyone had to.
00:21:59,00:22:03,"And we're sure that in those days, it wasn't just that pigs only had one right."
00:22:03,00:22:07,They were like a pogo stick.
00:22:07,00:22:09,That's an excellent point.
00:22:09,00:22:10,Definitely.
00:22:10,00:22:16,"I was having a look through the British newspaper archive to see which, so that goes back"
00:22:16,00:22:19,about 300 years and gives you newspaper records from that time to see kind of what people
00:22:19,00:22:21,thought of Stonehenge in the past.
00:22:21,00:22:27,"And so a lot of the articles in the early 1800s, around 1840, everyone thought that it"
00:22:27,00:22:31,"had been brought over by the Egyptians, so people thought the stone from Stonehenge"
00:22:31,00:22:35,"had been brought over from Africa to Egypt, and then the Egyptians, because they were considered"
00:22:35,00:22:40,"such a civilized race or such a civilized people, and they had much better mechanics and engineering"
00:22:40,00:22:41,than we did.
00:22:41,00:22:42,"We were all still, you know, stuck in."
00:22:42,00:22:46,"They also thought, for a time, that it was only built about a thousand years ago, which"
00:22:46,00:22:47,it would be.
00:22:47,00:22:48,"Oh, I have a theory on this."
00:22:48,00:22:49,When was Stonehenge built?
00:22:49,00:22:50,2018.
00:22:50,00:22:51,Yeah.
00:22:51,00:22:52,It may be seen.
00:22:52,00:22:53,OK.
00:22:53,00:22:55,"What would you say, if I told you it was 1958?"
00:22:55,00:22:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:56,00:23:00,"I'd say, Dan, be quiet."
00:23:00,00:23:04,But every single stone at Stonehenge has been moved between 1901 and 1964.
00:23:04,00:23:05,No.
00:23:05,00:23:06,Almost every single one.
00:23:06,00:23:09,So they were either moved or they were straightened.
00:23:09,00:23:11,Some of them were set in concrete.
00:23:11,00:23:15,"This was just very early 20th century guys saying, ah, it's not quite right, is it?"
00:23:15,00:23:17,Why don't we just bodge it up and put some concrete under it?
00:23:17,00:23:20,And they were very early cact-handed preservation.
00:23:20,00:23:23,So I say that Stonehenge was built in the late 50s.
00:23:23,00:23:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:24,00:23:25,Yeah.
00:23:25,00:23:26,That's a great theory.
00:23:26,00:23:30,"Well, you said that people thought that these stones came from Egypt, but they actually"
00:23:30,00:23:32,"came from Wales, didn't they?"
00:23:32,00:23:34,They came from the Presley Hills in Wales.
00:23:34,00:23:37,We know that now because of X-rays and stuff like that.
00:23:37,00:23:41,"But for 90 years, they were trying to dig on this particular hill."
00:23:41,00:23:43,And then they found out that they were digging on the wrong hill.
00:23:43,00:23:46,"And it was another one, one mile away, that they should have been digging out."
00:23:46,00:23:51,"And Dr. Richard Bevins of the National Museum of Wales, he was a guy who found this out."
00:23:51,00:23:55,"And he said, I don't expect to be getting any Christmas cards from the archaeologists"
00:23:55,00:23:58,who have been excavating at the wrong place for the last 90 years.
00:23:58,00:24:00,"Well, most of them will be dead by now."
00:24:00,00:24:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:03,00:24:05,"We're going to need to move on soon, by the way."
00:24:05,00:24:06,"OK, I have one quick thing."
00:24:06,00:24:10,"There's a company called Jackamo, who make clothes, especially for men."
00:24:10,00:24:17,"And they did a catalogue called the Architecture of Men, to identify modern kind of builds."
00:24:17,00:24:22,And they said that Simon Cowell and Ricky Gervais are built like Stonehenge.
00:24:22,00:24:23,Why?
00:24:23,00:24:28,"Apparently, they have short, stocky build, broad shoulders and chunky legs,"
00:24:28,00:24:29,according to Jackamo.
00:24:29,00:24:34,"Russell Crowe and Jay-Z look like the time bridge, according to these guys."
00:24:34,00:24:35,What?
00:24:35,00:24:37,And James Corden looks like the Girkin.
00:24:37,00:24:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:39,00:24:40,Harsh.
00:24:40,00:24:43,It's very harsh.
00:24:43,00:24:46,The Tasmanian town of Buckland built a replica of Stonehenge.
00:24:46,00:24:47,There are loads of replicas all over the world.
00:24:47,00:24:50,So there's a place called Phonehenge in South Carolina.
00:24:50,00:24:54,And there's a place called Carhenge in Kansas made of old cars.
00:24:54,00:24:56,And there's a live webcam that you can watch.
00:24:56,00:24:58,I watched it for hours the other day.
00:24:58,00:24:59,It's not much goes on.
00:24:59,00:25:02,It's just a camera pointing at a carhenge.
00:25:02,00:25:04,"But yeah, you can watch that."
00:25:04,00:25:07,"But the Tasmanian-- there was a Tasmanian town called Buckland, which built one."
00:25:07,00:25:09,And it was demolished by the authorities.
00:25:09,00:25:13,"And on the Wikipedia page where it says, ""In keeping with the original Stonehenge,"
00:25:13,00:25:16,"it did not have the necessary planning approval from the local council."""
00:25:16,00:25:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:20,00:25:21,OK.
00:25:21,00:25:23,Time for our final fact of the evening.
00:25:23,00:25:25,And that is Chazinski.
00:25:25,00:25:32,"Oh, yeah, my fact is that Utah has a 106-acre forest that's made out of one tree."
00:25:32,00:25:34,And this tree is so cool.
00:25:34,00:25:35,It's called Pando.
00:25:35,00:25:38,And it-- or some people call it the trembling giant.
00:25:38,00:25:44,And it's a quaking aspen tree.
00:25:44,00:25:48,"And it's a clonal colony, which means that basically it's got the same root system."
00:25:48,00:25:52,All the branches that stick up out of the ground are clones of the original tree.
00:25:52,00:25:53,So it's all completely interconnected.
00:25:53,00:25:57,Every single bit of it is genetically identical to every single other bit of it.
00:25:57,00:25:59,"And yeah, it takes up 106 acres."
00:25:59,00:26:01,And it's this one tree.
00:26:01,00:26:01,That's astonishing.
00:26:01,00:26:03,It's incredible.
00:26:03,00:26:03,It's so good.
00:26:03,00:26:07,"Pando means in Latin ice spread, which is why it's called that."
00:26:07,00:26:10,And it's also the heaviest-known organism.
00:26:10,00:26:11,It's really old as well.
00:26:11,00:26:16,"So the average age of each end of-- if you went into this forest and you saw one of the trees,"
00:26:16,00:26:19,it would be 130 years old.
00:26:19,00:26:23,"But the age of the roots is thought to be about 80,000 years old."
00:26:23,00:26:26,"But could be 800,000 years old."
00:26:26,00:26:27,"400,000."
00:26:27,00:26:28,"200,000."
00:26:28,00:26:29,To be ridiculous.
00:26:29,00:26:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:31,00:26:35,"It's amazing this tree, though, has been growing for 200,000 years."
00:26:35,00:26:38,"Is it one tree, though, or is it low to no tree?"
00:26:38,00:26:39,"Yeah, it's definitely one tree that is--"
00:26:39,00:26:40,It's the same organism as that.
00:26:40,00:26:41,It's one organism.
00:26:41,00:26:42,It's all completely interconnected.
00:26:42,00:26:46,It's just like a tree whose branches go underground and then come back up again.
00:26:46,00:26:47,Wow.
00:26:47,00:26:47,It is.
00:26:47,00:26:48,Very cool.
00:26:48,00:26:50,It's so great.
00:26:50,00:26:55,"So Utah, where it is, as far as Utah is really amazing."
00:26:55,00:26:56,I didn't realize how cool Utah is.
00:26:56,00:26:59,So Utah is where Kentucky fried chickens from?
00:26:59,00:27:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:01,00:27:02,Absolutely true.
00:27:02,00:27:03,Are you sure?
00:27:03,00:27:05,"Yeah, absolutely true."
00:27:05,00:27:09,Colonel Sanders was visiting Utah and there was an existing restaurant.
00:27:09,00:27:10,And he went inside the restaurant.
00:27:10,00:27:13,And he went there specifically because he liked the owners.
00:27:13,00:27:14,"And he said, I have this interesting chicken."
00:27:14,00:27:18,And so he did the recipe and they advertised outside.
00:27:18,00:27:20,He was away when they started selling it in the shop.
00:27:20,00:27:22,"And they said, what should we call it?"
00:27:22,00:27:24,And it could have been Utah fried chickens from Kentucky.
00:27:24,00:27:28,"He said, if you call it UFC, people would just be fighting there all the time."
00:27:28,00:27:32,"So Kentucky fried chicken, they said, let's call it Kentucky fried chicken,"
00:27:32,00:27:34,because he's from Kentucky.
00:27:34,00:27:36,"And then when he came back, he realized how big it was."
00:27:36,00:27:38,And they opened up the first ever KFC there.
00:27:38,00:27:39,And then it spread around America.
00:27:39,00:27:41,So Kentucky fried chicken is from Utah.
00:27:41,00:27:42,Wow.
00:27:42,00:27:43,Not know that.
00:27:43,00:27:43,That's very good.
00:27:43,00:27:44,Yeah.
00:27:44,00:27:47,And also NASA planned for our trips to Mars there.
00:27:47,00:27:48,"So in the Utah desert, they"
00:27:48,00:27:54,"have these stations where they put astronauts in for a bunch of days, weeks, months."
00:27:54,00:27:55,"And while I was reading this, I discovered something."
00:27:55,00:27:57,I never heard of this.
00:27:57,00:28:01,"NASA has actually created, or at least someone from NASA, a Mars flag."
00:28:01,00:28:02,"Do you know, we have a Mars flag?"
00:28:02,00:28:03,What?
00:28:03,00:28:03,No.
00:28:03,00:28:04,What's that mean?
00:28:04,00:28:05,What's that for when we go to Mars?
00:28:05,00:28:07,"For when we go to Mars, we have a flag now."
00:28:07,00:28:08,"And if you look at it, it's like the French flag."
00:28:08,00:28:11,"It's sort of vertical stripes, three."
00:28:11,00:28:12,And it starts red.
00:28:12,00:28:13,And then it goes red.
00:28:13,00:28:14,Red.
00:28:14,00:28:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:17,00:28:20,So it goes red and then green and then blue.
00:28:20,00:28:24,And the idea is that that's gradually how we would be making the planet.
00:28:24,00:28:25,And I've never known this.
00:28:25,00:28:27,So Mars has a flag.
00:28:27,00:28:28,What about when we get there?
00:28:28,00:28:30,"And the Martians say, we have a red flag."
00:28:30,00:28:32,Thanks.
00:28:32,00:28:34,Have you guys seen the-- this is not your topic.
00:28:34,00:28:37,But New Zealand is trying to redesign its flag at the moment.
00:28:37,00:28:39,"Or actually, the final design may have gone through now."
00:28:39,00:28:42,Have you seen the suggestions for the newly designed flag?
00:28:42,00:28:45,And I've always thought I don't understand why flags in the world are so boring.
00:28:45,00:28:46,And they've really nailed it this time.
00:28:46,00:28:48,So a lot of the entries that have been submitted
00:28:48,00:28:51,"are, I think, the best one was of a Kiwi, which"
00:28:51,00:28:53,was not the same color as a Kiwi.
00:28:53,00:28:54,I don't know what color it is.
00:28:54,00:28:58,And it's shooting red lasers out of its eyes into the corner of the flag.
00:28:58,00:29:01,"And that's being reported as, yes, we'll give it a good thing."
00:29:01,00:29:02,Yeah.
00:29:02,00:29:05,"Oh, back to trees, yeah."
00:29:05,00:29:10,So there is a tree of the year in Europe every year.
00:29:10,00:29:13,And this year's tree of the year is an Estonian oak tree
00:29:13,00:29:15,that's in the middle of a football field.
00:29:15,00:29:18,It's in the Arisare Stadium.
00:29:18,00:29:20,"And if you Google it, you can see pitch of it."
00:29:20,00:29:22,It's right in the middle of a pitch.
00:29:22,00:29:23,Wow.
00:29:23,00:29:24,In the middle of a stadium.
00:29:24,00:29:28,"And according to visit Estonia, when the stadium was being built,"
00:29:28,00:29:30,the Soviet technology could not beat the oak.
00:29:30,00:29:33,"And therefore, it was never uprooted."
00:29:33,00:29:34,And so it's kind of a sign of--
00:29:34,00:29:38,"Oh, I see, sort of, independence, and play, exactly."
00:29:38,00:29:39,"And then it also says on the website,"
00:29:39,00:29:44,"today, everyone is so used to their extra player on the field"
00:29:44,00:29:47,that the tree is hardly noticed during the games.
00:29:47,00:29:50,"And I promise you, it is massive."
00:29:50,00:29:53,There is no way the ball does not hit this tree
00:29:53,00:29:55,every single time it got us anywhere.
00:29:55,00:29:59,"Well, so that was Tree of the Year 2015."
00:29:59,00:30:02,And they're gearing up to announce Tree of the Year 2016
00:30:02,00:30:04,nominations have begun.
00:30:04,00:30:07,And I read the British nominations this year.
00:30:07,00:30:09,So a tree featured in the Game of Thrones series
00:30:09,00:30:11,"has been nominated, which is very exciting."
00:30:11,00:30:14,"And this is a laboo pick, is it?"
00:30:14,00:30:15,There are also laboo picks from Britain.
00:30:15,00:30:18,It's going to be like Eurovision all over again.
00:30:18,00:30:19,Because there's classic trees in it.
00:30:19,00:30:22,There's the tree that the Magna Carta was supposedly signed
00:30:22,00:30:23,under.
00:30:23,00:30:26,There's the tree where Charles II hid.
00:30:26,00:30:30,There's the tree where apparently Robin Hood hid under as well.
00:30:30,00:30:33,"There must be the four-tingle you, then."
00:30:33,00:30:36,This is the tree that apparently is the oldest tree
00:30:36,00:30:38,in Britain and possibly in Europe.
00:30:38,00:30:41,And it's the tree under which Legend says Pontius Pilate
00:30:41,00:30:42,hid it's in--
00:30:42,00:30:43,Or just Pilate.
00:30:43,00:30:44,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:30:44,00:30:45,He left the Middle East.
00:30:45,00:30:47,"Yeah, to hang out with Scotland under a tree."
00:30:47,00:30:48,"Yeah, it's thought that that's where he went."
00:30:48,00:30:52,And this has hit the news recently because--
00:30:52,00:30:55,"so it's about 5,000 years old."
00:30:55,00:30:57,It's thought-- so possibly the oldest tree in Europe.
00:30:57,00:31:00,And it is just having a sex change.
00:31:00,00:31:02,So it's mid-op right now.
00:31:02,00:31:04,So what on earth does that mean?
00:31:04,00:31:08,"It's been a male for, well, almost 5,000 years."
00:31:08,00:31:10,And it's just-- so it doesn't produce fruit.
00:31:10,00:31:12,"So a lot of plants, I think, most plants actually"
00:31:12,00:31:13,"don't have genders, but a lot of plants"
00:31:13,00:31:16,"are either male or female, have male parts or female parts."
00:31:16,00:31:18,"And it's been a male for almost 5,000 years."
00:31:18,00:31:20,"And someone noticed recently it was growing fruit, which"
00:31:20,00:31:21,the men don't do.
00:31:21,00:31:25,And one of its arms is having a sex change and becoming a female.
00:31:25,00:31:26,Wow.
00:31:26,00:31:29,So that's good for the four-tingle you.
00:31:29,00:31:30,That's astonishing.
00:31:30,00:31:33,"The England's tallest tree is a Douglas fair, which"
00:31:33,00:31:36,is on X-Moll and near Dunster.
00:31:36,00:31:37,I visited it a few years ago.
00:31:37,00:31:40,But they don't tell you exactly where it is.
00:31:40,00:31:42,They just tell you it's kind of in this forest somewhere.
00:31:42,00:31:45,Because people like you were going chop it down.
00:31:45,00:31:46,There was a whole thing where James--
00:31:46,00:31:48,Have you heard of the Chillingham cattle?
00:31:48,00:31:50,There's a herd of wild cattle up in--
00:31:50,00:31:50,Is it Yorkshire?
00:31:50,00:31:51,"Very, very Northumberland."
00:31:51,00:31:53,"Northumberland, really, really way up North."
00:31:53,00:31:56,"No one has touched these cows for 300 years, right?"
00:31:56,00:31:57,The field is completely sealed.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"They live, they breed, they die, all on their own."
00:31:59,00:32:01,They occasionally they throw over a bale of hay
00:32:01,00:32:03,or some extra food in the harsh winters.
00:32:03,00:32:05,"And as soon as James heard about this,"
00:32:05,00:32:09,"he said, I'm going to go there and touch them."
00:32:09,00:32:13,And now they're all in therapy.
00:32:13,00:32:13,Sorry.
00:32:13,00:32:16,"I did say that, I didn't go."
00:32:16,00:32:18,"But you did visit the tree, though."
00:32:18,00:32:20,"No, well, I went to see the tree."
00:32:20,00:32:22,And I just thought that it's the tallest tree.
00:32:22,00:32:24,"You're going to know which one it is, right?"
00:32:24,00:32:27,"Well, they haven't planted it around loads of big trees."
00:32:27,00:32:29,"But basically, it is around the load of big trees."
00:32:29,00:32:30,And so you just go there and you just kind of have
00:32:30,00:32:34,"to take the word for it that is there, really."
00:32:34,00:32:38,But the US has a national register of big trees.
00:32:38,00:32:40,"But again, they don't tell you where any of the trees are."
00:32:40,00:32:42,They just tell you the general area where they are
00:32:42,00:32:45,"and say it's called this, and it's this height."
00:32:45,00:32:47,And there was a spokesman from American Forest
00:32:47,00:32:48,who does this register.
00:32:48,00:32:51,"And he says, we don't want to send flocks of tree"
00:32:51,00:32:54,spotters and paparazzi to harass the trees
00:32:54,00:32:57,and ruin their lives.
00:32:57,00:33:00,"Which sounds like he's talking about me, doesn't it?"
00:33:00,00:33:01,Yeah.
00:33:01,00:33:03,Have you heard of the world's rarest tree?
00:33:03,00:33:03,No.
00:33:03,00:33:04,"No, it's so cool."
00:33:04,00:33:06,"It's a tree called Penentia, Belisiana."
00:33:06,00:33:07,Where is it?
00:33:07,00:33:09,I'm not telling you.
00:33:09,00:33:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:12,00:33:17,"From 1945, for about 70 years, there was only one in the world."
00:33:17,00:33:19,And it was on a tiny island off New Zealand.
00:33:19,00:33:22,And it became the last in the world when humans
00:33:22,00:33:23,introduced goats to the island.
00:33:23,00:33:25,And they ate all the other trees.
00:33:25,00:33:26,"Oh, my God."
00:33:26,00:33:30,I think they found out just in time that this was the last one.
00:33:30,00:33:33,But scientists have found a way of growing a load
00:33:33,00:33:34,"of new seedlings, so they've planted a load."
00:33:34,00:33:37,"Oh, we're going to have to wrap up really soon."
00:33:37,00:33:39,Can I just give a recommendation to everyone here
00:33:39,00:33:40,if they haven't already seen it?
00:33:40,00:33:41,"Since you mentioned goats, have you ever"
00:33:41,00:33:47,"seen the Argania trees, which are the trees that goats climb up?"
00:33:47,00:33:52,So there's a tree called the Argania tree and goats climb it.
00:33:52,00:33:54,"And yeah, you just see them in its branches."
00:33:54,00:33:56,"And just look it up, A-R-G-A-N-I-A."
00:33:56,00:33:57,Wow.
00:33:57,00:33:59,How many goats do you get in one tree?
00:33:59,00:34:01,"There are pictures of at least a dozen, I would say."
00:34:01,00:34:02,Wow.
00:34:02,00:34:05,And that's just so much for these trees.
00:34:05,00:34:08,Don't tell them at all.
00:34:08,00:34:09,"OK, I think we should wrap up."
00:34:09,00:34:10,That's it.
00:34:10,00:34:11,That's all of our facts.
