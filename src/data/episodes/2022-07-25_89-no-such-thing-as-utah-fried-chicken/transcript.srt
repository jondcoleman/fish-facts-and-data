1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:14,780
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,400
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,440
 this week coming to you from Cambridge.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,280
 My name is Dan Treiber and please welcome

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,140
 to the stage, it's the regular elves,

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,020
 Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski, and James Harkin.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,020
 (audience cheering)

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,800
 (audience applauding)

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,760
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,240
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,480
 and in no particular order, here we go.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,360
 Starting with you, Andy Murray.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,660
 - My fact this week is that before trains had corridors,

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,080
 guards had to climb along the outside of the carriage

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,060
 to check your ticket.

18
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,040
 (audience laughing)

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
 That is so amazing.

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,760
 - And they did it while the train was moving.

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,860
 - And this was a thing, this happened.

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,900
 Carriages used to not be, you couldn't go through a carriage.

23
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,540
 You would get in at one end, they closed the door,

24
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,140
 they'd lock it, you were locked in for the whole journey,

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,380
 then at the other end they'd unlock it, and that you'd get.

26
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,700
 And it was just across the train,

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,900
 instead of front to back through the train.

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,820
 - Well you locked in for health and safety reasons.

29
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,240
 - I think partly you were locked in

30
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,740
 so you wouldn't try and sneak into first class.

31
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,580
 - Wow, yeah.

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,780
 - I don't think they were that bothered about

33
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,580
 health and safety, if you have a guy climbing

34
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,580
 on the outside of the carriage.

35
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,460
 - Indeed, that's where it seems to fall down.

36
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,460
 How did it get, was there a ledge?

37
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,540
 - There was a little, they call it a running board.

38
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,180
 So just on the outside of the carriage

39
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,140
 at the bus, there's a little plate that you could climb on.

40
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,380
 But it wasn't even a continuous running board,

41
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,740
 it was intermittent, so you had to climb along

42
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,940
 between the beds, and the people did suggest,

43
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,700
 why don't we give people a continuous running board?

44
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,780
 And the train company said,

45
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,860
 "No, no, passengers will use them to sneak into first class."

46
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,260
 (audience laughing)

47
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,260
 - How good was first class?

48
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,220
 - It was, it was awful, 'cause it was 1840.

49
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,420
 - Oh yeah, these people's are desperate.

50
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,740
 - I bet in those days you just had to always

51
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,420
 know where your ticket was, 'cause if you were stuck

52
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,980
 there going, "Oh, where is it in this guy's outside going?

53
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,620
 "Find the ticket!"

54
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,460
 There is a tunnel coming.

55
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,500
 (audience laughing)

56
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,780
 - How fast did the trains used to go?

57
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,620
 - Well, these were really early ones, so maybe,

58
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,260
 I mean, about 40 miles an hour comfortably.

59
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,740
 - People thought that if they went over a certain speed,

60
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,540
 then your body wouldn't be able to deal with it, didn't they?

61
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,180
 - Yeah, they said that the human body would not be able

62
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,700
 to endure speeds of 25 miles per hour.

63
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,460
 Someone said that to start off with.

64
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,180
 And then someone else in America wrote that if a woman's body

65
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,420
 accelerated past 50 miles an hour,

66
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,420
 then her uterus would go shooting out of her body.

67
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,900
 (audience laughing)

68
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,660
 - And that's the plot of speed three.

69
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,580
 (audience laughing)

70
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,660
 - You'll never look as tangible

71
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,900
 like the same way again.

72
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,500
 - When trains first got to the Isle of White,

73
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,740
 well, they were taken to the Isle of White, obviously.

74
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,220
 (audience laughing)

75
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,300
 Wasn't a rogue train, which went off the rails.

76
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,820
 (audience laughing)

77
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,260
 - So the first ever journey, it was a four mile track

78
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,620
 and it went along its route in less than 10 minutes.

79
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,940
 And I think that's, I've worked it out about 30 miles an hour,

80
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,740
 give or take, we're not sure exactly at the time.

81
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,460
 But that was apparently faster than anyone had ever traveled

82
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,500
 on the Isle of White until that point in history.

83
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,860
 - That's pretty cool.

84
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,380
 I was reading about in the 1800s, 1827,

85
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,340
 there was a race between a train and a horse.

86
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,140
 But, and check it out, this is a bit unfair on the horse's side.

87
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,900
 The horse was towing a train.

88
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,900
 (audience laughing)

89
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,740
 - It was unfair.

90
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,220
 (audience laughing)

91
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,940
 - It was back in the day when horses used to pull trains

92
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,860
 prior to the engine.

93
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,900
 And so this was an example of showing

94
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,020
 that potentially an engine could beat a horse.

95
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,300
 And it probably would have, but one of the wheels

96
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,660
 or a little band around the wheels burst.

97
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,980
 And so they had to stop the train.

98
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,820
 So it wasn't the lead and then the horse took over.

99
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,940
 But there was an actual, let's have this as a big race,

100
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,100
 horse versus train.

101
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,060
 - So things were always going wrong.

102
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,420
 So at the 1829 display of, you know,

103
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,140
 which train is the best train,

104
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,780
 10 different types of train entered this competition.

105
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,660
 Five of them didn't even show up on the day.

106
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,220
 So I think broke down before they made it to the venue.

107
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,340
 So five trains entered.

108
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,020
 Stevenson's rocket being one of them.

109
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,260
 And only one of them completed the trial.

110
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,180
 So Stevenson's rocket didn't win because it was the best.

111
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,100
 It won because it was the only train

112
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,860
 that managed to not break.

113
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,740
 Or so the cycloped, do you remember the cycloped train,

114
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,580
 which was one of the--

115
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,300
 - I remember it personally.

116
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
 - I mean, I know I'm old.

117
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,420
 - I didn't think of you, but.

118
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,260
 - I did look at you directly there for a reason.

119
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,980
 - The cycloped train sounds like a quite a cool design,

120
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,060
 which is a, it's led by a horse,

121
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,340
 but it's a horse on a treadmill.

122
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,260
 And the horse, the treadmill that the horse is walking

123
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,820
 on powers the train.

124
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,900
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

125
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,100
 - Yeah, so really cool.

126
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,020
 But the horse, the demonstrations,

127
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,660
 the horse fell through the floor of the train.

128
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,220
 And so that failed, obviously.

129
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,420
 - I once fell on a treadmill.

130
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,740
 (laughing)

131
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,780
 Anyone want to hear that?

132
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,780
 No.

133
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,620
 Really?

134
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,580
 Oh, okay, I was a kid.

135
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,900
 It was my first time on a treadmill.

136
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,140
 So one of the ones that you put the actual is electric

137
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,740
 and it was going like crazy.

138
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,980
 I put it up to 10 and I thought this is going to be incredible.

139
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,500
 And I tested with my hands on the side,

140
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,380
 whether I could run on it.

141
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,540
 And I thought, yeah, that's easy.

142
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,420
 So, with one jump, I just jumped onto it

143
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,180
 and immediately my two legs went,

144
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,860
 "Whoop!"

145
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,540
 And I fell on my face on it.

146
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,700
 I got shot off the back, but it was on a carpet.

147
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,500
 And so everything went right off it except for my face.

148
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,780
 And for about half a minute,

149
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,420
 I was going, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.

150
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,220
 That explains an awful lot.

151
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,820
 (laughing)

152
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,300
 - It does also explain why I didn't get into, "Okay, go."

153
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,900
 (laughing)

154
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,260
 - Do you guys know about the city of crush in Texas?

155
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,340
 - No, it was from an extremely brief period,

156
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,260
 the second largest city in Texas.

157
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,820
 This was in 1896.

158
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,980
 And that was because 40,000 people came to it.

159
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,380
 And that was because someone had decided to stage

160
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,140
 a train crash.

161
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,620
 So this was 40,000 people went to,

162
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,020
 it was organized by this guy called William Krush.

163
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,500
 And he said, I guess we're going to say, yeah.

164
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,140
 He said he was going to just fire two trains towards each other.

165
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,260
 So he had like four miles of track created for the purpose.

166
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,820
 And 40,000 people came.

167
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,860
 And there was such demand that people did have to sit

168
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,140
 on top of trains in order to get there

169
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,340
 'cause they couldn't squeeze into the carriages.

170
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,340
 And then at 5 p.m., these two trains started going towards

171
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,140
 each other, picking up speed, picking up speed.

172
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,260
 And Krush stood right in the middle of the railway

173
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,380
 on a white horse and then he waved a big flag,

174
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,220
 saying they're coming.

175
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,060
 It's all right, he survived.

176
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,060
 - Oh, thank God.

177
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,900
 (laughing)

178
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,580
 - He stepped out of the way sort of at the last minute.

179
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,660
 The two trains crashed into each other.

180
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,660
 Both of their boilers exploded and a bunch of people died.

181
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,140
 - So when he said it's all right, it wasn't completely all right.

182
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,140
 - Well, here's the thing.

183
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,420
 Krush got fired that evening and then the company

184
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,180
 that he worked for, Relented and Hired him again,

185
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,740
 the next day, the rail company.

186
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,060
 And he worked at the same rail company

187
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,340
 for the rest of his life.

188
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,500
 - What?

189
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
 - We're going to need to move on

190
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,780
 to the next fact soon, ish.

191
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,220
 - Okay, so there's a guy called Andrew Dowd.

192
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,340
 He's from Wiggin, up in my neck of the woods.

193
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,340
 And he visited all 2,548 railway stations in Britain

194
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,700
 between 2010 and 2014 in his car.

195
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,940
 (laughing)

196
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,980
 - Need we ask why?

197
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,100
 - Well, people asked him that in the newspaper articles,

198
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,900
 but he didn't really kind of have a very good reason.

199
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,140
 He said, I started doing it round near where I lived

200
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,220
 and I kind of enjoyed it.

201
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,980
 So I thought I'd do the whole country.

202
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,500
 And they said to him, asked him what he did.

203
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,660
 And he said, I take a little look around if it's interesting,

204
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,260
 but most out, very interesting.

205
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,220
 (laughing)

206
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,540
 - Wow.

207
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,380
 - Why not?

208
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,220
 - Yeah.

209
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,660
 - I like to think there's an equivalent train driver

210
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,540
 who's planning to visit all the petrol stations

211
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,700
 in Britain on the train.

212
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,140
 (laughing)

213
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,660
 - Wouldn't it be visiting all the car parking spaces?

214
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,180
 - Yeah, right, there was a bad analogy.

215
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,460
 Yeah, that's better.

216
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,500
 - No, it was harder to visit all the car parking spaces

217
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,140
 'cause there are so many these days.

218
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,340
 (laughing)

219
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,180
 Anyway.

220
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,900
 (laughing)

221
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,940
 - Okay, time for fact number two.

222
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,740
 (laughing)

223
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,580
 And that is James Harkin.

224
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,060
 - Okay, my fact this week is that Ernest Shackleton's

225
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,740
 dog's names included slippery sloppers,

226
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,940
 satin, painful, swanker, bummer, and bob.

227
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,340
 (laughing)

228
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,340
 It's swankish over, he's the wanker.

229
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,180
 (laughing)

230
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,740
 Do you know the history?

231
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,940
 - Well, they all had different names for different reasons.

232
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,060
 I got this fact actually from a guy on Twitter called

233
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,540
 @davepain164, and it made me laugh,

234
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,020
 and so I thought I'd use it on the podcast,

235
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,500
 and it kind of fits in with one thing that I like,

236
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,700
 which is just going through lists of ridiculous data

237
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,860
 and trying to find funny bits or whatever.

238
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,060
 But they got the names for lots of different reasons.

239
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,460
 Some of them were nicknames that are people on the ship.

240
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,900
 So it could have been short for he's a wanker, I guess.

241
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,340
 It's possible.

242
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,140
 The dogs all came from Canada and they had names already.

243
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,100
 So some of them like Bob was already a name,

244
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,580
 and they just kept that.

245
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,460
 So some of them were changed like Bismarck, Napoleon,

246
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,100
 and three dogs all named Carlos.

247
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,340
 (laughing)

248
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,940
 They had to change all of those.

249
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,980
 (laughing)

250
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,540
 - What a great name for a dog.

251
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,380
 (laughing)

252
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,140
 - What's the, in just like a basic two sentences

253
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,460
 or a few more, Shackleton, just the background of Shackleton?

254
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,820
 - Polar Explorer.

255
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,980
 Went down to try and get to the South Pole, didn't quite make it.

256
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,340
 Became the furthest South of that anyone had ever got.

257
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,580
 Abinson beat him to the South Pole,

258
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,060
 and so he went on another expedition

259
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,100
 to go across the whole of the South Pole from one side

260
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,100
 to the other, and then ended in disaster again.

261
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,900
 And he became famous for a big sort of escape

262
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,500
 from the ice-filled islands of Elephant's Island.

263
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,340
 - Okay.

264
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,420
 - And now you don't need to watch the 12-part documentary

265
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,580
 (laughing)

266
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,900
 Shackleton.

267
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,020
 I like this.

268
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,260
 So there were a bunch of quite interesting people

269
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,020
 on board the expedition.

270
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,340
 So they had like official photographer, Frank Hurley,

271
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,260
 who used to like risk his life trying to get good photos

272
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,180
 because his only priority on this life-and-daging expedition

273
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,060
 was to make sure he could make money when he saw the pictures

274
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,020
 when he got back so he'd climb right to the top of the mast

275
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,740
 or go out onto the yard arm and hang from it to take good photos.

276
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,100
 And they also had an on-ship artist.

277
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,860
 And I just like this quote,

278
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,860
 I kind of remember where I read this in an account

279
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,580
 of when they were stranded on Elephant Island.

280
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,740
 So they were sort of like, we're definitely going to die now.

281
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,700
 No one's going to find us here.

282
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,140
 How on earth are we going to survive?

283
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,660
 And at one point, it was said this ship's artist,

284
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,460
 George Marston, allowed his remaining oil paints

285
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,300
 to be used as glue to make the canvases cover the shelter properly.

286
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,380
 And I like the idea that there was a little bit of a debate there.

287
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,020
 I have more facts about the dogs.

288
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,620
 I do want.

289
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,860
 So they were trapped on the ice for months and months and months.

290
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,540
 I think 15 months, maybe, and an amazing amount of time.

291
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,900
 So Frank Hurley wrote loads of notes about all the dogs.

292
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,660
 And there was Shakespeare, a steamer, Wallaby Satan,

293
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,820
 who was a treacherous brute.

294
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,420
 Sue is a flirt.

295
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,140
 [LAUGHTER]

296
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,660
 They've been on the ice for a long time, haven't they?

297
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660
 Bummer.

298
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,260
 [LAUGHTER]

299
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,660
 And then there was Snapper.

300
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,660
 It does not snap at all.

301
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,900
 [LAUGHTER]

302
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,860
 And they built the dogs a town.

303
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,780
 They built a little town.

304
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
 They called Dog Town.

305
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,140
 They built a lot of dog igloos out of ice and wood.

306
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,700
 And they built a pup-loo for the puppies that have been born.

307
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,100
 And they built a pig-loo because they had some pigs with them as well.

308
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,860
 A pig-loo.

309
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,900
 Yeah, that's great, isn't it?

310
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,940
 It's pretty cool.

311
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,300
 But they ate a lot of these animals.

312
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,300
 [LAUGHTER]

313
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,540
 And they had a ship's cat as well.

314
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,060
 They did.

315
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,980
 The ship's cat was called Mr. Chippy.

316
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,180
 Mrs. Chippy?

317
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,180
 Yes, Mrs. Chippy.

318
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,180
 It was always a male.

319
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
 Yeah.

320
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,460
 And it belonged to the cruise carpenter, Harry McNiss.

321
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,460
 And they decided to kill it because it was using up a lot of the meat.

322
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,820
 But Harry McNiss was not very happy about that at all

323
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,300
 and got into a massive fight with Shackleton, didn't he?

324
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,140
 Yeah.

325
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,140
 He was Scottish, wasn't he?

326
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,820
 Yeah, that's right.

327
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,420
 Harry McNiss.

328
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,620
 And someone who met him said the only thing I ever heard him talk about

329
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,700
 was the fact that Shackleton killed his cat, which, you know,

330
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,140
 they were in a difficult spot, I think.

331
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,900
 But he then really got furious.

332
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,740
 And he and Shackleton, as you say, had a huge route.

333
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,620
 And he was the only one of the expedition.

334
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,220
 I think all 28 men survived.

335
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,380
 There was a separate supply mission where a few of them end up.

336
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,300
 But all of the men with Shackleton survived.

337
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,860
 It was this huge survival story.

338
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,340
 He was the only one later denied this polar medal

339
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,580
 that all the others got for insubordination.

340
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,180
 Wow.

341
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,940
 You know that Shackleton's medals went up for sale

342
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,580
 in auction not too long ago.

343
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,820
 And they got a ridiculous amount of money.

344
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,900
 It was about 800,000 pounds.

345
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,740
 And I started looking into the kind of stuff

346
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,740
 that gets auctioned off from those trips.

347
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,220
 Discovered that-- this is quite recent--

348
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,460
 one of the biscuits that they didn't eat

349
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,580
 went up for auction recently and was bought for 1,250 euros.

350
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,620
 I definitely would have bought that.

351
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,340
 That's so cheap.

352
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,220
 A biscuit from a Shackleton, isn't it?

353
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,220
 They ate the dogs before eating that biscuit.

354
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,020
 No, because probably someone went when we bring this back,

355
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,380
 this biscuit will be worth a fortune.

356
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,580
 No, but so apparently Shackleton was giving

357
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,900
 one of his fellow explorers Frank wild a biscuit

358
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,300
 from one of the rations.

359
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,260
 And while recorded in the diary--

360
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,540
 and this is how spare food was back then--

361
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,460
 thousands of pounds would not have bought that biscuit.

362
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,820
 So that's how great it was.

363
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,460
 And so it's quite nice that now it has gone

364
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,220
 for over 1,000 pounds.

365
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,020
 I love-- so I read also as well recently in an auction,

366
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,140
 the head of the scouts, Robert Baden-Powell,

367
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,620
 a letter that he wrote to an autograph hunter saying

368
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,940
 you should not become an autograph hunter,

369
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,980
 recently sold at an auction to an autograph hunter.

370
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,260
 It's great when auctions have that little twist on them.

371
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,940
 There was another biscuit.

372
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,740
 Do you want to hear about the world's most expensive biscuit?

373
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,300
 Yeah.

374
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,060
 Do you just happen to have a biscuit factor?

375
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,700
 Well, I've also saw the thing about the Shackleton biscuit.

376
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,220
 All right, and then I thought, what's the most a biscuit's ever gone for?

377
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,460
 So a few weeks ago, it happened in October this year.

378
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,660
 A biscuit from the Titanic was auctioned.

379
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,140
 What?

380
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,100
 Yeah.

381
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,980
 It's old for 15,000 pounds.

382
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,780
 Wait, how?

383
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:59,580
 How did a biscuit survive had made its way into a lifeboat?

384
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:05,380
 Sorry, I mean, it was in a box and someone took the box

385
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,940
 and when they escaped the ship on a line.

386
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,780
 And it was in a sealed iron box or something.

387
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,460
 And that was one of the lifeboats which was picked up.

388
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,980
 So yeah, so that's the most expensive biscuit ever so far.

389
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,460
 Yeah, I don't want to rule out any future biscuits to go for more.

390
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:26,300
 I had a look for some unusual dog names and there was a website called petinsurance.com

391
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,580
 that collected a load of unusual dog names.

392
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:34,740
 But at the same time, by coincidence, I also found a list of the most unusual nicknames

393
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,020
 that men have for their genitals.

394
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,940
 Are we going to play dog or genitals?

395
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:46,020
 OK, I'll just read them in the order I have them.

396
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,020
 Baron von Ferry Pants.

397
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,020
 Oh!

398
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,020
 Dog.

399
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,020
 Correct.

400
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
 Ah!

401
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,020
 Lord Chubby Pruneface.

402
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
 Genital.

403
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
 Genital.

404
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,620
 No, that's a dog as well.

405
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,620
 Oh, no.

406
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,620
 Simon Wiggles Patello.

407
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,100
 Simon Wiggles Patello.

408
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,140
 Simon Wiggles Patello.

409
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,140
 Genital.

410
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,140
 Genital.

411
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,140
 No, dog.

412
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,140
 Ah!

413
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,500
 You got a dirty mind.

414
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
 OK.

415
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,060
 Prince Patches, oh, wholy having the third of Wilsher.

416
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,060
 Dog.

417
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,060
 Dog.

418
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,060
 Yeah.

419
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,060
 They were all dogs.

420
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,900
 I wouldn't give you any genitals.

421
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,060
 In the 15th century, the Duke of York, this is what he spent his time doing in those days,

422
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:35,820
 he wrote a list of 1,100 names that he considered appropriate for hunting dogs to advise people

423
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:43,060
 on what to call their dogs, so there were things like Troy, Genitals, Genital, yeah, nose wise,

424
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:51,580
 nameless, perony, clench, bragg, ringwood and hold fast.

425
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,580
 So there you go.

426
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,980
 That's what you're allowed to call your dogs, they're going to the Duke of York in the 15th

427
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,060
 century, if you ever find yourself there.

428
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,780
 Can I bring up a famous dog name?

429
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,780
 Yes, please.

430
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,780
 So Lassie.

431
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,780
 Oh, yeah.

432
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,100
 Lassie was originally called Paul, and that was the dog's name, Paul.

433
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,620
 Paul did all the movies, it was the single dog that did it.

434
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,700
 So when Paul died, they then took the litter, and when they grew up, they replaced Lassie,

435
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,380
 they became the next lassies.

436
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:18,300
 So every single lassie that you'd see in the early days was a descendant of the original

437
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
 lassie.

438
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
 Yeah.

439
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,780
 And then there was a huge controversy, I think it was in 1997, where suddenly the first non-blood-related

440
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,780
 lassie was used, and they were, yeah.

441
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,300
 And there were genuine protests.

442
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,140
 And people said, this is not on, and they were like, well, no, but we don't.

443
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,700
 And so they buckled, and then they did bring in another descendant of one of the descendants

444
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,700
 of Lassie.

445
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,580
 And then again, when another revival happened, they brought in another unrelated non-blood-line

446
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,580
 dog.

447
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:50,380
 Again, people freaked out, and it's been like that for ages up until very recently.

448
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:55,780
 And now one of the bloodline has come back into the fold and is the current lassie.

449
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:02,500
 But that's like saying that James Bond should be played by Sean Connery's grandson.

450
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:08,100
 I just, I love that somewhere in the world, someone is protesting strongly against something,

451
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,020
 and we have no idea for years and years.

452
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,500
 Do we know how many, was it like, Iraq, war, style, level?

453
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 No.

454
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,780
 It was me, my mum, my sister, at least six of us.

455
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,980
 Yeah, I don't know, to be honest.

456
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,180
 So, shall I put it out a stowaway on board, didn't he?

457
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,180
 Did he?

458
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,180
 Yeah, he did.

459
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,660
 And he regretted that decision.

460
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,420
 Should be landing in a nice one country by now.

461
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,420
 What happened?

462
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:38,180
 He was a guy called, he was a sailor called Perse Blackboro, and he was actually helped to

463
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,180
 sneak on board.

464
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,380
 He just really wanted to be part of the expedition, and he was discovered after three days, as I

465
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,380
 assume he expected to be.

466
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,380
 What was he going to do?

467
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,860
 I hide on the ship for a year.

468
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,020
 And so he was discovered after three days, and Shackleton, you know, threatened him

469
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,940
 a little bit, and said, "I can't believe you've done this, you're bastard."

470
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,420
 And eventually he said, "Okay, you can stay, but only if you sign this agreement saying,

471
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,460
 if you stay, you'll be the first person to be eaten if we need to start eating each other."

472
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,500
 And so he signed that agreement, and if they had had to eat each other, he would have

473
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,820
 been the first person to go.

474
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,820
 The nibbly got him.

475
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,740
 He's going, "But there's biscuits now."

476
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:17,820
 Okay, time for our next fact, fact number three, and that's my fact.

477
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:24,900
 My fact this week is that, according to a recent theory, Stonehenge was built as part of a team

478
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,180
 building exercise.

479
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,180
 I love that.

480
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,180
 I love that.

481
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,180
 Big away day.

482
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:38,460
 So this is, there are a lot of theories, by the way, about how Stonehenge came about, but

483
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,260
 the idea is that rather than it being a place that people returned to and so on, they seemed

484
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,700
 to have found evidence that it was occupied for about a decade, and that so it must have

485
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,300
 been built in that period of years, and then they left it once it was done, because apparently

486
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,200
 there weren't a lot of people back then, and the idea was to create something where people

487
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,420
 could come together, get to know each other, but do something that was a team building exercise,

488
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,900
 and the guy described it as glass refesible and a motorway building scheme at the same

489
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,900
 time.

490
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,900
 That's what it was.

491
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,900
 Yeah.

492
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
 Really?

493
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,900
 Someone said, "We're having a team building exercise.

494
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,140
 You need to book the next 10 years of work."

495
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,020
 Yeah, that's true.

496
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,380
 So when I read that sentence, I thought, "Oh, I bet that's a really mad idea," which

497
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,580
 obviously it probably is, but I did think it was druids that had built it and that it was

498
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,460
 part of this religion thing, this cult thing that they were doing, and it turns out that

499
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,260
 just we have no idea how it got there.

500
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,940
 There were so many theories, and they're all amazing theories, another recent theory.

501
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,740
 It's a prehistoric blockage feel, because apparently if you hit it, it rings in a really

502
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,740
 nice way.

503
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,380
 Acoustically, it's very amazing.

504
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,940
 So the hitting, hitting the stone thing does seem like a bridge too far for me, but it

505
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,700
 doesn't have exactly the same acoustics as a concert hall or a theatre or something, or a

506
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,180
 particular way you'd have musicals on, and so they do think that it was designed specifically

507
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,860
 so that the music, like any sounds inside it, would.

508
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,860
 That is good.

509
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,860
 Rebound.

510
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,780
 The thing that Dan said about the druids having built it is quite interesting that there is

511
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:06,580
 evidence that people were doing something at Stonehenge for every period from when it

512
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:11,500
 was built to now, apart from the late high-end age, which is a very time when the druids

513
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,860
 were supposed to have been around, and that's the only time in history.

514
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,260
 We don't really have any evidence of anything having happened there.

515
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,620
 They did have a load of druids there.

516
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:26,180
 They had a ceremony there in 1905 where 259 druids were inducted into druidism, but they

517
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,980
 were really mercilessly teased by the press on account of the fact that a lot of them had

518
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,980
 fake bids.

519
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:38,220
 Well, here's a very interesting fact about Stonehenge.

520
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,180
 Someone actually bought it at one point.

521
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,180
 Oh, yeah.

522
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:46,340
 He was sold at auction in a lot, and this husband called Cecille Shubb was sent by his wife to

523
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,420
 go to this auction, and he saw it was up for sale, and he thought, "Oh, that'll be a nice

524
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,180
 present for my wife."

525
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,660
 But when he got home, she was furious at him.

526
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:01,220
 She sent him to the auction to buy codons that she liked, and he came back with a hinge.

527
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,140
 He said that he bought it on a whim in the auction room.

528
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,140
 Yes.

529
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,380
 He said, "I just thought a local guy should own it, because he lived really nearby."

530
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,180
 So it's sort of a nice story that he bought it for his wife.

531
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,860
 And the thing about curtains is kind of too good to check, but it's right, okay.

532
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,240
 Another recent theory, it was a barbecue site.

533
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,700
 This is so they found a bunch of bones of animals, and when they were looking at their bones,

534
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,380
 they could see burn marks on it that suggested that quite like an Aussie barbecue, they were

535
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,140
 just sort of turning them over and cooking them nicely.

536
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,940
 It's amazing what they can do with the archaeology, they find bones, and they assume that it

537
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,820
 must be a barbecue or whatever.

538
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,860
 I read one thing that in the Iron Age in Wales, they had an annual party where the guests

539
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,220
 only ever had the right foreleg of pigs.

540
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,380
 And they found that, because they just found a big pile of the specific one leg of pigs

541
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,020
 all the time, and they lasted for years and years and years, and it seemed like they came

542
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,620
 from one year after another, after another, and they assumed that they just must have had

543
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,820
 this big party where you just got one leg off a pig and everyone had to.

544
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,260
 And we're sure that in those days, it wasn't just that pigs only had one right.

545
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,500
 They were like a pogo stick.

546
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,580
 That's an excellent point.

547
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,580
 Definitely.

548
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:16,260
 I was having a look through the British newspaper archive to see which, so that goes back

549
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,740
 about 300 years and gives you newspaper records from that time to see kind of what people

550
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,420
 thought of Stonehenge in the past.

551
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:27,240
 And so a lot of the articles in the early 1800s, around 1840, everyone thought that it

552
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,060
 had been brought over by the Egyptians, so people thought the stone from Stonehenge

553
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,500
 had been brought over from Africa to Egypt, and then the Egyptians, because they were considered

554
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,500
 such a civilized race or such a civilized people, and they had much better mechanics and engineering

555
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
 than we did.

556
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
 We were all still, you know, stuck in.

557
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,440
 They also thought, for a time, that it was only built about a thousand years ago, which

558
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
 it would be.

559
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
 Oh, I have a theory on this.

560
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
 When was Stonehenge built?

561
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
 2018.

562
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,640
 Yeah.

563
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
 It may be seen.

564
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
 OK.

565
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,640
 What would you say, if I told you it was 1958?

566
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
 [LAUGHTER]

567
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,500
 I'd say, Dan, be quiet.

568
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,940
 But every single stone at Stonehenge has been moved between 1901 and 1964.

569
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,940
 No.

570
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,940
 Almost every single one.

571
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,140
 So they were either moved or they were straightened.

572
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,520
 Some of them were set in concrete.

573
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,060
 This was just very early 20th century guys saying, ah, it's not quite right, is it?

574
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,660
 Why don't we just bodge it up and put some concrete under it?

575
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,100
 And they were very early cact-handed preservation.

576
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,540
 So I say that Stonehenge was built in the late 50s.

577
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
 [LAUGHTER]

578
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,540
 Yeah.

579
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
 That's a great theory.

580
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,140
 Well, you said that people thought that these stones came from Egypt, but they actually

581
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,020
 came from Wales, didn't they?

582
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,460
 They came from the Presley Hills in Wales.

583
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,900
 We know that now because of X-rays and stuff like that.

584
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,220
 But for 90 years, they were trying to dig on this particular hill.

585
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,820
 And then they found out that they were digging on the wrong hill.

586
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,860
 And it was another one, one mile away, that they should have been digging out.

587
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,380
 And Dr. Richard Bevins of the National Museum of Wales, he was a guy who found this out.

588
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,020
 And he said, I don't expect to be getting any Christmas cards from the archaeologists

589
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,780
 who have been excavating at the wrong place for the last 90 years.

590
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,460
 Well, most of them will be dead by now.

591
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,340
 [LAUGHTER]

592
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,300
 We're going to need to move on soon, by the way.

593
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,820
 OK, I have one quick thing.

594
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,940
 There's a company called Jackamo, who make clothes, especially for men.

595
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:17,580
 And they did a catalogue called the Architecture of Men, to identify modern kind of builds.

596
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,260
 And they said that Simon Cowell and Ricky Gervais are built like Stonehenge.

597
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,460
 Why?

598
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,140
 Apparently, they have short, stocky build, broad shoulders and chunky legs,

599
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,900
 according to Jackamo.

600
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,580
 Russell Crowe and Jay-Z look like the time bridge, according to these guys.

601
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,260
 What?

602
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,380
 And James Corden looks like the Girkin.

603
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,820
 [LAUGHTER]

604
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,820
 Harsh.

605
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,020
 It's very harsh.

606
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,180
 The Tasmanian town of Buckland built a replica of Stonehenge.

607
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,860
 There are loads of replicas all over the world.

608
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,780
 So there's a place called Phonehenge in South Carolina.

609
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,540
 And there's a place called Carhenge in Kansas made of old cars.

610
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,540
 And there's a live webcam that you can watch.

611
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,700
 I watched it for hours the other day.

612
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,780
 It's not much goes on.

613
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,620
 It's just a camera pointing at a carhenge.

614
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,060
 But yeah, you can watch that.

615
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,420
 But the Tasmanian-- there was a Tasmanian town called Buckland, which built one.

616
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,540
 And it was demolished by the authorities.

617
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,420
 And on the Wikipedia page where it says, "In keeping with the original Stonehenge,

618
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,340
 it did not have the necessary planning approval from the local council."

619
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,060
 [LAUGHTER]

620
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,260
 OK.

621
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,300
 Time for our final fact of the evening.

622
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,620
 And that is Chazinski.

623
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:32,340
 Oh, yeah, my fact is that Utah has a 106-acre forest that's made out of one tree.

624
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,100
 And this tree is so cool.

625
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,580
 It's called Pando.

626
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,940
 And it-- or some people call it the trembling giant.

627
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,060
 And it's a quaking aspen tree.

628
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,580
 And it's a clonal colony, which means that basically it's got the same root system.

629
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,180
 All the branches that stick up out of the ground are clones of the original tree.

630
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,900
 So it's all completely interconnected.

631
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,540
 Every single bit of it is genetically identical to every single other bit of it.

632
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,580
 And yeah, it takes up 106 acres.

633
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,220
 And it's this one tree.

634
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:01,980
 That's astonishing.

635
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,020
 It's incredible.

636
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,660
 It's so good.

637
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,620
 Pando means in Latin ice spread, which is why it's called that.

638
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,620
 And it's also the heaviest-known organism.

639
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,940
 It's really old as well.

640
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,900
 So the average age of each end of-- if you went into this forest and you saw one of the trees,

641
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,220
 it would be 130 years old.

642
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,460
 But the age of the roots is thought to be about 80,000 years old.

643
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,620
 But could be 800,000 years old.

644
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,420
 400,000.

645
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,380
 200,000.

646
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,780
 To be ridiculous.

647
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,180
 [LAUGHTER]

648
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,580
 It's amazing this tree, though, has been growing for 200,000 years.

649
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,060
 Is it one tree, though, or is it low to no tree?

650
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,220
 Yeah, it's definitely one tree that is--

651
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,060
 It's the same organism as that.

652
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,340
 It's one organism.

653
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,940
 It's all completely interconnected.

654
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,340
 It's just like a tree whose branches go underground and then come back up again.

655
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,020
 Wow.

656
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,540
 It is.

657
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,340
 Very cool.

658
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,460
 It's so great.

659
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,380
 So Utah, where it is, as far as Utah is really amazing.

660
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,700
 I didn't realize how cool Utah is.

661
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,900
 So Utah is where Kentucky fried chickens from?

662
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,900
 [LAUGHTER]

663
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
 Absolutely true.

664
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,700
 Are you sure?

665
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,460
 Yeah, absolutely true.

666
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,260
 Colonel Sanders was visiting Utah and there was an existing restaurant.

667
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,660
 And he went inside the restaurant.

668
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,140
 And he went there specifically because he liked the owners.

669
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,940
 And he said, I have this interesting chicken.

670
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,620
 And so he did the recipe and they advertised outside.

671
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,620
 He was away when they started selling it in the shop.

672
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,180
 And they said, what should we call it?

673
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,500
 And it could have been Utah fried chickens from Kentucky.

674
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,860
 He said, if you call it UFC, people would just be fighting there all the time.

675
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,580
 So Kentucky fried chicken, they said, let's call it Kentucky fried chicken,

676
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,060
 because he's from Kentucky.

677
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,540
 And then when he came back, he realized how big it was.

678
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,660
 And they opened up the first ever KFC there.

679
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,820
 And then it spread around America.

680
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,900
 So Kentucky fried chicken is from Utah.

681
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,660
 Wow.

682
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,340
 Not know that.

683
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:43,860
 That's very good.

684
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,180
 Yeah.

685
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,060
 And also NASA planned for our trips to Mars there.

686
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,460
 So in the Utah desert, they

687
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:54,060
 have these stations where they put astronauts in for a bunch of days, weeks, months.

688
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,860
 And while I was reading this, I discovered something.

689
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,340
 I never heard of this.

690
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,380
 NASA has actually created, or at least someone from NASA, a Mars flag.

691
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,700
 Do you know, we have a Mars flag?

692
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,220
 What?

693
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:03,700
 No.

694
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,220
 What's that mean?

695
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,460
 What's that for when we go to Mars?

696
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,100
 For when we go to Mars, we have a flag now.

697
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,900
 And if you look at it, it's like the French flag.

698
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,100
 It's sort of vertical stripes, three.

699
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,260
 And it starts red.

700
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,180
 And then it goes red.

701
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,180
 Red.

702
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,180
 [LAUGHTER]

703
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,500
 So it goes red and then green and then blue.

704
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,300
 And the idea is that that's gradually how we would be making the planet.

705
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,100
 And I've never known this.

706
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
 So Mars has a flag.

707
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,460
 What about when we get there?

708
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,620
 And the Martians say, we have a red flag.

709
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,140
 Thanks.

710
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,100
 Have you guys seen the-- this is not your topic.

711
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,020
 But New Zealand is trying to redesign its flag at the moment.

712
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,540
 Or actually, the final design may have gone through now.

713
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,100
 Have you seen the suggestions for the newly designed flag?

714
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,220
 And I've always thought I don't understand why flags in the world are so boring.

715
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,660
 And they've really nailed it this time.

716
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,940
 So a lot of the entries that have been submitted

717
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,740
 are, I think, the best one was of a Kiwi, which

718
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,220
 was not the same color as a Kiwi.

719
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,180
 I don't know what color it is.

720
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,820
 And it's shooting red lasers out of its eyes into the corner of the flag.

721
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,900
 And that's being reported as, yes, we'll give it a good thing.

722
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,700
 Yeah.

723
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,540
 Oh, back to trees, yeah.

724
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,220
 So there is a tree of the year in Europe every year.

725
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,700
 And this year's tree of the year is an Estonian oak tree

726
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,980
 that's in the middle of a football field.

727
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,500
 It's in the Arisare Stadium.

728
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,380
 And if you Google it, you can see pitch of it.

729
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,420
 It's right in the middle of a pitch.

730
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,420
 Wow.

731
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,740
 In the middle of a stadium.

732
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,100
 And according to visit Estonia, when the stadium was being built,

733
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,860
 the Soviet technology could not beat the oak.

734
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,020
 And therefore, it was never uprooted.

735
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,700
 And so it's kind of a sign of--

736
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,140
 Oh, I see, sort of, independence, and play, exactly.

737
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,820
 And then it also says on the website,

738
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,260
 today, everyone is so used to their extra player on the field

739
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,860
 that the tree is hardly noticed during the games.

740
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,860
 And I promise you, it is massive.

741
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,060
 There is no way the ball does not hit this tree

742
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,300
 every single time it got us anywhere.

743
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,060
 Well, so that was Tree of the Year 2015.

744
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,860
 And they're gearing up to announce Tree of the Year 2016

745
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,460
 nominations have begun.

746
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,020
 And I read the British nominations this year.

747
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,900
 So a tree featured in the Game of Thrones series

748
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,900
 has been nominated, which is very exciting.

749
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,260
 And this is a laboo pick, is it?

750
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,700
 There are also laboo picks from Britain.

751
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,460
 It's going to be like Eurovision all over again.

752
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,780
 Because there's classic trees in it.

753
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,980
 There's the tree that the Magna Carta was supposedly signed

754
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,300
 under.

755
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,020
 There's the tree where Charles II hid.

756
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,140
 There's the tree where apparently Robin Hood hid under as well.

757
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,940
 There must be the four-tingle you, then.

758
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,580
 This is the tree that apparently is the oldest tree

759
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,460
 in Britain and possibly in Europe.

760
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,180
 And it's the tree under which Legend says Pontius Pilate

761
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,180
 hid it's in--

762
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,180
 Or just Pilate.

763
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

764
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,500
 He left the Middle East.

765
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,300
 Yeah, to hang out with Scotland under a tree.

766
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,940
 Yeah, it's thought that that's where he went.

767
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,380
 And this has hit the news recently because--

768
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,180
 so it's about 5,000 years old.

769
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,460
 It's thought-- so possibly the oldest tree in Europe.

770
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,620
 And it is just having a sex change.

771
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,940
 So it's mid-op right now.

772
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,900
 So what on earth does that mean?

773
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,380
 It's been a male for, well, almost 5,000 years.

774
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,260
 And it's just-- so it doesn't produce fruit.

775
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,300
 So a lot of plants, I think, most plants actually

776
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,780
 don't have genders, but a lot of plants

777
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,380
 are either male or female, have male parts or female parts.

778
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,380
 And it's been a male for almost 5,000 years.

779
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,540
 And someone noticed recently it was growing fruit, which

780
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,380
 the men don't do.

781
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,780
 And one of its arms is having a sex change and becoming a female.

782
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,300
 Wow.

783
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,060
 So that's good for the four-tingle you.

784
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,340
 That's astonishing.

785
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,860
 The England's tallest tree is a Douglas fair, which

786
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,100
 is on X-Moll and near Dunster.

787
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,900
 I visited it a few years ago.

788
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,060
 But they don't tell you exactly where it is.

789
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,460
 They just tell you it's kind of in this forest somewhere.

790
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,260
 Because people like you were going chop it down.

791
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,700
 There was a whole thing where James--

792
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,100
 Have you heard of the Chillingham cattle?

793
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,340
 There's a herd of wild cattle up in--

794
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:50,940
 Is it Yorkshire?

795
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,900
 Very, very Northumberland.

796
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,660
 Northumberland, really, really way up North.

797
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,380
 No one has touched these cows for 300 years, right?

798
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,860
 The field is completely sealed.

799
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,980
 They live, they breed, they die, all on their own.

800
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,580
 They occasionally they throw over a bale of hay

801
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,660
 or some extra food in the harsh winters.

802
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,260
 And as soon as James heard about this,

803
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,300
 he said, I'm going to go there and touch them.

804
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,260
 And now they're all in therapy.

805
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:13,740
 Sorry.

806
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,900
 I did say that, I didn't go.

807
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,660
 But you did visit the tree, though.

808
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,220
 No, well, I went to see the tree.

809
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,180
 And I just thought that it's the tallest tree.

810
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,140
 You're going to know which one it is, right?

811
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,020
 Well, they haven't planted it around loads of big trees.

812
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,340
 But basically, it is around the load of big trees.

813
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,900
 And so you just go there and you just kind of have

814
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,100
 to take the word for it that is there, really.

815
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,380
 But the US has a national register of big trees.

816
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,860
 But again, they don't tell you where any of the trees are.

817
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,980
 They just tell you the general area where they are

818
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,540
 and say it's called this, and it's this height.

819
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,620
 And there was a spokesman from American Forest

820
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,940
 who does this register.

821
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,540
 And he says, we don't want to send flocks of tree

822
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,420
 spotters and paparazzi to harass the trees

823
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,820
 and ruin their lives.

824
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,220
 Which sounds like he's talking about me, doesn't it?

825
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,140
 Yeah.

826
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,100
 Have you heard of the world's rarest tree?

827
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,620
 No.

828
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,140
 No, it's so cool.

829
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,700
 It's a tree called Penentia, Belisiana.

830
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,780
 Where is it?

831
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,460
 I'm not telling you.

832
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,380
 [LAUGHTER]

833
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,100
 From 1945, for about 70 years, there was only one in the world.

834
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,180
 And it was on a tiny island off New Zealand.

835
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,180
 And it became the last in the world when humans

836
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,660
 introduced goats to the island.

837
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,340
 And they ate all the other trees.

838
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,860
 Oh, my God.

839
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,660
 I think they found out just in time that this was the last one.

840
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,060
 But scientists have found a way of growing a load

841
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,980
 of new seedlings, so they've planted a load.

842
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,020
 Oh, we're going to have to wrap up really soon.

843
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,740
 Can I just give a recommendation to everyone here

844
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,500
 if they haven't already seen it?

845
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,900
 Since you mentioned goats, have you ever

846
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:47,540
 seen the Argania trees, which are the trees that goats climb up?

847
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:52,580
 So there's a tree called the Argania tree and goats climb it.

848
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,300
 And yeah, you just see them in its branches.

849
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,900
 And just look it up, A-R-G-A-N-I-A.

850
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,900
 Wow.

851
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,180
 How many goats do you get in one tree?

852
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,860
 There are pictures of at least a dozen, I would say.

853
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,660
 Wow.

854
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,740
 And that's just so much for these trees.

855
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,500
 Don't tell them at all.

856
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,820
 OK, I think we should wrap up.

857
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,220
 That's it.

858
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,060
 That's all of our facts.

859
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,660
 Thank you so much for listening.

860
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,620
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

861
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,580
 about the things we've said over the course of this podcast,

862
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,020
 you can get us on our Twitter accounts.

863
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,220
 I'm on @Sriberland.

864
