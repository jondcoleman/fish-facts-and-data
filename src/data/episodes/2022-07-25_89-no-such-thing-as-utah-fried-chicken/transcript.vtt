00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.680
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:14.780
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.400
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.440
 this week coming to you from Cambridge.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.280
 My name is Dan Treiber and please welcome

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.140
 to the stage, it's the regular elves,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.020
 Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski, and James Harkin.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.020
 (audience cheering)

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.800
 (audience applauding)

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.760
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.240
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.480
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.360
 Starting with you, Andy Murray.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.660
 - My fact this week is that before trains had corridors,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.080
 guards had to climb along the outside of the carriage

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.060
 to check your ticket.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.040
 (audience laughing)

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.040
 That is so amazing.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.760
 - And they did it while the train was moving.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.860
 - And this was a thing, this happened.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.900
 Carriages used to not be, you couldn't go through a carriage.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.540
 You would get in at one end, they closed the door,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.140
 they'd lock it, you were locked in for the whole journey,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380
 then at the other end they'd unlock it, and that you'd get.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.700
 And it was just across the train,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.900
 instead of front to back through the train.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.820
 - Well you locked in for health and safety reasons.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.240
 - I think partly you were locked in

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.740
 so you wouldn't try and sneak into first class.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.580
 - Wow, yeah.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.780
 - I don't think they were that bothered about

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.580
 health and safety, if you have a guy climbing

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.580
 on the outside of the carriage.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.460
 - Indeed, that's where it seems to fall down.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 How did it get, was there a ledge?

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.540
 - There was a little, they call it a running board.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.180
 So just on the outside of the carriage

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.140
 at the bus, there's a little plate that you could climb on.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.380
 But it wasn't even a continuous running board,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.740
 it was intermittent, so you had to climb along

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.940
 between the beds, and the people did suggest,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.700
 why don't we give people a continuous running board?

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.780
 And the train company said,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.860
 "No, no, passengers will use them to sneak into first class."

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.260
 (audience laughing)

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
 - How good was first class?

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.220
 - It was, it was awful, 'cause it was 1840.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.420
 - Oh yeah, these people's are desperate.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.740
 - I bet in those days you just had to always

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.420
 know where your ticket was, 'cause if you were stuck

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.980
 there going, "Oh, where is it in this guy's outside going?

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.620
 "Find the ticket!"

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.460
 There is a tunnel coming.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.500
 (audience laughing)

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.780
 - How fast did the trains used to go?

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.620
 - Well, these were really early ones, so maybe,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.260
 I mean, about 40 miles an hour comfortably.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.740
 - People thought that if they went over a certain speed,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.540
 then your body wouldn't be able to deal with it, didn't they?

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.180
 - Yeah, they said that the human body would not be able

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.700
 to endure speeds of 25 miles per hour.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.460
 Someone said that to start off with.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.180
 And then someone else in America wrote that if a woman's body

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.420
 accelerated past 50 miles an hour,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.420
 then her uterus would go shooting out of her body.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.900
 (audience laughing)

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.660
 - And that's the plot of speed three.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.580
 (audience laughing)

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.660
 - You'll never look as tangible

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.900
 like the same way again.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.500
 - When trains first got to the Isle of White,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.740
 well, they were taken to the Isle of White, obviously.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.220
 (audience laughing)

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.300
 Wasn't a rogue train, which went off the rails.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.820
 (audience laughing)

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.260
 - So the first ever journey, it was a four mile track

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.620
 and it went along its route in less than 10 minutes.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.940
 And I think that's, I've worked it out about 30 miles an hour,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.740
 give or take, we're not sure exactly at the time.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.460
 But that was apparently faster than anyone had ever traveled

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.500
 on the Isle of White until that point in history.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.860
 - That's pretty cool.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.380
 I was reading about in the 1800s, 1827,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.340
 there was a race between a train and a horse.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.140
 But, and check it out, this is a bit unfair on the horse's side.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.900
 The horse was towing a train.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.900
 (audience laughing)

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.740
 - It was unfair.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.220
 (audience laughing)

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.940
 - It was back in the day when horses used to pull trains

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.860
 prior to the engine.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.900
 And so this was an example of showing

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.020
 that potentially an engine could beat a horse.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.300
 And it probably would have, but one of the wheels

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.660
 or a little band around the wheels burst.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.980
 And so they had to stop the train.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.820
 So it wasn't the lead and then the horse took over.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.940
 But there was an actual, let's have this as a big race,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.100
 horse versus train.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.060
 - So things were always going wrong.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.420
 So at the 1829 display of, you know,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.140
 which train is the best train,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.780
 10 different types of train entered this competition.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.660
 Five of them didn't even show up on the day.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.220
 So I think broke down before they made it to the venue.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.340
 So five trains entered.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.020
 Stevenson's rocket being one of them.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.260
 And only one of them completed the trial.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.180
 So Stevenson's rocket didn't win because it was the best.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.100
 It won because it was the only train

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.860
 that managed to not break.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.740
 Or so the cycloped, do you remember the cycloped train,

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.580
 which was one of the--

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.300
 - I remember it personally.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.300
 - I mean, I know I'm old.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.420
 - I didn't think of you, but.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.260
 - I did look at you directly there for a reason.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.980
 - The cycloped train sounds like a quite a cool design,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.060
 which is a, it's led by a horse,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.340
 but it's a horse on a treadmill.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.260
 And the horse, the treadmill that the horse is walking

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.820
 on powers the train.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.900
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.100
 - Yeah, so really cool.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.020
 But the horse, the demonstrations,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.660
 the horse fell through the floor of the train.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.220
 And so that failed, obviously.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.420
 - I once fell on a treadmill.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.740
 (laughing)

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.780
 Anyone want to hear that?

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.780
 No.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.620
 Really?

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.580
 Oh, okay, I was a kid.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.900
 It was my first time on a treadmill.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.140
 So one of the ones that you put the actual is electric

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.740
 and it was going like crazy.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.980
 I put it up to 10 and I thought this is going to be incredible.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.500
 And I tested with my hands on the side,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.380
 whether I could run on it.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.540
 And I thought, yeah, that's easy.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.420
 So, with one jump, I just jumped onto it

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.180
 and immediately my two legs went,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.860
 "Whoop!"

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.540
 And I fell on my face on it.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.700
 I got shot off the back, but it was on a carpet.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.500
 And so everything went right off it except for my face.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.780
 And for about half a minute,

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.420
 I was going, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.220
 That explains an awful lot.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.820
 (laughing)

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.300
 - It does also explain why I didn't get into, "Okay, go."

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.900
 (laughing)

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.260
 - Do you guys know about the city of crush in Texas?

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.340
 - No, it was from an extremely brief period,

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.260
 the second largest city in Texas.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.820
 This was in 1896.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.980
 And that was because 40,000 people came to it.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.380
 And that was because someone had decided to stage

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.140
 a train crash.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.620
 So this was 40,000 people went to,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.020
 it was organized by this guy called William Krush.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.500
 And he said, I guess we're going to say, yeah.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.140
 He said he was going to just fire two trains towards each other.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.260
 So he had like four miles of track created for the purpose.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.820
 And 40,000 people came.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.860
 And there was such demand that people did have to sit

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.140
 on top of trains in order to get there

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.340
 'cause they couldn't squeeze into the carriages.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.340
 And then at 5 p.m., these two trains started going towards

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.140
 each other, picking up speed, picking up speed.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.260
 And Krush stood right in the middle of the railway

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.380
 on a white horse and then he waved a big flag,

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.220
 saying they're coming.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.060
 It's all right, he survived.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.060
 - Oh, thank God.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.900
 (laughing)

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.580
 - He stepped out of the way sort of at the last minute.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.660
 The two trains crashed into each other.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.660
 Both of their boilers exploded and a bunch of people died.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.140
 - So when he said it's all right, it wasn't completely all right.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.140
 - Well, here's the thing.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.420
 Krush got fired that evening and then the company

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.180
 that he worked for, Relented and Hired him again,

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.740
 the next day, the rail company.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.060
 And he worked at the same rail company

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.340
 for the rest of his life.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.500
 - What?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.500
 - We're going to need to move on

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.780
 to the next fact soon, ish.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.220
 - Okay, so there's a guy called Andrew Dowd.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.340
 He's from Wiggin, up in my neck of the woods.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.340
 And he visited all 2,548 railway stations in Britain

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.700
 between 2010 and 2014 in his car.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.940
 (laughing)

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.980
 - Need we ask why?

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.100
 - Well, people asked him that in the newspaper articles,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.900
 but he didn't really kind of have a very good reason.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.140
 He said, I started doing it round near where I lived

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.220
 and I kind of enjoyed it.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.980
 So I thought I'd do the whole country.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.500
 And they said to him, asked him what he did.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.660
 And he said, I take a little look around if it's interesting,

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.260
 but most out, very interesting.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.220
 (laughing)

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.540
 - Wow.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.380
 - Why not?

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.220
 - Yeah.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.660
 - I like to think there's an equivalent train driver

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.540
 who's planning to visit all the petrol stations

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.700
 in Britain on the train.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.140
 (laughing)

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.660
 - Wouldn't it be visiting all the car parking spaces?

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.180
 - Yeah, right, there was a bad analogy.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.460
 Yeah, that's better.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.500
 - No, it was harder to visit all the car parking spaces

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.140
 'cause there are so many these days.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.340
 (laughing)

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.180
 Anyway.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.900
 (laughing)

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.940
 - Okay, time for fact number two.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.740
 (laughing)

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.580
 And that is James Harkin.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.060
 - Okay, my fact this week is that Ernest Shackleton's

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.740
 dog's names included slippery sloppers,

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.940
 satin, painful, swanker, bummer, and bob.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.340
 (laughing)

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.340
 It's swankish over, he's the wanker.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.180
 (laughing)

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.740
 Do you know the history?

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.940
 - Well, they all had different names for different reasons.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.060
 I got this fact actually from a guy on Twitter called

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.540
 @davepain164, and it made me laugh,

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.020
 and so I thought I'd use it on the podcast,

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.500
 and it kind of fits in with one thing that I like,

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.700
 which is just going through lists of ridiculous data

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.860
 and trying to find funny bits or whatever.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.060
 But they got the names for lots of different reasons.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.460
 Some of them were nicknames that are people on the ship.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.900
 So it could have been short for he's a wanker, I guess.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.340
 It's possible.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.140
 The dogs all came from Canada and they had names already.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.100
 So some of them like Bob was already a name,

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.580
 and they just kept that.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.460
 So some of them were changed like Bismarck, Napoleon,

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.100
 and three dogs all named Carlos.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.340
 (laughing)

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.940
 They had to change all of those.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:08.980
 (laughing)

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.540
 - What a great name for a dog.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.380
 (laughing)

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.140
 - What's the, in just like a basic two sentences

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.460
 or a few more, Shackleton, just the background of Shackleton?

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.820
 - Polar Explorer.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.980
 Went down to try and get to the South Pole, didn't quite make it.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.340
 Became the furthest South of that anyone had ever got.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.580
 Abinson beat him to the South Pole,

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.060
 and so he went on another expedition

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.100
 to go across the whole of the South Pole from one side

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.100
 to the other, and then ended in disaster again.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.900
 And he became famous for a big sort of escape

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.500
 from the ice-filled islands of Elephant's Island.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.340
 - Okay.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.420
 - And now you don't need to watch the 12-part documentary

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.580
 (laughing)

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.900
 Shackleton.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.020
 I like this.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.260
 So there were a bunch of quite interesting people

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.020
 on board the expedition.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.340
 So they had like official photographer, Frank Hurley,

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.260
 who used to like risk his life trying to get good photos

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.180
 because his only priority on this life-and-daging expedition

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.060
 was to make sure he could make money when he saw the pictures

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.020
 when he got back so he'd climb right to the top of the mast

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.740
 or go out onto the yard arm and hang from it to take good photos.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.100
 And they also had an on-ship artist.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.860
 And I just like this quote,

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.860
 I kind of remember where I read this in an account

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.580
 of when they were stranded on Elephant Island.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.740
 So they were sort of like, we're definitely going to die now.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.700
 No one's going to find us here.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.140
 How on earth are we going to survive?

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.660
 And at one point, it was said this ship's artist,

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.460
 George Marston, allowed his remaining oil paints

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.300
 to be used as glue to make the canvases cover the shelter properly.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.380
 And I like the idea that there was a little bit of a debate there.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.020
 I have more facts about the dogs.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.620
 I do want.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.860
 So they were trapped on the ice for months and months and months.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.540
 I think 15 months, maybe, and an amazing amount of time.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.900
 So Frank Hurley wrote loads of notes about all the dogs.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.660
 And there was Shakespeare, a steamer, Wallaby Satan,

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.820
 who was a treacherous brute.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.420
 Sue is a flirt.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.660
 They've been on the ice for a long time, haven't they?

00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.660
 Bummer.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.260
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.660
 And then there was Snapper.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.660
 It does not snap at all.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.860
 And they built the dogs a town.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.780
 They built a little town.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.780
 They called Dog Town.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.140
 They built a lot of dog igloos out of ice and wood.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.700
 And they built a pup-loo for the puppies that have been born.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.100
 And they built a pig-loo because they had some pigs with them as well.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:20.860
 A pig-loo.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:21.900
 Yeah, that's great, isn't it?

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.940
 It's pretty cool.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.300
 But they ate a lot of these animals.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.540
 And they had a ship's cat as well.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.060
 They did.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.980
 The ship's cat was called Mr. Chippy.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.180
 Mrs. Chippy?

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.180
 Yes, Mrs. Chippy.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.180
 It was always a male.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.180
 Yeah.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.460
 And it belonged to the cruise carpenter, Harry McNiss.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.460
 And they decided to kill it because it was using up a lot of the meat.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.820
 But Harry McNiss was not very happy about that at all

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.300
 and got into a massive fight with Shackleton, didn't he?

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.140
 Yeah.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.140
 He was Scottish, wasn't he?

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:49.820
 Yeah, that's right.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.420
 Harry McNiss.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.620
 And someone who met him said the only thing I ever heard him talk about

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.700
 was the fact that Shackleton killed his cat, which, you know,

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.140
 they were in a difficult spot, I think.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.900
 But he then really got furious.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.740
 And he and Shackleton, as you say, had a huge route.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.620
 And he was the only one of the expedition.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.220
 I think all 28 men survived.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.380
 There was a separate supply mission where a few of them end up.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.300
 But all of the men with Shackleton survived.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.860
 It was this huge survival story.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.340
 He was the only one later denied this polar medal

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.580
 that all the others got for insubordination.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.180
 Wow.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.940
 You know that Shackleton's medals went up for sale

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.580
 in auction not too long ago.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.820
 And they got a ridiculous amount of money.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.900
 It was about 800,000 pounds.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.740
 And I started looking into the kind of stuff

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.740
 that gets auctioned off from those trips.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.220
 Discovered that-- this is quite recent--

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.460
 one of the biscuits that they didn't eat

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:42.580
 went up for auction recently and was bought for 1,250 euros.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.620
 I definitely would have bought that.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.340
 That's so cheap.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.220
 A biscuit from a Shackleton, isn't it?

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:51.220
 They ate the dogs before eating that biscuit.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.020
 No, because probably someone went when we bring this back,

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.380
 this biscuit will be worth a fortune.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.580
 No, but so apparently Shackleton was giving

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.900
 one of his fellow explorers Frank wild a biscuit

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.300
 from one of the rations.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.260
 And while recorded in the diary--

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.540
 and this is how spare food was back then--

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.460
 thousands of pounds would not have bought that biscuit.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.820
 So that's how great it was.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.460
 And so it's quite nice that now it has gone

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.220
 for over 1,000 pounds.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.020
 I love-- so I read also as well recently in an auction,

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.140
 the head of the scouts, Robert Baden-Powell,

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.620
 a letter that he wrote to an autograph hunter saying

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.940
 you should not become an autograph hunter,

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.980
 recently sold at an auction to an autograph hunter.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.260
 It's great when auctions have that little twist on them.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.940
 There was another biscuit.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.740
 Do you want to hear about the world's most expensive biscuit?

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.300
 Yeah.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.060
 Do you just happen to have a biscuit factor?

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.700
 Well, I've also saw the thing about the Shackleton biscuit.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.220
 All right, and then I thought, what's the most a biscuit's ever gone for?

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.460
 So a few weeks ago, it happened in October this year.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.660
 A biscuit from the Titanic was auctioned.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.140
 What?

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.100
 Yeah.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.980
 It's old for 15,000 pounds.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:54.780
 Wait, how?

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.580
 How did a biscuit survive had made its way into a lifeboat?

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:05.380
 Sorry, I mean, it was in a box and someone took the box

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.940
 and when they escaped the ship on a line.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.780
 And it was in a sealed iron box or something.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.460
 And that was one of the lifeboats which was picked up.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.980
 So yeah, so that's the most expensive biscuit ever so far.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.460
 Yeah, I don't want to rule out any future biscuits to go for more.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:26.300
 I had a look for some unusual dog names and there was a website called petinsurance.com

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.580
 that collected a load of unusual dog names.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:34.740
 But at the same time, by coincidence, I also found a list of the most unusual nicknames

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.020
 that men have for their genitals.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.940
 Are we going to play dog or genitals?

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:46.020
 OK, I'll just read them in the order I have them.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.020
 Baron von Ferry Pants.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.020
 Oh!

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.020
 Dog.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.020
 Correct.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.020
 Ah!

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.020
 Lord Chubby Pruneface.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.020
 Genital.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.020
 Genital.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.620
 No, that's a dog as well.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.620
 Oh, no.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.620
 Simon Wiggles Patello.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.100
 Simon Wiggles Patello.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.140
 Simon Wiggles Patello.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.140
 Genital.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.140
 Genital.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.140
 No, dog.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.140
 Ah!

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.500
 You got a dirty mind.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.500
 OK.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.060
 Prince Patches, oh, wholy having the third of Wilsher.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.060
 Dog.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.060
 Dog.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.060
 Yeah.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.060
 They were all dogs.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.900
 I wouldn't give you any genitals.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.060
 In the 15th century, the Duke of York, this is what he spent his time doing in those days,

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:35.820
 he wrote a list of 1,100 names that he considered appropriate for hunting dogs to advise people

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:43.060
 on what to call their dogs, so there were things like Troy, Genitals, Genital, yeah, nose wise,

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:51.580
 nameless, perony, clench, bragg, ringwood and hold fast.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.580
 So there you go.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.980
 That's what you're allowed to call your dogs, they're going to the Duke of York in the 15th

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.060
 century, if you ever find yourself there.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.780
 Can I bring up a famous dog name?

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.780
 Yes, please.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.780
 So Lassie.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.780
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.100
 Lassie was originally called Paul, and that was the dog's name, Paul.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.620
 Paul did all the movies, it was the single dog that did it.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:11.700
 So when Paul died, they then took the litter, and when they grew up, they replaced Lassie,

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.380
 they became the next lassies.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:18.300
 So every single lassie that you'd see in the early days was a descendant of the original

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.300
 lassie.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.300
 Yeah.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.780
 And then there was a huge controversy, I think it was in 1997, where suddenly the first non-blood-related

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.780
 lassie was used, and they were, yeah.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.300
 And there were genuine protests.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.140
 And people said, this is not on, and they were like, well, no, but we don't.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:38.700
 And so they buckled, and then they did bring in another descendant of one of the descendants

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.700
 of Lassie.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.580
 And then again, when another revival happened, they brought in another unrelated non-blood-line

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.580
 dog.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:50.380
 Again, people freaked out, and it's been like that for ages up until very recently.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:55.780
 And now one of the bloodline has come back into the fold and is the current lassie.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:02.500
 But that's like saying that James Bond should be played by Sean Connery's grandson.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:08.100
 I just, I love that somewhere in the world, someone is protesting strongly against something,

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.020
 and we have no idea for years and years.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.500
 Do we know how many, was it like, Iraq, war, style, level?

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.500
 No.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.780
 It was me, my mum, my sister, at least six of us.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:19.980
 Yeah, I don't know, to be honest.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.180
 So, shall I put it out a stowaway on board, didn't he?

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.180
 Did he?

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.180
 Yeah, he did.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.660
 And he regretted that decision.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.420
 Should be landing in a nice one country by now.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.420
 What happened?

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:38.180
 He was a guy called, he was a sailor called Perse Blackboro, and he was actually helped to

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.180
 sneak on board.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.380
 He just really wanted to be part of the expedition, and he was discovered after three days, as I

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.380
 assume he expected to be.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.380
 What was he going to do?

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.860
 I hide on the ship for a year.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.020
 And so he was discovered after three days, and Shackleton, you know, threatened him

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.940
 a little bit, and said, "I can't believe you've done this, you're bastard."

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.420
 And eventually he said, "Okay, you can stay, but only if you sign this agreement saying,

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.460
 if you stay, you'll be the first person to be eaten if we need to start eating each other."

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.500
 And so he signed that agreement, and if they had had to eat each other, he would have

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.820
 been the first person to go.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.820
 The nibbly got him.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.740
 He's going, "But there's biscuits now."

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:17.820
 Okay, time for our next fact, fact number three, and that's my fact.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:24.900
 My fact this week is that, according to a recent theory, Stonehenge was built as part of a team

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.180
 building exercise.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.180
 I love that.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.180
 I love that.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.180
 Big away day.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:38.460
 So this is, there are a lot of theories, by the way, about how Stonehenge came about, but

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:43.260
 the idea is that rather than it being a place that people returned to and so on, they seemed

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.700
 to have found evidence that it was occupied for about a decade, and that so it must have

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.300
 been built in that period of years, and then they left it once it was done, because apparently

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.200
 there weren't a lot of people back then, and the idea was to create something where people

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.420
 could come together, get to know each other, but do something that was a team building exercise,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.900
 and the guy described it as glass refesible and a motorway building scheme at the same

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.900
 time.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.900
 That's what it was.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.900
 Yeah.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.900
 Really?

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.900
 Someone said, "We're having a team building exercise.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.140
 You need to book the next 10 years of work."

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.020
 Yeah, that's true.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.380
 So when I read that sentence, I thought, "Oh, I bet that's a really mad idea," which

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.580
 obviously it probably is, but I did think it was druids that had built it and that it was

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:25.460
 part of this religion thing, this cult thing that they were doing, and it turns out that

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.260
 just we have no idea how it got there.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.940
 There were so many theories, and they're all amazing theories, another recent theory.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.740
 It's a prehistoric blockage feel, because apparently if you hit it, it rings in a really

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.740
 nice way.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.380
 Acoustically, it's very amazing.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:43.940
 So the hitting, hitting the stone thing does seem like a bridge too far for me, but it

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.700
 doesn't have exactly the same acoustics as a concert hall or a theatre or something, or a

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:52.180
 particular way you'd have musicals on, and so they do think that it was designed specifically

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.860
 so that the music, like any sounds inside it, would.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.860
 That is good.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.860
 Rebound.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.780
 The thing that Dan said about the druids having built it is quite interesting that there is

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:06.580
 evidence that people were doing something at Stonehenge for every period from when it

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:11.500
 was built to now, apart from the late high-end age, which is a very time when the druids

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.860
 were supposed to have been around, and that's the only time in history.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.260
 We don't really have any evidence of anything having happened there.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.620
 They did have a load of druids there.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:26.180
 They had a ceremony there in 1905 where 259 druids were inducted into druidism, but they

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.980
 were really mercilessly teased by the press on account of the fact that a lot of them had

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:30.980
 fake bids.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:38.220
 Well, here's a very interesting fact about Stonehenge.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.180
 Someone actually bought it at one point.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.180
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:46.340
 He was sold at auction in a lot, and this husband called Cecille Shubb was sent by his wife to

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:50.420
 go to this auction, and he saw it was up for sale, and he thought, "Oh, that'll be a nice

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.180
 present for my wife."

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.660
 But when he got home, she was furious at him.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:21:01.220
 She sent him to the auction to buy codons that she liked, and he came back with a hinge.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.140
 He said that he bought it on a whim in the auction room.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.140
 Yes.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.380
 He said, "I just thought a local guy should own it, because he lived really nearby."

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.180
 So it's sort of a nice story that he bought it for his wife.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.860
 And the thing about curtains is kind of too good to check, but it's right, okay.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.240
 Another recent theory, it was a barbecue site.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.700
 This is so they found a bunch of bones of animals, and when they were looking at their bones,

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.380
 they could see burn marks on it that suggested that quite like an Aussie barbecue, they were

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.140
 just sort of turning them over and cooking them nicely.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.940
 It's amazing what they can do with the archaeology, they find bones, and they assume that it

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.820
 must be a barbecue or whatever.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:41.860
 I read one thing that in the Iron Age in Wales, they had an annual party where the guests

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.220
 only ever had the right foreleg of pigs.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.380
 And they found that, because they just found a big pile of the specific one leg of pigs

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.020
 all the time, and they lasted for years and years and years, and it seemed like they came

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.620
 from one year after another, after another, and they assumed that they just must have had

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.820
 this big party where you just got one leg off a pig and everyone had to.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.260
 And we're sure that in those days, it wasn't just that pigs only had one right.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.500
 They were like a pogo stick.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.580
 That's an excellent point.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.580
 Definitely.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:16.260
 I was having a look through the British newspaper archive to see which, so that goes back

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.740
 about 300 years and gives you newspaper records from that time to see kind of what people

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.420
 thought of Stonehenge in the past.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:27.240
 And so a lot of the articles in the early 1800s, around 1840, everyone thought that it

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.060
 had been brought over by the Egyptians, so people thought the stone from Stonehenge

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.500
 had been brought over from Africa to Egypt, and then the Egyptians, because they were considered

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:40.500
 such a civilized race or such a civilized people, and they had much better mechanics and engineering

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.500
 than we did.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.500
 We were all still, you know, stuck in.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.440
 They also thought, for a time, that it was only built about a thousand years ago, which

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.440
 it would be.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.640
 Oh, I have a theory on this.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.640
 When was Stonehenge built?

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.640
 2018.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.640
 Yeah.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.640
 It may be seen.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.640
 OK.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.640
 What would you say, if I told you it was 1958?

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.500
 I'd say, Dan, be quiet.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.940
 But every single stone at Stonehenge has been moved between 1901 and 1964.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.940
 No.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.940
 Almost every single one.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.140
 So they were either moved or they were straightened.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.520
 Some of them were set in concrete.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.060
 This was just very early 20th century guys saying, ah, it's not quite right, is it?

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.660
 Why don't we just bodge it up and put some concrete under it?

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.100
 And they were very early cact-handed preservation.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.540
 So I say that Stonehenge was built in the late 50s.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.540
 Yeah.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.540
 That's a great theory.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.140
 Well, you said that people thought that these stones came from Egypt, but they actually

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.020
 came from Wales, didn't they?

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.460
 They came from the Presley Hills in Wales.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.900
 We know that now because of X-rays and stuff like that.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.220
 But for 90 years, they were trying to dig on this particular hill.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.820
 And then they found out that they were digging on the wrong hill.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.860
 And it was another one, one mile away, that they should have been digging out.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.380
 And Dr. Richard Bevins of the National Museum of Wales, he was a guy who found this out.

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.020
 And he said, I don't expect to be getting any Christmas cards from the archaeologists

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.780
 who have been excavating at the wrong place for the last 90 years.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.460
 Well, most of them will be dead by now.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.300
 We're going to need to move on soon, by the way.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.820
 OK, I have one quick thing.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.940
 There's a company called Jackamo, who make clothes, especially for men.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:17.580
 And they did a catalogue called the Architecture of Men, to identify modern kind of builds.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:22.260
 And they said that Simon Cowell and Ricky Gervais are built like Stonehenge.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.460
 Why?

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:28.140
 Apparently, they have short, stocky build, broad shoulders and chunky legs,

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.900
 according to Jackamo.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.580
 Russell Crowe and Jay-Z look like the time bridge, according to these guys.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.260
 What?

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.380
 And James Corden looks like the Girkin.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:40.820
 Harsh.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.020
 It's very harsh.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.180
 The Tasmanian town of Buckland built a replica of Stonehenge.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.860
 There are loads of replicas all over the world.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.780
 So there's a place called Phonehenge in South Carolina.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.540
 And there's a place called Carhenge in Kansas made of old cars.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.540
 And there's a live webcam that you can watch.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.700
 I watched it for hours the other day.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.780
 It's not much goes on.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.620
 It's just a camera pointing at a carhenge.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.060
 But yeah, you can watch that.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.420
 But the Tasmanian-- there was a Tasmanian town called Buckland, which built one.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.540
 And it was demolished by the authorities.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.420
 And on the Wikipedia page where it says, "In keeping with the original Stonehenge,

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.340
 it did not have the necessary planning approval from the local council."

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.260
 OK.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.300
 Time for our final fact of the evening.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.620
 And that is Chazinski.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:32.340
 Oh, yeah, my fact is that Utah has a 106-acre forest that's made out of one tree.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.100
 And this tree is so cool.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.580
 It's called Pando.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.940
 And it-- or some people call it the trembling giant.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:44.060
 And it's a quaking aspen tree.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.580
 And it's a clonal colony, which means that basically it's got the same root system.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:52.180
 All the branches that stick up out of the ground are clones of the original tree.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.900
 So it's all completely interconnected.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.540
 Every single bit of it is genetically identical to every single other bit of it.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.580
 And yeah, it takes up 106 acres.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.220
 And it's this one tree.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:01.980
 That's astonishing.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.020
 It's incredible.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:03.660
 It's so good.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.620
 Pando means in Latin ice spread, which is why it's called that.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.620
 And it's also the heaviest-known organism.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.940
 It's really old as well.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:16.900
 So the average age of each end of-- if you went into this forest and you saw one of the trees,

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.220
 it would be 130 years old.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.460
 But the age of the roots is thought to be about 80,000 years old.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.620
 But could be 800,000 years old.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.420
 400,000.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.380
 200,000.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.780
 To be ridiculous.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:35.580
 It's amazing this tree, though, has been growing for 200,000 years.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.060
 Is it one tree, though, or is it low to no tree?

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.220
 Yeah, it's definitely one tree that is--

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.060
 It's the same organism as that.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.340
 It's one organism.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.940
 It's all completely interconnected.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.340
 It's just like a tree whose branches go underground and then come back up again.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.020
 Wow.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:47.540
 It is.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.340
 Very cool.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.460
 It's so great.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.380
 So Utah, where it is, as far as Utah is really amazing.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.700
 I didn't realize how cool Utah is.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.900
 So Utah is where Kentucky fried chickens from?

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:02.900
 Absolutely true.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:03.700
 Are you sure?

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.460
 Yeah, absolutely true.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.260
 Colonel Sanders was visiting Utah and there was an existing restaurant.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.660
 And he went inside the restaurant.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.140
 And he went there specifically because he liked the owners.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.940
 And he said, I have this interesting chicken.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.620
 And so he did the recipe and they advertised outside.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.620
 He was away when they started selling it in the shop.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.180
 And they said, what should we call it?

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.500
 And it could have been Utah fried chickens from Kentucky.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.860
 He said, if you call it UFC, people would just be fighting there all the time.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.580
 So Kentucky fried chicken, they said, let's call it Kentucky fried chicken,

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.060
 because he's from Kentucky.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.540
 And then when he came back, he realized how big it was.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.660
 And they opened up the first ever KFC there.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.820
 And then it spread around America.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.900
 So Kentucky fried chicken is from Utah.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.660
 Wow.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.340
 Not know that.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:43.860
 That's very good.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:44.180
 Yeah.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.060
 And also NASA planned for our trips to Mars there.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.460
 So in the Utah desert, they

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:54.060
 have these stations where they put astronauts in for a bunch of days, weeks, months.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.860
 And while I was reading this, I discovered something.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.340
 I never heard of this.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:01.380
 NASA has actually created, or at least someone from NASA, a Mars flag.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.700
 Do you know, we have a Mars flag?

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.220
 What?

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:03.700
 No.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.220
 What's that mean?

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.460
 What's that for when we go to Mars?

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.100
 For when we go to Mars, we have a flag now.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.900
 And if you look at it, it's like the French flag.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.100
 It's sort of vertical stripes, three.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.260
 And it starts red.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.180
 And then it goes red.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.180
 Red.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.500
 So it goes red and then green and then blue.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.300
 And the idea is that that's gradually how we would be making the planet.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.100
 And I've never known this.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.100
 So Mars has a flag.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.460
 What about when we get there?

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.620
 And the Martians say, we have a red flag.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.140
 Thanks.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.100
 Have you guys seen the-- this is not your topic.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.020
 But New Zealand is trying to redesign its flag at the moment.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.540
 Or actually, the final design may have gone through now.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.100
 Have you seen the suggestions for the newly designed flag?

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.220
 And I've always thought I don't understand why flags in the world are so boring.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.660
 And they've really nailed it this time.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.940
 So a lot of the entries that have been submitted

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.740
 are, I think, the best one was of a Kiwi, which

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.220
 was not the same color as a Kiwi.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.180
 I don't know what color it is.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.820
 And it's shooting red lasers out of its eyes into the corner of the flag.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.900
 And that's being reported as, yes, we'll give it a good thing.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:02.700
 Yeah.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.540
 Oh, back to trees, yeah.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:10.220
 So there is a tree of the year in Europe every year.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.700
 And this year's tree of the year is an Estonian oak tree

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.980
 that's in the middle of a football field.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.500
 It's in the Arisare Stadium.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.380
 And if you Google it, you can see pitch of it.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.420
 It's right in the middle of a pitch.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.420
 Wow.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.740
 In the middle of a stadium.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.100
 And according to visit Estonia, when the stadium was being built,

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.860
 the Soviet technology could not beat the oak.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.020
 And therefore, it was never uprooted.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.700
 And so it's kind of a sign of--

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.140
 Oh, I see, sort of, independence, and play, exactly.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.820
 And then it also says on the website,

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:44.260
 today, everyone is so used to their extra player on the field

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.860
 that the tree is hardly noticed during the games.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.860
 And I promise you, it is massive.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.060
 There is no way the ball does not hit this tree

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.300
 every single time it got us anywhere.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:59.060
 Well, so that was Tree of the Year 2015.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.860
 And they're gearing up to announce Tree of the Year 2016

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.460
 nominations have begun.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.020
 And I read the British nominations this year.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.900
 So a tree featured in the Game of Thrones series

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.900
 has been nominated, which is very exciting.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.260
 And this is a laboo pick, is it?

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.700
 There are also laboo picks from Britain.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.460
 It's going to be like Eurovision all over again.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.780
 Because there's classic trees in it.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.980
 There's the tree that the Magna Carta was supposedly signed

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:23.300
 under.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.020
 There's the tree where Charles II hid.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:30.140
 There's the tree where apparently Robin Hood hid under as well.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.940
 There must be the four-tingle you, then.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.580
 This is the tree that apparently is the oldest tree

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.460
 in Britain and possibly in Europe.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.180
 And it's the tree under which Legend says Pontius Pilate

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.180
 hid it's in--

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.180
 Or just Pilate.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.500
 He left the Middle East.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.300
 Yeah, to hang out with Scotland under a tree.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.940
 Yeah, it's thought that that's where he went.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.380
 And this has hit the news recently because--

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.180
 so it's about 5,000 years old.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.460
 It's thought-- so possibly the oldest tree in Europe.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.620
 And it is just having a sex change.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.940
 So it's mid-op right now.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.900
 So what on earth does that mean?

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.380
 It's been a male for, well, almost 5,000 years.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.260
 And it's just-- so it doesn't produce fruit.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.300
 So a lot of plants, I think, most plants actually

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.780
 don't have genders, but a lot of plants

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.380
 are either male or female, have male parts or female parts.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.380
 And it's been a male for almost 5,000 years.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.540
 And someone noticed recently it was growing fruit, which

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.380
 the men don't do.

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:25.780
 And one of its arms is having a sex change and becoming a female.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.300
 Wow.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.060
 So that's good for the four-tingle you.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.340
 That's astonishing.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.860
 The England's tallest tree is a Douglas fair, which

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.100
 is on X-Moll and near Dunster.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.900
 I visited it a few years ago.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.060
 But they don't tell you exactly where it is.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.460
 They just tell you it's kind of in this forest somewhere.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.260
 Because people like you were going chop it down.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.700
 There was a whole thing where James--

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.100
 Have you heard of the Chillingham cattle?

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.340
 There's a herd of wild cattle up in--

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:50.940
 Is it Yorkshire?

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.900
 Very, very Northumberland.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.660
 Northumberland, really, really way up North.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.380
 No one has touched these cows for 300 years, right?

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.860
 The field is completely sealed.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.980
 They live, they breed, they die, all on their own.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.580
 They occasionally they throw over a bale of hay

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.660
 or some extra food in the harsh winters.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.260
 And as soon as James heard about this,

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.300
 he said, I'm going to go there and touch them.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.260
 And now they're all in therapy.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:13.740
 Sorry.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.900
 I did say that, I didn't go.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.660
 But you did visit the tree, though.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.220
 No, well, I went to see the tree.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.180
 And I just thought that it's the tallest tree.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.140
 You're going to know which one it is, right?

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.020
 Well, they haven't planted it around loads of big trees.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.340
 But basically, it is around the load of big trees.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.900
 And so you just go there and you just kind of have

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.100
 to take the word for it that is there, really.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.380
 But the US has a national register of big trees.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.860
 But again, they don't tell you where any of the trees are.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.980
 They just tell you the general area where they are

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.540
 and say it's called this, and it's this height.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.620
 And there was a spokesman from American Forest

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.940
 who does this register.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.540
 And he says, we don't want to send flocks of tree

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.420
 spotters and paparazzi to harass the trees

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.820
 and ruin their lives.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.220
 Which sounds like he's talking about me, doesn't it?

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.140
 Yeah.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.100
 Have you heard of the world's rarest tree?

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:03.620
 No.

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:04.140
 No, it's so cool.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.700
 It's a tree called Penentia, Belisiana.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.780
 Where is it?

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.460
 I'm not telling you.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:17.100
 From 1945, for about 70 years, there was only one in the world.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.180
 And it was on a tiny island off New Zealand.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.180
 And it became the last in the world when humans

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.660
 introduced goats to the island.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.340
 And they ate all the other trees.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.860
 Oh, my God.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:30.660
 I think they found out just in time that this was the last one.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.060
 But scientists have found a way of growing a load

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.980
 of new seedlings, so they've planted a load.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.020
 Oh, we're going to have to wrap up really soon.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.740
 Can I just give a recommendation to everyone here

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:40.500
 if they haven't already seen it?

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.900
 Since you mentioned goats, have you ever

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:47.540
 seen the Argania trees, which are the trees that goats climb up?

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:52.580
 So there's a tree called the Argania tree and goats climb it.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.300
 And yeah, you just see them in its branches.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.900
 And just look it up, A-R-G-A-N-I-A.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:57.900
 Wow.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.180
 How many goats do you get in one tree?

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.860
 There are pictures of at least a dozen, I would say.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.660
 Wow.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.740
 And that's just so much for these trees.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.500
 Don't tell them at all.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.820
 OK, I think we should wrap up.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:10.220
 That's it.

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.060
 That's all of our facts.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.660
