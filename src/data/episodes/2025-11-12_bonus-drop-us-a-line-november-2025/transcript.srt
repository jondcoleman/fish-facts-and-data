1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
 - They don't want it, I don't want it.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,000
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,900
 - Hi, welcome to Dropper's Align.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,120
 Welcome to the audience feedback show

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,940
 as part of Club Fish.

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,500
 Welcome to all you Club Fishers,

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,900
 whether you're listening or watching.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,220
 We've had a huge emboss--

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,220
 - I don't think anyone's watching or mute.

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,980
 I think the people are watching are also listening.

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,740
 So whether you are watching or listening

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,540
 or merely listening, is that all right?

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,260
 - Yeah, there could be captions actually,

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,180
 it could be subtitles.

15
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,340
 - It could be, also I saw a comment from someone saying

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,580
 they love just looking at our three heads.

17
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,220
 (laughing)

18
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,420
 So if you're watching from some kind of

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,320
 I imagine mental health institution,

20
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,380
 we've had a very, very full inbox.

21
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,340
 - How full, it's bulging.

22
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,620
 - Yeah, exciting.

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,740
 - It's, it's heaving.

24
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,140
 It's, it's riving, the inbox.

25
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,100
 - Yeah, it's separating.

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,680
 (laughing)

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,420
 - Let's clear it out, let's do it.

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,420
 - You're right.

29
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,540
 Let's start with an email from Matthew Acorn,

30
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,340
 a book with an H in the middle.

31
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,340
 - Acorn?

32
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,700
 - Yeah. - Hey John.

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,780
 - Could be, hello Matthew.

34
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,340
 We mentioned a thing about literary characters

35
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,380
 whose names clearly say what they like.

36
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,620
 Like Dickens does and like Joe Rowling does.

37
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,500
 - Exactly, exactly.

38
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,700
 - And I always say it's massively hack,

39
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,140
 even though a lot of very, very great writers have done it.

40
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,980
 - Yeah.

41
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,420
 - What's that I can't actually think of an example

42
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,260
 right now?

43
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,420
 - Tony Old.

44
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,260
 - Tony Old.

45
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,100
 - Is that a dickens?

46
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,940
 - Well, no, but it would be it.

47
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,180
 If I was, yeah, yeah.

48
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,260
 - I've got a book coming out next year.

49
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,100
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

50
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,380
 - Tony Old is the main character.

51
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,780
 - Is that what the old curiosity shop is?

52
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,100
 It's his shop.

53
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,940
 - Right, yeah.

54
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,460
 (laughing)

55
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,540
 - The club Cratchit is Cratchin' around in the ground.

56
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,940
 (laughing)

57
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,780
 - Mr. Bumble.

58
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,700
 - Yes.

59
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,540
 - Bumbles around.

60
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,380
 - Yeah.

61
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,220
 - Okay.

62
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,060
 - That kind of thing.

63
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,580
 Anyway, there is a book called Snowcrash.

64
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,900
 - Hmm.

65
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,460
 - The novel Snowcrash has a character called Hero

66
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,180
 with an eye, as in Japanese name.

67
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,660
 - Hero protagonist.

68
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,940
 (laughing)

69
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,420
 - That's really good.

70
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,500
 - Yeah, yeah.

71
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,260
 - I love that name, Hero.

72
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,100
 - Yeah, me too.

73
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,940
 - Great name.

74
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,900
 - That's from Matthew Acorn,

75
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,540
 who lives in a place called Trophy Club in Texas.

76
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,500
 (laughing)

77
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,700
 - Isn't that unusual?

78
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,540
 - Yeah.

79
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,380
 - And I looked it up.

80
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,340
 And it's James, you're going to love this.

81
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,700
 It's centered around a country club.

82
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,660
 It's basically a golf horse.

83
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,180
 - Golf horse, now that is what I want.

84
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,820
 Those golf buggies are so old-hat.

85
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,380
 I want a golf horse.

86
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,060
 And then you can play like Polo, but with golf clubs.

87
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,060
 - Has anyone done that?

88
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,780
 Because you've got two sports so close to each other

89
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,860
 in terms of the item.

90
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,420
 - Why on earth wouldn't you use a horse as a caddy?

91
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,420
 It just makes perfect sense.

92
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,460
 They fertilize the green.

93
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,300
 - That's true.

94
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,140
 - Which is what you want, isn't it?

95
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,140
 - And you can ride them.

96
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,820
 You can't ride your caddy in golf.

97
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,660
 - No.

98
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,820
 - It's frowned on.

99
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,100
 - You know what, I rode a horse for the first time

100
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,380
 a few weeks ago.

101
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,220
 - Did you?

102
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,060
 - Yeah.

103
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,540
 And I found it absolutely terrifying.

104
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,540
 (laughing)

105
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,860
 - Well, you're a long way up.

106
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,700
 - Yeah.

107
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,220
 - And they're unpredictable.

108
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,580
 - I will never do it again.

109
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,300
 'Cause I felt like it was a bit unfair on the horse, really.

110
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,140
 - Why?

111
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,980
 - Because you were inexperienced.

112
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,220
 - No, because I weigh 90 kilos.

113
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,060
 - Right.

114
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,380
 - Then you think Harry, heavy, heavy, like burdens.

115
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,980
 - Well, I don't think that's fair, I bet.

116
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,500
 (laughing)

117
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,980
 - I don't think we've got a complete difference in our opinion.

118
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,420
 I think it's absolutely fine to put them through hell.

119
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,660
 - And you know what, that ride in the horse,

120
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,260
 it wasn't the most uncomfortable I was that day

121
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,380
 because I also went for my first ever massage.

122
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,820
 I've never been for a massage before.

123
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,660
 - What a day for you.

124
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,260
 - And I went for a full naked massage.

125
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,100
 - Oh!

126
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,940
 - Like a time massage.

127
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,780
 - Yeah, right.

128
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,020
 - It was my birthday.

129
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,860
 - What a birthday.

130
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,700
 - What a birthday.

131
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,860
 - Did you get, were you naked on the horse as well?

132
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,500
 - No, no, I wasn't wearing my birthday suits

133
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,660
 all the way through the day.

134
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,300
 - Did you have the massage after the horse riding?

135
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,740
 - Actually, no, I did it the wrong way around.

136
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,820
 'Cause it was a sunset horse ride.

137
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,700
 - So now that you're totally relaxed,

138
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,500
 like a boneless jelly,

139
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,340
 let's get you on a horse where you have to,

140
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,740
 you know, maintain perfect posture.

141
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,500
 Did you have, were they, did they walk all over you?

142
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,340
 - That kind of massage.

143
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,180
 - Oh, I switched out.

144
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,300
 (laughing)

145
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,420
 - They also fertilized my back.

146
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,380
 I've got a lovely hairy back now

147
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,980
 after all that fertilizing.

148
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,500
 - What a day for you, James.

149
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,340
 - Yeah, it's my birthday.

150
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,820
 And you know what, the very next day,

151
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,500
 I went straight back into my comfort zone

152
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,860
 and I don't intend to leave there

153
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,740
 for another 360-poil day.

154
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,220
 - Yeah, that's just quite something.

155
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,020
 I can't imagine you having a massage.

156
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,900
 You're just such an unmassaging person.

157
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,100
 - I'm just, I'm really ticklish.

158
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,620
 And I don't like people touching me.

159
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,060
 - And you thrive on tension.

160
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,900
 - Yeah.

161
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,100
 - So did you like it or not?

162
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,940
 - No, I was extremely uncomfortable

163
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,780
 all the way through.

164
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,300
 - Make it is a big step to go.

165
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,460
 You should go to a, like a step one massage first.

166
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,580
 - Well, you're in like hazmat suits.

167
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,780
 - Yeah, like you just take off,

168
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,700
 you just really reveal one flap of skin

169
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,940
 and let me rub you through that.

170
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,100
 (laughing)

171
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,420
 - Tealers choice.

172
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,220
 Or like an airport chair that you put coins in,

173
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,060
 like one of those ones.

174
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,060
 - Oh yeah, I've been in one of those.

175
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,940
 - You've done that, right.

176
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,780
 - How exciting.

177
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,780
 - You've done that massage in years.

178
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,980
 You were a massage guy.

179
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,100
 - What do you think?

180
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,260
 - I think every morning.

181
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,740
 (laughing)

182
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,860
 - I'm often late for things.

183
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,620
 - You're in like a mini kimono.

184
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,460
 I can see you.

185
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,740
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

186
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,340
 - Here are protagonists watching.

187
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,180
 (laughing)

188
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,060
 Cracks his fingers.

189
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,420
 - Right, should we do some emails?

190
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,260
 - Yeah, sure.

191
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,980
 - Right, let's go to a rodeo clown.

192
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,460
 rodeo clown of the week.

193
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,260
 - Okay, boy, oh boy.

194
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,580
 - I feel like having ridden the horse for the first time.

195
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,460
 I'm able to comment on these now.

196
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,420
 - Yeah, well, you're about to get bucked right off this horse.

197
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,620
 Ruth Tiffin writes, right name.

198
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,980
 Oh no, Andy.

199
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,420
 The amount of emails you're about to get

200
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,980
 about everyone's pronunciation of null-ar-bore

201
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,220
 is going to be off the chain, Loll, and Ruth was right.

202
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,340
 And it was followed by, I'd say, 15 to 20 emails, say.

203
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,980
 - Do you remember when we went to this place in Australia?

204
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,820
 - Yeah, yeah.

205
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,820
 - So it's where there are no trees.

206
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,980
 - It's where there are no trees.

207
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,260
 - Exactly, from the Latin, nullus and arbor.

208
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,100
 - No trees.

209
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,660
 Well, in terms of the Australians have formed

210
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,900
 their own unique way of pronouncing that name,

211
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,300
 and they're very interested that that's the correct way.

212
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,140
 - I think that's fine.

213
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,980
 - Yep, absolutely.

214
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,820
 It is fine.

215
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,340
 The Romans are long dead.

216
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,300
 They don't get to say it's pronounced anymore.

217
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,420
 But my goodness, Mel Brayeswell was on as well, wasn't she?

218
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,260
 - Mel Brayeswell.

219
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,780
 Having moved to Australia two weeks earlier,

220
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,860
 would have been able to tell us that.

221
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,940
 - Absolutely.

222
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,180
 - How do you pronounce it?

223
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,020
 - Null-ar.

224
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,180
 - I'm so terrified now to say it.

225
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,420
 I think null-ar-bore.

226
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,580
 - Null-ar-bore.

227
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,820
 - Null-ar-bore.

228
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,060
 Null-ar-bore.

229
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,900
 Leah Bridges says, "Dang claims to be Australian.

230
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,780
 Come on, mate."

231
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,580
 But throws in a fact about null-ar-bore.

232
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,420
 - Right.

233
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,540
 - If you're driving from the eastern states,

234
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,460
 you can't take fruit, vegetables, or honey

235
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,580
 into South Australia or Western Australia,

236
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,100
 but you can take onions and garlic

237
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,860
 as long as you peel them first.

238
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,380
 - Pre-pit, wow, pre-peeled.

239
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,220
 - That's a good fact.

240
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,060
 - Peeling garlic, yeah.

241
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,900
 - Cool.

242
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,740
 - All right.

243
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,660
 Marcus Jakes writes, "I have listened to nearly every podcast

244
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,500
 you have done.

245
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,180
 I look forward to Friday when I get a new one,

246
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,740
 but ep604 was a disaster."

247
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,540
 Can't pronounce Melbourne.

248
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,820
 Do we say Melbourne wrong?

249
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,660
 - Melbourne.

250
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,500
 - Melbourne.

251
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,900
 We've talked about Melbourne.

252
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,140
 That's not Melbourne.

253
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,340
 That's a different thing.

254
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,820
 Can't pronounce Melbourne or Null-ar-bore.

255
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,980
 Terrible description of a road train, not even close.

256
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,340
 I have more, but in my disbelief, I've forgotten most.

257
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,260
 Considering Melbourne is the city with the most NBA number one

258
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,620
 draft picks since 1981.

259
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,860
 We deserve more respect.

260
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,700
 Excuse me.

261
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,900
 I don't know what that means.

262
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,380
 I thought I was going to hand over to you.

263
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,220
 - I can't.

264
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,060
 - What?

265
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,820
 - In Australia, of Australian NBA people.

266
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,220
 - Yeah, it must be of.

267
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,700
 - Because there would be a lot more people in LA or--

268
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,300
 - Just America, generally.

269
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,620
 Well, I don't know what a draft pick is,

270
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,660
 so I'm very happy to just hand over to you guys.

271
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,420
 - Do you want to know or--

272
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,260
 - We'll just assume everyone does know.

273
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,180
 Yeah, yeah.

274
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,180
 I can't think of who it might have been,

275
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,180
 but, okay.

276
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,940
 - That's a top basketball player, not all Australian.

277
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,820
 - It's a really idea.

278
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,180
 - Here's a funny idea.

279
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,340
 - I do.

280
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,900
 - I mean, Mark, she's my thing, so I'm sorry,

281
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,740
 sorry, Mark.

282
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,180
 - But one of the Aussie basketball players

283
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,260
 who was massive in the NBA was part of Michael Jordan's

284
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,740
 Chicago Bulls team was Luke Longley,

285
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,100
 who is brother-in-law by marriage

286
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,020
 of our guest, Ben Elton.

287
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,860
 - Recent guest.

288
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,700
 - Is that right?

289
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,540
 - Yeah.

290
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,060
 That's good.

291
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,700
 - Actually, on draft picks, just from the Ben Elton show,

292
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,060
 we mentioned William Shakespeare, the NFL player.

293
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,900
 - Right, yeah.

294
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,580
 - And I was like, I know the name,

295
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,460
 and the reason I knew it is he was the first ever draft pick

296
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,540
 in American football.

297
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,860
 So, I mean--

298
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,140
 - Right.

299
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,300
 - So he's an American football player?

300
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,460
 - Yeah, yeah, but I was like, how do I know the name?

301
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,900
 'Cause you said, I said, oh, I've known that name,

302
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,060
 and you said, oh, he's from 1950 something,

303
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,060
 or 1960 something, so I was like,

304
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,020
 oh, well, I didn't watch American football back then,

305
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,140
 but that's how I know it, 'cause he was the first ever draft pick.

306
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,220
 - Look, I'm just gonna say it.

307
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,620
 There's college basketball, there's college football,

308
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,820
 they graduate, and the NBA and the NFL get to bid on them.

309
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,700
 - You know what, I've never put knowledge out of my head.

310
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,620
 So quickly, except when I've met someone

311
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,500
 and they've told me their name, that's like--

312
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,260
 (laughing)

313
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,460
 It was that fast, I was like, actively having to slap it right out.

314
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,460
 - Wow, okay.

315
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,500
 We also, in that episode, managed to fluff road trains,

316
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,740
 apparently, and this was me.

317
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,580
 - I'm on the hook.

318
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,420
 - Yeah, absolutely.

319
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,260
 You were the one who said it.

320
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,100
 - Oh gosh, I'm so sorry.

321
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,580
 Thomas Wyndham writes, "I feel like a better job

322
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,300
 "could have been done explaining road trains."

323
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,060
 That's true.

324
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,980
 It's a single vehicle with lots of trailers.

325
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,820
 - Okay, right.

326
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,820
 Now, what I said was, it's--

327
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,980
 - You thought it was like a convoy.

328
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,580
 - I said something.

329
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,380
 I said something really, really wrong.

330
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,940
 In Australia, if there's a main vehicle pulling one trailer,

331
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,940
 that's a semi.

332
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,700
 Sorry.

333
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,740
 Sorry.

334
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,620
 But--

335
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,020
 (laughing)

336
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,740
 - I'm done as semi, but it's like 18 feet long.

337
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,660
 (laughing)

338
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,660
 - I wouldn't have made that joke

339
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,060
 if you just didn't giggle for the last 30 seconds.

340
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,900
 - There we go.

341
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,620
 - But road trains, it's one prime mover,

342
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,820
 as they call it, moving two or more full-size trailers,

343
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,540
 and they're really long.

344
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,260
 And apparently, even the shortest road train

345
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,420
 is as long as three and a half London buses.

346
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,700
 - Wow.

347
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,580
 - So you know how you felt about draft picks?

348
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,420
 - Yeah.

349
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,620
 - I'm experiencing the exact moment right here.

350
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,900
 - In Australia, you should be all over the road train, Stan.

351
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,900
 - That was a dorkin--

352
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,180
 I was sitting reading Mark's brothers in a bedroom.

353
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,020
 - I wasn't into it.

354
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,860
 - Okay.

355
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,660
 - Well, you may like to know, Thomas adds additional,

356
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,580
 they might have additional locomotives in the middle

357
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,180
 of a big long road train.

358
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,460
 It might be an extra engine in the middle,

359
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,420
 providing more power.

360
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,260
 - That's pretty cool.

361
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,100
 - Wow.

362
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,740
 So there you go.

363
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,980
 Bryce Clark writes, this is absolutely huge.

364
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,540
 Do you remember we mentioned one of the most famous

365
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,020
 Australians of all time?

366
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,300
 - Oh, Lenbedel.

367
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,460
 - Lenbedel.

368
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,300
 - Lenbedel.

369
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,140
 - Yeah.

370
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,980
 - Yeah.

371
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,820
 - Right.

372
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,180
 Bryce Clark writes, I know Gary of Gary Highway.

373
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,020
 So Lenbedel was the Australian road builder

374
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,820
 who named all of his roads after members as family.

375
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,660
 - We all know that.

376
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,500
 - We all know that.

377
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,780
 - It's only Mal, who didn't know Lenbedel.

378
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,260
 (laughing)

379
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,300
 And so Bryce writes, I know Gary of Gary Highway.

380
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,420
 He's got good dental work.

381
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,300
 'Cause Lenbedel would take out the teeth of--

382
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,180
 - Oh, they're crews building the roads of the desert.

383
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,380
 Gary is a well-respected piano technician in Melbourne.

384
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,860
 But I think his sister-- - Sorry, what?

385
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,700
 - Melborn.

386
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,660
 But I think his sister does bush tours

387
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,340
 around the areas their dad worked.

388
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,340
 - Right.

389
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,500
 - Bush, 'cause all of his books,

390
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,380
 you remember beating around the bush too long in the bush?

391
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,220
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

392
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,420
 - Bushbashes.

393
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,220
 - Yes, bushwhackers.

394
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,060
 - Bushwhackers are a very big band in Australia.

395
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,460
 The bushwhackers, yeah.

396
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,300
 - Interesting.

397
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,020
 - They wrote the song, "I am you are we are Australian."

398
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,660
 If you know that song.

399
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,740
 - That's how Australians learn grammar.

400
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,860
 (laughing)

401
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,700
 - So I know that's huge news that we allow

402
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,860
 two handshakes away from Lenbedel, basically.

403
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,700
 - It's huge.

404
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,540
 - Is he still alive?

405
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,380
 - I don't believe Len is, no.

406
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,380
 I think so. - So that'll be a bit

407
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,660
 of an awkward handshake.

408
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,020
 - Certainly with some digging required.

409
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,580
 - Oh, dear.

410
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,980
 And David writes, "Pubquizzes, do you remember

411
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,220
 "Pubquizz Roads in Australia?"

412
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,060
 - Yeah.

413
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,900
 - This is a big thing.

414
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,220
 Well, the Western USA also has miles and miles

415
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,860
 of nothing but miles and miles, writes David.

416
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,900
 And during the heyday of America's love affair with cars,

417
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,340
 we had Burma Shave signs,

418
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,140
 which had humorous limericks on them.

419
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,660
 - So a razor company?

420
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,500
 - Yeah.

421
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,340
 - Right.

422
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,180
 - It's got to be.

423
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,620
 It's Burma Shave has to be a razor company.

424
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,780
 I did look it up, I think it is.

425
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,700
 - And then we just put random limericks.

426
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,540
 - Yeah.

427
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,380
 - Very nice.

428
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,820
 But David says, "Since we Americans are not as intellectually

429
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,020
 adept as Brits, we had humorous limericks

430
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,380
 rather than quiz questions."

431
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,300
 - I'd like to hear an example of the limericks.

432
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,220
 - I don't have one, I'm so sorry.

433
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,060
 - Sorry.

434
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,260
 - Must end in like shave or...

435
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
 - Razor?

436
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,820
 - Taser, laser.

437
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,660
 That's not for a limerick.

438
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,420
 - It has to begin with the once was a man

439
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,540
 from Australasia.

440
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,260
 (laughing)

441
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,700
 - Who tried to shave with a laser?

442
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,540
 - Yeah.

443
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,820
 - He burned off his face.

444
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,620
 Wanted to disgrace.

445
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,380
 He should have used a Burma Shave razor.

446
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,220
 - Brilliant.

447
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,060
 - There we go.

448
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,900
 - We should have gone into advertising.

449
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,100
 - We do been bloody good.

450
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,540
 - Maybe all our ads going forward are in limerick form.

451
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,540
 - That's a very good idea.

452
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,380
 - Look how quick that was.

453
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,540
 - Yeah.

454
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:43,060
 - And we'll have the royalty rights of the lyrics.

455
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,900
 - The royalty rights?

456
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,940
 - Oh yeah, you mean, when they make a song,

457
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,860
 when Kendrick won the harmonics a song.

458
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,700
 - Yeah.

459
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,540
 - With one of our limericks.

460
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,700
 - Yeah, exactly.

461
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,540
 It could happen.

462
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,420
 Chas and Dave got used in M&M song, remember?

463
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,340
 - How many rhymes are they for VPN?

464
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,260
 - Then, men.

465
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,100
 - Hen.

466
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,940
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

467
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,780
 - Come on.

468
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,860
 - Biscuits in New Zealand.

469
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,900
 - Biscuit tin was what we were talking about.

470
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,460
 The fact that Parliament has a Biscuit tin

471
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,900
 that they pull out policies to discuss.

472
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,740
 - Yes.

473
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,300
 - So in that fact, John, from Parliament,

474
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,700
 the British Parliament, writes in.

475
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,540
 This is exciting.

476
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,380
 - John there, come.

477
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,420
 - I can't say.

478
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,060
 We've got a few secret squirrels today.

479
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,900
 - It's too late.

480
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,900
 - People who can't reveal their true name.

481
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,740
 - Major?

482
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,580
 - Location.

483
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,420
 - It's John Major.

484
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,260
 I was listening to today's episode

485
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,060
 and you talk about whether the division bells

486
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,140
 still work in the pubs around Parliament.

487
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,820
 - Oh yeah, I'd be interested in to know that.

488
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,260
 - Well, I've got great news, James.

489
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,380
 You're about to find out.

490
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,900
 - We should re-explain what the division bell is.

491
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,060
 'Cause it's so interesting.

492
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,220
 It's basically if a vote needs to happen immediately,

493
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,380
 bells start ringing and everyone dashes towards

494
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,220
 to make their vote,

495
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,500
 but because they're all spread around in places

496
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,620
 like pubs around the area.

497
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,860
 Sometimes there's telephones that ring

498
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,260
 and the division bells are ringing and they play it.

499
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,540
 So yeah, it's a big thing,

500
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,300
 but we thought a lot of it went extinct in modern day.

501
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,060
 - Well, I work in Parliament, says John,

502
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,820
 and I can say that they don't ring anymore.

503
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,500
 The system, I believe, broke over COVID

504
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,540
 and as it was being phased out,

505
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,060
 they didn't bother to fix it.

506
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,660
 It still works inside the building.

507
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,460
 That's good, but not in external pubs.

508
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,580
 Oh, it still goes off in the on-site bars.

509
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,420
 There you go.

510
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,580
 - There's three bars, isn't there?

511
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,060
 - Yeah, yeah.

512
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,020
 - And because of the sound of the division bells,

513
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,700
 John adds, it means the fire bell must be different.

514
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,140
 So instead of a loud noise,

515
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,820
 it's a pot of voice saying warning,

516
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,700
 warning a fire has been reported in your vicinity.

517
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,500
 (laughing)

518
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,340
 - That's good.

519
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,140
 - When my daughter was born,

520
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,860
 we, it was in the hospital opposite the Parliament.

521
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
 - Oh, across the town.

522
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,700
 - Yeah, yeah.

523
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,100
 - Yeah, St. Thomas's. - St. Thomas's.

524
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,060
 - And we were in a room overlooking Parliament.

525
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,940
 - Wow. - So we could see the people

526
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,340
 and obviously when your child is born,

527
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,180
 you're awake all night.

528
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,020
 So we could see the people with flashlights,

529
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,540
 you know, looking for fires

530
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,020
 that they do that every single night.

531
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,540
 - Yeah, 24 hours a day.

532
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,180
 - Yeah, like every couple of hours,

533
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,180
 someone with a flashlight would be looking for fires outside.

534
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,420
 - You're worse in the bed saying,

535
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,100
 James, I can appreciate.

536
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,020
 A bit of, I need a bit of help with the boat.

537
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,580
 You're saying, wait, wait, it's been an hour and 57 minutes

538
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,060
 and I just, I wanna check my theory.

539
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,260
 - That's terrific, that's so cool.

540
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,660
 - That is cool. - That's spooky.

541
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:32,140
 Right, here is, get yourself off the hook for James.

542
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,700
 We've both had a real showing so far with this whole.

543
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,540
 - Okay, no, I'm ready.

544
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,700
 - Nullabor thing. - I'm ready.

545
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,180
 - Nullabor, yeah, yeah.

546
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:45,100
 Simo Sarn writes, in episode 604 at 5119,

547
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,180
 well, I'll just, over to you, James.

548
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,220
 - Oh, no, I see, so that's right near the end.

549
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,060
 - Yep.

550
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,100
 - Number 614. - 604. - 6, oh, right, sorry.

551
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,420
 - That's the, it's still the Mount Bracewell show.

552
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,620
 We're talking about, yeah.

553
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,460
 The last section, James says that pie is infinite.

554
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,500
 - Oh, here we go.

555
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,060
 - And doesn't repeat, meaning it's irrational,

556
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,980
 thus all series of numbers are in there.

557
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,140
 Then Simo says the latter called normality

558
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,140
 actually doesn't follow from the former.

559
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,940
 It's a separate property which hasn't been proven

560
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,300
 or disproven about pie. - Yeah.

561
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,820
 - So, you're on the hook. - Well, I'm about to say something,

562
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,580
 which will go directly into both your head

563
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,940
 and then directly out of it straight afterwards.

564
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
 - Okay.

565
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,660
 - But yeah, pie is not a normal number as far as we know

566
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,500
 or it might be or it might not be,

567
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,380
 which means that it might be that all numbers are in there

568
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,900
 or it might not be.

569
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,700
 Now, I said that it might repeat,

570
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,340
 but what is definitely true is that it doesn't repeat

571
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,260
 at the end, you know, like one third is 0.3333333

572
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,020
 and it just keeps going forever.

573
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,500
 Pie definitely doesn't do that.

574
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,220
 It's not like a repeated set of numbers

575
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,260
 that just keeps going on like that.

576
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,220
 What is possible is that there is some pattern inside of pie

577
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,060
 as in it's not at the end, but it's inside.

578
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:01,540
 Like it could be, it could go 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

579
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,100
 That's a pattern and it's a repeating pattern,

580
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,020
 but it isn't repeating numbers.

581
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,700
 - Hmm. - Right.

582
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,820
 - And what was very difficult to part across

583
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,220
 in the comedy show that we were doing,

584
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,500
 was that quite advanced math,

585
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,860
 at which I did at university

586
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,740
 and which, in fairness,

587
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,900
 I haven't completely remembered all of it.

588
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,340
 - Yeah. - And I did flub it a little bit.

589
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,820
 - I think he slightly fudged it though at the time.

590
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,180
 I think he said it might or might not be.

591
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,420
 So I-- - I definitely fudged it.

592
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,260
 It's slightly inexcusable because I do know it all,

593
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,620
 like all that stuff, and I did study it,

594
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,500
 but at the same time, yeah.

595
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,820
 - So I think you're off the hook.

596
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,820
 - I don't think so.

597
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,740
 - Well, we've got to the end of it either, have we?

598
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,100
 - We haven't, but we know for a fact that it doesn't do that

599
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,420
 'cause then it would, you would be able to express it

600
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,060
 as a fraction, which you can't.

601
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,660
 - I forgot about the fraction.

602
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,540
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

603
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,380
 - There you go.

604
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,620
 - Okay. That was very interesting.

605
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,460
 - Thank you, James.

606
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,900
 - I think the show does have to be serious sometimes,

607
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
 drop us a line.

608
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,740
 - What do you think?

609
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,860
 - I think it can't all be hilarious.

610
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,260
 - It can't all be limer eggs.

611
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,980
 - It can't all be music limer eggs.

612
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,660
 Josh Jones writes, long time listener, clubfish member,

613
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,820
 hello Josh, and first time message guy.

614
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,860
 I was listening to episode six, I fought with Mell's Forfax,

615
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,860
 and you spoke about the digits of pi.

616
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,380
 Listening to her recite pi to 50 decimal places.

617
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,540
 - That's very impressive.

618
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,820
 - It was astonishing.

619
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,900
 - It's amazing 'cause what she actually did was just say

620
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,060
 all 10 numbers, and I put them in the right order.

621
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,100
 She doesn't know, actually,

622
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,300
 she didn't even know the first thing.

623
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,300
 - That's a great edit.

624
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,780
 - Yeah. - She's amazing.

625
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,020
 - I don't think we knew she knew that as well.

626
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,740
 That kind of just came out, didn't it, in the show?

627
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,460
 - I astonished. - Yeah.

628
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,220
 But it reminded Josh of something here

629
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,540
 a few weeks ago.

630
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,300
 He says, I work in a hospital with a surgeon,

631
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,060
 brackets gynecologist, who just a few weeks ago

632
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:45,060
 set a new Australian record by reciting pi to 10,640 places.

633
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,540
 Can Chana, once a purer, is his name

634
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,700
 from Ballarat Base Hospital in Victoria, Australia.

635
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,500
 So that's pretty good, isn't it?

636
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,860
 - That's very cool. - That's amazing.

637
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,700
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

638
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,620
 - It is 10,000.

639
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,460
 - That's a lot, isn't it?

640
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,980
 - Imagine he's just muttering away down there.

641
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
 - What are you saying?

642
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,740
 - 3,640. - What are you measuring?

643
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,300
 (laughing)

644
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,620
 - I'm just doing the circumference,

645
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,820
 and then I could have divide it.

646
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,580
 (laughing)

647
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,900
 - Bit of ribbled humour.

648
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,300
 We've had emails from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

649
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,500
 - Oh, yes, we mentioned a fact about them.

650
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,740
 - 'Cause it was about pie charts and pies and bakers in Australia.

651
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,740
 So Mel Aitan, Aitan, has sent over a bar chart on bartenders,

652
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,220
 also things I've included here.

653
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,540
 A line graph on line markers and a histogram on historians.

654
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,780
 (laughing)

655
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,020
 - It's very nice. - This is altered by the Aussies.

656
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,860
 - This is all the Aussies.

657
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,940
 - Sorry, very good. - Very good.

658
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,100
 So it's just a bit of fun, really.

659
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,940
 - Really like that.

660
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,260
 We should mention something quickly that actually,

661
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,220
 I've had a few messages about,

662
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,940
 which is the fact that the Mel Bracewell episode

663
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,700
 was the first episode we have ever done,

664
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,700
 where the facts were entirely from the guests that we had on,

665
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,140
 one person bringing the facts.

666
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,100
 There was a lot of theories about why that happened.

667
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,020
 - She insisted.

668
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,540
 - She insisted? - Sever.

669
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,780
 - Yeah.

670
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,820
 Yeah, no people were saying like,

671
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,700
 "Oh, did they have no time to get it together?"

672
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,740
 And then she just brought the facts.

673
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,140
 So just for clarity, 'cause why not?

674
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,340
 We basically received five facts from Mel.

675
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,700
 We couldn't pick one we liked most

676
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,700
 because we thought they were brilliant.

677
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,340
 And I think it was you James, just one.

678
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,700
 We just do all the facts.

679
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,660
 When that be fun, that it was just Mel's facts each time.

680
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,660
 And then he resisted it.

681
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,820
 It was so there was some resistance

682
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,860
 from more traditionally minded members of the group.

683
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,460
 But yeah, and you know what?

684
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,900
 I'm gonna say, Mayor Culper, I was wrong.

685
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,220
 Well, don't, don't Mayor Culper.

686
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,060
 I mean, it's not my fault.

687
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,860
 But I was wrong, so resisted.

688
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,780
 I thought it was a very fun thing to do.

689
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,620
 - But never again.

690
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,420
 - Never again, never ever again.

691
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,620
 But it was really fun.

692
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,460
 They were all great facts.

693
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,460
 - Right.

694
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,980
 - Here's a, do you know the name, if I say Mike Giggler?

695
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,860
 - Mike Giggler?

696
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,980
 - Yeah.

697
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,580
 Mike is maybe a private, I think.

698
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,020
 It's like when someone writes an email in that's amusing,

699
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,580
 deliberately amusing.

700
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,180
 Sometimes people just think of extra jokes.

701
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,020
 - Yeah, yeah.

702
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,580
 - So is Mike, it's not a slam on the email.

703
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,860
 - It is a bit of a slam to save Mike.

704
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,700
 - It's a bit of a slam.

705
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,540
 - Okay.

706
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,580
 - To say, oh, there's a bit of Mike Giggler email.

707
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,900
 Someone's saying, I've thought of a joke

708
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,380
 that you didn't at the time.

709
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,740
 But we're operating in a live fire environment.

710
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,940
 There's not time to think of every joke.

711
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,540
 You know, sometimes you mess something and it's,

712
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,460
 - Sometimes you say a joke and I cut it out.

713
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,020
 - Exactly, those are the most painful of all.

714
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,860
 It's where like, someone's like, I can't believe

715
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,300
 you didn't make this incredibly obvious

716
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,340
 low-hanging fruit joke.

717
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,460
 And I'm like, I did make the most obvious joke

718
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,820
 and I'm like, I did make the most obvious joke.

719
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,940
 I'm a James Cunning.

720
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,380
 Anyway, this is not, this is a bit of a Mike Giggler,

721
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,740
 but I'm very grateful to Caleb M for sending it.

722
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,940
 Thank you, Caleb.

723
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,500
 You remember we talked about ghost sharks

724
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,540
 and they've got these weird things on their head,

725
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,220
 made of teeth.

726
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,060
 - Oh yeah.

727
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,460
 - They used to grip on during sex.

728
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,900
 - This is in the Sarah Pasco show.

729
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,860
 - It certainly was.

730
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,460
 Sorry, show change.

731
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,460
 There we go, we're on the Pasco show now.

732
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,700
 Anyway, Caleb writes, ghost sharks use their teeth

733
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,180
 to eat prey and love.

734
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,660
 - Oh, that's a really good joke.

735
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,900
 - Yeah. - To be fair.

736
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,220
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

737
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,660
 - Well done, Mike. - Oh, we go.

738
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,940
 - Caleb, no, no, I don't.

739
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,780
 - Oh, I'm sorry.

740
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,740
 (laughing)

741
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,180
 - Lauren Payne writes, "I was listening

742
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,660
 to this week's fish podcast

743
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,660
 and the mother of a friend of mine is a nurse,

744
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,300
 named Nurse Doctor."

745
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,380
 - Nurse Doctor. - Brilliant.

746
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,940
 - Based on central Kentucky.

747
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,420
 - 'Cause you said, Andy, that Paul Nurse is a doctor.

748
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,720
 He won their Nobel Prize for Physiology.

749
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,940
 - Oh, yeah. - And there was another

750
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,780
 doctor called Nurse,

751
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,460
 but you'd never found a nurse called Doctor.

752
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,300
 - There we go.

753
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,300
 "And my friend is considering going for a PhD

754
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,020
 to become Doctor Doctor."

755
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,780
 - Very good. - It's gonna be great.

756
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,340
 - Which was Sarah Gertons.

757
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,900
 - Wasn't that the name of President Garfields,

758
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,740
 one of the doctors?

759
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,140
 - Doctor, Doctor Willard Bliss.

760
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,780
 - Yes, his first name was Doctor, that's right.

761
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,540
 - So, Doctor. - Oh!

762
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,940
 - There's been an amazing email from Dragon.

763
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,260
 Dragon. - What a great name, can't you spell?

764
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,340
 - Dragon, but with another A instead of the O.

765
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,580
 - Are they from Serbia?

766
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,860
 - They don't say, is that a Serbian name?

767
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,420
 - Uh, I know some dragons from Serbia.

768
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,740
 - Really? - Yeah.

769
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,860
 - That's pretty cool. - It's a footballer

770
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,020
 called Dragon Steak of It, I think, as well.

771
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,260
 I'm not sure if he was Serbian.

772
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,780
 - That's a great name.

773
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,780
 - It's very strong.

774
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,300
 Anyway, it's the Blade Runner plot title explainer.

775
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,980
 Now, just look at this half of the sheet of paper.

776
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,820
 That's very important.

777
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,900
 Don't turn it over. - Oh, okay.

778
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,180
 - So it basically shows,

779
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,780
 and we'll put it on screen as well,

780
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,180
 where the title comes from, where the plot comes from.

781
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,500
 It just makes it so clear.

782
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,740
 - And he's made this for us?

783
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,900
 - Dragon.

784
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,740
 - We should explain,

785
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,340
 'cause some people won't have heard the episode.

786
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,500
 The very basic thing is,

787
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,940
 "Do Android Stream of Electric Sheep" by Philip K. Dick

788
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,940
 was being adapted into a movie.

789
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,820
 The people making the movie didn't like the title.

790
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,180
 So they call it Blade Runner,

791
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,300
 but in order to call it Blade Runner,

792
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,060
 they had to buy the rights to another book,

793
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,460
 written by William S. Burrows,

794
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,340
 to take the title, but just the title,

795
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,460
 and apply it to the Philip K. Dick book.

796
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,420
 - That William Burrows had taken the story

797
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,700
 from another book called Blade Runner,

798
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,060
 and turned it into a movie adaptation,

799
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,620
 which was never adapted, but then was later adapted.

800
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,420
 - Yeah, and that book was by someone called,

801
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,540
 I think it was "Alone Nas." - "Alone Nas."

802
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,540
 - Anyway, so it does not make it clear?

803
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,820
 - Yeah, although it's just very complicated, isn't it?

804
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,380
 - Yeah, although someone on the train the other day

805
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,460
 was reading "Do Android Stream of Electric Sheep."

806
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,500
 Coincidence? - Yeah.

807
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,340
 - Pass it back.

808
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,420
 - I tell you what, if they were reading the "Alone Nas" book,

809
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,940
 which is quite obscure, I've been really surprised.

810
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,940
 - Yeah, I might have had to intervene at that point,

811
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,740
 or if they were reading the final book

812
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,620
 in this little image here, of the novelization of the movie,

813
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,860
 Blade Runner, which is not "Do Android Stream of Electric Sheep."

814
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,860
 - That can't have sold well.

815
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,260
 - Can't have done it. - Do you want to read

816
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,100
 the book of the film?

817
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,100
 - Yeah, well, there is one, you know?

818
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,140
 - Anyway. - Yeah.

819
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,380
 - Right, "Discussed."

820
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,500
 William James writes, "We talked about being disgusting."

821
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,740
 - All right, not the past of "Discussed."

822
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,380
 - No, right.

823
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,140
 - Although we, I suppose we did "Discussed."

824
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,500
 It was "Discussed." - Yeah.

825
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,140
 - In regard to Sarah Pasco's fact, regarding "A Rousal,"

826
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,900
 reducing people's "Discussed" response.

827
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,740
 - So this was Dan's idea that if he arouses his wife,

828
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,380
 he could get to take up the bench.

829
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,780
 He's one of my favorite lines ever in any podcast we've ever done.

830
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,060
 - Really pulling pain to the wife guy thing, as well.

831
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,860
 (laughing)

832
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,740
 James, folks, the idea of a restaurant

833
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,660
 that shows "Soft Cool Pawn" to entice people

834
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,500
 in tweeting "Medio-Coffoon."

835
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,020
 - Yeah. (laughing)

836
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,820
 - Though it doesn't show "Pawn" per se,

837
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,700
 I believe there is already a restaurant chain in North America

838
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,500
 operating on this basic principle.

839
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,780
 I believe James has invented Hooters.

840
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,780
 - Yes. (laughing)

841
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,940
 - I believe I have.

842
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,180
 - Yeah, congratulations.

843
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,780
 Like that's a huge business.

844
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,020
 - That is a big business.

845
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,380
 - Yeah, but it exists, doesn't it?

846
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,540
 What am I gonna do?

847
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,180
 - Yeah, I know, that's the only,

848
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,060
 but you could be the first Hooters,

849
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,300
 I don't think Hooters exists in the UK, does it?

850
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,460
 You could franchise Hooters.

851
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,460
 - Spring Fellows, is that Hooters in the UK or not?

852
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,300
 I don't know.

853
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,460
 - I think it's just a big chain of like,

854
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,940
 not very good restaurants, though,

855
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,740
 so there is definitely a gap in the market.

856
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,780
 - I think they've tried, maybe.

857
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,100
 - Well, the advantage of my version is you don't have labor costs

858
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,060
 'cause you just put the TV on and show some Soft Cool Pawn.

859
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,900
 - Yeah.

860
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,500
 - You don't have to pay the waiters on waitresses.

861
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,380
 - It must be niche, like we're for geeks.

862
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,780
 Like a cypher, oh, like Dr Hooters.

863
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,620
 - Dr Hooters and all of the people there

864
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,580
 have three boobs and they're alien like, I mean, yeah.

865
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,100
 - Where's the doctor, Pa?

866
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,940
 - A doctor who?

867
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,860
 There's a cypher.

868
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,420
 (laughing)

869
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,060
 - Some steps went on in your head there.

870
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,900
 - Absolutely.

871
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,900
 - And you really need to elucidate.

872
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,740
 - Why so cypher?

873
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,580
 That's a cypher.

874
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,420
 - Sorry.

875
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,420
 - Dr Hooters.

876
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,420
 - Yeah.

877
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,820
 (laughing)

878
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,020
 - Bigger on the inside boys.

879
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,860
 - Oh my God.

880
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,020
 (laughing)

881
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,060
 - Four, five, seven, nine.

882
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,500
 (laughing)

883
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,180
 - Oh, we've got very blokey since Anna went on matter.

884
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,300
 I think it's really, it's ribbled now.

885
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,140
 - Yeah.

886
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,340
 - That's the second time you've used ribbled today.

887
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,500
 - Has it get away?

888
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,140
 - Yeah.

889
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,220
 - What a bad vocabulary I've got.

890
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,980
 But you know where you know one fancy word.

891
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,380
 You're constantly.

892
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,620
 - Was that your word of the day that you've read?

893
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,820
 - Oh my tear off calendar.

894
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,980
 (laughing)

895
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,660
 - Ribbled, hmm.

896
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,740
 Don't mind if I do.

897
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,540
 - Oh, yeah, that's very embarrassing.

898
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,340
 - All right, let's move on.

899
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,900
 Sophie McCook writes,

900
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,060
 - Ah yeah.

901
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,940
 - I don't often know a fish fact before I hear it

902
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,140
 on your podcast, but the news of the great raft spider,

903
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,980
 mmm, Norfolk spider.

904
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,820
 - Yes.

905
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,420
 - It can run across the water.

906
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,260
 - Lots of it, yeah.

907
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,900
 - It lives in the Norfolk broads and things like that.

908
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,420
 Great spider.

909
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,780
 It was already fresh off the press for me

910
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,460
 because the fact is currently being used

911
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,020
 as an excuse by my mother.

912
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,380
 (laughing)

913
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,620
 She lives in a small cottage in Beckles, Suffolk.

914
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,100
 And holiday rents out a smaller cottage in the garden,

915
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,740
 right on the river, Waveney.

916
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,380
 The cottage, she rents out,

917
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,420
 seems to be a popular spider congregating place.

918
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:03,180
 They're all sizes and favor the walls, ceiling and bath.

919
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,100
 My mother doesn't want to hoover them all up,

920
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,620
 spiders are friends.

921
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,260
 So she's printed an extensive guest information pack

922
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,940
 all about rare Suffolk spiders,

923
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,460
 especially the great raft spider,

924
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,660
 and she hopes this will act as an information to pay

925
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,180
 that will stop visitors leaving poor reviews.

926
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,180
 - Hmm.

927
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,260
 So what we've got here is a holiday cottage

928
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,100
 that is absolutely, sounds like absolutely coated in spiders.

929
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,580
 (laughing)

930
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,820
 - Imagine in a Ragnaphobia if you go to,

931
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,620
 you know that movie, you go there,

932
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,100
 but there's just a big sign saying spiders are our friends.

933
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,300
 (laughing)

934
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,460
 - You know what, this reminds me of,

935
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,180
 I was driving back from somewhere,

936
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,260
 I can't remember what it was,

937
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,460
 somewhere in Gloucestershire maybe the other day,

938
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,260
 and I drove through Beesden.

939
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,100
 - To you.

940
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,940
 - To you.

941
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,780
 - Wow.

942
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,980
 - Was that, and I've taught me a different way,

943
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,700
 'cause it was like a problem on the roads,

944
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,980
 and then suddenly I was like welcome to Beesden,

945
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,980
 and it reminded me of one of our favorite facts.

946
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,500
 - Yes, full of Bees.

947
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,340
 - Full of Bees?

948
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,180
 - But he's still.

949
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,900
 - Like 10,000 Bees were stolen from Beesden.

950
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,460
 - Yes, that was the, that was getting it now.

951
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,620
 - Look at the year.

952
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,860
 - 2,000 Bees were stolen in Beesden.

953
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,700
 - Yeah.

954
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,940
 - I almost stopped off and tried to find the Bees,

955
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,060
 but lucky that would be stupid.

956
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,020
 - Yeah, well, they'll all be dead now.

957
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,380
 (laughing)

958
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,820
 - How's the search going, guys?

959
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,980
 (laughing)

960
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,460
 - 2,000, it does sound like a lot, but for Bees, that's.

961
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,300
 - No.

962
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,300
 - Highval two, isn't it?

963
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,140
 - Yeah.

964
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,980
 - Yeah.

965
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,820
 - Very cool.

966
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,820
 - A good book to write, though, and fun to read.

967
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,380
 - Yeah.

968
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,220
 - Right.

969
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,700
 We've got a lookalike.

970
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,900
 This is really exciting.

971
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,900
 - Mm-hmm.

972
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,860
 - Luke McNeil writes this.

973
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,860
 I noticed an uncanny similarity between Dan Schreiber

974
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,940
 and Don Music from Sesame Street.

975
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,620
 - Twin separated at birth, perhaps?

976
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,900
 Now, I was thinking, come on.

977
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,220
 Is this, like, a Sesame Street character?

978
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,220
 This is not gonna look like that.

979
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,900
 - That looks like Beaker, doesn't he?

980
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,540
 - Oh, from the Muppets.

981
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,260
 Don Music, I would say, looks even more like Dan.

982
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,100
 - All right.

983
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,700
 - I'm just gonna turn the paper over for you now.

984
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,620
 Your time starts now.

985
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,100
 (laughing)

986
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,660
 - No, that's Louis Theroux, isn't it?

987
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,100
 (laughing)

988
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,220
 - It's quite Dan, isn't it?

989
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,060
 - Yeah.

990
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,980
 - We prepared for how much, like, Dan.

991
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,820
 (laughing)

992
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,300
 - Hey everybody!

993
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,300
 - What's he called?

994
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,300
 - Don Music.

995
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,140
 - Don?

996
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,980
 - Don Music.

997
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,820
 - I'm clear why.

998
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,980
 - Oh, he sounds like a twat, doesn't he?

999
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,140
 (laughing)

1000
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,980
 - What?

1001
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,340
 - Don Music.

1002
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,580
 - Don Music.

1003
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,420
 - Sounds nice.

1004
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,420
 - No, right now.

1005
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,260
 - With that head?

1006
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,100
 - With that face?

1007
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,420
 - I mean, don't be too harsh about it,

1008
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,700
 because it's your face, okay?

1009
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,860
 - I need to say, I reckon Don Music probably does music, right?

1010
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,700
 In the same way that Dan Schreiber,

1011
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,940
 it does the German for writing.

1012
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,380
 - Yeah, that's so very true.

1013
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,900
 - I think it might actually be based on you.

1014
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,180
 - Wow, I know.

1015
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,860
 So I've got that guy from Dender Dan.

1016
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,860
 - Yeah.

1017
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,740
 - And Don Music.

1018
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,220
 - Maybe you're the guy with an incredibly recognizable

1019
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,940
 copyable face and head, unlike me.

1020
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,740
 - No, you have just a face, but Dan has a face

1021
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,100
 which is very similar to other faces.

1022
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,380
 - Yeah, mine is generic, Dan's is repeated.

1023
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,220
 - Yeah.

1024
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,060
 - I got it.

1025
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,900
 - Like Pie.

1026
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,740
 (laughing)

1027
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,980
 - Please don't, please don't.

1028
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,500
 - No, then we're gonna do draft picks again,

1029
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,100
 and I won't be able to hack it.

1030
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,620
 Extreme fish.

1031
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,260
 - What's that mean?

1032
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,860
 - What do you think it means?

1033
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,420
 People doing extreme things while listening to fish.

1034
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,420
 - Oh, great.

1035
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,220
 - Yeah, so we have the guy who went fishing.

1036
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,220
 (laughing)

1037
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,500
 Okay, we'll get this.

1038
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
 I think this is unbelievable.

1039
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,140
 This might be email of the week.

1040
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,980
 - Okay.

1041
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,820
 - Okay.

1042
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,420
 - Duncan Pierce writes, "In the September of Drops of Line,

1043
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,180
 "you said descendant pictures of you

1044
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,220
 "doing extreme things while listening to fish.

1045
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,700
 "I'm not sure if this counts as extreme,

1046
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,980
 "but efficient counts as extreme,

1047
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,220
 "and this probably does as well."

1048
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,220
 (laughing)

1049
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,220
 Fair.

1050
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,220
 This summer, my friend Dante and I did our explore a belt.

1051
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,700
 Okay, a scout expedition similar to the British Duke of Edinburgh,

1052
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,020
 but it's for Swedish scouts.

1053
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,380
 And it involves being dropped off in a random city

1054
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,860
 in another country and having to hike 160 kilometers,

1055
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,460
 at least over 10 days without paying for lodging

1056
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,260
 or ready-made meals.

1057
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,260
 You just get dropped somewhere with a letter

1058
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,180
 with your destination and some challenges and 200 quid.

1059
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,260
 That's it. - Cool.

1060
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,100
 Sounds great.

1061
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,940
 I'd love to do that.

1062
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,780
 - I know.

1063
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,580
 Dante and I did this in Scotland.

1064
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,380
 We were dropped off in a small village called Ecclefecan.

1065
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,400
 (laughing)

1066
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,820
 - The locals are having you on there.

1067
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,300
 That is not a real place.

1068
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,900
 - Ecclefecan.

1069
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,740
 - Ecclefecan.

1070
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,580
 - Ecclefecan.

1071
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,140
 - Ecclefecan, yeah, yeah.

1072
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,700
 And they had this lovely time and he says,

1073
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,940
 the scouts were incredibly kind and people would let them

1074
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,460
 sleep in their gardens or whatever it was

1075
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,220
 and sort of be very hospitable.

1076
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,340
 - In Scotland, you're allowed to sleep in any field, right?

1077
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,180
 - No way.

1078
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,100
 - I think so.

1079
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,900
 I think, unlike in England,

1080
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,260
 if you want a camp, you need permission of the Londoner,

1081
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,020
 but in Scotland, I think you're allowed.

1082
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,140
 - Wow.

1083
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:55,980
 - Starting.

1084
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,380
 Okay, well, they did a bit of that.

1085
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,580
 They did a bit of camping.

1086
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,820
 And he says, "No such thing as a fish was our soundtrack."

1087
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,140
 We listened to the drove effects while walking

1088
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,700
 on the old drove road.

1089
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,540
 - Very good.

1090
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,020
 - Yeah.

1091
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,580
 And also, it's made it's called Dante.

1092
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,420
 What a name.

1093
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,500
 - I know, Dante.

1094
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,140
 - Duncan and Dante.

1095
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,140
 And they saw the great Polish map of Scotland.

1096
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,980
 Have you heard of this?

1097
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,700
 - No, it's the largest physical map in the world, apparently.

1098
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,420
 And it was made by some Poles living in Scotland

1099
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,180
 during the Second World War, as a thank you present.

1100
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,220
 I looked it up, it's absolutely massive.

1101
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,140
 There's massive map of Scotland.

1102
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,460
 Very cool, very cool.

1103
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,300
 - I know.

1104
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,020
 So there was some, just stunning stuff.

1105
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,820
 That's an extreme fish, I'd say.

1106
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,260
 Would you like to hear a bit of non-determ.

1107
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,980
 Quick old blast on that, please.

1108
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,060
 Flute, lovely.

1109
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,140
 Dennis Walker of Dumf, oh, I'm gonna say this wrong.

1110
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,260
 Dumfurlin, Dumfurlin.

1111
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,340
 - You got it right, the second time.

1112
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,580
 - Dumfurlin, yeah.

1113
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,700
 - Right, on nominative determinism,

1114
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,820
 I have always been amused by this book,

1115
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,660
 a book about chocolate by Sophie D. Coe

1116
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,300
 and Michael D. Coe.

1117
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,060
 - Coe coe.

1118
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,140
 - Coe coe.

1119
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,980
 - Oh.

1120
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,820
 - How good is that?

1121
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,660
 - Very good.

1122
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,820
 - I like it when people have,

1123
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,700
 they make you work a bit for your non-determ, you know?

1124
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,540
 - Yeah.

1125
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,420
 - There's not an immediately obvious spot.

1126
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,260
 - There you go.

1127
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,540
 - I wonder what he does for a job,

1128
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:18,140
 because his name would lend itself to non.

1129
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,980
 - Dennis Walker.

1130
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,820
 - Yeah.

1131
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,660
 - What are you thinking?

1132
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,420
 Line painter on the roads.

1133
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,580
 - Or just, he walks a lot.

1134
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,220
 He's a, is that a job?

1135
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,740
 - Can be.

1136
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,140
 - Tour guide.

1137
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,900
 - Yeah.

1138
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,660
 - Line painter on the roads, and I said.

1139
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,220
 (laughing)

1140
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,980
 - But has he said?

1141
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,820
 - No.

1142
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,060
 - I want right back in, Dennis Walker.

1143
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,900
 - Yeah.

1144
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,740
 - For God's sake.

1145
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,660
 - Please, in future emails, please include your profession.

1146
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,820
 You know, it's important.

1147
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,660
 - It is.

1148
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,500
 - It is important.

1149
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,980
 - Finally, email.

1150
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,300
 Nate Booster from Eugene Oregon writes.

1151
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,140
 - What do I name?

1152
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,420
 - Thank you for the hilarious and data rich show.

1153
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,260
 - Thank you.

1154
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,100
 That's nice.

1155
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,380
 It's a very nice compliment.

1156
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,620
 And Nate adds a bit of nominative determinism.

1157
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,460
 My last name is Booster.

1158
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,980
 And I spend a good chunk of my work day at a pharmacy

1159
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,220
 giving people vaccines.

1160
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,060
 - Very nice.

1161
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,900
 - Brilliant.

1162
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,740
 - That's awesome.

1163
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,540
 - But what do you do for a living, Nate?

1164
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,380
 - Oh, I'm sorry.

1165
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,220
 - That's great.

1166
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,060
 - Yeah.

1167
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,900
 - So there you go.

1168
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,740
 - Lovely.

1169
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,740
 - Anyway, that's it for this episode of "Crops of Line".

1170
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,860
 It was a good one, Andy.

1171
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,860
 It was, it's always fun.

1172
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,020
 And we'll be back again, now in two weeks.

1173
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,860
 - Come on.

1174
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,440
 (upbeat music)

1175
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,140
 And if you have anything to say about anything we've said,

1176
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,900
 please write to podcast@ky.com.

1177
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,340
 Thank you very much everyone for listening.

1178
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,420
 See you next time.

1179
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,260
 Bye.

1180
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,840
 (upbeat music)

1181
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,420
 (upbeat music)

1182
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,000
 (upbeat music)
