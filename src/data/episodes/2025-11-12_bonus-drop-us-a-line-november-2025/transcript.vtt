WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
 - They don't want it, I don't want it.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.000
 (upbeat music)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.900
 - Hi, welcome to Dropper's Align.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.120
 Welcome to the audience feedback show

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.940
 as part of Club Fish.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.500
 Welcome to all you Club Fishers,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.900
 whether you're listening or watching.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.220
 We've had a huge emboss--

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.220
 - I don't think anyone's watching or mute.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.980
 I think the people are watching are also listening.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.740
 So whether you are watching or listening

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.540
 or merely listening, is that all right?

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.260
 - Yeah, there could be captions actually,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.180
 it could be subtitles.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.340
 - It could be, also I saw a comment from someone saying

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.580
 they love just looking at our three heads.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.220
 (laughing)

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.420
 So if you're watching from some kind of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.320
 I imagine mental health institution,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.380
 we've had a very, very full inbox.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.340
 - How full, it's bulging.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.620
 - Yeah, exciting.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.740
 - It's, it's heaving.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.140
 It's, it's riving, the inbox.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 - Yeah, it's separating.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.680
 (laughing)

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.420
 - Let's clear it out, let's do it.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.420
 - You're right.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.540
 Let's start with an email from Matthew Acorn,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.340
 a book with an H in the middle.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.340
 - Acorn?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.700
 - Yeah. - Hey John.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.780
 - Could be, hello Matthew.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.340
 We mentioned a thing about literary characters

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.380
 whose names clearly say what they like.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.620
 Like Dickens does and like Joe Rowling does.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.500
 - Exactly, exactly.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.700
 - And I always say it's massively hack,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.140
 even though a lot of very, very great writers have done it.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.980
 - Yeah.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.420
 - What's that I can't actually think of an example

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.260
 right now?

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.420
 - Tony Old.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.260
 - Tony Old.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.100
 - Is that a dickens?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.940
 - Well, no, but it would be it.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.180
 If I was, yeah, yeah.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.260
 - I've got a book coming out next year.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.100
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.380
 - Tony Old is the main character.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.780
 - Is that what the old curiosity shop is?

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.100
 It's his shop.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.940
 - Right, yeah.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.460
 (laughing)

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.540
 - The club Cratchit is Cratchin' around in the ground.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.940
 (laughing)

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.780
 - Mr. Bumble.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.700
 - Yes.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.540
 - Bumbles around.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.380
 - Yeah.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.220
 - Okay.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.060
 - That kind of thing.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.580
 Anyway, there is a book called Snowcrash.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.900
 - Hmm.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.460
 - The novel Snowcrash has a character called Hero

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.180
 with an eye, as in Japanese name.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.660
 - Hero protagonist.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.940
 (laughing)

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.420
 - That's really good.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.500
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.260
 - I love that name, Hero.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.100
 - Yeah, me too.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.940
 - Great name.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.900
 - That's from Matthew Acorn,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.540
 who lives in a place called Trophy Club in Texas.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.500
 (laughing)

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.700
 - Isn't that unusual?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.540
 - Yeah.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.380
 - And I looked it up.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.340
 And it's James, you're going to love this.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.700
 It's centered around a country club.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.660
 It's basically a golf horse.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.180
 - Golf horse, now that is what I want.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.820
 Those golf buggies are so old-hat.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.380
 I want a golf horse.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.060
 And then you can play like Polo, but with golf clubs.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.060
 - Has anyone done that?

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.780
 Because you've got two sports so close to each other

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.860
 in terms of the item.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.420
 - Why on earth wouldn't you use a horse as a caddy?

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.420
 It just makes perfect sense.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.460
 They fertilize the green.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.300
 - That's true.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.140
 - Which is what you want, isn't it?

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.140
 - And you can ride them.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.820
 You can't ride your caddy in golf.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.660
 - No.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.820
 - It's frowned on.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.100
 - You know what, I rode a horse for the first time

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.380
 a few weeks ago.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.220
 - Did you?

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.060
 - Yeah.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.540
 And I found it absolutely terrifying.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.540
 (laughing)

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.860
 - Well, you're a long way up.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.700
 - Yeah.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.220
 - And they're unpredictable.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.580
 - I will never do it again.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.300
 'Cause I felt like it was a bit unfair on the horse, really.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.140
 - Why?

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.980
 - Because you were inexperienced.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.220
 - No, because I weigh 90 kilos.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.060
 - Right.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.380
 - Then you think Harry, heavy, heavy, like burdens.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.980
 - Well, I don't think that's fair, I bet.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.500
 (laughing)

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.980
 - I don't think we've got a complete difference in our opinion.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.420
 I think it's absolutely fine to put them through hell.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.660
 - And you know what, that ride in the horse,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.260
 it wasn't the most uncomfortable I was that day

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.380
 because I also went for my first ever massage.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.820
 I've never been for a massage before.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.660
 - What a day for you.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.260
 - And I went for a full naked massage.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.100
 - Oh!

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.940
 - Like a time massage.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.780
 - Yeah, right.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.020
 - It was my birthday.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.860
 - What a birthday.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.700
 - What a birthday.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.860
 - Did you get, were you naked on the horse as well?

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.500
 - No, no, I wasn't wearing my birthday suits

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.660
 all the way through the day.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.300
 - Did you have the massage after the horse riding?

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.740
 - Actually, no, I did it the wrong way around.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.820
 'Cause it was a sunset horse ride.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.700
 - So now that you're totally relaxed,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.500
 like a boneless jelly,

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.340
 let's get you on a horse where you have to,

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.740
 you know, maintain perfect posture.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.500
 Did you have, were they, did they walk all over you?

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.340
 - That kind of massage.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.180
 - Oh, I switched out.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.300
 (laughing)

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.420
 - They also fertilized my back.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.380
 I've got a lovely hairy back now

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.980
 after all that fertilizing.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.500
 - What a day for you, James.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.340
 - Yeah, it's my birthday.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.820
 And you know what, the very next day,

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.500
 I went straight back into my comfort zone

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.860
 and I don't intend to leave there

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.740
 for another 360-poil day.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.220
 - Yeah, that's just quite something.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.020
 I can't imagine you having a massage.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.900
 You're just such an unmassaging person.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.100
 - I'm just, I'm really ticklish.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.620
 And I don't like people touching me.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.060
 - And you thrive on tension.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.900
 - Yeah.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.100
 - So did you like it or not?

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.940
 - No, I was extremely uncomfortable

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.780
 all the way through.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.300
 - Make it is a big step to go.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.460
 You should go to a, like a step one massage first.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.580
 - Well, you're in like hazmat suits.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.780
 - Yeah, like you just take off,

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.700
 you just really reveal one flap of skin

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.940
 and let me rub you through that.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.100
 (laughing)

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.420
 - Tealers choice.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.220
 Or like an airport chair that you put coins in,

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.060
 like one of those ones.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.060
 - Oh yeah, I've been in one of those.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.940
 - You've done that, right.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.780
 - How exciting.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.780
 - You've done that massage in years.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.980
 You were a massage guy.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.100
 - What do you think?

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.260
 - I think every morning.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.740
 (laughing)

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.860
 - I'm often late for things.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.620
 - You're in like a mini kimono.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.460
 I can see you.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.740
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.340
 - Here are protagonists watching.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.180
 (laughing)

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.060
 Cracks his fingers.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.420
 - Right, should we do some emails?

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.260
 - Yeah, sure.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.980
 - Right, let's go to a rodeo clown.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.460
 rodeo clown of the week.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.260
 - Okay, boy, oh boy.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.580
 - I feel like having ridden the horse for the first time.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.460
 I'm able to comment on these now.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.420
 - Yeah, well, you're about to get bucked right off this horse.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.620
 Ruth Tiffin writes, right name.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.980
 Oh no, Andy.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.420
 The amount of emails you're about to get

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.980
 about everyone's pronunciation of null-ar-bore

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.220
 is going to be off the chain, Loll, and Ruth was right.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.340
 And it was followed by, I'd say, 15 to 20 emails, say.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.980
 - Do you remember when we went to this place in Australia?

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.820
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.820
 - So it's where there are no trees.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.980
 - It's where there are no trees.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.260
 - Exactly, from the Latin, nullus and arbor.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.100
 - No trees.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.660
 Well, in terms of the Australians have formed

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.900
 their own unique way of pronouncing that name,

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.300
 and they're very interested that that's the correct way.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.140
 - I think that's fine.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.980
 - Yep, absolutely.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.820
 It is fine.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.340
 The Romans are long dead.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.300
 They don't get to say it's pronounced anymore.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.420
 But my goodness, Mel Brayeswell was on as well, wasn't she?

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.260
 - Mel Brayeswell.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.780
 Having moved to Australia two weeks earlier,

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.860
 would have been able to tell us that.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.940
 - Absolutely.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.180
 - How do you pronounce it?

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.020
 - Null-ar.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.180
 - I'm so terrified now to say it.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.420
 I think null-ar-bore.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.580
 - Null-ar-bore.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.820
 - Null-ar-bore.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.060
 Null-ar-bore.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.900
 Leah Bridges says, "Dang claims to be Australian.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.780
 Come on, mate."

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.580
 But throws in a fact about null-ar-bore.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.420
 - Right.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.540
 - If you're driving from the eastern states,

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.460
 you can't take fruit, vegetables, or honey

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.580
 into South Australia or Western Australia,

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.100
 but you can take onions and garlic

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.860
 as long as you peel them first.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.380
 - Pre-pit, wow, pre-peeled.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.220
 - That's a good fact.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.060
 - Peeling garlic, yeah.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.900
 - Cool.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.740
 - All right.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.660
 Marcus Jakes writes, "I have listened to nearly every podcast

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.500
 you have done.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.180
 I look forward to Friday when I get a new one,

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.740
 but ep604 was a disaster."

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.540
 Can't pronounce Melbourne.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.820
 Do we say Melbourne wrong?

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.660
 - Melbourne.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.500
 - Melbourne.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.900
 We've talked about Melbourne.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.140
 That's not Melbourne.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.340
 That's a different thing.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.820
 Can't pronounce Melbourne or Null-ar-bore.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.980
 Terrible description of a road train, not even close.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.340
 I have more, but in my disbelief, I've forgotten most.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.260
 Considering Melbourne is the city with the most NBA number one

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.620
 draft picks since 1981.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.860
 We deserve more respect.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.700
 Excuse me.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.900
 I don't know what that means.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.380
 I thought I was going to hand over to you.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.220
 - I can't.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.060
 - What?

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.820
 - In Australia, of Australian NBA people.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.220
 - Yeah, it must be of.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.700
 - Because there would be a lot more people in LA or--

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.300
 - Just America, generally.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.620
 Well, I don't know what a draft pick is,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.660
 so I'm very happy to just hand over to you guys.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.420
 - Do you want to know or--

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.260
 - We'll just assume everyone does know.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.180
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.180
 I can't think of who it might have been,

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.180
 but, okay.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.940
 - That's a top basketball player, not all Australian.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.820
 - It's a really idea.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.180
 - Here's a funny idea.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.340
 - I do.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.900
 - I mean, Mark, she's my thing, so I'm sorry,

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.740
 sorry, Mark.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.180
 - But one of the Aussie basketball players

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.260
 who was massive in the NBA was part of Michael Jordan's

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.740
 Chicago Bulls team was Luke Longley,

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.100
 who is brother-in-law by marriage

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.020
 of our guest, Ben Elton.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:32.860
 - Recent guest.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.700
 - Is that right?

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.540
 - Yeah.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.060
 That's good.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.700
 - Actually, on draft picks, just from the Ben Elton show,

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.060
 we mentioned William Shakespeare, the NFL player.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.900
 - Right, yeah.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.580
 - And I was like, I know the name,

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.460
 and the reason I knew it is he was the first ever draft pick

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.540
 in American football.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.860
 So, I mean--

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.140
 - Right.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.300
 - So he's an American football player?

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.460
 - Yeah, yeah, but I was like, how do I know the name?

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.900
 'Cause you said, I said, oh, I've known that name,

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.060
 and you said, oh, he's from 1950 something,

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.060
 or 1960 something, so I was like,

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.020
 oh, well, I didn't watch American football back then,

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.140
 but that's how I know it, 'cause he was the first ever draft pick.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.220
 - Look, I'm just gonna say it.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.620
 There's college basketball, there's college football,

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.820
 they graduate, and the NBA and the NFL get to bid on them.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.700
 - You know what, I've never put knowledge out of my head.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.620
 So quickly, except when I've met someone

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.500
 and they've told me their name, that's like--

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.260
 (laughing)

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.460
 It was that fast, I was like, actively having to slap it right out.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.460
 - Wow, okay.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.500
 We also, in that episode, managed to fluff road trains,

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.740
 apparently, and this was me.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.580
 - I'm on the hook.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.420
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.260
 You were the one who said it.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.100
 - Oh gosh, I'm so sorry.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.580
 Thomas Wyndham writes, "I feel like a better job

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.300
 "could have been done explaining road trains."

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.060
 That's true.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.980
 It's a single vehicle with lots of trailers.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.820
 - Okay, right.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.820
 Now, what I said was, it's--

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.980
 - You thought it was like a convoy.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.580
 - I said something.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.380
 I said something really, really wrong.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.940
 In Australia, if there's a main vehicle pulling one trailer,

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.940
 that's a semi.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.700
 Sorry.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:06.740
 Sorry.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.620
 But--

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.020
 (laughing)

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.740
 - I'm done as semi, but it's like 18 feet long.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.660
 (laughing)

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.660
 - I wouldn't have made that joke

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.060
 if you just didn't giggle for the last 30 seconds.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:19.900
 - There we go.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.620
 - But road trains, it's one prime mover,

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.820
 as they call it, moving two or more full-size trailers,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.540
 and they're really long.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.260
 And apparently, even the shortest road train

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.420
 is as long as three and a half London buses.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.700
 - Wow.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.580
 - So you know how you felt about draft picks?

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.420
 - Yeah.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.620
 - I'm experiencing the exact moment right here.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.900
 - In Australia, you should be all over the road train, Stan.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.900
 - That was a dorkin--

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.180
 I was sitting reading Mark's brothers in a bedroom.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.020
 - I wasn't into it.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:46.860
 - Okay.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.660
 - Well, you may like to know, Thomas adds additional,

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.580
 they might have additional locomotives in the middle

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.180
 of a big long road train.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.460
 It might be an extra engine in the middle,

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.420
 providing more power.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.260
 - That's pretty cool.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.100
 - Wow.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.740
 So there you go.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.980
 Bryce Clark writes, this is absolutely huge.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.540
 Do you remember we mentioned one of the most famous

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.020
 Australians of all time?

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.300
 - Oh, Lenbedel.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.460
 - Lenbedel.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.300
 - Lenbedel.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.140
 - Yeah.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:08.980
 - Yeah.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.820
 - Right.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.180
 Bryce Clark writes, I know Gary of Gary Highway.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.020
 So Lenbedel was the Australian road builder

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.820
 who named all of his roads after members as family.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.660
 - We all know that.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.500
 - We all know that.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.780
 - It's only Mal, who didn't know Lenbedel.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.260
 (laughing)

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.300
 And so Bryce writes, I know Gary of Gary Highway.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.420
 He's got good dental work.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.300
 'Cause Lenbedel would take out the teeth of--

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.180
 - Oh, they're crews building the roads of the desert.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.380
 Gary is a well-respected piano technician in Melbourne.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.860
 But I think his sister-- - Sorry, what?

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.700
 - Melborn.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.660
 But I think his sister does bush tours

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.340
 around the areas their dad worked.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.340
 - Right.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.500
 - Bush, 'cause all of his books,

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.380
 you remember beating around the bush too long in the bush?

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.220
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.420
 - Bushbashes.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.220
 - Yes, bushwhackers.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.060
 - Bushwhackers are a very big band in Australia.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.460
 The bushwhackers, yeah.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.300
 - Interesting.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.020
 - They wrote the song, "I am you are we are Australian."

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.660
 If you know that song.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.740
 - That's how Australians learn grammar.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.860
 (laughing)

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.700
 - So I know that's huge news that we allow

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.860
 two handshakes away from Lenbedel, basically.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.700
 - It's huge.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.540
 - Is he still alive?

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.380
 - I don't believe Len is, no.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.380
 I think so. - So that'll be a bit

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.660
 of an awkward handshake.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.020
 - Certainly with some digging required.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.580
 - Oh, dear.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.980
 And David writes, "Pubquizzes, do you remember

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.220
 "Pubquizz Roads in Australia?"

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.060
 - Yeah.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:28.900
 - This is a big thing.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.220
 Well, the Western USA also has miles and miles

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.860
 of nothing but miles and miles, writes David.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.900
 And during the heyday of America's love affair with cars,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.340
 we had Burma Shave signs,

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.140
 which had humorous limericks on them.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.660
 - So a razor company?

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.500
 - Yeah.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.340
 - Right.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.180
 - It's got to be.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.620
 It's Burma Shave has to be a razor company.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.780
 I did look it up, I think it is.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.700
 - And then we just put random limericks.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.540
 - Yeah.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.380
 - Very nice.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.820
 But David says, "Since we Americans are not as intellectually

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.020
 adept as Brits, we had humorous limericks

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.380
 rather than quiz questions."

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.300
 - I'd like to hear an example of the limericks.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.220
 - I don't have one, I'm so sorry.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.060
 - Sorry.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.260
 - Must end in like shave or...

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.260
 - Razor?

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.820
 - Taser, laser.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:11.660
 That's not for a limerick.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.420
 - It has to begin with the once was a man

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.540
 from Australasia.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.260
 (laughing)

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.700
 - Who tried to shave with a laser?

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.540
 - Yeah.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.820
 - He burned off his face.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.620
 Wanted to disgrace.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.380
 He should have used a Burma Shave razor.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.220
 - Brilliant.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.060
 - There we go.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.900
 - We should have gone into advertising.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.100
 - We do been bloody good.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.540
 - Maybe all our ads going forward are in limerick form.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.540
 - That's a very good idea.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.380
 - Look how quick that was.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.540
 - Yeah.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.060
 - And we'll have the royalty rights of the lyrics.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:43.900
 - The royalty rights?

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.940
 - Oh yeah, you mean, when they make a song,

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.860
 when Kendrick won the harmonics a song.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.700
 - Yeah.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.540
 - With one of our limericks.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.700
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.540
 It could happen.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.420
 Chas and Dave got used in M&M song, remember?

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.340
 - How many rhymes are they for VPN?

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.260
 - Then, men.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.100
 - Hen.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:13:59.940
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.780
 - Come on.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.860
 - Biscuits in New Zealand.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.900
 - Biscuit tin was what we were talking about.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.460
 The fact that Parliament has a Biscuit tin

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.900
 that they pull out policies to discuss.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.740
 - Yes.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:15.300
 - So in that fact, John, from Parliament,

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.700
 the British Parliament, writes in.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.540
 This is exciting.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.380
 - John there, come.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.420
 - I can't say.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.060
 We've got a few secret squirrels today.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:23.900
 - It's too late.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.900
 - People who can't reveal their true name.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.740
 - Major?

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.580
 - Location.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.420
 - It's John Major.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.260
 I was listening to today's episode

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.060
 and you talk about whether the division bells

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.140
 still work in the pubs around Parliament.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.820
 - Oh yeah, I'd be interested in to know that.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.260
 - Well, I've got great news, James.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.380
 You're about to find out.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.900
 - We should re-explain what the division bell is.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.060
 'Cause it's so interesting.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.220
 It's basically if a vote needs to happen immediately,

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.380
 bells start ringing and everyone dashes towards

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.220
 to make their vote,

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.500
 but because they're all spread around in places

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.620
 like pubs around the area.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.860
 Sometimes there's telephones that ring

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.260
 and the division bells are ringing and they play it.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.540
 So yeah, it's a big thing,

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.300
 but we thought a lot of it went extinct in modern day.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.060
 - Well, I work in Parliament, says John,

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.820
 and I can say that they don't ring anymore.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.500
 The system, I believe, broke over COVID

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.540
 and as it was being phased out,

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.060
 they didn't bother to fix it.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.660
 It still works inside the building.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.460
 That's good, but not in external pubs.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.580
 Oh, it still goes off in the on-site bars.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.420
 There you go.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.580
 - There's three bars, isn't there?

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.060
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.020
 - And because of the sound of the division bells,

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.700
 John adds, it means the fire bell must be different.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.140
 So instead of a loud noise,

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.820
 it's a pot of voice saying warning,

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.700
 warning a fire has been reported in your vicinity.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.500
 (laughing)

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.340
 - That's good.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.140
 - When my daughter was born,

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:45.860
 we, it was in the hospital opposite the Parliament.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.860
 - Oh, across the town.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.700
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.100
 - Yeah, St. Thomas's. - St. Thomas's.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.060
 - And we were in a room overlooking Parliament.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.940
 - Wow. - So we could see the people

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.340
 and obviously when your child is born,

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.180
 you're awake all night.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.020
 So we could see the people with flashlights,

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.540
 you know, looking for fires

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.020
 that they do that every single night.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.540
 - Yeah, 24 hours a day.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.180
 - Yeah, like every couple of hours,

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.180
 someone with a flashlight would be looking for fires outside.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.420
 - You're worse in the bed saying,

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.100
 James, I can appreciate.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.020
 A bit of, I need a bit of help with the boat.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.580
 You're saying, wait, wait, it's been an hour and 57 minutes

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.060
 and I just, I wanna check my theory.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.260
 - That's terrific, that's so cool.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.660
 - That is cool. - That's spooky.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:32.140
 Right, here is, get yourself off the hook for James.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.700
 We've both had a real showing so far with this whole.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.540
 - Okay, no, I'm ready.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.700
 - Nullabor thing. - I'm ready.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.180
 - Nullabor, yeah, yeah.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:45.100
 Simo Sarn writes, in episode 604 at 5119,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.180
 well, I'll just, over to you, James.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:51.220
 - Oh, no, I see, so that's right near the end.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.060
 - Yep.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.100
 - Number 614. - 604. - 6, oh, right, sorry.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.420
 - That's the, it's still the Mount Bracewell show.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.620
 We're talking about, yeah.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.460
 The last section, James says that pie is infinite.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.500
 - Oh, here we go.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.060
 - And doesn't repeat, meaning it's irrational,

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.980
 thus all series of numbers are in there.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.140
 Then Simo says the latter called normality

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.140
 actually doesn't follow from the former.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.940
 It's a separate property which hasn't been proven

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.300
 or disproven about pie. - Yeah.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.820
 - So, you're on the hook. - Well, I'm about to say something,

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.580
 which will go directly into both your head

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.940
 and then directly out of it straight afterwards.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:24.940
 - Okay.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.660
 - But yeah, pie is not a normal number as far as we know

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.500
 or it might be or it might not be,

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.380
 which means that it might be that all numbers are in there

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.900
 or it might not be.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.700
 Now, I said that it might repeat,

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.340
 but what is definitely true is that it doesn't repeat

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:43.260
 at the end, you know, like one third is 0.3333333

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.020
 and it just keeps going forever.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.500
 Pie definitely doesn't do that.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.220
 It's not like a repeated set of numbers

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.260
 that just keeps going on like that.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.220
 What is possible is that there is some pattern inside of pie

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.060
 as in it's not at the end, but it's inside.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:01.540
 Like it could be, it could go 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.100
 That's a pattern and it's a repeating pattern,

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.020
 but it isn't repeating numbers.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.700
 - Hmm. - Right.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.820
 - And what was very difficult to part across

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.220
 in the comedy show that we were doing,

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.500
 was that quite advanced math,

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.860
 at which I did at university

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.740
 and which, in fairness,

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.900
 I haven't completely remembered all of it.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.340
 - Yeah. - And I did flub it a little bit.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.820
 - I think he slightly fudged it though at the time.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.180
 I think he said it might or might not be.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.420
 So I-- - I definitely fudged it.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.260
 It's slightly inexcusable because I do know it all,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.620
 like all that stuff, and I did study it,

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.500
 but at the same time, yeah.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.820
 - So I think you're off the hook.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:35.820
 - I don't think so.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.740
 - Well, we've got to the end of it either, have we?

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.100
 - We haven't, but we know for a fact that it doesn't do that

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.420
 'cause then it would, you would be able to express it

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.060
 as a fraction, which you can't.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.660
 - I forgot about the fraction.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.540
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.380
 - There you go.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.620
 - Okay. That was very interesting.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.460
 - Thank you, James.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.900
 - I think the show does have to be serious sometimes,

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:51.900
 drop us a line.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:52.740
 - What do you think?

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.860
 - I think it can't all be hilarious.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.260
 - It can't all be limer eggs.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.980
 - It can't all be music limer eggs.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:02.660
 Josh Jones writes, long time listener, clubfish member,

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.820
 hello Josh, and first time message guy.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.860
 I was listening to episode six, I fought with Mell's Forfax,

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.860
 and you spoke about the digits of pi.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.380
 Listening to her recite pi to 50 decimal places.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.540
 - That's very impressive.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.820
 - It was astonishing.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.900
 - It's amazing 'cause what she actually did was just say

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.060
 all 10 numbers, and I put them in the right order.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.100
 She doesn't know, actually,

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.300
 she didn't even know the first thing.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.300
 - That's a great edit.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.780
 - Yeah. - She's amazing.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.020
 - I don't think we knew she knew that as well.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.740
 That kind of just came out, didn't it, in the show?

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.460
 - I astonished. - Yeah.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.220
 But it reminded Josh of something here

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.540
 a few weeks ago.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.300
 He says, I work in a hospital with a surgeon,

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.060
 brackets gynecologist, who just a few weeks ago

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:45.060
 set a new Australian record by reciting pi to 10,640 places.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.540
 Can Chana, once a purer, is his name

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.700
 from Ballarat Base Hospital in Victoria, Australia.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.500
 So that's pretty good, isn't it?

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.860
 - That's very cool. - That's amazing.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.700
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.620
 - It is 10,000.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.460
 - That's a lot, isn't it?

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.980
 - Imagine he's just muttering away down there.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.980
 - What are you saying?

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.740
 - 3,640. - What are you measuring?

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.300
 (laughing)

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.620
 - I'm just doing the circumference,

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.820
 and then I could have divide it.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.580
 (laughing)

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.900
 - Bit of ribbled humour.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:14.300
 We've had emails from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.500
 - Oh, yes, we mentioned a fact about them.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.740
 - 'Cause it was about pie charts and pies and bakers in Australia.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.740
 So Mel Aitan, Aitan, has sent over a bar chart on bartenders,

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.220
 also things I've included here.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.540
 A line graph on line markers and a histogram on historians.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.780
 (laughing)

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.020
 - It's very nice. - This is altered by the Aussies.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.860
 - This is all the Aussies.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.940
 - Sorry, very good. - Very good.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.100
 So it's just a bit of fun, really.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:38.940
 - Really like that.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.260
 We should mention something quickly that actually,

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.220
 I've had a few messages about,

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.940
 which is the fact that the Mel Bracewell episode

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.700
 was the first episode we have ever done,

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.700
 where the facts were entirely from the guests that we had on,

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.140
 one person bringing the facts.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.100
 There was a lot of theories about why that happened.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.020
 - She insisted.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.540
 - She insisted? - Sever.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.780
 - Yeah.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.820
 Yeah, no people were saying like,

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.700
 "Oh, did they have no time to get it together?"

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.740
 And then she just brought the facts.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.140
 So just for clarity, 'cause why not?

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.340
 We basically received five facts from Mel.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.700
 We couldn't pick one we liked most

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:11.700
 because we thought they were brilliant.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.340
 And I think it was you James, just one.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.700
 We just do all the facts.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.660
 When that be fun, that it was just Mel's facts each time.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.660
 And then he resisted it.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.820
 It was so there was some resistance

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.860
 from more traditionally minded members of the group.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.460
 But yeah, and you know what?

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.900
 I'm gonna say, Mayor Culper, I was wrong.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.220
 Well, don't, don't Mayor Culper.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.060
 I mean, it's not my fault.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.860
 But I was wrong, so resisted.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.780
 I thought it was a very fun thing to do.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.620
 - But never again.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.420
 - Never again, never ever again.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.620
 But it was really fun.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.460
 They were all great facts.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.460
 - Right.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.980
 - Here's a, do you know the name, if I say Mike Giggler?

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.860
 - Mike Giggler?

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:49.980
 - Yeah.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.580
 Mike is maybe a private, I think.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.020
 It's like when someone writes an email in that's amusing,

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.580
 deliberately amusing.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.180
 Sometimes people just think of extra jokes.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.020
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.580
 - So is Mike, it's not a slam on the email.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.860
 - It is a bit of a slam to save Mike.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:02.700
 - It's a bit of a slam.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.540
 - Okay.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.580
 - To say, oh, there's a bit of Mike Giggler email.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.900
 Someone's saying, I've thought of a joke

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.380
 that you didn't at the time.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.740
 But we're operating in a live fire environment.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:10.940
 There's not time to think of every joke.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.540
 You know, sometimes you mess something and it's,

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.460
 - Sometimes you say a joke and I cut it out.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.020
 - Exactly, those are the most painful of all.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.860
 It's where like, someone's like, I can't believe

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.300
 you didn't make this incredibly obvious

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.340
 low-hanging fruit joke.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.460
 And I'm like, I did make the most obvious joke

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.820
 and I'm like, I did make the most obvious joke.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:27.940
 I'm a James Cunning.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.380
 Anyway, this is not, this is a bit of a Mike Giggler,

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.740
 but I'm very grateful to Caleb M for sending it.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.940
 Thank you, Caleb.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.500
 You remember we talked about ghost sharks

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.540
 and they've got these weird things on their head,

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.220
 made of teeth.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.060
 - Oh yeah.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.460
 - They used to grip on during sex.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.900
 - This is in the Sarah Pasco show.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.860
 - It certainly was.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.460
 Sorry, show change.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.460
 There we go, we're on the Pasco show now.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.700
 Anyway, Caleb writes, ghost sharks use their teeth

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.180
 to eat prey and love.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.660
 - Oh, that's a really good joke.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.900
 - Yeah. - To be fair.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.220
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.660
 - Well done, Mike. - Oh, we go.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:00.940
 - Caleb, no, no, I don't.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:01.780
 - Oh, I'm sorry.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.740
 (laughing)

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.180
 - Lauren Payne writes, "I was listening

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.660
 to this week's fish podcast

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.660
 and the mother of a friend of mine is a nurse,

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.300
 named Nurse Doctor."

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.380
 - Nurse Doctor. - Brilliant.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.940
 - Based on central Kentucky.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.420
 - 'Cause you said, Andy, that Paul Nurse is a doctor.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.720
 He won their Nobel Prize for Physiology.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.940
 - Oh, yeah. - And there was another

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.780
 doctor called Nurse,

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.460
 but you'd never found a nurse called Doctor.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.300
 - There we go.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.300
 "And my friend is considering going for a PhD

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.020
 to become Doctor Doctor."

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.780
 - Very good. - It's gonna be great.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.340
 - Which was Sarah Gertons.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.900
 - Wasn't that the name of President Garfields,

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.740
 one of the doctors?

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.140
 - Doctor, Doctor Willard Bliss.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.780
 - Yes, his first name was Doctor, that's right.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.540
 - So, Doctor. - Oh!

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.940
 - There's been an amazing email from Dragon.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.260
 Dragon. - What a great name, can't you spell?

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.340
 - Dragon, but with another A instead of the O.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.580
 - Are they from Serbia?

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:57.860
 - They don't say, is that a Serbian name?

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.420
 - Uh, I know some dragons from Serbia.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.740
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.860
 - That's pretty cool. - It's a footballer

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.020
 called Dragon Steak of It, I think, as well.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.260
 I'm not sure if he was Serbian.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.780
 - That's a great name.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:08.780
 - It's very strong.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.300
 Anyway, it's the Blade Runner plot title explainer.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.980
 Now, just look at this half of the sheet of paper.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:15.820
 That's very important.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.900
 Don't turn it over. - Oh, okay.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.180
 - So it basically shows,

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:19.780
 and we'll put it on screen as well,

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.180
 where the title comes from, where the plot comes from.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.500
 It just makes it so clear.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.740
 - And he's made this for us?

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.900
 - Dragon.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.740
 - We should explain,

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.340
 'cause some people won't have heard the episode.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.500
 The very basic thing is,

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.940
 "Do Android Stream of Electric Sheep" by Philip K. Dick

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.940
 was being adapted into a movie.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.820
 The people making the movie didn't like the title.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.180
 So they call it Blade Runner,

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.300
 but in order to call it Blade Runner,

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.060
 they had to buy the rights to another book,

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.460
 written by William S. Burrows,

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.340
 to take the title, but just the title,

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.460
 and apply it to the Philip K. Dick book.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.420
 - That William Burrows had taken the story

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.700
 from another book called Blade Runner,

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.060
 and turned it into a movie adaptation,

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.620
 which was never adapted, but then was later adapted.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.420
 - Yeah, and that book was by someone called,

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.540
 I think it was "Alone Nas." - "Alone Nas."

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.540
 - Anyway, so it does not make it clear?

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.820
 - Yeah, although it's just very complicated, isn't it?

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.380
 - Yeah, although someone on the train the other day

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.460
 was reading "Do Android Stream of Electric Sheep."

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.500
 Coincidence? - Yeah.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.340
 - Pass it back.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:23.420
 - I tell you what, if they were reading the "Alone Nas" book,

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.940
 which is quite obscure, I've been really surprised.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.940
 - Yeah, I might have had to intervene at that point,

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.740
 or if they were reading the final book

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.620
 in this little image here, of the novelization of the movie,

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.860
 Blade Runner, which is not "Do Android Stream of Electric Sheep."

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.860
 - That can't have sold well.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.260
 - Can't have done it. - Do you want to read

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.100
 the book of the film?

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.100
 - Yeah, well, there is one, you know?

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.140
 - Anyway. - Yeah.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.380
 - Right, "Discussed."

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.500
 William James writes, "We talked about being disgusting."

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.740
 - All right, not the past of "Discussed."

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.380
 - No, right.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.140
 - Although we, I suppose we did "Discussed."

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.500
 It was "Discussed." - Yeah.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.140
 - In regard to Sarah Pasco's fact, regarding "A Rousal,"

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.900
 reducing people's "Discussed" response.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.740
 - So this was Dan's idea that if he arouses his wife,

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.380
 he could get to take up the bench.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.780
 He's one of my favorite lines ever in any podcast we've ever done.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.060
 - Really pulling pain to the wife guy thing, as well.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.860
 (laughing)

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.740
 James, folks, the idea of a restaurant

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.660
 that shows "Soft Cool Pawn" to entice people

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.500
 in tweeting "Medio-Coffoon."

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.020
 - Yeah. (laughing)

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.820
 - Though it doesn't show "Pawn" per se,

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.700
 I believe there is already a restaurant chain in North America

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.500
 operating on this basic principle.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.780
 I believe James has invented Hooters.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.780
 - Yes. (laughing)

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.940
 - I believe I have.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.180
 - Yeah, congratulations.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.780
 Like that's a huge business.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.020
 - That is a big business.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.380
 - Yeah, but it exists, doesn't it?

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.540
 What am I gonna do?

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.180
 - Yeah, I know, that's the only,

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.060
 but you could be the first Hooters,

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.300
 I don't think Hooters exists in the UK, does it?

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.460
 You could franchise Hooters.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.460
 - Spring Fellows, is that Hooters in the UK or not?

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.300
 I don't know.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.460
 - I think it's just a big chain of like,

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.940
 not very good restaurants, though,

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.740
 so there is definitely a gap in the market.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.780
 - I think they've tried, maybe.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:07.100
 - Well, the advantage of my version is you don't have labor costs

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:11.060
 'cause you just put the TV on and show some Soft Cool Pawn.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:11.900
 - Yeah.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.500
 - You don't have to pay the waiters on waitresses.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.380
 - It must be niche, like we're for geeks.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:21.780
 Like a cypher, oh, like Dr Hooters.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.620
 - Dr Hooters and all of the people there

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.580
 have three boobs and they're alien like, I mean, yeah.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.100
 - Where's the doctor, Pa?

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:30.940
 - A doctor who?

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:31.860
 There's a cypher.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.420
 (laughing)

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.060
 - Some steps went on in your head there.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:35.900
 - Absolutely.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:36.900
 - And you really need to elucidate.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:37.740
 - Why so cypher?

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.580
 That's a cypher.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.420
 - Sorry.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.420
 - Dr Hooters.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.420
 - Yeah.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.820
 (laughing)

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.020
 - Bigger on the inside boys.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:44.860
 - Oh my God.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.020
 (laughing)

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.060
 - Four, five, seven, nine.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.500
 (laughing)

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:56.180
 - Oh, we've got very blokey since Anna went on matter.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.300
 I think it's really, it's ribbled now.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.140
 - Yeah.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.340
 - That's the second time you've used ribbled today.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.500
 - Has it get away?

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.140
 - Yeah.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.220
 - What a bad vocabulary I've got.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.980
 But you know where you know one fancy word.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.380
 You're constantly.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.620
 - Was that your word of the day that you've read?

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:12.820
 - Oh my tear off calendar.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.980
 (laughing)

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.660
 - Ribbled, hmm.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.740
 Don't mind if I do.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.540
 - Oh, yeah, that's very embarrassing.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.340
 - All right, let's move on.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.900
 Sophie McCook writes,

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.060
 - Ah yeah.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.940
 - I don't often know a fish fact before I hear it

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.140
 on your podcast, but the news of the great raft spider,

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.980
 mmm, Norfolk spider.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:31.820
 - Yes.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.420
 - It can run across the water.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.260
 - Lots of it, yeah.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.900
 - It lives in the Norfolk broads and things like that.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.420
 Great spider.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:39.780
 It was already fresh off the press for me

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.460
 because the fact is currently being used

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.020
 as an excuse by my mother.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.380
 (laughing)

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.620
 She lives in a small cottage in Beckles, Suffolk.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.100
 And holiday rents out a smaller cottage in the garden,

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.740
 right on the river, Waveney.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.380
 The cottage, she rents out,

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.420
 seems to be a popular spider congregating place.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:03.180
 They're all sizes and favor the walls, ceiling and bath.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.100
 My mother doesn't want to hoover them all up,

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.620
 spiders are friends.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.260
 So she's printed an extensive guest information pack

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.940
 all about rare Suffolk spiders,

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.460
 especially the great raft spider,

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.660
 and she hopes this will act as an information to pay

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.180
 that will stop visitors leaving poor reviews.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.180
 - Hmm.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.260
 So what we've got here is a holiday cottage

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.100
 that is absolutely, sounds like absolutely coated in spiders.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.580
 (laughing)

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.820
 - Imagine in a Ragnaphobia if you go to,

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.620
 you know that movie, you go there,

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.100
 but there's just a big sign saying spiders are our friends.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.300
 (laughing)

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.460
 - You know what, this reminds me of,

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.180
 I was driving back from somewhere,

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.260
 I can't remember what it was,

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.460
 somewhere in Gloucestershire maybe the other day,

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.260
 and I drove through Beesden.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.100
 - To you.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:44.940
 - To you.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.780
 - Wow.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.980
 - Was that, and I've taught me a different way,

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.700
 'cause it was like a problem on the roads,

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.980
 and then suddenly I was like welcome to Beesden,

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.980
 and it reminded me of one of our favorite facts.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.500
 - Yes, full of Bees.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:55.340
 - Full of Bees?

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.180
 - But he's still.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.900
 - Like 10,000 Bees were stolen from Beesden.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.460
 - Yes, that was the, that was getting it now.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.620
 - Look at the year.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.860
 - 2,000 Bees were stolen in Beesden.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:04.700
 - Yeah.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.940
 - I almost stopped off and tried to find the Bees,

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.060
 but lucky that would be stupid.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.020
 - Yeah, well, they'll all be dead now.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.380
 (laughing)

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.820
 - How's the search going, guys?

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.980
 (laughing)

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:22.460
 - 2,000, it does sound like a lot, but for Bees, that's.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.300
 - No.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.300
 - Highval two, isn't it?

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.140
 - Yeah.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:25.980
 - Yeah.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:26.820
 - Very cool.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.820
 - A good book to write, though, and fun to read.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.380
 - Yeah.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.220
 - Right.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.700
 We've got a lookalike.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.900
 This is really exciting.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.900
 - Mm-hmm.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.860
 - Luke McNeil writes this.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.860
 I noticed an uncanny similarity between Dan Schreiber

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.940
 and Don Music from Sesame Street.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.620
 - Twin separated at birth, perhaps?

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.900
 Now, I was thinking, come on.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.220
 Is this, like, a Sesame Street character?

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.220
 This is not gonna look like that.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.900
 - That looks like Beaker, doesn't he?

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.540
 - Oh, from the Muppets.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.260
 Don Music, I would say, looks even more like Dan.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.100
 - All right.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.700
 - I'm just gonna turn the paper over for you now.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.620
 Your time starts now.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.100
 (laughing)

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.660
 - No, that's Louis Theroux, isn't it?

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.100
 (laughing)

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.220
 - It's quite Dan, isn't it?

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.060
 - Yeah.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.980
 - We prepared for how much, like, Dan.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.820
 (laughing)

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.300
 - Hey everybody!

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.300
 - What's he called?

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.300
 - Don Music.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.140
 - Don?

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:19.980
 - Don Music.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:20.820
 - I'm clear why.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:21.980
 - Oh, he sounds like a twat, doesn't he?

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.140
 (laughing)

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:23.980
 - What?

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.340
 - Don Music.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.580
 - Don Music.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.420
 - Sounds nice.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:28.420
 - No, right now.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.260
 - With that head?

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.100
 - With that face?

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:31.420
 - I mean, don't be too harsh about it,

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.700
 because it's your face, okay?

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:37.860
 - I need to say, I reckon Don Music probably does music, right?

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.700
 In the same way that Dan Schreiber,

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.940
 it does the German for writing.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.380
 - Yeah, that's so very true.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.900
 - I think it might actually be based on you.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.180
 - Wow, I know.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.860
 So I've got that guy from Dender Dan.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.860
 - Yeah.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:51.740
 - And Don Music.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.220
 - Maybe you're the guy with an incredibly recognizable

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.940
 copyable face and head, unlike me.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.740
 - No, you have just a face, but Dan has a face

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.100
 which is very similar to other faces.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.380
 - Yeah, mine is generic, Dan's is repeated.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.220
 - Yeah.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.060
 - I got it.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:07.900
 - Like Pie.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:08.740
 (laughing)

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:09.980
 - Please don't, please don't.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.500
 - No, then we're gonna do draft picks again,

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.100
 and I won't be able to hack it.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.620
 Extreme fish.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.260
 - What's that mean?

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.860
 - What do you think it means?

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.420
 People doing extreme things while listening to fish.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.420
 - Oh, great.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.220
 - Yeah, so we have the guy who went fishing.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.220
 (laughing)

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.500
 Okay, we'll get this.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.500
 I think this is unbelievable.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.140
 This might be email of the week.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:32.980
 - Okay.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.820
 - Okay.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.420
 - Duncan Pierce writes, "In the September of Drops of Line,

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.180
 "you said descendant pictures of you

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.220
 "doing extreme things while listening to fish.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.700
 "I'm not sure if this counts as extreme,

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.980
 "but efficient counts as extreme,

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.220
 "and this probably does as well."

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.220
 (laughing)

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.220
 Fair.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:51.220
 This summer, my friend Dante and I did our explore a belt.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:55.700
 Okay, a scout expedition similar to the British Duke of Edinburgh,

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.020
 but it's for Swedish scouts.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.380
 And it involves being dropped off in a random city

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.860
 in another country and having to hike 160 kilometers,

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.460
 at least over 10 days without paying for lodging

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.260
 or ready-made meals.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.260
 You just get dropped somewhere with a letter

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.180
 with your destination and some challenges and 200 quid.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.260
 That's it. - Cool.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.100
 Sounds great.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:16.940
 I'd love to do that.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.780
 - I know.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.580
 Dante and I did this in Scotland.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.380
 We were dropped off in a small village called Ecclefecan.

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.400
 (laughing)

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.820
 - The locals are having you on there.

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.300
 That is not a real place.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.900
 - Ecclefecan.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.740
 - Ecclefecan.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.580
 - Ecclefecan.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.140
 - Ecclefecan, yeah, yeah.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.700
 And they had this lovely time and he says,

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.940
 the scouts were incredibly kind and people would let them

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.460
 sleep in their gardens or whatever it was

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.220
 and sort of be very hospitable.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.340
 - In Scotland, you're allowed to sleep in any field, right?

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.180
 - No way.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.100
 - I think so.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.900
 I think, unlike in England,

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.260
 if you want a camp, you need permission of the Londoner,

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.020
 but in Scotland, I think you're allowed.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.140
 - Wow.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:55.980
 - Starting.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.380
 Okay, well, they did a bit of that.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.580
 They did a bit of camping.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:03.820
 And he says, "No such thing as a fish was our soundtrack."

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.140
 We listened to the drove effects while walking

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:07.700
 on the old drove road.

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.540
 - Very good.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.020
 - Yeah.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.580
 And also, it's made it's called Dante.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.420
 What a name.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.500
 - I know, Dante.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.140
 - Duncan and Dante.

00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.140
 And they saw the great Polish map of Scotland.

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:18.980
 Have you heard of this?

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.700
 - No, it's the largest physical map in the world, apparently.

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:23.420
 And it was made by some Poles living in Scotland

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.180
 during the Second World War, as a thank you present.

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:27.220
 I looked it up, it's absolutely massive.

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.140
 There's massive map of Scotland.

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.460
 Very cool, very cool.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.300
 - I know.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.020
 So there was some, just stunning stuff.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.820
 That's an extreme fish, I'd say.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:39.260
 Would you like to hear a bit of non-determ.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.980
 Quick old blast on that, please.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.060
 Flute, lovely.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:46.140
 Dennis Walker of Dumf, oh, I'm gonna say this wrong.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.260
 Dumfurlin, Dumfurlin.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.340
 - You got it right, the second time.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.580
 - Dumfurlin, yeah.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.700
 - Right, on nominative determinism,

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.820
 I have always been amused by this book,

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.660
 a book about chocolate by Sophie D. Coe

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.300
 and Michael D. Coe.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.060
 - Coe coe.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.140
 - Coe coe.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:04.980
 - Oh.

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:05.820
 - How good is that?

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.660
 - Very good.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.820
 - I like it when people have,

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.700
 they make you work a bit for your non-determ, you know?

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.540
 - Yeah.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.420
 - There's not an immediately obvious spot.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.260
 - There you go.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.540
 - I wonder what he does for a job,

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:18.140
 because his name would lend itself to non.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.980
 - Dennis Walker.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:19.820
 - Yeah.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:20.660
 - What are you thinking?

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.420
 Line painter on the roads.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.580
 - Or just, he walks a lot.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.220
 He's a, is that a job?

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.740
 - Can be.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.140
 - Tour guide.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:28.900
 - Yeah.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.660
 - Line painter on the roads, and I said.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.220
 (laughing)

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.980
 - But has he said?

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:34.820
 - No.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.060
 - I want right back in, Dennis Walker.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:36.900
 - Yeah.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:37.740
 - For God's sake.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.660
 - Please, in future emails, please include your profession.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:40.820
 You know, it's important.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:41.660
 - It is.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:42.500
 - It is important.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.980
 - Finally, email.

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.300
 Nate Booster from Eugene Oregon writes.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.140
 - What do I name?

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.420
 - Thank you for the hilarious and data rich show.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.260
 - Thank you.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.100
 That's nice.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.380
 It's a very nice compliment.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.620
 And Nate adds a bit of nominative determinism.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.460
 My last name is Booster.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.980
 And I spend a good chunk of my work day at a pharmacy

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.220
 giving people vaccines.

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.060
 - Very nice.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:03.900
 - Brilliant.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:04.740
 - That's awesome.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.540
 - But what do you do for a living, Nate?

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.380
 - Oh, I'm sorry.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.220
 - That's great.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.060
 - Yeah.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:10.900
 - So there you go.

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.740
 - Lovely.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.740
 - Anyway, that's it for this episode of "Crops of Line".

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.860
 It was a good one, Andy.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.860
 It was, it's always fun.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.020
 And we'll be back again, now in two weeks.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:20.860
 - Come on.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.440
 (upbeat music)

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.140
 And if you have anything to say about anything we've said,

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.900
 please write to podcast@ky.com.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.340
 Thank you very much everyone for listening.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.420
 See you next time.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.260
 Bye.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.840
 (upbeat music)

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.420
 (upbeat music)

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.000
