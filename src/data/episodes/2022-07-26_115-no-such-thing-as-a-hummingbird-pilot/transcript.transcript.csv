00:00:00,00:00:02,(whimsical music)
00:00:02,00:00:04,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:04,00:00:07,(upbeat music)
00:00:07,00:00:12,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:12,00:00:14,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:14,00:00:18,coming to you from the QI Offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:18,00:00:20,My name is Anna Tishinsky and I'm joined today
00:00:20,00:00:24,"by Ann Miller, James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:00:24,00:00:26,"And once again, we've gathered around the microphones"
00:00:26,00:00:28,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:28,00:00:33,"and in no particular order here, they are starting with Ann."
00:00:33,00:00:36,- My fact is that the alarm clock
00:00:36,00:00:38,on the mere space station made the same noise
00:00:38,00:00:39,as their emergency alarm.
00:00:39,00:00:40,"- That'll wait you up, wouldn't it?"
00:00:40,00:00:41,- It would wake you up with a start.
00:00:41,00:00:44,"This is Helen Sherman, he was the first Britain space."
00:00:44,00:00:46,He spent eight days up there in 1991
00:00:46,00:00:48,"and she was interviewed recently and said, quote,"
00:00:48,00:00:50,you'd wake up unsure if it was time to get up
00:00:50,00:00:52,or if you were leaking oxygen.
00:00:52,00:00:54,It got us out of our sleeping bags pretty quick.
00:00:54,00:00:56,"- And was that why they did it, do we know?"
00:00:56,00:00:59,Or was it just like they didn't have any other sounds on file?
00:00:59,00:01:02,- I like to think we just thought we've got one alarm.
00:01:02,00:01:04,That'll work. - That'll do.
00:01:04,00:01:05,It does sound like a really effective way
00:01:05,00:01:07,"of getting out of bed, I mean."
00:01:07,00:01:08,- Terrifying. - Smart.
00:01:08,00:01:09,- Yeah.
00:01:09,00:01:10,- Wake up.
00:01:10,00:01:11,Fearing for your life.
00:01:11,00:01:15,- That's pretty much how I feel waking up every morning.
00:01:15,00:01:18,"Did you know that her mission, the Juno mission,"
00:01:18,00:01:20,was actually a commercial mission
00:01:20,00:01:21,"and while she was up there,"
00:01:21,00:01:23,she had to do an advert for Interflora.
00:01:23,00:01:24,- No. - Did she?
00:01:24,00:01:26,"- Was it because Interflora like Interstellar,"
00:01:26,00:01:29,was that the reasoning?
00:01:29,00:01:30,- You should work an advertising Andy.
00:01:30,00:01:33,"I'm not sure, actually."
00:01:33,00:01:34,"- Wake the flower company, Interflora."
00:01:34,00:01:36,"- Yeah, they actually weren't Interstellar though,"
00:01:36,00:01:39,where they were probably closer to our stellar
00:01:39,00:01:41,than they were on Earth.
00:01:41,00:01:43,- For some other time. - They were interplanetary.
00:01:43,00:01:44,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:01:44,00:01:46,"- For whoever you're Inter, get them."
00:01:46,00:01:47,(laughing)
00:01:47,00:01:49,- Nice footage. - You should not work
00:01:49,00:01:50,in advertising.
00:01:50,00:01:51,(laughing)
00:01:51,00:01:53,- Meer sounds incredibly shonky.
00:01:53,00:01:56,- So there was a thing about how the solar panels were damaged.
00:01:56,00:01:59,"That was how, I find it really all the space stations"
00:01:59,00:02:00,"are solar powered, I suppose it's obvious."
00:02:00,00:02:02,But often the lights would go out
00:02:02,00:02:04,and they'd just have to wait in the dark
00:02:04,00:02:06,"until they came back on, really."
00:02:06,00:02:06,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:02:06,00:02:07,"- Yeah, it was really dodgy, wasn't it?"
00:02:07,00:02:11,"They had a few very near, near disaster incidents."
00:02:11,00:02:15,It's caught fire in the '90s in 1997 of fire started
00:02:15,00:02:18,"and they tried to extinguish it with a wet towel at first,"
00:02:18,00:02:19,"I think, which made it worse."
00:02:19,00:02:21,It just made everything very smoky.
00:02:21,00:02:23,So they all had to put their respiratory masks on
00:02:23,00:02:24,at which point they realized
00:02:24,00:02:27,that half the respiratory mask didn't work.
00:02:27,00:02:29,And so while they weren't working
00:02:29,00:02:30,"and they were all suffocating,"
00:02:30,00:02:32,they tried to pull the fire extinguishers off the wall.
00:02:32,00:02:34,And I think seven out of the 10 fire extinguishers
00:02:34,00:02:35,were actually stuck to the wall
00:02:35,00:02:38,so they couldn't be removed to put the fire out.
00:02:38,00:02:39,- How did they get it out?
00:02:39,00:02:41,- They got the other three fire extinguishers
00:02:41,00:02:43,and used those instead and they were fine.
00:02:43,00:02:46,"But it sounds entertaining, so it's terrifying."
00:02:46,00:02:48,- Do you think they called that a mere miss?
00:02:48,00:02:49,- Probably not. - I hope they did.
00:02:49,00:02:54,"So the mere space station, when it was decommissioned,"
00:02:54,00:02:58,it just had to be sent back into the atmosphere
00:02:58,00:02:59,to shatter over the Pacific.
00:02:59,00:03:01,And it looks really beautiful.
00:03:01,00:03:02,So I really loved that idea.
00:03:02,00:03:03,And when the International Space Station
00:03:03,00:03:05,"is decommissioned, it's deobased."
00:03:05,00:03:07,"That'll do the same thing, I think."
00:03:07,00:03:08,So it just gets brought back into a sorbit
00:03:08,00:03:11,and then you make sure that it gets brought back
00:03:11,00:03:12,at a place where it's not gonna rain down
00:03:12,00:03:14,over a well populated area.
00:03:14,00:03:16,"And it looks like a whole,"
00:03:16,00:03:18,"it looks like a meteor shower or something, doesn't it?"
00:03:18,00:03:21,"Is that where they all land in Point Nemo, Andy?"
00:03:21,00:03:22,- Yes.
00:03:22,00:03:24,- So Point Nemo is the area of the ocean
00:03:24,00:03:27,that's furthest away from any land.
00:03:27,00:03:29,"And is it full of, I remember you told me this,"
00:03:29,00:03:30,is it full of space ships?
00:03:30,00:03:31,- It's a full of old spacecraft.
00:03:31,00:03:33,That's where they try and get them all to land
00:03:33,00:03:35,"or they sort of, they work it out."
00:03:35,00:03:36,- There's those remote spots.
00:03:36,00:03:38,"- Exactly, yeah, so there's the least transfer of the life,"
00:03:38,00:03:41,unless you're on a fishing expedition to Point Nemo.
00:03:41,00:03:42,- To get away from it all.
00:03:42,00:03:45,- Fun finding Nemo themed expedition in the way.
00:03:45,00:03:46,"- Oh, it's the idea for it."
00:03:46,00:03:49,"- Yeah, here's a cool thing I found out."
00:03:49,00:03:51,"Once you get back, so in space, basically,"
00:03:51,00:03:52,you're a bit like a superhuman.
00:03:52,00:03:53,"Chris Hadfield said, you know,"
00:03:53,00:03:55,you can move a massive fridge or whatever
00:03:55,00:03:57,with the tips of his fingers.
00:03:57,00:03:59,I don't know why he was moving a fridge out on the ISS.
00:03:59,00:04:00,"But he said that when you get back,"
00:04:00,00:04:02,obviously you're much weaker 'cause your muscles
00:04:02,00:04:05,"atrophy in space, but the other thing he said"
00:04:05,00:04:07,is that you can feel the weight of your lips
00:04:07,00:04:08,and your tongue.
00:04:08,00:04:10,And you have to get used to speaking
00:04:10,00:04:12,with a tongue that weighs something.
00:04:12,00:04:13,- That's great.
00:04:13,00:04:15,Now I can feel the weight of my tongue.
00:04:15,00:04:17,"- I was saying that in space, he had sort of automatically"
00:04:17,00:04:20,learned how to speak with a weightless tongue
00:04:20,00:04:22,"'cause you're all weightless,"
00:04:22,00:04:23,so you don't really realize at the time.
00:04:23,00:04:25,"And when you return, it's a little bit harder."
00:04:25,00:04:26,- That's amazing.
00:04:26,00:04:28,Is it also hard then to keep your eyes open?
00:04:28,00:04:30,"And then when you come back to earth from outer space,"
00:04:30,00:04:32,surely you feel the weight of gravity.
00:04:32,00:04:33,"- When Helen Sharman came back,"
00:04:33,00:04:35,she said that she kind of felt a bit weird
00:04:35,00:04:37,and that her brain felt heavy.
00:04:37,00:04:38,- Wow.
00:04:38,00:04:40,- Maybe she just got way cleverer in space.
00:04:40,00:04:41,- Way more stuff.
00:04:41,00:04:43,"- Is that what happens that your brain gets heavier,"
00:04:43,00:04:44,the cleverer you are?
00:04:44,00:04:45,- Yes.
00:04:45,00:04:46,"- Everyone knows you get smarter in space,"
00:04:46,00:04:47,and your brain gets heavier when you get cleverer.
00:04:47,00:04:51,"- It's like how a full kindle with a tiny, tiny point"
00:04:51,00:04:53,of a gram more than an empty kindle.
00:04:53,00:04:54,- Oh yeah.
00:04:54,00:04:55,- So our brains are like.
00:04:55,00:04:57,"- Hang on, surely if you learn something"
00:04:57,00:04:59,"and new connections are made in your brain, yeah."
00:04:59,00:05:01,"They weigh something though, don't they?"
00:05:01,00:05:03,"Those cells, I mean, doesn't that mean"
00:05:03,00:05:05,"that a really clever brain will weigh a tiny bit more,"
00:05:05,00:05:07,the more with no information?
00:05:07,00:05:08,- That's why they used to try and like examine
00:05:08,00:05:09,"like Einstein's brain and stuff, didn't they?"
00:05:09,00:05:11,'Cause they thought they have like a secret
00:05:11,00:05:12,of big brains or small brains.
00:05:12,00:05:13,- I don't think anyone knows.
00:05:13,00:05:16,- I think this is a conversation for the neuroscientist
00:05:16,00:05:18,"podcast, rather than a bunch of idiots"
00:05:18,00:05:20,who don't know anything about neuroscience.
00:05:20,00:05:21,- I can tell you a historical thing about this.
00:05:21,00:05:24,"I think it was golden, but it was certainly someone"
00:05:24,00:05:26,like that from their Victorian age
00:05:26,00:05:29,who was kind of believed in eugenics or something.
00:05:29,00:05:31,And he thought the people with bigger heads
00:05:31,00:05:34,"must have bigger brains and must be smarter,"
00:05:34,00:05:36,but he needed to work out how to weigh people's brains
00:05:36,00:05:38,and how to find the size of their heads.
00:05:38,00:05:41,And so what he would do is he'd go into a pub
00:05:41,00:05:43,and find two people with kind of big heads
00:05:43,00:05:45,and then start an argument between them
00:05:45,00:05:48,"and say, ""This guy says your head's small."""
00:05:48,00:05:49,And he can't tell you the angle.
00:05:49,00:05:51,"This guy says, ""Your head's small."""
00:05:51,00:05:54,"And he goes, ""But don't worry, I'll measure your heads."""
00:05:54,00:05:55,And that'll tell you who's the best.
00:05:55,00:05:57,And then he got his measurements that way.
00:05:57,00:05:59,"- Was he, and he just had a lot of refusals"
00:05:59,00:06:01,"going up and politely asking people,"
00:06:01,00:06:03,so we had to come up with a way around it.
00:06:03,00:06:04,- I didn't measure my head.
00:06:04,00:06:06,"- I'd just say yes though, if someone asked me"
00:06:06,00:06:07,if they wanted to measure my head.
00:06:07,00:06:08,- I'd be well offered.
00:06:08,00:06:10,"- Yeah, if anyone wants my head measured."
00:06:10,00:06:12,- If you ever see other in the streets.
00:06:12,00:06:13,- Variant aim measure.
00:06:13,00:06:15,- Happy to help.
00:06:15,00:06:16,- Can we talk about alarm clocks?
00:06:16,00:06:17,- Yeah. - alarm clocks.
00:06:17,00:06:20,- So the first alarm clock only went off
00:06:20,00:06:23,at four in the morning that I had found.
00:06:23,00:06:24,"- Yes, that's fantastic."
00:06:24,00:06:27,"- After it was invented, it took another 60 years"
00:06:27,00:06:29,"before the first alarm clock was invented,"
00:06:29,00:06:30,which you could not.
00:06:30,00:06:31,- Why not?
00:06:31,00:06:32,- People want to get up at four a year.
00:06:32,00:06:35,"- It was just one guy, he called Levi Hutchins."
00:06:35,00:06:39,He was from New Hampshire and he started work
00:06:39,00:06:41,"soon after four AM, so that was the time he got up."
00:06:41,00:06:45,"So he just set it, it was totally adaptable."
00:06:45,00:06:48,And so the first alarm clock that you could adjust
00:06:48,00:06:52,"was patented in France in 1847, but he was 1787."
00:06:52,00:06:54,- I have a type of alarm clock.
00:06:54,00:06:57,This is from a designer called Randolpho
00:06:57,00:07:00,and it's called The Good Morning Underwear.
00:07:00,00:07:02,And it's a pair of pants that vibrates
00:07:02,00:07:03,to wake you up in the morning.
00:07:03,00:07:05,- Wow. - Okay.
00:07:05,00:07:07,- This is a designer who kind of likes
00:07:07,00:07:10,"to do electronic clothing or wearable tech,"
00:07:10,00:07:12,especially underwear.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"And he said, ""I finally wanted to make a garment"
00:07:14,00:07:17,"that my girlfriend would actually want to wear."""
00:07:17,00:07:19,"While it might be hard to believe,"
00:07:19,00:07:23,"when I made the clap off bra, it was not really for her."
00:07:23,00:07:26,- The clap off bra.
00:07:26,00:07:28,"- Yeah, so what you do is you clap"
00:07:28,00:07:32,and then your girlfriend or wife's bra falls off.
00:07:32,00:07:33,- That's fantastic.
00:07:33,00:07:35,"- Well, if you went to a comedy club."
00:07:35,00:07:39,- Yeah. - Just have to hope everyone is really bad.
00:07:39,00:07:42,"- I read about two simple alarm clocks,"
00:07:42,00:07:45,one of which I would say is higher risks than the other.
00:07:45,00:07:47,"One is that you can build, if you build your house,"
00:07:47,00:07:48,"so when you have your bedroom,"
00:07:48,00:07:50,"so you're the window where the sun comes in,"
00:07:50,00:07:51,"then that actually you'll wake up in the morning,"
00:07:51,00:07:53,which is a lovely idea waking up to the sunrise.
00:07:53,00:07:55,The other idea is that you just drink loads of water
00:07:55,00:07:57,before you go to sleep and your body will wake you up.
00:07:57,00:07:58,- I do that.
00:07:58,00:08:00,- And it works 80% of the time.
00:08:00,00:08:02,(laughing)
00:08:02,00:08:05,"- But supposedly it's a Native American thing, isn't it?"
00:08:05,00:08:08,And then it still got practiced even into the 20th century.
00:08:08,00:08:09,- What was the drinking thing?
00:08:09,00:08:10,- Yeah.
00:08:10,00:08:15,"- Oh my gosh, I am so connected to my fellow Native Americans."
00:08:15,00:08:16,They used to drink that.
00:08:16,00:08:18,"- They used to drink water, not Pinot Grigio."
00:08:18,00:08:20,(laughing)
00:08:20,00:08:23,- I read that alarm clocks is one of the most common things
00:08:23,00:08:25,displaced by smart phones.
00:08:25,00:08:26,"- Yeah, that makes a lot of sense."
00:08:26,00:08:28,"I've still got three alarm clocks actually,"
00:08:28,00:08:29,so I'm keeping the industry going.
00:08:29,00:08:30,- But how do you?
00:08:30,00:08:32,Are they all set at different times?
00:08:32,00:08:33,- Two of them have broken.
00:08:33,00:08:35,"- Oh, okay, why do you still keep them?"
00:08:35,00:08:37,- 'Cause I have this fantasy that I'm going to go
00:08:37,00:08:39,into the back of one and fix it one day.
00:08:39,00:08:40,- That's an incredible fantasy.
00:08:40,00:08:42,(laughing)
00:08:42,00:08:44,- Your dreams must be amazing.
00:08:44,00:08:46,- Pretty wild inside of my head.
00:08:46,00:08:47,(laughing)
00:08:47,00:08:50,Clock fixing and stamp collecting.
00:08:50,00:08:52,"All night long, my dreams."
00:08:52,00:08:55,- So just a couple more weird alarm clocks.
00:08:55,00:08:57,These are off Kickstarter.
00:08:57,00:09:00,These are current Kickstarter alarm clocks.
00:09:00,00:09:03,"One of them is, as soon as you wake up,"
00:09:03,00:09:06,it gives you your estimated life expectancy
00:09:06,00:09:09,and your financial information.
00:09:09,00:09:11,And it's supposed to be the most depressing alarm clock
00:09:11,00:09:11,of all time.
00:09:11,00:09:14,- Is that worse than the emergency alarm going off?
00:09:14,00:09:16,- I think it is 'cause it says you're gonna die in 20 years
00:09:16,00:09:18,and you've got no money.
00:09:18,00:09:19,"- Mom, this is early."
00:09:19,00:09:20,"If you're a billionaire child,"
00:09:20,00:09:21,then that's what you do.
00:09:21,00:09:22,- You wake up like I'm winning.
00:09:22,00:09:23,- Yeah.
00:09:23,00:09:25,"- Come on, bring on the tape."
00:09:25,00:09:27,What's the idea that it will force you together
00:09:27,00:09:28,because you need to make more money
00:09:28,00:09:30,and spend as much time awake as possible before death?
00:09:30,00:09:32,- I think it's a bit like a memento-mari
00:09:32,00:09:34,which is kind of it just reminds you
00:09:34,00:09:37,that you will die one day and it helps you grasp life.
00:09:37,00:09:38,"- No, not remotely."
00:09:38,00:09:39,"- Okay, fine."
00:09:39,00:09:41,- I try to cheat it by killing myself immediately
00:09:41,00:09:44,"and do like, ""Ah, you're wrong."""
00:09:44,00:09:45,(laughing)
00:09:45,00:09:47,"- Well, you'll hope you the winner there."
00:09:47,00:09:49,- Just immediately spend the load of money
00:09:49,00:09:50,on Amazon to kill yourself.
00:09:50,00:09:52,(laughing)
00:09:52,00:09:55,"- In your face, Mr. Alarm."
00:09:55,00:09:57,"- What was it, was there another one James?"
00:09:57,00:10:00,"- Here's another one, the money shredding alarm clock."
00:10:00,00:10:01,(laughing)
00:10:01,00:10:04,"He, this is a guy who combined a clock kit"
00:10:04,00:10:07,with a USB paper shredder
00:10:07,00:10:09,and basically put a load of money in there
00:10:09,00:10:11,and then the alarm goes off
00:10:11,00:10:13,and the slower it takes you to wake up
00:10:13,00:10:14,"and turn the alarm off,"
00:10:14,00:10:15,the more of your money gets shredded.
00:10:15,00:10:17,- That is fantastic.
00:10:17,00:10:18,"- A tip, hot tip for people out there."
00:10:18,00:10:20,Put your partner's money in it.
00:10:20,00:10:21,(laughing)
00:10:21,00:10:22,"- Steve, for as long as you like."
00:10:22,00:10:24,- There's somebody who doesn't have a joint bank account.
00:10:24,00:10:25,(laughing)
00:10:25,00:10:28,(upbeat music)
00:10:28,00:10:30,"- Okay, time for our second fact"
00:10:30,00:10:33,and that is from James.
00:10:33,00:10:34,"- Okay, my fact this week is that"
00:10:34,00:10:36,the Bosnian National Anthem
00:10:36,00:10:38,is almost identical in melody
00:10:38,00:10:40,to the theme for the movie
00:10:40,00:10:42,National Lampoon's Animal House.
00:10:42,00:10:44,(laughing)
00:10:44,00:10:44,- Sounds awesome.
00:10:44,00:10:45,- Right.
00:10:45,00:10:46,- Who came first?
00:10:46,00:10:48,- National Lampoon came first.
00:10:48,00:10:50,- Basically Bosnian is quite a new country
00:10:50,00:10:52,"and when it became a country,"
00:10:52,00:10:53,they needed a national anthem
00:10:53,00:10:54,and they found a guy to write it
00:10:54,00:10:58,and we think that perhaps he might have been somehow
00:10:58,00:11:01,- So unconsciously.
00:11:01,00:11:04,- So unconsciously perhaps influenced by this movie.
00:11:04,00:11:06,- Because if you were going to pick a movie
00:11:06,00:11:07,"to nick the theme tune of it,"
00:11:07,00:11:10,probably wouldn't be National Lampoon's Animal House.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"- That's true, although if you Googled National Anthem"
00:11:13,00:11:14,and spelt it slightly wrong
00:11:14,00:11:16,"and it said, did you mean National Lampoon?"
00:11:16,00:11:17,(laughing)
00:11:17,00:11:19,"- National Lampoon, this will do."
00:11:19,00:11:20,"- Well, the other thing is that"
00:11:20,00:11:23,the National Anthem of Bosnia has no official lyrics.
00:11:23,00:11:25,So you really are just listening to the theme tune.
00:11:25,00:11:26,(laughing)
00:11:26,00:11:29,"- And Google it, go on to YouTube and listen to them"
00:11:29,00:11:31,because they are remarkably similar.
00:11:31,00:11:33,And this fact actually comes from a book
00:11:33,00:11:35,that I read a fantastic book called
00:11:35,00:11:38,"""Republic or Death"" by a guy called Alex Marshall"
00:11:38,00:11:41,and it's full of kind of QI facts about National Anthem.
00:11:41,00:11:42,So I absolutely love it.
00:11:42,00:11:44,I've found so much stuff in there.
00:11:44,00:11:47,"- So he, Alex Marshall is quite firmly sympathetic"
00:11:47,00:11:49,"towards the guy who wrote this isn't here,"
00:11:49,00:11:50,do Sancestic.
00:11:50,00:11:51,- That's right.
00:11:51,00:11:53,- And says it implies that it really was a subconscious
00:11:53,00:11:55,thing and I think this guy might have been screwed out
00:11:55,00:11:57,of quite a bit of money from the Bosnian government now
00:11:57,00:11:59,who are refusing to pay him
00:11:59,00:12:02,because they didn't like the lyrics that he wrote eventually.
00:12:02,00:12:04,"- Yeah, the lyrics have been written"
00:12:04,00:12:05,and they've been approved by one body
00:12:05,00:12:08,but they still haven't been approved by a council of ministers.
00:12:08,00:12:10,So at the moment there are no lyrics.
00:12:10,00:12:12,"- The Spanish one hasn't got any words either, hasn't."
00:12:12,00:12:13,"- Oh, is it not?"
00:12:13,00:12:14,- I don't know.
00:12:14,00:12:15,- They had a competition to give words for it
00:12:15,00:12:17,but no one really liked them so they took them out.
00:12:17,00:12:18,- Oh really?
00:12:18,00:12:19,- They're amazing.
00:12:19,00:12:20,"Yes, South Sudan, obviously."
00:12:20,00:12:22,"It's still the world's newest country, isn't it?"
00:12:22,00:12:23,"- Yeah, it must be."
00:12:23,00:12:26,- They had an X-factor style competition for theirs
00:12:26,00:12:28,with literally had a row of judges
00:12:28,00:12:29,and you had to present it.
00:12:29,00:12:31,And I did not know that South Sudan
00:12:31,00:12:33,was nearly called the Nile Republic.
00:12:33,00:12:34,- What's it?
00:12:34,00:12:35,"- It was one of the names they considered, yeah."
00:12:35,00:12:39,- So there's a story attested to in the 19th century
00:12:39,00:12:42,which is that the Sultan of Malaysia visited Queen Victoria
00:12:42,00:12:46,was invited to visit Queen Victoria in 1888 I think
00:12:46,00:12:49,"and they didn't have a national anthem at the time,"
00:12:49,00:12:50,the Malaysians.
00:12:50,00:12:53,"But when the Sultan got to meet Queen Victoria,"
00:12:53,00:12:55,"her aide said, oh by the way,"
00:12:55,00:12:57,"when we're formally welcoming you,"
00:12:57,00:12:58,we want to be able to sing and play on national anthem.
00:12:58,00:13:00,So what is it?
00:13:00,00:13:02,And the aide was too embarrassed to say we don't have one.
00:13:02,00:13:04,And so he just thought of the first unique think of
00:13:04,00:13:06,which was some local tune from the say shells
00:13:06,00:13:09,"that he'd once heard, which was a French origin I think"
00:13:09,00:13:10,and hummed that.
00:13:10,00:13:12,"And to this day, that is the Malaysian national anthem."
00:13:12,00:13:12,- Why?
00:13:12,00:13:13,- No way.
00:13:13,00:13:15,- Didn't they change the Malaysian anthem
00:13:15,00:13:16,when they came independent?
00:13:16,00:13:19,Because Benjamin Britain wrote one for them in 1957.
00:13:19,00:13:20,"- Oh, did he?"
00:13:20,00:13:23,"- But he had, he'd only been in the country for a few hours."
00:13:23,00:13:25,He didn't particularly have the best time.
00:13:25,00:13:27,- The lyrics are all about the airport.
00:13:27,00:13:28,- He was supposed to be here.
00:13:28,00:13:33,- They have great Tobleros and lovely duty free.
00:13:33,00:13:35,- He was a bit pricey.
00:13:35,00:13:37,"Now he's supposed to go and visit a rubber plantation,"
00:13:37,00:13:39,"but instead spent the whole trip terrified,"
00:13:39,00:13:40,he's going to be attacked under attack.
00:13:40,00:13:43,"And he said, quote, we had a taste of what it's like"
00:13:43,00:13:45,to live always armed in a fear of one's life.
00:13:45,00:13:47,"And at one point, they were stuck in a thunderstorm,"
00:13:47,00:13:49,and spent the entire hour terrified
00:13:49,00:13:51,that someone was going to find them.
00:13:51,00:13:52,- And did all these quotes make it
00:13:52,00:13:53,into the lyrics he wrote for the national anthem?
00:13:53,00:13:55,- They didn't go with his national anthem.
00:13:55,00:13:57,(laughing)
00:13:57,00:13:59,"'Cause they had a huge competition in the '50s,"
00:13:59,00:14:00,and they didn't like their entries.
00:14:00,00:14:01,They thought we'll ask Benjamin Britain
00:14:01,00:14:02,to see if he can come up with something.
00:14:02,00:14:05,"And instead, they went with a cabaret song, I think."
00:14:05,00:14:07,"- Oh, I have a fact about cabaret songs"
00:14:07,00:14:08,in national anthems.
00:14:08,00:14:09,- Great.
00:14:09,00:14:12,"- So, the Germans, only sing the third verse"
00:14:12,00:14:13,of their national anthem.
00:14:13,00:14:15,"And that's partly because the first verse begins,"
00:14:15,00:14:19,"Deutsche Landu Bras, very heavily associated,"
00:14:19,00:14:21,"with Nazi times, obviously."
00:14:21,00:14:22,"So, after the Second World War, West Germany"
00:14:22,00:14:24,"had no official national anthem,"
00:14:24,00:14:25,'cause there was a big program of what was called
00:14:25,00:14:26,"""D-Nazification"","
00:14:26,00:14:28,where they were trying to restore civil society
00:14:28,00:14:31,"as it had been before, 1933."
00:14:31,00:14:32,"So, at football matches,"
00:14:32,00:14:35,people started singing a carnival song
00:14:35,00:14:37,"as their kind of unofficial national anthem,"
00:14:37,00:14:40,"which was taking the Mickey out of the allied powers,"
00:14:40,00:14:42,who were still obviously occupying at the time.
00:14:42,00:14:45,"So, that was another carnival song that got used as a..."
00:14:45,00:14:46,"- Oh, did they actually use it"
00:14:46,00:14:48,as a national anthem for a while?
00:14:48,00:14:50,"- No, it was always unofficial."
00:14:50,00:14:51,Sometimes they started playing it
00:14:51,00:14:53,"and Belgian soldiers who were occupying, heard it,"
00:14:53,00:14:54,"and they stood up thinking,"
00:14:54,00:14:56,"""Oh, this is the national anthem, then, that's great."""
00:14:56,00:14:58,"- Isn't there a verse of ""God Save the Queen"""
00:14:58,00:14:59,"that we don't sing,"
00:14:59,00:15:01,because it's got a line about rebellious scots to crush?
00:15:01,00:15:02,- I always sing that one.
00:15:02,00:15:04,- I only sing that one.
00:15:04,00:15:08,- Can I feel very secure to be here?
00:15:08,00:15:09,"- God Save the Queen, wasn't that the national anthem"
00:15:09,00:15:12,for a lot of countries when it was first written?
00:15:12,00:15:14,"- Like, Lichtenstein had the same tune,"
00:15:14,00:15:15,but I think they have different words.
00:15:15,00:15:17,"- Lichtenstein, it would be amazing"
00:15:17,00:15:19,if they had the same words.
00:15:19,00:15:21,"- It's already done, we could just change it."
00:15:21,00:15:23,"- God Save the Queen, Lichtenstein."
00:15:23,00:15:24,(all laughing)
00:15:24,00:15:26,"Apparently, when Lichtenstein played football"
00:15:26,00:15:29,"against Scotland, they always get the national anthem boot."
00:15:29,00:15:31,"- Oh, so my favorite story ever"
00:15:31,00:15:32,"with Scottish people, if it were matches,"
00:15:32,00:15:33,"when they went to Italy,"
00:15:33,00:15:34,"and allegedly, we're singing,"
00:15:34,00:15:36,"""We're going to deep fry our pizzas."""
00:15:36,00:15:37,"- Oh, yeah."
00:15:37,00:15:39,- I just think it's...
00:15:39,00:15:43,"- So, I think a lot of countries had the English national anthem"
00:15:43,00:15:45,before anyone else had a national anthem.
00:15:45,00:15:47,"So, I think God Save the King was the first"
00:15:47,00:15:51,that came up in 1745 and became our national anthem.
00:15:51,00:15:52,"And lots of other countries thought,"
00:15:52,00:15:53,"""Okay, that sounds like a good idea, national anthems."""
00:15:53,00:15:55,But didn't think to write their own.
00:15:55,00:15:58,"And so, you know, within a few decades,"
00:15:58,00:16:00,"the German states, Russia, Denmark,"
00:16:00,00:16:01,"the kingdom of Hawaii,"
00:16:01,00:16:03,they all had the English national anthem
00:16:03,00:16:06,"as their national anthem, as in that melody."
00:16:06,00:16:08,"And Lichtenstein is the one that still kept it,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,couldn't be bothered to ever drop it.
00:16:10,00:16:12,"- I read a list of national anthem titles,"
00:16:12,00:16:13,"and there are some from around the world,"
00:16:13,00:16:16,"which are unbelievably good, let's hear some."
00:16:16,00:16:20,"So, I think the best around the entire world"
00:16:20,00:16:23,is Bhutan's The Thunder Dragon Kingdom.
00:16:23,00:16:24,- Yes. - Amazing.
00:16:24,00:16:26,"Poland has, Poland is not yet lost"
00:16:26,00:16:30,so long as we still live very lively.
00:16:30,00:16:32,Equatorial guineas is let us tread the path
00:16:32,00:16:34,of our immense happiness.
00:16:34,00:16:36,- That's quite nice. - Good luck.
00:16:36,00:16:38,"- I like Vanuatu's, which is Yumi, Yumi, Yumi."
00:16:38,00:16:39,(laughing)
00:16:39,00:16:41,- Is it really?
00:16:41,00:16:42,"- Yumi, Yumi, Yumi, it's so good in my tummy."
00:16:42,00:16:44,"- It's the same verse, isn't it?"
00:16:44,00:16:46,"- It means we, we, we."
00:16:46,00:16:48,"- As in us, us, us."
00:16:48,00:16:49,- Yeah. - Not as in you're in you're in you're in you're in you.
00:16:49,00:16:51,"I mean, they have to be insane, wouldn't they?"
00:16:51,00:16:53,- The cleanup operation is awful after everyone saw it.
00:16:53,00:16:55,(laughing)
00:16:55,00:16:58,"- So, Bikina Faso, their national anthem"
00:16:58,00:17:00,"is one single night, and these are the opening lights."
00:17:00,00:17:02,"This is in translation, obviously."
00:17:02,00:17:06,"But, against the humiliating bondage of a thousand years,"
00:17:06,00:17:09,repacity came from afar to subjugate them for a hundred years
00:17:09,00:17:12,against the cynical malice in the shape of neo-colonialism
00:17:12,00:17:15,and its petty local servants.
00:17:15,00:17:16,- Wow.
00:17:16,00:17:18,"- I prefer Yumi, Yumi, Yumi."
00:17:18,00:17:20,(laughing)
00:17:20,00:17:22,- The English public don't want God save the Queen
00:17:22,00:17:25,"to be their national anthem, mostly."
00:17:25,00:17:27,"So, at the moment, I think a bill was proposed in Parliament"
00:17:27,00:17:30,at the start of this year to have an English national anthem
00:17:30,00:17:32,'cause weird English people get upset
00:17:32,00:17:34,that we have to share our national anthem
00:17:34,00:17:36,with the Scottish and the Welsh.
00:17:36,00:17:37,- They're also not thrilled.
00:17:37,00:17:38,(laughing)
00:17:38,00:17:40,- Yeah.
00:17:40,00:17:41,- I'm the Northern Irish.
00:17:41,00:17:43,- And the Northern Irish.
00:17:43,00:17:44,- And the Lichtenstonian.
00:17:44,00:17:45,- And the Lichtenstonians.
00:17:45,00:17:47,"Okay, too many people are sharing God save the Queen"
00:17:47,00:17:48,and there's not enough to go around.
00:17:48,00:17:51,"So, there's a movement to change the English national anthem."
00:17:51,00:17:53,And I think one of the popular choices is obviously land
00:17:53,00:17:56,"of Hope and Glory, which I think 55% of the English public"
00:17:56,00:17:58,"would like, which is a catchy tune,"
00:17:58,00:18:02,"but which, Elgar, who wrote the tune for it,"
00:18:02,00:18:05,"didn't like, and he really hated the way"
00:18:05,00:18:08,"that it was appropriated for kind of jingoistic causes,"
00:18:08,00:18:12,and it was sung to get the English troops
00:18:12,00:18:14,"riled up in the First World War,"
00:18:14,00:18:16,"and Elgar already disapproved of that,"
00:18:16,00:18:17,"and he didn't like the lyrics that were written to it,"
00:18:17,00:18:19,which were written by someone else.
00:18:19,00:18:21,"So, when you're seeing that feeling patriotic,"
00:18:21,00:18:23,you should know that the man who wrote it
00:18:23,00:18:24,was not up for that.
00:18:24,00:18:25,- I think we should ask the internet
00:18:25,00:18:27,what should be our national anthem?
00:18:27,00:18:28,- Don't get us.
00:18:28,00:18:32,Queenie McQueen face will win by a country mile.
00:18:32,00:18:34,"- There'd be something like it's raining there now,"
00:18:34,00:18:34,something like that.
00:18:34,00:18:36,(laughing)
00:18:36,00:18:39,"- Well, the Massey A's, strong candidate"
00:18:39,00:18:43,"for the best national anthem ever, really, really exciting,"
00:18:43,00:18:44,was written by a royalist.
00:18:44,00:18:46,"The composer was a massive royalist,"
00:18:46,00:18:49,"and considering it's so revolutionary,"
00:18:49,00:18:50,that's a bit surprising.
00:18:50,00:18:51,"- Oh, really? - Yeah."
00:18:51,00:18:54,- He was asked to write it by the mayor of Strasbourg.
00:18:54,00:18:55,"- Oh, what's he?"
00:18:55,00:18:57,- Can I just say a quick story about plagiarism?
00:18:57,00:18:57,"- Yes, please."
00:18:57,00:19:00,- That really entertained me that I'd never read.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"It's just about a nature writer,"
00:19:02,00:19:04,"this seems like a bit of a crowbar,"
00:19:04,00:19:06,but I read something written by a nature writer
00:19:06,00:19:08,"called Paul Tolme,"
00:19:08,00:19:10,and he visited South Dakota in 2005
00:19:10,00:19:14,to write an academic article on Black-footed ferrets.
00:19:14,00:19:17,He noticed a few years later that a bodice ripper
00:19:17,00:19:20,kind of raunchy book by a writer called Cassie Edwards
00:19:20,00:19:24,"contained verbatim, his description of Black-footed ferrets."
00:19:24,00:19:28,"So he says, she writes raunchy stories about Native Americans"
00:19:28,00:19:32,having forbidden relationships with frontiers women.
00:19:32,00:19:33,"- Oh, I thought you were going to say with ferrets."
00:19:33,00:19:35,(laughing)
00:19:35,00:19:36,"- No, bizarrely enough."
00:19:36,00:19:38,"There's just a scene where they have raunchies,"
00:19:38,00:19:40,I've said the word raunchy a lot.
00:19:40,00:19:42,"There's a scene where they have sex,"
00:19:42,00:19:43,"and after they have sex,"
00:19:43,00:19:45,"they start having a chat about ferrets,"
00:19:45,00:19:47,"and in that chat about ferrets,"
00:19:47,00:19:49,"there's a really incongruous description,"
00:19:49,00:19:51,"academic description of ferrets,"
00:19:51,00:19:53,"and he said, yeah, it was a sudden dialogue"
00:19:53,00:19:55,between a hunky American Indian
00:19:55,00:19:57,"and a lustful pioneer woman,"
00:19:57,00:19:58,which was the height of absurdity.
00:19:58,00:20:00,(laughing)
00:20:00,00:20:03,(upbeat music)
00:20:04,00:20:08,"- Okay, on to fact number three, and that is Ande's Facts."
00:20:08,00:20:10,- My fact is that crows can bear a grudge for nine years
00:20:10,00:20:12,and two generations.
00:20:12,00:20:13,- That is fantastic.
00:20:13,00:20:16,- What have you done to these crows Ande's?
00:20:16,00:20:18,"- There's a crow I know called Enigo Montoya,"
00:20:18,00:20:20,and I killed his father.
00:20:20,00:20:23,(laughing)
00:20:23,00:20:24,Is that a reference to something I don't get?
00:20:24,00:20:25,The Princess Bride.
00:20:25,00:20:27,(laughing)
00:20:27,00:20:30,"So, okay, so this is from a book that's just out,"
00:20:30,00:20:31,"it's called The Genius of Birds,"
00:20:31,00:20:33,"it's by Jennifer Ackerman,"
00:20:33,00:20:35,and it is a fantastic book.
00:20:35,00:20:37,"So, basically, crows can remember a face."
00:20:37,00:20:39,"Okay, they can remember a load of faces,"
00:20:39,00:20:41,and they can teach their offspring
00:20:41,00:20:44,and their friends to dislike you as well.
00:20:44,00:20:46,"- Why do they do that, though?"
00:20:46,00:20:48,"- Basically, a load of scientists put on masks"
00:20:48,00:20:50,and then bothered crows.
00:20:50,00:20:51,(laughing)
00:20:51,00:20:53,"Basically, and they captured them,"
00:20:53,00:20:56,"or they used the word abducted in some write-ups of this,"
00:20:56,00:20:58,but they just sort of captured them
00:20:58,00:21:00,"and then released them, wearing a particular mask."
00:21:00,00:21:04,"So, they had a caveman mask for one of these experiments."
00:21:04,00:21:05,"And then when they were released,"
00:21:05,00:21:08,"the birds remembered which kind of face had treated them badly,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,"or which kind of face had treated them well, fed them."
00:21:10,00:21:14,"And then they would dive bomb the threatening masks,"
00:21:14,00:21:17,"and then they left it for, in some cases, up to nine years,"
00:21:17,00:21:19,and the mobbing still happened.
00:21:19,00:21:21,"The birds had remembered from years and years previously,"
00:21:21,00:21:24,"and other birds, which had not hatched at the time"
00:21:24,00:21:26,"of the original attacks,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,"were taught to join in this mobbing,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,"and then when they saw you thereafter,"
00:21:30,00:21:32,"they would mob you, 'cause they knew."
00:21:32,00:21:34,"- Can I ask, why were they wearing masks?"
00:21:34,00:21:37,'Cause they didn't want the crows to hate their normal faces.
00:21:37,00:21:39,"- I think it was, because they were on the university campus,"
00:21:39,00:21:42,and you can't just teach all birds on the campus to hate--
00:21:42,00:21:43,"- No, actually, I do want this one."
00:21:43,00:21:46,"It's because they were worried that if they didn't have masks,"
00:21:46,00:21:47,"it'd be something in their facial expressions,"
00:21:47,00:21:49,"the birds were reacting to it, it was a mask."
00:21:49,00:21:51,It was sort of controlled for each time they did it.
00:21:51,00:21:53,- It's not like there was an old scientist
00:21:53,00:21:54,"who once did this experiment,"
00:21:54,00:21:57,and then all the birds in the whole world hated him.
00:21:57,00:22:00,- I'd rather have to wear a mask
00:22:00,00:22:01,when I was doing the bird experiment
00:22:01,00:22:04,than have to wear a mask at all other times.
00:22:04,00:22:05,- All other times.
00:22:05,00:22:06,"But this is a study, one thing that they did"
00:22:06,00:22:07,"when they were wearing masks,"
00:22:07,00:22:10,'cause I don't think they were real ones or a replica crew.
00:22:10,00:22:12,"They carry a, what looked like a dead crow"
00:22:12,00:22:13,"to sort of taunt the crows,"
00:22:13,00:22:15,"and then they'd be like, that's a bad person,"
00:22:15,00:22:16,they've killed a crow.
00:22:16,00:22:17,They also did it with pigeons.
00:22:17,00:22:19,A pigeons could not care less.
00:22:19,00:22:21,I think that's a dead pigeon.
00:22:21,00:22:22,"They didn't look, they didn't do anything."
00:22:22,00:22:26,"So, crows and pathetic pigeons, they'll let you go."
00:22:26,00:22:27,- That's fantastic.
00:22:27,00:22:29,"- Well, they are very advanced crows, aren't they?"
00:22:29,00:22:32,"And so, corvids are my favorite type of bird, by a long way,"
00:22:32,00:22:34,"'cause they're, what?"
00:22:34,00:22:37,"- Sorry, it's just funny to have a favorite type of bird."
00:22:37,00:22:39,"- That has a better than hummingbirds, they're pretty cool."
00:22:39,00:22:41,- You don't bring your hummingbird biases in here.
00:22:41,00:22:43,This is a podcast about crows.
00:22:43,00:22:44,"If you wanted a podcast about hummingbirds,"
00:22:44,00:22:45,you should have gone elsewhere.
00:22:45,00:22:48,"- So, corvids are their family or a genus or?"
00:22:48,00:22:50,"- Corvids are family, I think."
00:22:50,00:22:51,- So they're like ravens.
00:22:51,00:22:54,"- Ravens, crows, jays, magpies, all birds like that."
00:22:54,00:22:57,"And they're much better than parrots are at talking,"
00:22:57,00:22:59,"for instance, they can vocalize them more impressively,"
00:22:59,00:23:01,"so parrots can copy your words,"
00:23:01,00:23:03,but they always speak in that power voice.
00:23:03,00:23:06,"And whereas, I can imitate power voices very well,"
00:23:06,00:23:07,they can't imitate mine.
00:23:07,00:23:09,- But crows can do all the accents.
00:23:09,00:23:11,- Crows can do all the accents.
00:23:11,00:23:13,"- Actually, you know the radio show, Death Riggas."
00:23:13,00:23:15,It's just all crows.
00:23:15,00:23:18,- There's a man who's trained his raven
00:23:18,00:23:21,"to chant ""Nevermore"" from the Edgar Allan Poe poem."
00:23:21,00:23:23,"So, he chants it in, 'cause he's so good"
00:23:23,00:23:27,at mimicking his own voice in this terrifying man's voice.
00:23:27,00:23:28,- It's so good.
00:23:28,00:23:29,- Yeah. - That would give me nightmares.
00:23:29,00:23:30,- Yeah.
00:23:30,00:23:33,- Did Edgar Allan Poe in life take advantage of the fact
00:23:33,00:23:36,that his surname and the word poem are really similar?
00:23:36,00:23:38,And another Edgar Allan Poe.
00:23:38,00:23:39,(laughing)
00:23:39,00:23:40,He should have done.
00:23:40,00:23:41,"I mean, maybe he wouldn't have died penniless"
00:23:41,00:23:42,"at the edge of about 40,"
00:23:42,00:23:44,if he'd only had a bit of commercial mass.
00:23:44,00:23:46,(laughing)
00:23:46,00:23:47,He had a terrible life.
00:23:47,00:23:50,"Everyone around him died incredibly young,"
00:23:50,00:23:52,"and yeah, he was completely blighted."
00:23:52,00:23:55,"He made no money from his poems, and yeah."
00:23:55,00:23:56,"But if he'd have had commercial expert,"
00:23:56,00:23:58,Andrew Hunter Murray with it.
00:23:58,00:23:59,(laughing)
00:23:59,00:24:00,- Yeah.
00:24:00,00:24:03,"So, one thing that says it's called mobbing behavior."
00:24:03,00:24:05,"Basically, when birds all attack an individual"
00:24:05,00:24:07,at the same time.
00:24:07,00:24:10,And the birds mostly do it with birds of prey.
00:24:10,00:24:11,"So, small birds will attack big birds."
00:24:11,00:24:12,- Oh yeah.
00:24:12,00:24:15,"- But basically, they will defecate or vomit"
00:24:15,00:24:19,"on birds of prey so much that the bird of prey has to leave,"
00:24:19,00:24:21,because they can be quite corrosive.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"Obviously, vomit is very acidic."
00:24:23,00:24:24,"And the bird of prey will have to leave,"
00:24:24,00:24:26,because its feathers might be damaged.
00:24:26,00:24:29,- I think that is very bold.
00:24:29,00:24:32,"I wouldn't approach to tiger, for instance,"
00:24:32,00:24:33,and vomit on it.
00:24:33,00:24:36,- Hoping that it's fur would be eroded fast enough
00:24:36,00:24:37,before eight.
00:24:37,00:24:38,- It would need me.
00:24:38,00:24:40,- But you might find yourself defecating.
00:24:40,00:24:42,(laughing)
00:24:42,00:24:44,"- But if your family were all with you,"
00:24:44,00:24:46,you might all go and vomit on the tiger.
00:24:46,00:24:46,(laughing)
00:24:46,00:24:49,- Worst trip to nosely safari path ever.
00:24:49,00:24:50,(laughing)
00:24:50,00:24:53,- But there is a video online of otters mobbing a crocodile.
00:24:53,00:24:55,"I mean, it is unbelievably good."
00:24:55,00:24:56,"- Wow, really?"
00:24:56,00:24:58,"- The otters are all advancing on the crocodile,"
00:24:58,00:25:01,"and it's backing away, scared from them."
00:25:01,00:25:02,"I mean, they're not vomiting or--"
00:25:02,00:25:04,- But they could be about.
00:25:04,00:25:04,- Maybe.
00:25:04,00:25:06,"But occasionally, the crocodile snaps a bit,"
00:25:06,00:25:08,"but it is losing, basically."
00:25:08,00:25:09,"- But the crocodile is aquatic,"
00:25:09,00:25:11,"if it did get vomit, it would just submerge itself,"
00:25:11,00:25:12,and then come out of that.
00:25:12,00:25:13,"- I don't think the otters are vomiting, are they?"
00:25:13,00:25:15,They're just being aggressive.
00:25:15,00:25:16,They're just being aggressive and advance going on.
00:25:16,00:25:18,And now I'm thinking about it.
00:25:18,00:25:19,"I don't think this has happened,"
00:25:19,00:25:20,but it's possible someone just reversed
00:25:20,00:25:22,the tape of a crocodile advance.
00:25:22,00:25:23,About to reach a load of otters.
00:25:23,00:25:26,(laughing)
00:25:26,00:25:28,- Crows like to pull tails of cats and animals
00:25:28,00:25:30,"to like to tease them, play with them."
00:25:30,00:25:31,- What?
00:25:31,00:25:32,"- And I read, so you know how tricky to do,"
00:25:32,00:25:33,"and you have somebody, you see somebody,"
00:25:33,00:25:34,"and you tap them on a shoulder,"
00:25:34,00:25:35,"but you're actually on the other side,"
00:25:35,00:25:36,because you've reached round.
00:25:36,00:25:38,Jack does do that to rooks.
00:25:38,00:25:40,"So Jack does think up to a rook and pull its tail,"
00:25:40,00:25:41,"and then the other jack does on the other side,"
00:25:41,00:25:43,and we're going to steal every rook was eating.
00:25:43,00:25:44,- No way.
00:25:44,00:25:45,"- Yeah, it's like an distraction,"
00:25:45,00:25:46,like a two-man con.
00:25:46,00:25:48,"So one taps the, and then the other one's like,"
00:25:48,00:25:49,"""Yes, dinner."""
00:25:49,00:25:50,- That's great.
00:25:50,00:25:51,- It's not all that's so clever.
00:25:51,00:25:53,- Yeah.
00:25:53,00:25:55,"- You know, when crows hide their foods,"
00:25:55,00:25:56,"they hide it in the ground,"
00:25:56,00:25:58,"and they also remember where they hid it,"
00:25:58,00:25:59,but also remember how long that food has
00:25:59,00:26:00,before it goes bad.
00:26:00,00:26:02,So they would bother going back to food that's gone bad.
00:26:02,00:26:03,- No. - Yeah.
00:26:03,00:26:05,"- And also similar to the Ravens,"
00:26:05,00:26:07,"they, if crows have crows,"
00:26:07,00:26:09,they're friends with her around their five.
00:26:09,00:26:10,"If a crew who they don't like isn't the area,"
00:26:10,00:26:12,they'll go back and then hide it somewhere else later.
00:26:12,00:26:13,- Wow. - Because they didn't even observe.
00:26:13,00:26:16,"- Yeah, well, hummingbirds can fly backwards, so."
00:26:16,00:26:18,(laughing)
00:26:18,00:26:19,"- James, will you drop this insane hummingbird"
00:26:19,00:26:20,fixation of yours?
00:26:20,00:26:21,(laughing)
00:26:21,00:26:24,- I read an article on Atlas Obscura
00:26:24,00:26:26,talking about crow brains.
00:26:26,00:26:28,It was a bit weird.
00:26:28,00:26:31,"They asked, ""Can they fall in love?"""
00:26:31,00:26:34,"And the scientist said, ""We don't and probably can't know"
00:26:34,00:26:37,"if they fall in love, but we like to consider it."""
00:26:37,00:26:38,This is quite nice.
00:26:38,00:26:41,"And then the article goes on, ""Just for good measure,"
00:26:41,00:26:42,"we asked whether, given a machine design,"
00:26:42,00:26:44,"specifically for the purpose,"
00:26:44,00:26:45,"a crow could drive a car."""
00:26:45,00:26:48,(laughing)
00:26:48,00:26:50,"- To which the scientist said, ""I have no idea."""
00:26:50,00:26:51,(laughing)
00:26:51,00:26:53,"I think probably I have an idea that they probably,"
00:26:53,00:26:55,"they can't even reach that, well."
00:26:55,00:26:56,- Did you see that stroke?
00:26:56,00:26:59,What was it called when dogs fly a plane
00:26:59,00:27:00,or something that was on recently?
00:27:00,00:27:01,- And could they?
00:27:01,00:27:03,"- Well, they claimed it was flying the plane."
00:27:03,00:27:04,I think the dog was just sitting in a seat.
00:27:04,00:27:05,- I saw that.
00:27:05,00:27:07,- That was a cult pilot.
00:27:07,00:27:09,"- It was a cult, yeah, I mean, you'd be mad"
00:27:09,00:27:10,(laughing)
00:27:10,00:27:12,to send sensitive cameras and stuff.
00:27:12,00:27:14,Expensive filming equipment.
00:27:14,00:27:16,- With an unaccompanied tax.
00:27:16,00:27:17,(laughing)
00:27:17,00:27:20,"- On a 7472 in the next, you'll imagine,"
00:27:20,00:27:22,"sitting in your seat, and over the tunnel."
00:27:22,00:27:23,(laughing)
00:27:23,00:27:24,- Where?
00:27:24,00:27:27,- You'll probably do it again in English in a minute.
00:27:27,00:27:30,(laughing)
00:27:30,00:27:31,"- So actually, just going back to that,"
00:27:31,00:27:33,what actually happened on this TV show?
00:27:33,00:27:36,"- I can't remember if it's the guy, the pilot took them up"
00:27:36,00:27:37,and then they handed over control to the dog.
00:27:37,00:27:38,(laughing)
00:27:38,00:27:40,And there was a train over behind the dog.
00:27:40,00:27:42,I think what it was was the dog had it had it.
00:27:42,00:27:44,- The poor's were kind of through the joystick.
00:27:44,00:27:45,- Is it a joystick?
00:27:45,00:27:46,- Yeah.
00:27:46,00:27:47,- Whatever steer is the plane.
00:27:47,00:27:49,"The dog had that, and I think it made some turns,"
00:27:49,00:27:51,"but also some unnext to them, and they were."
00:27:51,00:27:52,So they took a train to what to do.
00:27:52,00:27:54,I think Kroza never had a better chance.
00:27:54,00:27:55,'Cause Kroza is actually my anyway.
00:27:55,00:27:56,"- I mean, I think we're flying out."
00:27:56,00:27:57,"- Absolutely, yeah."
00:27:57,00:28:00,"- Because they can talk, they can make the tunnel announcements"
00:28:00,00:28:01,and uncomprehensibly.
00:28:01,00:28:03,- What if it was a Kro and you didn't know?
00:28:03,00:28:05,- Would you be angry or thrilled if the big reveal
00:28:05,00:28:07,at the end of your 747 flight was a Kro
00:28:07,00:28:10,coming out of the cockpit and going surprise?
00:28:10,00:28:11,"- I'd be a bit of both, I think."
00:28:11,00:28:12,- Yeah.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"- I'd be surprised, sir."
00:28:14,00:28:16,(laughing)
00:28:16,00:28:19,"- Yeah, James is a stagger that the hummingbird hadn't done it."
00:28:19,00:28:21,- Why would you fly backwards all the way?
00:28:21,00:28:23,(laughing)
00:28:23,00:28:24,- I just wanted to say one thing about grudges.
00:28:24,00:28:25,- Okay.
00:28:25,00:28:26,- It's just quite...
00:28:26,00:28:27,"- Not now Anna, not now."
00:28:27,00:28:28,(laughing)
00:28:28,00:28:30,- Let's talk about it after the recording ends.
00:28:30,00:28:32,"- Andy, it was my last biscuit."
00:28:32,00:28:33,(laughing)
00:28:33,00:28:34,- It was four years ago.
00:28:34,00:28:35,(laughing)
00:28:35,00:28:37,- Men are more vengeful than women.
00:28:37,00:28:39,- We'll see about that.
00:28:39,00:28:42,(laughing)
00:28:42,00:28:45,- That's just my fight.
00:28:45,00:28:48,"- No, there was a study done saying men bear grudges more"
00:28:48,00:28:50,and they aren't as good at forgiving people
00:28:50,00:28:53,when they've been wronged until you explain to them
00:28:53,00:28:56,how they might have also done that.
00:28:56,00:28:57,- In words of one syllable.
00:28:57,00:28:58,(laughing)
00:28:58,00:28:59,- Exactly.
00:28:59,00:29:00,So it seems bizarre.
00:29:00,00:29:02,It seems like when you show them and how to empathize
00:29:02,00:29:05,then they do forgive as easily as women.
00:29:05,00:29:08,"So in this study, the women who remembered their wrongs"
00:29:08,00:29:11,were no more likely to forgive those wrongs
00:29:11,00:29:14,when you reminded women that they had also wronged people.
00:29:14,00:29:15,But the men became much more likely
00:29:15,00:29:17,to forgive people who had wronged them
00:29:17,00:29:20,"when you reminded them, oh but didn't you do this person wrong."
00:29:20,00:29:23,So it's just many that little extra reminder.
00:29:23,00:29:24,- They're like simple crows aren't they?
00:29:24,00:29:25,(laughing)
00:29:25,00:29:27,- Women are hummingbirds to the male raven.
00:29:27,00:29:30,(upbeat music)
00:29:30,00:29:34,- Let's move on to the final fact.
00:29:34,00:29:35,- And that is my fact.
00:29:35,00:29:39,"- My fact is that in 1959, the man who set the record time"
00:29:39,00:29:43,for swimming the Panama Canal was declared an honorary ship
00:29:43,00:29:44,by the Panama Canal Authority.
00:29:44,00:29:45,- That's crazy.
00:29:45,00:29:46,- Amazing.
00:29:46,00:29:47,Although on the way back he did have to carry a load
00:29:47,00:29:49,of 450 cotton bales.
00:29:49,00:29:52,(laughing)
00:29:52,00:29:55,- This was a guy called Captain Robert Legg.
00:29:55,00:29:57,(laughing)
00:29:57,00:29:58,- He got all Bob Legg.
00:29:58,00:29:59,(laughing)
00:29:59,00:30:01,- Well there's Bob Legg with his bobbing legs.
00:30:01,00:30:04,They called him as his swam by.
00:30:04,00:30:07,"And he made the journey in 1958, in 21 hours and 54 minutes,"
00:30:07,00:30:10,which is pretty fast to swim the 77 kilometers
00:30:10,00:30:11,of the Panama Canal.
00:30:11,00:30:15,"And yeah, the next year, the governor of the Panama Canal"
00:30:15,00:30:17,"authority, Mr. William Potter,"
00:30:17,00:30:19,"presented him with a certificate,"
00:30:19,00:30:21,"which announced that he was an honorary ship,"
00:30:21,00:30:24,an honorary vessel in recognition of his achievement.
00:30:24,00:30:25,- That's great.
00:30:25,00:30:28,- I like that if you work hard you could become anything.
00:30:28,00:30:30,(laughing)
00:30:30,00:30:32,"- Yeah, when he was a kid they probably said"
00:30:32,00:30:33,a little bobby leg.
00:30:33,00:30:35,What do you want to be when you grow up?
00:30:35,00:30:36,"He's like, I want to be a ship."
00:30:36,00:30:37,- You dreamer.
00:30:37,00:30:38,- Yeah.
00:30:38,00:30:41,"- Well, can you be a bit more realistic please, Bob?"
00:30:41,00:30:41,(laughing)
00:30:41,00:30:42,You'll be in a council.
00:30:42,00:30:44,(laughing)
00:30:44,00:30:45,- That's fantastic.
00:30:45,00:30:45,- It is good.
00:30:45,00:30:48,Another thing I liked is that people who attempted
00:30:48,00:30:50,to swim in the Panama Canal were treated like ships
00:30:50,00:30:53,"in another sense, which is that they had to pay tolls"
00:30:53,00:30:54,as they went through the locks.
00:30:54,00:30:56,And they were weight-based tolls.
00:30:56,00:30:59,So they had to be weighed and sized up to work out
00:30:59,00:31:01,how much they had to pay.
00:31:01,00:31:05,"And so, Bob leg had to pay 72 cents for each lock crossing"
00:31:05,00:31:08,which was actually the weight of a one ton vessel.
00:31:08,00:31:12,- But the first man who swam it paid 35 cents I think
00:31:12,00:31:15,"because he was only, he was declared a small proportion"
00:31:15,00:31:17,of a one ton vessel.
00:31:17,00:31:18,- I have 36 cents on my file.
00:31:18,00:31:20,I don't know which one's right.
00:31:20,00:31:23,He was called Richard Halliburton.
00:31:23,00:31:24,- Yes.
00:31:24,00:31:26,- I love Richard Halliburton so much.
00:31:26,00:31:28,"So, he was an amazing guy."
00:31:28,00:31:32,"Well, he disappeared in 1939, we assume he died."
00:31:32,00:31:34,"I mean, he's probably dead now."
00:31:34,00:31:36,But he crossed the out by elephant.
00:31:36,00:31:40,He descended into the Mayan Well of Death.
00:31:40,00:31:41,(laughing)
00:31:41,00:31:42,He wasn't a nice guy.
00:31:42,00:31:45,He flew a bike lane over the Taj Mahal upside down.
00:31:45,00:31:46,- That's fantastic.
00:31:46,00:31:48,Can I ask what the Mayan Well of Death is?
00:31:48,00:31:49,- You can ask James.
00:31:49,00:31:51,(laughing)
00:31:51,00:31:54,"- If I had read that, that would be the first thing I googled."
00:31:54,00:31:55,"- Oh, that wasn't curious."
00:31:55,00:31:57,(laughing)
00:31:57,00:32:01,- The Mayan Well of Death is a Mayer sort of sacred well
00:32:01,00:32:03,in I think it's in Colombia.
00:32:03,00:32:06,And lots of people have fallen into there
00:32:06,00:32:08,"and died and things, but not Halliburton."
00:32:08,00:32:09,- Halliburton.
00:32:09,00:32:10,"- He was an unbelievable,"
00:32:10,00:32:11,and he wrote these newspaper columns and books
00:32:11,00:32:13,all about his adventures all over the world.
00:32:13,00:32:15,And there was quite a lot of embellishment in them.
00:32:15,00:32:17,"So, you know, some things need a pinch of salt."
00:32:17,00:32:19,But he swam the Panama Canal.
00:32:19,00:32:21,I think it was the first one to do it.
00:32:21,00:32:22,- He was the first one to do it.
00:32:22,00:32:23,It's going through all the locks as well.
00:32:23,00:32:26,Because the first people to actually swim
00:32:26,00:32:28,from one end to the other were two people
00:32:28,00:32:29,who worked on the canal.
00:32:29,00:32:30,'Cause they thought the honor of swimming
00:32:30,00:32:32,it should go to people who worked on it.
00:32:32,00:32:36,"And they, because they worked on the canal six days a week,"
00:32:36,00:32:37,they could only swim it on Sundays.
00:32:37,00:32:40,And so it took them quite a long time in stages.
00:32:40,00:32:42,- Yeah.
00:32:42,00:32:45,"I like this headline from when Halliburton swam the canal in,"
00:32:45,00:32:47,so it was 1928 when he did it.
00:32:47,00:32:49,"And I just read a headline from the time,"
00:32:49,00:32:52,"which is, ""Alligators annoy authors"
00:32:52,00:32:53,"""froming Panama Canal."""
00:32:53,00:32:54,(laughing)
00:32:54,00:32:56,"- I just thought, ""I think that's the wrong way round."""
00:32:56,00:32:59,"Like, he's the one who's in their canal."
00:32:59,00:33:01,- You should have bought some autos to go off.
00:33:01,00:33:02,(laughing)
00:33:02,00:33:05,"- So about the prices that you have to pay,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,the most that anyone's ever paid is a cruise ship
00:33:07,00:33:09,called the Norwegian Pearl.
00:33:09,00:33:14,"And they paid $375,600 to go through."
00:33:14,00:33:18,"You paid by birth, by the number of people you can carry."
00:33:18,00:33:21,And there's a thing called Priority Passage.
00:33:21,00:33:22,"So if there's a queue,"
00:33:22,00:33:25,quite often there's a queue of a load of ships waiting.
00:33:25,00:33:27,"There was one time, there was a seven-day delay,"
00:33:27,00:33:30,a 90-ship queue waiting.
00:33:30,00:33:33,And these people paid kind of extra money
00:33:33,00:33:35,so they could kind of jump the queue.
00:33:35,00:33:38,"And they paid $220,300."
00:33:38,00:33:41,"And it would normally have been 13,430."
00:33:41,00:33:43,"- Well, they really wanted to get their wares over."
00:33:43,00:33:45,"- Yeah, I know, but that's,"
00:33:45,00:33:45,isn't it great though?
00:33:45,00:33:47,Can you imagine sort of getting there
00:33:47,00:33:49,and there's 90 ships ahead of you?
00:33:49,00:33:52,- I don't know how they would overtake each other though.
00:33:52,00:33:53,"- Because they are huge, aren't they?"
00:33:53,00:33:57,They're made to the ships that go down the Panagma Canal
00:33:57,00:33:59,are often made specifically in order to fit through the canal.
00:33:59,00:34:02,"And the technical term for them is Panamax,"
00:34:02,00:34:03,which is the maximum width you can be
00:34:03,00:34:04,in order to get through.
00:34:04,00:34:06,And they don't look ridiculous if you don't have that.
00:34:06,00:34:08,"- So is it Panama with an X at the end, Panamax?"
00:34:08,00:34:09,"- You've got it, you've got it, one just."
00:34:09,00:34:13,"- Smart, if only Edgar Allan Poe had that kind of forward thinking."
00:34:13,00:34:17,- Do you want to hear my favourite canal facts?
00:34:17,00:34:17,- Yeah.
00:34:17,00:34:21,"- In 1978 there was British waterways,"
00:34:21,00:34:23,"the group were out, cleaning out the canal, dredging it,"
00:34:23,00:34:25,"and they pulled out a chain with a bit of wood on the end,"
00:34:25,00:34:28,"and it was a plug, and they drained the Chesterfield Canal."
00:34:28,00:34:28,- No.
00:34:28,00:34:29,- No.
00:34:29,00:34:31,"- Oh, the fuck in it."
00:34:31,00:34:31,- Oh my god.
00:34:31,00:34:36,- And I thought that can't be true.
00:34:36,00:34:39,"And I was googling it, and then there's a found a thing"
00:34:39,00:34:41,"with the guy who did it, it was called Bill Thorpe,"
00:34:41,00:34:44,and his aunt told the story and said that Bill couldn't believe it.
00:34:44,00:34:46,And the canal crust said that every canal has
00:34:46,00:34:48,"some sort of draining system, that's how they're maintained."
00:34:48,00:34:49,- So you can't drain it now.
00:34:49,00:34:52,"- They get a better, because I thought this is amazing."
00:34:52,00:34:55,"And I found in 2009 there's an aqueduct, an erectum,"
00:34:55,00:34:57,and it needs to be drained for inspection
00:34:57,00:34:59,to see how it was all doing.
00:34:59,00:35:00,And so a ten-year-old boy won the chance
00:35:00,00:35:02,to pull the plug in the competition.
00:35:02,00:35:03,- Oh.
00:35:03,00:35:06,- They let him drain the entire aqueduct.
00:35:06,00:35:08,"- Can he really, a canal can be drained"
00:35:08,00:35:11,by a ten-year-old little weakling?
00:35:11,00:35:12,- This is the aqueduct.
00:35:12,00:35:16,"So it released 1.5 million liters of water in the aqueduct,"
00:35:16,00:35:18,and he said it wasn't actually that hard to do.
00:35:18,00:35:19,- Wow.
00:35:19,00:35:21,- It's really cool to drain the aqueduct.
00:35:21,00:35:22,"- It is cool, I want to do that."
00:35:22,00:35:27,"- Yeah, you know, there was a phase in canals"
00:35:27,00:35:31,between when we decided that having mules pull our things
00:35:31,00:35:33,along the water wasn't going to work.
00:35:33,00:35:35,"And between that phase, and when we came up with diesel,"
00:35:35,00:35:37,there was a phase when canal boats were supposed
00:35:37,00:35:38,to be electrically powered.
00:35:38,00:35:42,"And there were quite a few built, especially in Germany"
00:35:42,00:35:44,"and France and Belgium, I think, and a few in America,"
00:35:44,00:35:46,which had cables running along the top of them.
00:35:46,00:35:48,So it was like electricity lines.
00:35:48,00:35:50,And the canal boats would be connected to the electricity lines
00:35:50,00:35:52,"above them, and then be carried along like that."
00:35:52,00:35:53,That's us. - That's us.
00:35:53,00:35:54,- Very dangerous.
00:35:54,00:35:55,"- Yeah, water and electricity."
00:35:55,00:35:56,- Yeah.
00:35:56,00:35:58,- And you were in the middle of it.
00:35:58,00:35:59,- It has on the tillet. - Incredible.
00:35:59,00:36:00,- There's still one left.
00:36:00,00:36:03,"It's the Straussi ferry in Germany, if you want to visit."
00:36:03,00:36:04,They look really cool.
00:36:04,00:36:05,- That's amazing.
00:36:05,00:36:07,"- So when they, obviously, they used to have horses"
00:36:07,00:36:08,pulling them along the banks.
00:36:08,00:36:10,"And then, obviously that's a problem when you get to the tunnel"
00:36:10,00:36:12,'cause you can't just shove the horse in the canal
00:36:12,00:36:13,and make it go along inside the tunnel.
00:36:13,00:36:15,So they had men called Leggers.
00:36:15,00:36:17,"And what you would do, you would lie on top of the boat"
00:36:17,00:36:19,and you would stick your legs into the air
00:36:19,00:36:22,"and you would use that to slowly push, again,"
00:36:22,00:36:25,"to sort of upside down, walk the canal boat"
00:36:25,00:36:26,along through the tunnel.
00:36:26,00:36:27,"- That's so cool, right?"
00:36:27,00:36:28,"- It's really interesting, right?"
00:36:28,00:36:29,- I used to love it in a blatant book called
00:36:29,00:36:30,"""Sawcy Jane Family."""
00:36:30,00:36:31,That was the name of the canal.
00:36:31,00:36:32,"- ""Sawcy Jane."""
00:36:32,00:36:34,- It was the family who got canal holiday.
00:36:34,00:36:38,"And at some point, they sent the horse over the hill"
00:36:38,00:36:38,"'cause they were going through tunnel,"
00:36:38,00:36:40,but they didn't explain how the boat carried on moving.
00:36:40,00:36:41,"- Oh, yeah."
00:36:41,00:36:42,- So now I know that someone on the top
00:36:42,00:36:44,was peddling against the ceiling.
00:36:44,00:36:45,"- Yeah, that's so cool."
00:36:45,00:36:48,"- ""Sawcy Jane"" lay on her back with a legs of the air."
00:36:48,00:36:49,(laughing)
00:36:49,00:36:50,- Don't ruin my childhood.
00:36:50,00:36:51,- Why was that?
00:36:51,00:36:52,- Quietly that out.
00:36:52,00:36:53,(laughing)
00:36:53,00:36:56,(upbeat music)
