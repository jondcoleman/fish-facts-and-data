1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (whimsical music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,980
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,560
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,120
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,840
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,080
 coming to you from the QI Offices in Covent Garden.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,600
 My name is Anna Tishinsky and I'm joined today

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,440
 by Ann Miller, James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,400
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,760
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,760
 and in no particular order here, they are starting with Ann.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,000
 - My fact is that the alarm clock

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,200
 on the mere space station made the same noise

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,440
 as their emergency alarm.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,440
 - That'll wait you up, wouldn't it?

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,920
 - It would wake you up with a start.

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,080
 This is Helen Sherman, he was the first Britain space.

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,440
 He spent eight days up there in 1991

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,920
 and she was interviewed recently and said, quote,

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,880
 you'd wake up unsure if it was time to get up

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,400
 or if you were leaking oxygen.

22
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,680
 It got us out of our sleeping bags pretty quick.

23
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,520
 - And was that why they did it, do we know?

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,920
 Or was it just like they didn't have any other sounds on file?

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,440
 - I like to think we just thought we've got one alarm.

26
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,360
 That'll work. - That'll do.

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,680
 It does sound like a really effective way

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,440
 of getting out of bed, I mean.

29
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,880
 - Terrifying. - Smart.

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,720
 - Yeah.

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,560
 - Wake up.

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,600
 Fearing for your life.

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,240
 - That's pretty much how I feel waking up every morning.

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,280
 Did you know that her mission, the Juno mission,

35
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,560
 was actually a commercial mission

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,400
 and while she was up there,

37
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,520
 she had to do an advert for Interflora.

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,680
 - No. - Did she?

39
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,920
 - Was it because Interflora like Interstellar,

40
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,040
 was that the reasoning?

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,760
 - You should work an advertising Andy.

42
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,160
 I'm not sure, actually.

43
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,880
 - Wake the flower company, Interflora.

44
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,680
 - Yeah, they actually weren't Interstellar though,

45
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,560
 where they were probably closer to our stellar

46
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,000
 than they were on Earth.

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 - For some other time. - They were interplanetary.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,320
 - For whoever you're Inter, get them.

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,720
 (laughing)

51
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,560
 - Nice footage. - You should not work

52
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,320
 in advertising.

53
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,920
 (laughing)

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,880
 - Meer sounds incredibly shonky.

55
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,840
 - So there was a thing about how the solar panels were damaged.

56
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,400
 That was how, I find it really all the space stations

57
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,960
 are solar powered, I suppose it's obvious.

58
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,240
 But often the lights would go out

59
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,480
 and they'd just have to wait in the dark

60
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,080
 until they came back on, really.

61
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,920
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

62
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
 - Yeah, it was really dodgy, wasn't it?

63
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,320
 They had a few very near, near disaster incidents.

64
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,520
 It's caught fire in the '90s in 1997 of fire started

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,640
 and they tried to extinguish it with a wet towel at first,

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,720
 I think, which made it worse.

67
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,120
 It just made everything very smoky.

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,240
 So they all had to put their respiratory masks on

69
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,800
 at which point they realized

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,240
 that half the respiratory mask didn't work.

71
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,080
 And so while they weren't working

72
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,120
 and they were all suffocating,

73
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,480
 they tried to pull the fire extinguishers off the wall.

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,680
 And I think seven out of the 10 fire extinguishers

75
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,880
 were actually stuck to the wall

76
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,200
 so they couldn't be removed to put the fire out.

77
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,280
 - How did they get it out?

78
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,120
 - They got the other three fire extinguishers

79
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,960
 and used those instead and they were fine.

80
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,000
 But it sounds entertaining, so it's terrifying.

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,640
 - Do you think they called that a mere miss?

82
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,960
 - Probably not. - I hope they did.

83
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,960
 So the mere space station, when it was decommissioned,

84
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,200
 it just had to be sent back into the atmosphere

85
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,720
 to shatter over the Pacific.

86
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,400
 And it looks really beautiful.

87
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
 So I really loved that idea.

88
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,720
 And when the International Space Station

89
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,720
 is decommissioned, it's deobased.

90
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,040
 That'll do the same thing, I think.

91
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,960
 So it just gets brought back into a sorbit

92
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,440
 and then you make sure that it gets brought back

93
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,920
 at a place where it's not gonna rain down

94
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,880
 over a well populated area.

95
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,080
 And it looks like a whole,

96
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,680
 it looks like a meteor shower or something, doesn't it?

97
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,560
 Is that where they all land in Point Nemo, Andy?

98
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
 - Yes.

99
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,880
 - So Point Nemo is the area of the ocean

100
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,000
 that's furthest away from any land.

101
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,480
 And is it full of, I remember you told me this,

102
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,680
 is it full of space ships?

103
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
 - It's a full of old spacecraft.

104
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,520
 That's where they try and get them all to land

105
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,360
 or they sort of, they work it out.

106
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,440
 - There's those remote spots.

107
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,360
 - Exactly, yeah, so there's the least transfer of the life,

108
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,080
 unless you're on a fishing expedition to Point Nemo.

109
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
 - To get away from it all.

110
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,360
 - Fun finding Nemo themed expedition in the way.

111
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,840
 - Oh, it's the idea for it.

112
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,480
 - Yeah, here's a cool thing I found out.

113
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,680
 Once you get back, so in space, basically,

114
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
 you're a bit like a superhuman.

115
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,880
 Chris Hadfield said, you know,

116
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,720
 you can move a massive fridge or whatever

117
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,200
 with the tips of his fingers.

118
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,280
 I don't know why he was moving a fridge out on the ISS.

119
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,880
 But he said that when you get back,

120
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,640
 obviously you're much weaker 'cause your muscles

121
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
 atrophy in space, but the other thing he said

122
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,360
 is that you can feel the weight of your lips

123
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,600
 and your tongue.

124
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,680
 And you have to get used to speaking

125
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,440
 with a tongue that weighs something.

126
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,280
 - That's great.

127
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,200
 Now I can feel the weight of my tongue.

128
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,720
 - I was saying that in space, he had sort of automatically

129
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,320
 learned how to speak with a weightless tongue

130
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
 'cause you're all weightless,

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,680
 so you don't really realize at the time.

132
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,600
 And when you return, it's a little bit harder.

133
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,440
 - That's amazing.

134
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,480
 Is it also hard then to keep your eyes open?

135
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,320
 And then when you come back to earth from outer space,

136
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,360
 surely you feel the weight of gravity.

137
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,800
 - When Helen Sharman came back,

138
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,720
 she said that she kind of felt a bit weird

139
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,680
 and that her brain felt heavy.

140
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,520
 - Wow.

141
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,240
 - Maybe she just got way cleverer in space.

142
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,400
 - Way more stuff.

143
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,360
 - Is that what happens that your brain gets heavier,

144
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,400
 the cleverer you are?

145
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,240
 - Yes.

146
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,320
 - Everyone knows you get smarter in space,

147
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,920
 and your brain gets heavier when you get cleverer.

148
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,040
 - It's like how a full kindle with a tiny, tiny point

149
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
 of a gram more than an empty kindle.

150
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,200
 - Oh yeah.

151
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,040
 - So our brains are like.

152
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,120
 - Hang on, surely if you learn something

153
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,560
 and new connections are made in your brain, yeah.

154
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,160
 They weigh something though, don't they?

155
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,560
 Those cells, I mean, doesn't that mean

156
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,920
 that a really clever brain will weigh a tiny bit more,

157
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,120
 the more with no information?

158
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,440
 - That's why they used to try and like examine

159
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,720
 like Einstein's brain and stuff, didn't they?

160
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,040
 'Cause they thought they have like a secret

161
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,640
 of big brains or small brains.

162
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,760
 - I don't think anyone knows.

163
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,280
 - I think this is a conversation for the neuroscientist

164
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,040
 podcast, rather than a bunch of idiots

165
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,000
 who don't know anything about neuroscience.

166
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,960
 - I can tell you a historical thing about this.

167
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,360
 I think it was golden, but it was certainly someone

168
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,240
 like that from their Victorian age

169
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,080
 who was kind of believed in eugenics or something.

170
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,640
 And he thought the people with bigger heads

171
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,040
 must have bigger brains and must be smarter,

172
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,560
 but he needed to work out how to weigh people's brains

173
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,760
 and how to find the size of their heads.

174
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,200
 And so what he would do is he'd go into a pub

175
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,720
 and find two people with kind of big heads

176
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
 and then start an argument between them

177
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,320
 and say, "This guy says your head's small."

178
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,960
 And he can't tell you the angle.

179
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,600
 This guy says, "Your head's small."

180
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,200
 And he goes, "But don't worry, I'll measure your heads."

181
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,480
 And that'll tell you who's the best.

182
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,960
 And then he got his measurements that way.

183
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,760
 - Was he, and he just had a lot of refusals

184
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,400
 going up and politely asking people,

185
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,080
 so we had to come up with a way around it.

186
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,520
 - I didn't measure my head.

187
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,280
 - I'd just say yes though, if someone asked me

188
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,640
 if they wanted to measure my head.

189
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,720
 - I'd be well offered.

190
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,120
 - Yeah, if anyone wants my head measured.

191
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,360
 - If you ever see other in the streets.

192
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,400
 - Variant aim measure.

193
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,040
 - Happy to help.

194
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
 - Can we talk about alarm clocks?

195
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,520
 - Yeah. - alarm clocks.

196
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,840
 - So the first alarm clock only went off

197
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,360
 at four in the morning that I had found.

198
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,720
 - Yes, that's fantastic.

199
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,360
 - After it was invented, it took another 60 years

200
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,240
 before the first alarm clock was invented,

201
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,960
 which you could not.

202
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,800
 - Why not?

203
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
 - People want to get up at four a year.

204
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,920
 - It was just one guy, he called Levi Hutchins.

205
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,360
 He was from New Hampshire and he started work

206
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,480
 soon after four AM, so that was the time he got up.

207
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,360
 So he just set it, it was totally adaptable.

208
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,600
 And so the first alarm clock that you could adjust

209
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,400
 was patented in France in 1847, but he was 1787.

210
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,880
 - I have a type of alarm clock.

211
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
 This is from a designer called Randolpho

212
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,280
 and it's called The Good Morning Underwear.

213
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,480
 And it's a pair of pants that vibrates

214
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,640
 to wake you up in the morning.

215
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,240
 - Wow. - Okay.

216
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,000
 - This is a designer who kind of likes

217
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,200
 to do electronic clothing or wearable tech,

218
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,160
 especially underwear.

219
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,480
 And he said, "I finally wanted to make a garment

220
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,720
 that my girlfriend would actually want to wear."

221
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,400
 While it might be hard to believe,

222
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,040
 when I made the clap off bra, it was not really for her.

223
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,360
 - The clap off bra.

224
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,840
 - Yeah, so what you do is you clap

225
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,240
 and then your girlfriend or wife's bra falls off.

226
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,320
 - That's fantastic.

227
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,240
 - Well, if you went to a comedy club.

228
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,160
 - Yeah. - Just have to hope everyone is really bad.

229
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,760
 - I read about two simple alarm clocks,

230
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,040
 one of which I would say is higher risks than the other.

231
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,440
 One is that you can build, if you build your house,

232
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,520
 so when you have your bedroom,

233
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,080
 so you're the window where the sun comes in,

234
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,600
 then that actually you'll wake up in the morning,

235
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,680
 which is a lovely idea waking up to the sunrise.

236
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,840
 The other idea is that you just drink loads of water

237
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,960
 before you go to sleep and your body will wake you up.

238
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,800
 - I do that.

239
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,720
 - And it works 80% of the time.

240
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,960
 (laughing)

241
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,680
 - But supposedly it's a Native American thing, isn't it?

242
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,800
 And then it still got practiced even into the 20th century.

243
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,960
 - What was the drinking thing?

244
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,800
 - Yeah.

245
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,160
 - Oh my gosh, I am so connected to my fellow Native Americans.

246
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,320
 They used to drink that.

247
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,440
 - They used to drink water, not Pinot Grigio.

248
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,480
 (laughing)

249
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,280
 - I read that alarm clocks is one of the most common things

250
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,240
 displaced by smart phones.

251
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,720
 - Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

252
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,080
 I've still got three alarm clocks actually,

253
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,440
 so I'm keeping the industry going.

254
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,280
 - But how do you?

255
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,400
 Are they all set at different times?

256
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,760
 - Two of them have broken.

257
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,960
 - Oh, okay, why do you still keep them?

258
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,640
 - 'Cause I have this fantasy that I'm going to go

259
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,160
 into the back of one and fix it one day.

260
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,560
 - That's an incredible fantasy.

261
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,120
 (laughing)

262
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,240
 - Your dreams must be amazing.

263
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
 - Pretty wild inside of my head.

264
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
 (laughing)

265
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,600
 Clock fixing and stamp collecting.

266
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,480
 All night long, my dreams.

267
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,640
 - So just a couple more weird alarm clocks.

268
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,760
 These are off Kickstarter.

269
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,520
 These are current Kickstarter alarm clocks.

270
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,640
 One of them is, as soon as you wake up,

271
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,840
 it gives you your estimated life expectancy

272
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,120
 and your financial information.

273
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
 And it's supposed to be the most depressing alarm clock

274
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
 of all time.

275
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,040
 - Is that worse than the emergency alarm going off?

276
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,640
 - I think it is 'cause it says you're gonna die in 20 years

277
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,280
 and you've got no money.

278
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,120
 - Mom, this is early.

279
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,280
 If you're a billionaire child,

280
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
 then that's what you do.

281
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,840
 - You wake up like I'm winning.

282
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,680
 - Yeah.

283
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,520
 - Come on, bring on the tape.

284
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,200
 What's the idea that it will force you together

285
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,280
 because you need to make more money

286
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,640
 and spend as much time awake as possible before death?

287
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,680
 - I think it's a bit like a memento-mari

288
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,360
 which is kind of it just reminds you

289
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,280
 that you will die one day and it helps you grasp life.

290
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,880
 - No, not remotely.

291
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,720
 - Okay, fine.

292
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,800
 - I try to cheat it by killing myself immediately

293
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,640
 and do like, "Ah, you're wrong."

294
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,480
 (laughing)

295
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,240
 - Well, you'll hope you the winner there.

296
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,480
 - Just immediately spend the load of money

297
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,880
 on Amazon to kill yourself.

298
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,720
 (laughing)

299
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,240
 - In your face, Mr. Alarm.

300
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,280
 - What was it, was there another one James?

301
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,440
 - Here's another one, the money shredding alarm clock.

302
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
 (laughing)

303
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,800
 He, this is a guy who combined a clock kit

304
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,400
 with a USB paper shredder

305
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,480
 and basically put a load of money in there

306
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,440
 and then the alarm goes off

307
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,480
 and the slower it takes you to wake up

308
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,400
 and turn the alarm off,

309
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,960
 the more of your money gets shredded.

310
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,480
 - That is fantastic.

311
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,760
 - A tip, hot tip for people out there.

312
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,000
 Put your partner's money in it.

313
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,080
 (laughing)

314
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,560
 - Steve, for as long as you like.

315
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,600
 - There's somebody who doesn't have a joint bank account.

316
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,760
 (laughing)

317
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,640
 (upbeat music)

318
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,400
 - Okay, time for our second fact

319
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,080
 and that is from James.

320
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,840
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

321
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,560
 the Bosnian National Anthem

322
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,880
 is almost identical in melody

323
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,280
 to the theme for the movie

324
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,560
 National Lampoon's Animal House.

325
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,080
 (laughing)

326
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,920
 - Sounds awesome.

327
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,760
 - Right.

328
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,800
 - Who came first?

329
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,560
 - National Lampoon came first.

330
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,920
 - Basically Bosnian is quite a new country

331
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,040
 and when it became a country,

332
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,200
 they needed a national anthem

333
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,880
 and they found a guy to write it

334
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,960
 and we think that perhaps he might have been somehow

335
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,240
 - So unconsciously.

336
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,360
 - So unconsciously perhaps influenced by this movie.

337
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,480
 - Because if you were going to pick a movie

338
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,800
 to nick the theme tune of it,

339
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,160
 probably wouldn't be National Lampoon's Animal House.

340
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,080
 - That's true, although if you Googled National Anthem

341
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,480
 and spelt it slightly wrong

342
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,280
 and it said, did you mean National Lampoon?

343
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,120
 (laughing)

344
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,800
 - National Lampoon, this will do.

345
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,840
 - Well, the other thing is that

346
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,520
 the National Anthem of Bosnia has no official lyrics.

347
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,840
 So you really are just listening to the theme tune.

348
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,680
 (laughing)

349
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,680
 - And Google it, go on to YouTube and listen to them

350
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
 because they are remarkably similar.

351
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,760
 And this fact actually comes from a book

352
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,240
 that I read a fantastic book called

353
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,760
 "Republic or Death" by a guy called Alex Marshall

354
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,640
 and it's full of kind of QI facts about National Anthem.

355
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,760
 So I absolutely love it.

356
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,200
 I've found so much stuff in there.

357
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,720
 - So he, Alex Marshall is quite firmly sympathetic

358
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,440
 towards the guy who wrote this isn't here,

359
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,560
 do Sancestic.

360
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,400
 - That's right.

361
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,320
 - And says it implies that it really was a subconscious

362
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,120
 thing and I think this guy might have been screwed out

363
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,400
 of quite a bit of money from the Bosnian government now

364
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,440
 who are refusing to pay him

365
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,560
 because they didn't like the lyrics that he wrote eventually.

366
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,200
 - Yeah, the lyrics have been written

367
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,840
 and they've been approved by one body

368
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,480
 but they still haven't been approved by a council of ministers.

369
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,120
 So at the moment there are no lyrics.

370
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,720
 - The Spanish one hasn't got any words either, hasn't.

371
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,560
 - Oh, is it not?

372
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,400
 - I don't know.

373
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,640
 - They had a competition to give words for it

374
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,560
 but no one really liked them so they took them out.

375
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,400
 - Oh really?

376
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,240
 - They're amazing.

377
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,880
 Yes, South Sudan, obviously.

378
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,520
 It's still the world's newest country, isn't it?

379
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,640
 - Yeah, it must be.

380
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,200
 - They had an X-factor style competition for theirs

381
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,600
 with literally had a row of judges

382
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,960
 and you had to present it.

383
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,360
 And I did not know that South Sudan

384
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,160
 was nearly called the Nile Republic.

385
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,000
 - What's it?

386
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,840
 - It was one of the names they considered, yeah.

387
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,840
 - So there's a story attested to in the 19th century

388
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,800
 which is that the Sultan of Malaysia visited Queen Victoria

389
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,840
 was invited to visit Queen Victoria in 1888 I think

390
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,600
 and they didn't have a national anthem at the time,

391
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,680
 the Malaysians.

392
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,640
 But when the Sultan got to meet Queen Victoria,

393
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,320
 her aide said, oh by the way,

394
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,120
 when we're formally welcoming you,

395
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,840
 we want to be able to sing and play on national anthem.

396
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,040
 So what is it?

397
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,800
 And the aide was too embarrassed to say we don't have one.

398
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,760
 And so he just thought of the first unique think of

399
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,600
 which was some local tune from the say shells

400
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,320
 that he'd once heard, which was a French origin I think

401
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,160
 and hummed that.

402
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,040
 And to this day, that is the Malaysian national anthem.

403
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,880
 - Why?

404
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,720
 - No way.

405
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,120
 - Didn't they change the Malaysian anthem

406
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,400
 when they came independent?

407
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,440
 Because Benjamin Britain wrote one for them in 1957.

408
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,600
 - Oh, did he?

409
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,360
 - But he had, he'd only been in the country for a few hours.

410
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
 He didn't particularly have the best time.

411
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,640
 - The lyrics are all about the airport.

412
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
 - He was supposed to be here.

413
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,400
 - They have great Tobleros and lovely duty free.

414
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,440
 - He was a bit pricey.

415
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,360
 Now he's supposed to go and visit a rubber plantation,

416
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,120
 but instead spent the whole trip terrified,

417
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,880
 he's going to be attacked under attack.

418
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,400
 And he said, quote, we had a taste of what it's like

419
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,960
 to live always armed in a fear of one's life.

420
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,560
 And at one point, they were stuck in a thunderstorm,

421
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,160
 and spent the entire hour terrified

422
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,080
 that someone was going to find them.

423
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,320
 - And did all these quotes make it

424
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,920
 into the lyrics he wrote for the national anthem?

425
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,320
 - They didn't go with his national anthem.

426
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,400
 (laughing)

427
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,080
 'Cause they had a huge competition in the '50s,

428
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,000
 and they didn't like their entries.

429
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 They thought we'll ask Benjamin Britain

430
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,880
 to see if he can come up with something.

431
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,440
 And instead, they went with a cabaret song, I think.

432
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,600
 - Oh, I have a fact about cabaret songs

433
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,400
 in national anthems.

434
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,240
 - Great.

435
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,640
 - So, the Germans, only sing the third verse

436
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
 of their national anthem.

437
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,760
 And that's partly because the first verse begins,

438
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,120
 Deutsche Landu Bras, very heavily associated,

439
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
 with Nazi times, obviously.

440
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,800
 So, after the Second World War, West Germany

441
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,400
 had no official national anthem,

442
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,880
 'cause there was a big program of what was called

443
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,960
 "D-Nazification",

444
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,880
 where they were trying to restore civil society

445
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,480
 as it had been before, 1933.

446
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,800
 So, at football matches,

447
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,480
 people started singing a carnival song

448
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,640
 as their kind of unofficial national anthem,

449
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,120
 which was taking the Mickey out of the allied powers,

450
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,480
 who were still obviously occupying at the time.

451
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,600
 So, that was another carnival song that got used as a...

452
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
 - Oh, did they actually use it

453
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,000
 as a national anthem for a while?

454
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,280
 - No, it was always unofficial.

455
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,480
 Sometimes they started playing it

456
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,200
 and Belgian soldiers who were occupying, heard it,

457
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
 and they stood up thinking,

458
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
 "Oh, this is the national anthem, then, that's great."

459
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,840
 - Isn't there a verse of "God Save the Queen"

460
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,680
 that we don't sing,

461
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,640
 because it's got a line about rebellious scots to crush?

462
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,720
 - I always sing that one.

463
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,000
 - I only sing that one.

464
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,040
 - Can I feel very secure to be here?

465
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,880
 - God Save the Queen, wasn't that the national anthem

466
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,480
 for a lot of countries when it was first written?

467
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,120
 - Like, Lichtenstein had the same tune,

468
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,320
 but I think they have different words.

469
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,120
 - Lichtenstein, it would be amazing

470
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,440
 if they had the same words.

471
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,400
 - It's already done, we could just change it.

472
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,360
 - God Save the Queen, Lichtenstein.

473
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,800
 (all laughing)

474
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,560
 Apparently, when Lichtenstein played football

475
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,600
 against Scotland, they always get the national anthem boot.

476
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,240
 - Oh, so my favorite story ever

477
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,440
 with Scottish people, if it were matches,

478
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,600
 when they went to Italy,

479
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,760
 and allegedly, we're singing,

480
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
 "We're going to deep fry our pizzas."

481
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,600
 - Oh, yeah.

482
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,040
 - I just think it's...

483
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,760
 - So, I think a lot of countries had the English national anthem

484
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,480
 before anyone else had a national anthem.

485
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,960
 So, I think God Save the King was the first

486
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,000
 that came up in 1745 and became our national anthem.

487
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,040
 And lots of other countries thought,

488
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,920
 "Okay, that sounds like a good idea, national anthems."

489
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,600
 But didn't think to write their own.

490
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,200
 And so, you know, within a few decades,

491
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,600
 the German states, Russia, Denmark,

492
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,840
 the kingdom of Hawaii,

493
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,920
 they all had the English national anthem

494
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,080
 as their national anthem, as in that melody.

495
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,760
 And Lichtenstein is the one that still kept it,

496
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,720
 couldn't be bothered to ever drop it.

497
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,800
 - I read a list of national anthem titles,

498
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,960
 and there are some from around the world,

499
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,480
 which are unbelievably good, let's hear some.

500
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,120
 So, I think the best around the entire world

501
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,160
 is Bhutan's The Thunder Dragon Kingdom.

502
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,520
 - Yes. - Amazing.

503
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,600
 Poland has, Poland is not yet lost

504
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,480
 so long as we still live very lively.

505
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,960
 Equatorial guineas is let us tread the path

506
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,920
 of our immense happiness.

507
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,080
 - That's quite nice. - Good luck.

508
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,680
 - I like Vanuatu's, which is Yumi, Yumi, Yumi.

509
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,840
 (laughing)

510
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,320
 - Is it really?

511
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,960
 - Yumi, Yumi, Yumi, it's so good in my tummy.

512
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,680
 - It's the same verse, isn't it?

513
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,480
 - It means we, we, we.

514
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,160
 - As in us, us, us.

515
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,800
 - Yeah. - Not as in you're in you're in you're in you're in you.

516
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,120
 I mean, they have to be insane, wouldn't they?

517
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,720
 - The cleanup operation is awful after everyone saw it.

518
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,760
 (laughing)

519
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,480
 - So, Bikina Faso, their national anthem

520
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,760
 is one single night, and these are the opening lights.

521
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,000
 This is in translation, obviously.

522
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,280
 But, against the humiliating bondage of a thousand years,

523
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,680
 repacity came from afar to subjugate them for a hundred years

524
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,920
 against the cynical malice in the shape of neo-colonialism

525
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,320
 and its petty local servants.

526
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,640
 - Wow.

527
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,160
 - I prefer Yumi, Yumi, Yumi.

528
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,600
 (laughing)

529
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,680
 - The English public don't want God save the Queen

530
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,040
 to be their national anthem, mostly.

531
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,840
 So, at the moment, I think a bill was proposed in Parliament

532
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,760
 at the start of this year to have an English national anthem

533
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,880
 'cause weird English people get upset

534
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,480
 that we have to share our national anthem

535
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,600
 with the Scottish and the Welsh.

536
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,880
 - They're also not thrilled.

537
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
 (laughing)

538
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,240
 - Yeah.

539
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,720
 - I'm the Northern Irish.

540
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,080
 - And the Northern Irish.

541
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,240
 - And the Lichtenstonian.

542
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,440
 - And the Lichtenstonians.

543
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,480
 Okay, too many people are sharing God save the Queen

544
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,840
 and there's not enough to go around.

545
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,480
 So, there's a movement to change the English national anthem.

546
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,720
 And I think one of the popular choices is obviously land

547
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,680
 of Hope and Glory, which I think 55% of the English public

548
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,960
 would like, which is a catchy tune,

549
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,680
 but which, Elgar, who wrote the tune for it,

550
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,360
 didn't like, and he really hated the way

551
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,920
 that it was appropriated for kind of jingoistic causes,

552
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,800
 and it was sung to get the English troops

553
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,320
 riled up in the First World War,

554
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,040
 and Elgar already disapproved of that,

555
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,840
 and he didn't like the lyrics that were written to it,

556
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,240
 which were written by someone else.

557
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,120
 So, when you're seeing that feeling patriotic,

558
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,000
 you should know that the man who wrote it

559
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 was not up for that.

560
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,800
 - I think we should ask the internet

561
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,440
 what should be our national anthem?

562
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,680
 - Don't get us.

563
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,120
 Queenie McQueen face will win by a country mile.

564
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,040
 - There'd be something like it's raining there now,

565
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,880
 something like that.

566
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,840
 (laughing)

567
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,760
 - Well, the Massey A's, strong candidate

568
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,200
 for the best national anthem ever, really, really exciting,

569
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,960
 was written by a royalist.

570
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,840
 The composer was a massive royalist,

571
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,720
 and considering it's so revolutionary,

572
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,560
 that's a bit surprising.

573
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,920
 - Oh, really? - Yeah.

574
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,680
 - He was asked to write it by the mayor of Strasbourg.

575
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,520
 - Oh, what's he?

576
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,080
 - Can I just say a quick story about plagiarism?

577
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,920
 - Yes, please.

578
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,080
 - That really entertained me that I'd never read.

579
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,760
 It's just about a nature writer,

580
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,400
 this seems like a bit of a crowbar,

581
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,640
 but I read something written by a nature writer

582
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,120
 called Paul Tolme,

583
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,840
 and he visited South Dakota in 2005

584
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,080
 to write an academic article on Black-footed ferrets.

585
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,560
 He noticed a few years later that a bodice ripper

586
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,760
 kind of raunchy book by a writer called Cassie Edwards

587
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,200
 contained verbatim, his description of Black-footed ferrets.

588
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,880
 So he says, she writes raunchy stories about Native Americans

589
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,160
 having forbidden relationships with frontiers women.

590
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,880
 - Oh, I thought you were going to say with ferrets.

591
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,480
 (laughing)

592
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,880
 - No, bizarrely enough.

593
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,960
 There's just a scene where they have raunchies,

594
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,360
 I've said the word raunchy a lot.

595
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,280
 There's a scene where they have sex,

596
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,560
 and after they have sex,

597
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,640
 they start having a chat about ferrets,

598
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,080
 and in that chat about ferrets,

599
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,840
 there's a really incongruous description,

600
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,160
 academic description of ferrets,

601
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,600
 and he said, yeah, it was a sudden dialogue

602
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,120
 between a hunky American Indian

603
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,040
 and a lustful pioneer woman,

604
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,920
 which was the height of absurdity.

605
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,440
 (laughing)

606
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,020
 (upbeat music)

607
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,120
 - Okay, on to fact number three, and that is Ande's Facts.

608
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,920
 - My fact is that crows can bear a grudge for nine years

609
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,360
 and two generations.

610
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,880
 - That is fantastic.

611
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,440
 - What have you done to these crows Ande's?

612
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,840
 - There's a crow I know called Enigo Montoya,

613
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,080
 and I killed his father.

614
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,040
 (laughing)

615
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,600
 Is that a reference to something I don't get?

616
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
 The Princess Bride.

617
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,640
 (laughing)

618
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,520
 So, okay, so this is from a book that's just out,

619
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,960
 it's called The Genius of Birds,

620
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,040
 it's by Jennifer Ackerman,

621
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
 and it is a fantastic book.

622
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,920
 So, basically, crows can remember a face.

623
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,400
 Okay, they can remember a load of faces,

624
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,080
 and they can teach their offspring

625
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,080
 and their friends to dislike you as well.

626
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,120
 - Why do they do that, though?

627
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,520
 - Basically, a load of scientists put on masks

628
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,360
 and then bothered crows.

629
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,560
 (laughing)

630
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,320
 Basically, and they captured them,

631
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,720
 or they used the word abducted in some write-ups of this,

632
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,040
 but they just sort of captured them

633
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,920
 and then released them, wearing a particular mask.

634
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,160
 So, they had a caveman mask for one of these experiments.

635
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,400
 And then when they were released,

636
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,200
 the birds remembered which kind of face had treated them badly,

637
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,840
 or which kind of face had treated them well, fed them.

638
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,160
 And then they would dive bomb the threatening masks,

639
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,720
 and then they left it for, in some cases, up to nine years,

640
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,840
 and the mobbing still happened.

641
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
 The birds had remembered from years and years previously,

642
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,720
 and other birds, which had not hatched at the time

643
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,000
 of the original attacks,

644
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,640
 were taught to join in this mobbing,

645
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,440
 and then when they saw you thereafter,

646
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,120
 they would mob you, 'cause they knew.

647
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,640
 - Can I ask, why were they wearing masks?

648
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,640
 'Cause they didn't want the crows to hate their normal faces.

649
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,760
 - I think it was, because they were on the university campus,

650
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,000
 and you can't just teach all birds on the campus to hate--

651
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,640
 - No, actually, I do want this one.

652
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,040
 It's because they were worried that if they didn't have masks,

653
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,400
 it'd be something in their facial expressions,

654
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,640
 the birds were reacting to it, it was a mask.

655
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,280
 It was sort of controlled for each time they did it.

656
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
 - It's not like there was an old scientist

657
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,720
 who once did this experiment,

658
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,680
 and then all the birds in the whole world hated him.

659
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,080
 - I'd rather have to wear a mask

660
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,600
 when I was doing the bird experiment

661
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,120
 than have to wear a mask at all other times.

662
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
 - All other times.

663
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,880
 But this is a study, one thing that they did

664
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
 when they were wearing masks,

665
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,520
 'cause I don't think they were real ones or a replica crew.

666
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,400
 They carry a, what looked like a dead crow

667
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,840
 to sort of taunt the crows,

668
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,240
 and then they'd be like, that's a bad person,

669
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,400
 they've killed a crow.

670
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,880
 They also did it with pigeons.

671
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,600
 A pigeons could not care less.

672
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,120
 I think that's a dead pigeon.

673
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,880
 They didn't look, they didn't do anything.

674
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,280
 So, crows and pathetic pigeons, they'll let you go.

675
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,720
 - That's fantastic.

676
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,920
 - Well, they are very advanced crows, aren't they?

677
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,480
 And so, corvids are my favorite type of bird, by a long way,

678
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,040
 'cause they're, what?

679
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,080
 - Sorry, it's just funny to have a favorite type of bird.

680
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,720
 - That has a better than hummingbirds, they're pretty cool.

681
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,840
 - You don't bring your hummingbird biases in here.

682
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,000
 This is a podcast about crows.

683
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,280
 If you wanted a podcast about hummingbirds,

684
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,400
 you should have gone elsewhere.

685
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,200
 - So, corvids are their family or a genus or?

686
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,000
 - Corvids are family, I think.

687
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,280
 - So they're like ravens.

688
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,640
 - Ravens, crows, jays, magpies, all birds like that.

689
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,880
 And they're much better than parrots are at talking,

690
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,840
 for instance, they can vocalize them more impressively,

691
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,320
 so parrots can copy your words,

692
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,440
 but they always speak in that power voice.

693
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,320
 And whereas, I can imitate power voices very well,

694
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,840
 they can't imitate mine.

695
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,920
 - But crows can do all the accents.

696
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,080
 - Crows can do all the accents.

697
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,840
 - Actually, you know the radio show, Death Riggas.

698
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,080
 It's just all crows.

699
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,440
 - There's a man who's trained his raven

700
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,600
 to chant "Nevermore" from the Edgar Allan Poe poem.

701
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,480
 So, he chants it in, 'cause he's so good

702
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,320
 at mimicking his own voice in this terrifying man's voice.

703
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
 - It's so good.

704
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,480
 - Yeah. - That would give me nightmares.

705
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,320
 - Yeah.

706
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,240
 - Did Edgar Allan Poe in life take advantage of the fact

707
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,760
 that his surname and the word poem are really similar?

708
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,440
 And another Edgar Allan Poe.

709
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
 (laughing)

710
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,280
 He should have done.

711
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,960
 I mean, maybe he wouldn't have died penniless

712
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
 at the edge of about 40,

713
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,720
 if he'd only had a bit of commercial mass.

714
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,040
 (laughing)

715
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,600
 He had a terrible life.

716
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,400
 Everyone around him died incredibly young,

717
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,520
 and yeah, he was completely blighted.

718
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,200
 He made no money from his poems, and yeah.

719
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,840
 But if he'd have had commercial expert,

720
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,000
 Andrew Hunter Murray with it.

721
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 (laughing)

722
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,240
 - Yeah.

723
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,200
 So, one thing that says it's called mobbing behavior.

724
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,960
 Basically, when birds all attack an individual

725
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,360
 at the same time.

726
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,120
 And the birds mostly do it with birds of prey.

727
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,960
 So, small birds will attack big birds.

728
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,800
 - Oh yeah.

729
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,240
 - But basically, they will defecate or vomit

730
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,080
 on birds of prey so much that the bird of prey has to leave,

731
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,200
 because they can be quite corrosive.

732
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,400
 Obviously, vomit is very acidic.

733
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,680
 And the bird of prey will have to leave,

734
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,760
 because its feathers might be damaged.

735
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,200
 - I think that is very bold.

736
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,120
 I wouldn't approach to tiger, for instance,

737
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,480
 and vomit on it.

738
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,880
 - Hoping that it's fur would be eroded fast enough

739
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,720
 before eight.

740
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,560
 - It would need me.

741
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,720
 - But you might find yourself defecating.

742
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,360
 (laughing)

743
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,000
 - But if your family were all with you,

744
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,160
 you might all go and vomit on the tiger.

745
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,920
 (laughing)

746
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,320
 - Worst trip to nosely safari path ever.

747
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,560
 (laughing)

748
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,400
 - But there is a video online of otters mobbing a crocodile.

749
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,040
 I mean, it is unbelievably good.

750
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,600
 - Wow, really?

751
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,920
 - The otters are all advancing on the crocodile,

752
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,040
 and it's backing away, scared from them.

753
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,880
 I mean, they're not vomiting or--

754
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,040
 - But they could be about.

755
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,880
 - Maybe.

756
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,520
 But occasionally, the crocodile snaps a bit,

757
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,360
 but it is losing, basically.

758
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
 - But the crocodile is aquatic,

759
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,680
 if it did get vomit, it would just submerge itself,

760
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,520
 and then come out of that.

761
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,880
 - I don't think the otters are vomiting, are they?

762
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,040
 They're just being aggressive.

763
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,760
 They're just being aggressive and advance going on.

764
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,240
 And now I'm thinking about it.

765
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,160
 I don't think this has happened,

766
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,440
 but it's possible someone just reversed

767
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,120
 the tape of a crocodile advance.

768
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,720
 About to reach a load of otters.

769
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,760
 (laughing)

770
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,960
 - Crows like to pull tails of cats and animals

771
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,440
 to like to tease them, play with them.

772
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,280
 - What?

773
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,400
 - And I read, so you know how tricky to do,

774
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,720
 and you have somebody, you see somebody,

775
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
 and you tap them on a shoulder,

776
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,640
 but you're actually on the other side,

777
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,480
 because you've reached round.

778
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,080
 Jack does do that to rooks.

779
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,280
 So Jack does think up to a rook and pull its tail,

780
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,520
 and then the other jack does on the other side,

781
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,720
 and we're going to steal every rook was eating.

782
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,560
 - No way.

783
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,400
 - Yeah, it's like an distraction,

784
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
 like a two-man con.

785
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,600
 So one taps the, and then the other one's like,

786
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,800
 "Yes, dinner."

787
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,640
 - That's great.

788
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,880
 - It's not all that's so clever.

789
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,200
 - Yeah.

790
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
 - You know, when crows hide their foods,

791
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,120
 they hide it in the ground,

792
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,000
 and they also remember where they hid it,

793
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,640
 but also remember how long that food has

794
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,600
 before it goes bad.

795
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,400
 So they would bother going back to food that's gone bad.

796
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,680
 - No. - Yeah.

797
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,680
 - And also similar to the Ravens,

798
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,480
 they, if crows have crows,

799
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,000
 they're friends with her around their five.

800
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,760
 If a crew who they don't like isn't the area,

801
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,680
 they'll go back and then hide it somewhere else later.

802
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,920
 - Wow. - Because they didn't even observe.

803
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,680
 - Yeah, well, hummingbirds can fly backwards, so.

804
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,040
 (laughing)

805
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,880
 - James, will you drop this insane hummingbird

806
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,800
 fixation of yours?

807
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,720
 (laughing)

808
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,000
 - I read an article on Atlas Obscura

809
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,880
 talking about crow brains.

810
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,040
 It was a bit weird.

811
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,160
 They asked, "Can they fall in love?"

812
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,640
 And the scientist said, "We don't and probably can't know

813
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,320
 if they fall in love, but we like to consider it."

814
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,560
 This is quite nice.

815
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,040
 And then the article goes on, "Just for good measure,

816
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,800
 we asked whether, given a machine design,

817
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,120
 specifically for the purpose,

818
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,760
 a crow could drive a car."

819
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,160
 (laughing)

820
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,560
 - To which the scientist said, "I have no idea."

821
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,400
 (laughing)

822
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,800
 I think probably I have an idea that they probably,

823
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,080
 they can't even reach that, well.

824
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,320
 - Did you see that stroke?

825
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,280
 What was it called when dogs fly a plane

826
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,680
 or something that was on recently?

827
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,520
 - And could they?

828
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,120
 - Well, they claimed it was flying the plane.

829
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,720
 I think the dog was just sitting in a seat.

830
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,560
 - I saw that.

831
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,480
 - That was a cult pilot.

832
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,880
 - It was a cult, yeah, I mean, you'd be mad

833
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,720
 (laughing)

834
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,960
 to send sensitive cameras and stuff.

835
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,200
 Expensive filming equipment.

836
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,280
 - With an unaccompanied tax.

837
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,120
 (laughing)

838
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,600
 - On a 7472 in the next, you'll imagine,

839
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,520
 sitting in your seat, and over the tunnel.

840
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,760
 (laughing)

841
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,600
 - Where?

842
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,960
 - You'll probably do it again in English in a minute.

843
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,320
 (laughing)

844
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,880
 - So actually, just going back to that,

845
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,800
 what actually happened on this TV show?

846
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,040
 - I can't remember if it's the guy, the pilot took them up

847
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,840
 and then they handed over control to the dog.

848
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,680
 (laughing)

849
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,480
 And there was a train over behind the dog.

850
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
 I think what it was was the dog had it had it.

851
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,840
 - The poor's were kind of through the joystick.

852
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,680
 - Is it a joystick?

853
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,520
 - Yeah.

854
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,480
 - Whatever steer is the plane.

855
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,600
 The dog had that, and I think it made some turns,

856
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,360
 but also some unnext to them, and they were.

857
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,640
 So they took a train to what to do.

858
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,360
 I think Kroza never had a better chance.

859
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,560
 'Cause Kroza is actually my anyway.

860
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
 - I mean, I think we're flying out.

861
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,400
 - Absolutely, yeah.

862
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,160
 - Because they can talk, they can make the tunnel announcements

863
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,680
 and uncomprehensibly.

864
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,360
 - What if it was a Kro and you didn't know?

865
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
 - Would you be angry or thrilled if the big reveal

866
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,960
 at the end of your 747 flight was a Kro

867
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,200
 coming out of the cockpit and going surprise?

868
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,840
 - I'd be a bit of both, I think.

869
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,680
 - Yeah.

870
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,200
 - I'd be surprised, sir.

871
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,480
 (laughing)

872
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,440
 - Yeah, James is a stagger that the hummingbird hadn't done it.

873
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,160
 - Why would you fly backwards all the way?

874
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,320
 (laughing)

875
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,800
 - I just wanted to say one thing about grudges.

876
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,640
 - Okay.

877
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,480
 - It's just quite...

878
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,440
 - Not now Anna, not now.

879
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
 (laughing)

880
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,840
 - Let's talk about it after the recording ends.

881
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,400
 - Andy, it was my last biscuit.

882
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
 (laughing)

883
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,760
 - It was four years ago.

884
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,720
 (laughing)

885
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,280
 - Men are more vengeful than women.

886
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,800
 - We'll see about that.

887
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,240
 (laughing)

888
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,920
 - That's just my fight.

889
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,000
 - No, there was a study done saying men bear grudges more

890
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,200
 and they aren't as good at forgiving people

891
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,640
 when they've been wronged until you explain to them

892
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,080
 how they might have also done that.

893
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,720
 - In words of one syllable.

894
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,720
 (laughing)

895
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,800
 - Exactly.

896
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,640
 So it seems bizarre.

897
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,840
 It seems like when you show them and how to empathize

898
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,200
 then they do forgive as easily as women.

899
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,800
 So in this study, the women who remembered their wrongs

900
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,320
 were no more likely to forgive those wrongs

901
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,040
 when you reminded women that they had also wronged people.

902
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,880
 But the men became much more likely

903
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,100
 to forgive people who had wronged them

904
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,280
 when you reminded them, oh but didn't you do this person wrong.

905
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,080
 So it's just many that little extra reminder.

906
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,680
 - They're like simple crows aren't they?

907
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,640
 (laughing)

908
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,920
 - Women are hummingbirds to the male raven.

909
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,500
 (upbeat music)

910
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,880
 - Let's move on to the final fact.

911
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,920
 - And that is my fact.

912
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,760
 - My fact is that in 1959, the man who set the record time

913
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,040
 for swimming the Panama Canal was declared an honorary ship

914
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,760
 by the Panama Canal Authority.

915
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,600
 - That's crazy.

916
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,440
 - Amazing.

917
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,920
 Although on the way back he did have to carry a load

918
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,800
 of 450 cotton bales.

919
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,400
 (laughing)

920
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,040
 - This was a guy called Captain Robert Legg.

921
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
 (laughing)

922
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,280
 - He got all Bob Legg.

923
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,840
 (laughing)

924
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,720
 - Well there's Bob Legg with his bobbing legs.

925
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,000
 They called him as his swam by.

926
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,800
 And he made the journey in 1958, in 21 hours and 54 minutes,

927
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,520
 which is pretty fast to swim the 77 kilometers

928
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,920
 of the Panama Canal.

929
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,760
 And yeah, the next year, the governor of the Panama Canal

930
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,600
 authority, Mr. William Potter,

931
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,000
 presented him with a certificate,

932
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,840
 which announced that he was an honorary ship,

933
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,800
 an honorary vessel in recognition of his achievement.

934
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,640
 - That's great.

935
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,000
 - I like that if you work hard you could become anything.

936
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,160
 (laughing)

937
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,560
 - Yeah, when he was a kid they probably said

938
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,800
 a little bobby leg.

939
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,040
 What do you want to be when you grow up?

940
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,880
 He's like, I want to be a ship.

941
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
 - You dreamer.

942
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,720
 - Yeah.

943
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,080
 - Well, can you be a bit more realistic please, Bob?

944
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,920
 (laughing)

945
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,760
 You'll be in a council.

946
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,160
 (laughing)

947
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,120
 - That's fantastic.

948
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,960
 - It is good.

949
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,240
 Another thing I liked is that people who attempted

950
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,680
 to swim in the Panama Canal were treated like ships

951
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,600
 in another sense, which is that they had to pay tolls

952
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,800
 as they went through the locks.

953
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,320
 And they were weight-based tolls.

954
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,960
 So they had to be weighed and sized up to work out

955
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,520
 how much they had to pay.

956
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,920
 And so, Bob leg had to pay 72 cents for each lock crossing

957
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,440
 which was actually the weight of a one ton vessel.

958
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,600
 - But the first man who swam it paid 35 cents I think

959
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,960
 because he was only, he was declared a small proportion

960
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,000
 of a one ton vessel.

961
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,960
 - I have 36 cents on my file.

962
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,320
 I don't know which one's right.

963
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,360
 He was called Richard Halliburton.

964
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,200
 - Yes.

965
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,760
 - I love Richard Halliburton so much.

966
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,760
 So, he was an amazing guy.

967
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,840
 Well, he disappeared in 1939, we assume he died.

968
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,200
 I mean, he's probably dead now.

969
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,800
 But he crossed the out by elephant.

970
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,440
 He descended into the Mayan Well of Death.

971
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,280
 (laughing)

972
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,120
 He wasn't a nice guy.

973
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,360
 He flew a bike lane over the Taj Mahal upside down.

974
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,200
 - That's fantastic.

975
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
 Can I ask what the Mayan Well of Death is?

976
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,360
 - You can ask James.

977
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
 (laughing)

978
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,560
 - If I had read that, that would be the first thing I googled.

979
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,640
 - Oh, that wasn't curious.

980
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,520
 (laughing)

981
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,840
 - The Mayan Well of Death is a Mayer sort of sacred well

982
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,720
 in I think it's in Colombia.

983
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,200
 And lots of people have fallen into there

984
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,960
 and died and things, but not Halliburton.

985
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,800
 - Halliburton.

986
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
 - He was an unbelievable,

987
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,840
 and he wrote these newspaper columns and books

988
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,240
 all about his adventures all over the world.

989
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,280
 And there was quite a lot of embellishment in them.

990
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,680
 So, you know, some things need a pinch of salt.

991
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,520
 But he swam the Panama Canal.

992
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,600
 I think it was the first one to do it.

993
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,680
 - He was the first one to do it.

994
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,960
 It's going through all the locks as well.

995
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,720
 Because the first people to actually swim

996
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,760
 from one end to the other were two people

997
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
 who worked on the canal.

998
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,840
 'Cause they thought the honor of swimming

999
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
 it should go to people who worked on it.

1000
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,520
 And they, because they worked on the canal six days a week,

1001
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,880
 they could only swim it on Sundays.

1002
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,960
 And so it took them quite a long time in stages.

1003
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,360
 - Yeah.

1004
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,520
 I like this headline from when Halliburton swam the canal in,

1005
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,760
 so it was 1928 when he did it.

1006
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,280
 And I just read a headline from the time,

1007
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,120
 which is, "Alligators annoy authors

1008
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,520
 "froming Panama Canal."

1009
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,360
 (laughing)

1010
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,720
 - I just thought, "I think that's the wrong way round."

1011
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,280
 Like, he's the one who's in their canal.

1012
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,200
 - You should have bought some autos to go off.

1013
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,440
 (laughing)

1014
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,280
 - So about the prices that you have to pay,

1015
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,600
 the most that anyone's ever paid is a cruise ship

1016
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,280
 called the Norwegian Pearl.

1017
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,280
 And they paid $375,600 to go through.

1018
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,400
 You paid by birth, by the number of people you can carry.

1019
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,560
 And there's a thing called Priority Passage.

1020
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,880
 So if there's a queue,

1021
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,320
 quite often there's a queue of a load of ships waiting.

1022
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,800
 There was one time, there was a seven-day delay,

1023
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,720
 a 90-ship queue waiting.

1024
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,560
 And these people paid kind of extra money

1025
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,240
 so they could kind of jump the queue.

1026
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,120
 And they paid $220,300.

1027
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,240
 And it would normally have been 13,430.

1028
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,840
 - Well, they really wanted to get their wares over.

1029
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,040
 - Yeah, I know, but that's,

1030
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,840
 isn't it great though?

1031
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,240
 Can you imagine sort of getting there

1032
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,280
 and there's 90 ships ahead of you?

1033
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,640
 - I don't know how they would overtake each other though.

1034
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,800
 - Because they are huge, aren't they?

1035
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,000
 They're made to the ships that go down the Panagma Canal

1036
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,560
 are often made specifically in order to fit through the canal.

1037
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,040
 And the technical term for them is Panamax,

1038
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,880
 which is the maximum width you can be

1039
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,720
 in order to get through.

1040
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,040
 And they don't look ridiculous if you don't have that.

1041
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,080
 - So is it Panama with an X at the end, Panamax?

1042
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,400
 - You've got it, you've got it, one just.

1043
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,520
 - Smart, if only Edgar Allan Poe had that kind of forward thinking.

1044
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,040
 - Do you want to hear my favourite canal facts?

1045
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,880
 - Yeah.

1046
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,520
 - In 1978 there was British waterways,

1047
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,320
 the group were out, cleaning out the canal, dredging it,

1048
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,600
 and they pulled out a chain with a bit of wood on the end,

1049
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,080
 and it was a plug, and they drained the Chesterfield Canal.

1050
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,920
 - No.

1051
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,760
 - No.

1052
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,080
 - Oh, the fuck in it.

1053
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,920
 - Oh my god.

1054
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,920
 - And I thought that can't be true.

1055
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,200
 And I was googling it, and then there's a found a thing

1056
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,400
 with the guy who did it, it was called Bill Thorpe,

1057
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,480
 and his aunt told the story and said that Bill couldn't believe it.

1058
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,400
 And the canal crust said that every canal has

1059
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,600
 some sort of draining system, that's how they're maintained.

1060
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,840
 - So you can't drain it now.

1061
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,240
 - They get a better, because I thought this is amazing.

1062
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,720
 And I found in 2009 there's an aqueduct, an erectum,

1063
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,880
 and it needs to be drained for inspection

1064
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,040
 to see how it was all doing.

1065
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,720
 And so a ten-year-old boy won the chance

1066
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,160
 to pull the plug in the competition.

1067
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
 - Oh.

1068
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,720
 - They let him drain the entire aqueduct.

1069
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,440
 - Can he really, a canal can be drained

1070
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,160
 by a ten-year-old little weakling?

1071
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,360
 - This is the aqueduct.

1072
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,000
 So it released 1.5 million liters of water in the aqueduct,

1073
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,600
 and he said it wasn't actually that hard to do.

1074
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,440
 - Wow.

1075
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,080
 - It's really cool to drain the aqueduct.

1076
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,920
 - It is cool, I want to do that.

1077
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,160
 - Yeah, you know, there was a phase in canals

1078
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,760
 between when we decided that having mules pull our things

1079
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,040
 along the water wasn't going to work.

1080
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,720
 And between that phase, and when we came up with diesel,

1081
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,560
 there was a phase when canal boats were supposed

1082
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,920
 to be electrically powered.

1083
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,200
 And there were quite a few built, especially in Germany

1084
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,880
 and France and Belgium, I think, and a few in America,

1085
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,760
 which had cables running along the top of them.

1086
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,080
 So it was like electricity lines.

1087
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,160
 And the canal boats would be connected to the electricity lines

1088
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,280
 above them, and then be carried along like that.

1089
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,120
 That's us. - That's us.

1090
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,680
 - Very dangerous.

1091
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,960
 - Yeah, water and electricity.

1092
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,800
 - Yeah.

1093
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,000
 - And you were in the middle of it.

1094
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,560
 - It has on the tillet. - Incredible.

1095
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,520
 - There's still one left.

1096
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,320
 It's the Straussi ferry in Germany, if you want to visit.

1097
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,440
 They look really cool.

1098
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,600
 - That's amazing.

1099
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,400
 - So when they, obviously, they used to have horses

1100
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
 pulling them along the banks.

1101
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,680
 And then, obviously that's a problem when you get to the tunnel

1102
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,400
 'cause you can't just shove the horse in the canal

1103
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,920
 and make it go along inside the tunnel.

1104
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,760
 So they had men called Leggers.

1105
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,880
 And what you would do, you would lie on top of the boat

1106
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,320
 and you would stick your legs into the air

1107
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,720
 and you would use that to slowly push, again,

1108
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,280
 to sort of upside down, walk the canal boat

1109
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,560
 along through the tunnel.

1110
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
 - That's so cool, right?

1111
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,400
 - It's really interesting, right?

1112
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,560
 - I used to love it in a blatant book called

1113
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
 "Sawcy Jane Family."

1114
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,400
 That was the name of the canal.

1115
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,240
 - "Sawcy Jane."

1116
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,720
 - It was the family who got canal holiday.

1117
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,080
 And at some point, they sent the horse over the hill

1118
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,920
 'cause they were going through tunnel,

1119
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,600
 but they didn't explain how the boat carried on moving.

1120
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,440
 - Oh, yeah.

1121
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,760
 - So now I know that someone on the top

1122
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,040
 was peddling against the ceiling.

1123
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,560
 - Yeah, that's so cool.

1124
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,560
 - "Sawcy Jane" lay on her back with a legs of the air.

1125
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,400
 (laughing)

1126
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
 - Don't ruin my childhood.

1127
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,240
 - Why was that?

1128
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,080
 - Quietly that out.

1129
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,400
 (laughing)

1130
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,000
 (upbeat music)

1131
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,760
 - Okay, that's all of our facts.

1132
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,920
