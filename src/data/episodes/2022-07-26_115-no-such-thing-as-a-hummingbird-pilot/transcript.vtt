00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (whimsical music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.980
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.560
 (upbeat music)

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.120
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.840
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.080
 coming to you from the QI Offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.600
 My name is Anna Tishinsky and I'm joined today

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.440
 by Ann Miller, James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.400
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.760
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.760
 and in no particular order here, they are starting with Ann.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.000
 - My fact is that the alarm clock

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.200
 on the mere space station made the same noise

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.440
 as their emergency alarm.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 - That'll wait you up, wouldn't it?

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.920
 - It would wake you up with a start.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.080
 This is Helen Sherman, he was the first Britain space.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.440
 He spent eight days up there in 1991

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.920
 and she was interviewed recently and said, quote,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.880
 you'd wake up unsure if it was time to get up

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.400
 or if you were leaking oxygen.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.680
 It got us out of our sleeping bags pretty quick.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.520
 - And was that why they did it, do we know?

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.920
 Or was it just like they didn't have any other sounds on file?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.440
 - I like to think we just thought we've got one alarm.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.360
 That'll work. - That'll do.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.680
 It does sound like a really effective way

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.440
 of getting out of bed, I mean.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.880
 - Terrifying. - Smart.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.720
 - Yeah.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.560
 - Wake up.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.600
 Fearing for your life.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.240
 - That's pretty much how I feel waking up every morning.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.280
 Did you know that her mission, the Juno mission,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.560
 was actually a commercial mission

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.400
 and while she was up there,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.520
 she had to do an advert for Interflora.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.680
 - No. - Did she?

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.920
 - Was it because Interflora like Interstellar,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.040
 was that the reasoning?

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.760
 - You should work an advertising Andy.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.160
 I'm not sure, actually.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.880
 - Wake the flower company, Interflora.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.680
 - Yeah, they actually weren't Interstellar though,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.560
 where they were probably closer to our stellar

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.000
 than they were on Earth.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 - For some other time. - They were interplanetary.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.320
 - For whoever you're Inter, get them.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.720
 (laughing)

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.560
 - Nice footage. - You should not work

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.320
 in advertising.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.920
 (laughing)

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.880
 - Meer sounds incredibly shonky.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.840
 - So there was a thing about how the solar panels were damaged.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.400
 That was how, I find it really all the space stations

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.960
 are solar powered, I suppose it's obvious.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.240
 But often the lights would go out

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.480
 and they'd just have to wait in the dark

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.080
 until they came back on, really.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.920
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 - Yeah, it was really dodgy, wasn't it?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.320
 They had a few very near, near disaster incidents.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.520
 It's caught fire in the '90s in 1997 of fire started

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.640
 and they tried to extinguish it with a wet towel at first,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.720
 I think, which made it worse.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.120
 It just made everything very smoky.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.240
 So they all had to put their respiratory masks on

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.800
 at which point they realized

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.240
 that half the respiratory mask didn't work.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.080
 And so while they weren't working

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.120
 and they were all suffocating,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.480
 they tried to pull the fire extinguishers off the wall.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.680
 And I think seven out of the 10 fire extinguishers

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.880
 were actually stuck to the wall

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.200
 so they couldn't be removed to put the fire out.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.280
 - How did they get it out?

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.120
 - They got the other three fire extinguishers

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.960
 and used those instead and they were fine.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.000
 But it sounds entertaining, so it's terrifying.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.640
 - Do you think they called that a mere miss?

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.960
 - Probably not. - I hope they did.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.960
 So the mere space station, when it was decommissioned,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.200
 it just had to be sent back into the atmosphere

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.720
 to shatter over the Pacific.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.400
 And it looks really beautiful.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400
 So I really loved that idea.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.720
 And when the International Space Station

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.720
 is decommissioned, it's deobased.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.040
 That'll do the same thing, I think.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.960
 So it just gets brought back into a sorbit

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.440
 and then you make sure that it gets brought back

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.920
 at a place where it's not gonna rain down

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.880
 over a well populated area.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.080
 And it looks like a whole,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.680
 it looks like a meteor shower or something, doesn't it?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.560
 Is that where they all land in Point Nemo, Andy?

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.560
 - Yes.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.880
 - So Point Nemo is the area of the ocean

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.000
 that's furthest away from any land.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.480
 And is it full of, I remember you told me this,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.680
 is it full of space ships?

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680
 - It's a full of old spacecraft.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.520
 That's where they try and get them all to land

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.360
 or they sort of, they work it out.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.440
 - There's those remote spots.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.360
 - Exactly, yeah, so there's the least transfer of the life,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.080
 unless you're on a fishing expedition to Point Nemo.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.080
 - To get away from it all.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.360
 - Fun finding Nemo themed expedition in the way.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.840
 - Oh, it's the idea for it.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.480
 - Yeah, here's a cool thing I found out.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.680
 Once you get back, so in space, basically,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.960
 you're a bit like a superhuman.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.880
 Chris Hadfield said, you know,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.720
 you can move a massive fridge or whatever

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.200
 with the tips of his fingers.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.280
 I don't know why he was moving a fridge out on the ISS.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.880
 But he said that when you get back,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.640
 obviously you're much weaker 'cause your muscles

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.040
 atrophy in space, but the other thing he said

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.360
 is that you can feel the weight of your lips

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.600
 and your tongue.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.680
 And you have to get used to speaking

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.440
 with a tongue that weighs something.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.280
 - That's great.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.200
 Now I can feel the weight of my tongue.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.720
 - I was saying that in space, he had sort of automatically

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.320
 learned how to speak with a weightless tongue

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.000
 'cause you're all weightless,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.680
 so you don't really realize at the time.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.600
 And when you return, it's a little bit harder.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.440
 - That's amazing.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.480
 Is it also hard then to keep your eyes open?

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.320
 And then when you come back to earth from outer space,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.360
 surely you feel the weight of gravity.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.800
 - When Helen Sharman came back,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.720
 she said that she kind of felt a bit weird

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.680
 and that her brain felt heavy.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.520
 - Wow.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.240
 - Maybe she just got way cleverer in space.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.400
 - Way more stuff.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.360
 - Is that what happens that your brain gets heavier,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.400
 the cleverer you are?

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.240
 - Yes.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.320
 - Everyone knows you get smarter in space,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.920
 and your brain gets heavier when you get cleverer.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.040
 - It's like how a full kindle with a tiny, tiny point

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.360
 of a gram more than an empty kindle.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.200
 - Oh yeah.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.040
 - So our brains are like.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.120
 - Hang on, surely if you learn something

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.560
 and new connections are made in your brain, yeah.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.160
 They weigh something though, don't they?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.560
 Those cells, I mean, doesn't that mean

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.920
 that a really clever brain will weigh a tiny bit more,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.120
 the more with no information?

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.440
 - That's why they used to try and like examine

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.720
 like Einstein's brain and stuff, didn't they?

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.040
 'Cause they thought they have like a secret

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.640
 of big brains or small brains.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.760
 - I don't think anyone knows.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.280
 - I think this is a conversation for the neuroscientist

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.040
 podcast, rather than a bunch of idiots

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.000
 who don't know anything about neuroscience.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.960
 - I can tell you a historical thing about this.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.360
 I think it was golden, but it was certainly someone

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.240
 like that from their Victorian age

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.080
 who was kind of believed in eugenics or something.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.640
 And he thought the people with bigger heads

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.040
 must have bigger brains and must be smarter,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.560
 but he needed to work out how to weigh people's brains

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.760
 and how to find the size of their heads.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.200
 And so what he would do is he'd go into a pub

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.720
 and find two people with kind of big heads

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.720
 and then start an argument between them

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.320
 and say, "This guy says your head's small."

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.960
 And he can't tell you the angle.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.600
 This guy says, "Your head's small."

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.200
 And he goes, "But don't worry, I'll measure your heads."

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.480
 And that'll tell you who's the best.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.960
 And then he got his measurements that way.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.760
 - Was he, and he just had a lot of refusals

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.400
 going up and politely asking people,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.080
 so we had to come up with a way around it.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.520
 - I didn't measure my head.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.280
 - I'd just say yes though, if someone asked me

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.640
 if they wanted to measure my head.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.720
 - I'd be well offered.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.120
 - Yeah, if anyone wants my head measured.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.360
 - If you ever see other in the streets.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.400
 - Variant aim measure.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.040
 - Happy to help.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.040
 - Can we talk about alarm clocks?

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.520
 - Yeah. - alarm clocks.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.840
 - So the first alarm clock only went off

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.360
 at four in the morning that I had found.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.720
 - Yes, that's fantastic.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.360
 - After it was invented, it took another 60 years

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.240
 before the first alarm clock was invented,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.960
 which you could not.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.800
 - Why not?

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.800
 - People want to get up at four a year.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.920
 - It was just one guy, he called Levi Hutchins.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.360
 He was from New Hampshire and he started work

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.480
 soon after four AM, so that was the time he got up.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.360
 So he just set it, it was totally adaptable.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.600
 And so the first alarm clock that you could adjust

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.400
 was patented in France in 1847, but he was 1787.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.880
 - I have a type of alarm clock.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.520
 This is from a designer called Randolpho

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.280
 and it's called The Good Morning Underwear.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.480
 And it's a pair of pants that vibrates

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.640
 to wake you up in the morning.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.240
 - Wow. - Okay.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.000
 - This is a designer who kind of likes

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.200
 to do electronic clothing or wearable tech,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.160
 especially underwear.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.480
 And he said, "I finally wanted to make a garment

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.720
 that my girlfriend would actually want to wear."

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.400
 While it might be hard to believe,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.040
 when I made the clap off bra, it was not really for her.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.360
 - The clap off bra.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.840
 - Yeah, so what you do is you clap

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.240
 and then your girlfriend or wife's bra falls off.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.320
 - That's fantastic.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.240
 - Well, if you went to a comedy club.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.160
 - Yeah. - Just have to hope everyone is really bad.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.760
 - I read about two simple alarm clocks,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.040
 one of which I would say is higher risks than the other.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.440
 One is that you can build, if you build your house,

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.520
 so when you have your bedroom,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.080
 so you're the window where the sun comes in,

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.600
 then that actually you'll wake up in the morning,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.680
 which is a lovely idea waking up to the sunrise.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.840
 The other idea is that you just drink loads of water

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.960
 before you go to sleep and your body will wake you up.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.800
 - I do that.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.720
 - And it works 80% of the time.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.960
 (laughing)

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.680
 - But supposedly it's a Native American thing, isn't it?

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.800
 And then it still got practiced even into the 20th century.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.960
 - What was the drinking thing?

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.800
 - Yeah.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.160
 - Oh my gosh, I am so connected to my fellow Native Americans.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.320
 They used to drink that.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.440
 - They used to drink water, not Pinot Grigio.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.480
 (laughing)

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.280
 - I read that alarm clocks is one of the most common things

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.240
 displaced by smart phones.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.720
 - Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.080
 I've still got three alarm clocks actually,

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.440
 so I'm keeping the industry going.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.280
 - But how do you?

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.400
 Are they all set at different times?

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.760
 - Two of them have broken.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.960
 - Oh, okay, why do you still keep them?

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.640
 - 'Cause I have this fantasy that I'm going to go

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.160
 into the back of one and fix it one day.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.560
 - That's an incredible fantasy.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.120
 (laughing)

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.240
 - Your dreams must be amazing.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.720
 - Pretty wild inside of my head.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.720
 (laughing)

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.600
 Clock fixing and stamp collecting.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.480
 All night long, my dreams.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.640
 - So just a couple more weird alarm clocks.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.760
 These are off Kickstarter.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.520
 These are current Kickstarter alarm clocks.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.640
 One of them is, as soon as you wake up,

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.840
 it gives you your estimated life expectancy

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.120
 and your financial information.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.120
 And it's supposed to be the most depressing alarm clock

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.960
 of all time.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.040
 - Is that worse than the emergency alarm going off?

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.640
 - I think it is 'cause it says you're gonna die in 20 years

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.280
 and you've got no money.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.120
 - Mom, this is early.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.280
 If you're a billionaire child,

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.280
 then that's what you do.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.840
 - You wake up like I'm winning.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.680
 - Yeah.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.520
 - Come on, bring on the tape.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.200
 What's the idea that it will force you together

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.280
 because you need to make more money

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.640
 and spend as much time awake as possible before death?

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.680
 - I think it's a bit like a memento-mari

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.360
 which is kind of it just reminds you

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.280
 that you will die one day and it helps you grasp life.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.880
 - No, not remotely.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.720
 - Okay, fine.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.800
 - I try to cheat it by killing myself immediately

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.640
 and do like, "Ah, you're wrong."

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.480
 (laughing)

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.240
 - Well, you'll hope you the winner there.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.480
 - Just immediately spend the load of money

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.880
 on Amazon to kill yourself.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.720
 (laughing)

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.240
 - In your face, Mr. Alarm.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.280
 - What was it, was there another one James?

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.440
 - Here's another one, the money shredding alarm clock.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.440
 (laughing)

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.800
 He, this is a guy who combined a clock kit

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.400
 with a USB paper shredder

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.480
 and basically put a load of money in there

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.440
 and then the alarm goes off

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.480
 and the slower it takes you to wake up

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.400
 and turn the alarm off,

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.960
 the more of your money gets shredded.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.480
 - That is fantastic.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.760
 - A tip, hot tip for people out there.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.000
 Put your partner's money in it.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.080
 (laughing)

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.560
 - Steve, for as long as you like.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.600
 - There's somebody who doesn't have a joint bank account.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.760
 (laughing)

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.640
 (upbeat music)

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.400
 - Okay, time for our second fact

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.080
 and that is from James.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.840
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.560
 the Bosnian National Anthem

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.880
 is almost identical in melody

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.280
 to the theme for the movie

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.560
 National Lampoon's Animal House.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.080
 (laughing)

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:44.920
 - Sounds awesome.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.760
 - Right.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.800
 - Who came first?

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.560
 - National Lampoon came first.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.920
 - Basically Bosnian is quite a new country

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.040
 and when it became a country,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.200
 they needed a national anthem

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.880
 and they found a guy to write it

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.960
 and we think that perhaps he might have been somehow

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.240
 - So unconsciously.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.360
 - So unconsciously perhaps influenced by this movie.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.480
 - Because if you were going to pick a movie

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.800
 to nick the theme tune of it,

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.160
 probably wouldn't be National Lampoon's Animal House.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.080
 - That's true, although if you Googled National Anthem

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.480
 and spelt it slightly wrong

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.280
 and it said, did you mean National Lampoon?

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.120
 (laughing)

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.800
 - National Lampoon, this will do.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.840
 - Well, the other thing is that

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.520
 the National Anthem of Bosnia has no official lyrics.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.840
 So you really are just listening to the theme tune.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.680
 (laughing)

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.680
 - And Google it, go on to YouTube and listen to them

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.680
 because they are remarkably similar.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.760
 And this fact actually comes from a book

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.240
 that I read a fantastic book called

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.760
 "Republic or Death" by a guy called Alex Marshall

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.640
 and it's full of kind of QI facts about National Anthem.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.760
 So I absolutely love it.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.200
 I've found so much stuff in there.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.720
 - So he, Alex Marshall is quite firmly sympathetic

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.440
 towards the guy who wrote this isn't here,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.560
 do Sancestic.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.400
 - That's right.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.320
 - And says it implies that it really was a subconscious

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.120
 thing and I think this guy might have been screwed out

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.400
 of quite a bit of money from the Bosnian government now

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.440
 who are refusing to pay him

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.560
 because they didn't like the lyrics that he wrote eventually.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.200
 - Yeah, the lyrics have been written

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.840
 and they've been approved by one body

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.480
 but they still haven't been approved by a council of ministers.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.120
 So at the moment there are no lyrics.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.720
 - The Spanish one hasn't got any words either, hasn't.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.560
 - Oh, is it not?

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.400
 - I don't know.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.640
 - They had a competition to give words for it

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.560
 but no one really liked them so they took them out.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.400
 - Oh really?

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.240
 - They're amazing.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.880
 Yes, South Sudan, obviously.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.520
 It's still the world's newest country, isn't it?

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.640
 - Yeah, it must be.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.200
 - They had an X-factor style competition for theirs

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.600
 with literally had a row of judges

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.960
 and you had to present it.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.360
 And I did not know that South Sudan

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.160
 was nearly called the Nile Republic.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.000
 - What's it?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.840
 - It was one of the names they considered, yeah.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.840
 - So there's a story attested to in the 19th century

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.800
 which is that the Sultan of Malaysia visited Queen Victoria

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.840
 was invited to visit Queen Victoria in 1888 I think

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.600
 and they didn't have a national anthem at the time,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.680
 the Malaysians.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.640
 But when the Sultan got to meet Queen Victoria,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.320
 her aide said, oh by the way,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.120
 when we're formally welcoming you,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.840
 we want to be able to sing and play on national anthem.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.040
 So what is it?

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.800
 And the aide was too embarrassed to say we don't have one.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.760
 And so he just thought of the first unique think of

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.600
 which was some local tune from the say shells

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.320
 that he'd once heard, which was a French origin I think

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.160
 and hummed that.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.040
 And to this day, that is the Malaysian national anthem.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.880
 - Why?

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.720
 - No way.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.120
 - Didn't they change the Malaysian anthem

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.400
 when they came independent?

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.440
 Because Benjamin Britain wrote one for them in 1957.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.600
 - Oh, did he?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.360
 - But he had, he'd only been in the country for a few hours.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.440
 He didn't particularly have the best time.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.640
 - The lyrics are all about the airport.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640
 - He was supposed to be here.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.400
 - They have great Tobleros and lovely duty free.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.440
 - He was a bit pricey.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.360
 Now he's supposed to go and visit a rubber plantation,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.120
 but instead spent the whole trip terrified,

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.880
 he's going to be attacked under attack.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.400
 And he said, quote, we had a taste of what it's like

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.960
 to live always armed in a fear of one's life.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.560
 And at one point, they were stuck in a thunderstorm,

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.160
 and spent the entire hour terrified

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.080
 that someone was going to find them.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.320
 - And did all these quotes make it

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.920
 into the lyrics he wrote for the national anthem?

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.320
 - They didn't go with his national anthem.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.400
 (laughing)

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.080
 'Cause they had a huge competition in the '50s,

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.000
 and they didn't like their entries.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 They thought we'll ask Benjamin Britain

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.880
 to see if he can come up with something.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.440
 And instead, they went with a cabaret song, I think.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.600
 - Oh, I have a fact about cabaret songs

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.400
 in national anthems.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.240
 - Great.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.640
 - So, the Germans, only sing the third verse

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.640
 of their national anthem.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.760
 And that's partly because the first verse begins,

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.120
 Deutsche Landu Bras, very heavily associated,

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.120
 with Nazi times, obviously.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.800
 So, after the Second World War, West Germany

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.400
 had no official national anthem,

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.880
 'cause there was a big program of what was called

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.960
 "D-Nazification",

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.880
 where they were trying to restore civil society

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.480
 as it had been before, 1933.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.800
 So, at football matches,

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.480
 people started singing a carnival song

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.640
 as their kind of unofficial national anthem,

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.120
 which was taking the Mickey out of the allied powers,

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.480
 who were still obviously occupying at the time.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.600
 So, that was another carnival song that got used as a...

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.600
 - Oh, did they actually use it

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.000
 as a national anthem for a while?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.280
 - No, it was always unofficial.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.480
 Sometimes they started playing it

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.200
 and Belgian soldiers who were occupying, heard it,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.200
 and they stood up thinking,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.200
 "Oh, this is the national anthem, then, that's great."

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.840
 - Isn't there a verse of "God Save the Queen"

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.680
 that we don't sing,

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.640
 because it's got a line about rebellious scots to crush?

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.720
 - I always sing that one.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.000
 - I only sing that one.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.040
 - Can I feel very secure to be here?

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.880
 - God Save the Queen, wasn't that the national anthem

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.480
 for a lot of countries when it was first written?

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.120
 - Like, Lichtenstein had the same tune,

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.320
 but I think they have different words.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.120
 - Lichtenstein, it would be amazing

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.440
 if they had the same words.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.400
 - It's already done, we could just change it.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.360
 - God Save the Queen, Lichtenstein.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.800
 (all laughing)

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.560
 Apparently, when Lichtenstein played football

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.600
 against Scotland, they always get the national anthem boot.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.240
 - Oh, so my favorite story ever

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.440
 with Scottish people, if it were matches,

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.600
 when they went to Italy,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.760
 and allegedly, we're singing,

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.760
 "We're going to deep fry our pizzas."

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.600
 - Oh, yeah.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.040
 - I just think it's...

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.760
 - So, I think a lot of countries had the English national anthem

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.480
 before anyone else had a national anthem.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.960
 So, I think God Save the King was the first

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.000
 that came up in 1745 and became our national anthem.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.040
 And lots of other countries thought,

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.920
 "Okay, that sounds like a good idea, national anthems."

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.600
 But didn't think to write their own.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.200
 And so, you know, within a few decades,

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.600
 the German states, Russia, Denmark,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.840
 the kingdom of Hawaii,

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.920
 they all had the English national anthem

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.080
 as their national anthem, as in that melody.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.760
 And Lichtenstein is the one that still kept it,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.720
 couldn't be bothered to ever drop it.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.800
 - I read a list of national anthem titles,

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.960
 and there are some from around the world,

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.480
 which are unbelievably good, let's hear some.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.120
 So, I think the best around the entire world

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.160
 is Bhutan's The Thunder Dragon Kingdom.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.520
 - Yes. - Amazing.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.600
 Poland has, Poland is not yet lost

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.480
 so long as we still live very lively.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.960
 Equatorial guineas is let us tread the path

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.920
 of our immense happiness.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.080
 - That's quite nice. - Good luck.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.680
 - I like Vanuatu's, which is Yumi, Yumi, Yumi.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.840
 (laughing)

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.320
 - Is it really?

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.960
 - Yumi, Yumi, Yumi, it's so good in my tummy.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.680
 - It's the same verse, isn't it?

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.480
 - It means we, we, we.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.160
 - As in us, us, us.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.800
 - Yeah. - Not as in you're in you're in you're in you're in you.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.120
 I mean, they have to be insane, wouldn't they?

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.720
 - The cleanup operation is awful after everyone saw it.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.760
 (laughing)

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.480
 - So, Bikina Faso, their national anthem

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.760
 is one single night, and these are the opening lights.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.000
 This is in translation, obviously.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.280
 But, against the humiliating bondage of a thousand years,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.680
 repacity came from afar to subjugate them for a hundred years

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.920
 against the cynical malice in the shape of neo-colonialism

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.320
 and its petty local servants.

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.640
 - Wow.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.160
 - I prefer Yumi, Yumi, Yumi.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.600
 (laughing)

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.680
 - The English public don't want God save the Queen

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.040
 to be their national anthem, mostly.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.840
 So, at the moment, I think a bill was proposed in Parliament

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.760
 at the start of this year to have an English national anthem

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.880
 'cause weird English people get upset

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.480
 that we have to share our national anthem

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.600
 with the Scottish and the Welsh.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.880
 - They're also not thrilled.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.880
 (laughing)

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.240
 - Yeah.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.720
 - I'm the Northern Irish.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.080
 - And the Northern Irish.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.240
 - And the Lichtenstonian.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.440
 - And the Lichtenstonians.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.480
 Okay, too many people are sharing God save the Queen

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.840
 and there's not enough to go around.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.480
 So, there's a movement to change the English national anthem.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.720
 And I think one of the popular choices is obviously land

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.680
 of Hope and Glory, which I think 55% of the English public

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.960
 would like, which is a catchy tune,

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.680
 but which, Elgar, who wrote the tune for it,

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.360
 didn't like, and he really hated the way

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.920
 that it was appropriated for kind of jingoistic causes,

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.800
 and it was sung to get the English troops

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.320
 riled up in the First World War,

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.040
 and Elgar already disapproved of that,

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.840
 and he didn't like the lyrics that were written to it,

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.240
 which were written by someone else.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.120
 So, when you're seeing that feeling patriotic,

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.000
 you should know that the man who wrote it

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 was not up for that.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.800
 - I think we should ask the internet

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.440
 what should be our national anthem?

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.680
 - Don't get us.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.120
 Queenie McQueen face will win by a country mile.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.040
 - There'd be something like it's raining there now,

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:34.880
 something like that.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.840
 (laughing)

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.760
 - Well, the Massey A's, strong candidate

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.200
 for the best national anthem ever, really, really exciting,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.960
 was written by a royalist.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.840
 The composer was a massive royalist,

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.720
 and considering it's so revolutionary,

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.560
 that's a bit surprising.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.920
 - Oh, really? - Yeah.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.680
 - He was asked to write it by the mayor of Strasbourg.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.520
 - Oh, what's he?

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.080
 - Can I just say a quick story about plagiarism?

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:57.920
 - Yes, please.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.080
 - That really entertained me that I'd never read.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.760
 It's just about a nature writer,

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.400
 this seems like a bit of a crowbar,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.640
 but I read something written by a nature writer

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.120
 called Paul Tolme,

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.840
 and he visited South Dakota in 2005

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.080
 to write an academic article on Black-footed ferrets.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.560
 He noticed a few years later that a bodice ripper

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.760
 kind of raunchy book by a writer called Cassie Edwards

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.200
 contained verbatim, his description of Black-footed ferrets.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.880
 So he says, she writes raunchy stories about Native Americans

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.160
 having forbidden relationships with frontiers women.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.880
 - Oh, I thought you were going to say with ferrets.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.480
 (laughing)

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.880
 - No, bizarrely enough.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.960
 There's just a scene where they have raunchies,

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.360
 I've said the word raunchy a lot.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.280
 There's a scene where they have sex,

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.560
 and after they have sex,

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.640
 they start having a chat about ferrets,

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.080
 and in that chat about ferrets,

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.840
 there's a really incongruous description,

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.160
 academic description of ferrets,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.600
 and he said, yeah, it was a sudden dialogue

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.120
 between a hunky American Indian

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.040
 and a lustful pioneer woman,

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.920
 which was the height of absurdity.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.440
 (laughing)

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.020
 (upbeat music)

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.120
 - Okay, on to fact number three, and that is Ande's Facts.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.920
 - My fact is that crows can bear a grudge for nine years

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.360
 and two generations.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.880
 - That is fantastic.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.440
 - What have you done to these crows Ande's?

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.840
 - There's a crow I know called Enigo Montoya,

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.080
 and I killed his father.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.040
 (laughing)

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.600
 Is that a reference to something I don't get?

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.600
 The Princess Bride.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.640
 (laughing)

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.520
 So, okay, so this is from a book that's just out,

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.960
 it's called The Genius of Birds,

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.040
 it's by Jennifer Ackerman,

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.040
 and it is a fantastic book.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.920
 So, basically, crows can remember a face.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.400
 Okay, they can remember a load of faces,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.080
 and they can teach their offspring

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.080
 and their friends to dislike you as well.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.120
 - Why do they do that, though?

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.520
 - Basically, a load of scientists put on masks

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.360
 and then bothered crows.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.560
 (laughing)

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.320
 Basically, and they captured them,

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.720
 or they used the word abducted in some write-ups of this,

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.040
 but they just sort of captured them

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.920
 and then released them, wearing a particular mask.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.160
 So, they had a caveman mask for one of these experiments.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.400
 And then when they were released,

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.200
 the birds remembered which kind of face had treated them badly,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.840
 or which kind of face had treated them well, fed them.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.160
 And then they would dive bomb the threatening masks,

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.720
 and then they left it for, in some cases, up to nine years,

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.840
 and the mobbing still happened.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.840
 The birds had remembered from years and years previously,

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.720
 and other birds, which had not hatched at the time

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.000
 of the original attacks,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.640
 were taught to join in this mobbing,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.440
 and then when they saw you thereafter,

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.120
 they would mob you, 'cause they knew.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.640
 - Can I ask, why were they wearing masks?

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.640
 'Cause they didn't want the crows to hate their normal faces.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.760
 - I think it was, because they were on the university campus,

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.000
 and you can't just teach all birds on the campus to hate--

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.640
 - No, actually, I do want this one.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.040
 It's because they were worried that if they didn't have masks,

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.400
 it'd be something in their facial expressions,

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.640
 the birds were reacting to it, it was a mask.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.280
 It was sort of controlled for each time they did it.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.280
 - It's not like there was an old scientist

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.720
 who once did this experiment,

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.680
 and then all the birds in the whole world hated him.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.080
 - I'd rather have to wear a mask

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.600
 when I was doing the bird experiment

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.120
 than have to wear a mask at all other times.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.120
 - All other times.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.880
 But this is a study, one thing that they did

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.880
 when they were wearing masks,

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.520
 'cause I don't think they were real ones or a replica crew.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.400
 They carry a, what looked like a dead crow

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.840
 to sort of taunt the crows,

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.240
 and then they'd be like, that's a bad person,

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.400
 they've killed a crow.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.880
 They also did it with pigeons.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.600
 A pigeons could not care less.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.120
 I think that's a dead pigeon.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.880
 They didn't look, they didn't do anything.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.280
 So, crows and pathetic pigeons, they'll let you go.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.720
 - That's fantastic.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.920
 - Well, they are very advanced crows, aren't they?

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.480
 And so, corvids are my favorite type of bird, by a long way,

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.040
 'cause they're, what?

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.080
 - Sorry, it's just funny to have a favorite type of bird.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.720
 - That has a better than hummingbirds, they're pretty cool.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.840
 - You don't bring your hummingbird biases in here.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.000
 This is a podcast about crows.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.280
 If you wanted a podcast about hummingbirds,

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.400
 you should have gone elsewhere.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.200
 - So, corvids are their family or a genus or?

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.000
 - Corvids are family, I think.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.280
 - So they're like ravens.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.640
 - Ravens, crows, jays, magpies, all birds like that.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.880
 And they're much better than parrots are at talking,

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.840
 for instance, they can vocalize them more impressively,

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.320
 so parrots can copy your words,

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.440
 but they always speak in that power voice.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.320
 And whereas, I can imitate power voices very well,

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.840
 they can't imitate mine.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.920
 - But crows can do all the accents.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.080
 - Crows can do all the accents.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.840
 - Actually, you know the radio show, Death Riggas.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.080
 It's just all crows.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.440
 - There's a man who's trained his raven

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.600
 to chant "Nevermore" from the Edgar Allan Poe poem.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.480
 So, he chants it in, 'cause he's so good

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.320
 at mimicking his own voice in this terrifying man's voice.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.320
 - It's so good.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.480
 - Yeah. - That would give me nightmares.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.320
 - Yeah.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.240
 - Did Edgar Allan Poe in life take advantage of the fact

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.760
 that his surname and the word poem are really similar?

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.440
 And another Edgar Allan Poe.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.440
 (laughing)

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.280
 He should have done.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.960
 I mean, maybe he wouldn't have died penniless

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.960
 at the edge of about 40,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.720
 if he'd only had a bit of commercial mass.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.040
 (laughing)

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.600
 He had a terrible life.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.400
 Everyone around him died incredibly young,

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.520
 and yeah, he was completely blighted.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.200
 He made no money from his poems, and yeah.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.840
 But if he'd have had commercial expert,

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.000
 Andrew Hunter Murray with it.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 (laughing)

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.240
 - Yeah.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.200
 So, one thing that says it's called mobbing behavior.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.960
 Basically, when birds all attack an individual

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.360
 at the same time.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.120
 And the birds mostly do it with birds of prey.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.960
 So, small birds will attack big birds.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.800
 - Oh yeah.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.240
 - But basically, they will defecate or vomit

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.080
 on birds of prey so much that the bird of prey has to leave,

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.200
 because they can be quite corrosive.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.400
 Obviously, vomit is very acidic.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.680
 And the bird of prey will have to leave,

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.760
 because its feathers might be damaged.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.200
 - I think that is very bold.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.120
 I wouldn't approach to tiger, for instance,

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.480
 and vomit on it.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.880
 - Hoping that it's fur would be eroded fast enough

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.720
 before eight.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.560
 - It would need me.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.720
 - But you might find yourself defecating.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.360
 (laughing)

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.000
 - But if your family were all with you,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.160
 you might all go and vomit on the tiger.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:46.920
 (laughing)

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.320
 - Worst trip to nosely safari path ever.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.560
 (laughing)

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.400
 - But there is a video online of otters mobbing a crocodile.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.040
 I mean, it is unbelievably good.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.600
 - Wow, really?

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.920
 - The otters are all advancing on the crocodile,

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.040
 and it's backing away, scared from them.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.880
 I mean, they're not vomiting or--

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.040
 - But they could be about.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:04.880
 - Maybe.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.520
 But occasionally, the crocodile snaps a bit,

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.360
 but it is losing, basically.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.360
 - But the crocodile is aquatic,

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.680
 if it did get vomit, it would just submerge itself,

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.520
 and then come out of that.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.880
 - I don't think the otters are vomiting, are they?

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.040
 They're just being aggressive.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.760
 They're just being aggressive and advance going on.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.240
 And now I'm thinking about it.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.160
 I don't think this has happened,

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.440
 but it's possible someone just reversed

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.120
 the tape of a crocodile advance.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.720
 About to reach a load of otters.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.760
 (laughing)

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.960
 - Crows like to pull tails of cats and animals

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.440
 to like to tease them, play with them.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.280
 - What?

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.400
 - And I read, so you know how tricky to do,

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.720
 and you have somebody, you see somebody,

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.720
 and you tap them on a shoulder,

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.640
 but you're actually on the other side,

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.480
 because you've reached round.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.080
 Jack does do that to rooks.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.280
 So Jack does think up to a rook and pull its tail,

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.520
 and then the other jack does on the other side,

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.720
 and we're going to steal every rook was eating.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.560
 - No way.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.400
 - Yeah, it's like an distraction,

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.400
 like a two-man con.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.600
 So one taps the, and then the other one's like,

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.800
 "Yes, dinner."

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.640
 - That's great.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.880
 - It's not all that's so clever.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.200
 - Yeah.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.200
 - You know, when crows hide their foods,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.120
 they hide it in the ground,

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.000
 and they also remember where they hid it,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.640
 but also remember how long that food has

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.600
 before it goes bad.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.400
 So they would bother going back to food that's gone bad.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.680
 - No. - Yeah.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.680
 - And also similar to the Ravens,

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.480
 they, if crows have crows,

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.000
 they're friends with her around their five.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.760
 If a crew who they don't like isn't the area,

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.680
 they'll go back and then hide it somewhere else later.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.920
 - Wow. - Because they didn't even observe.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.680
 - Yeah, well, hummingbirds can fly backwards, so.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.040
 (laughing)

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.880
 - James, will you drop this insane hummingbird

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.800
 fixation of yours?

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.720
 (laughing)

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.000
 - I read an article on Atlas Obscura

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.880
 talking about crow brains.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.040
 It was a bit weird.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.160
 They asked, "Can they fall in love?"

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.640
 And the scientist said, "We don't and probably can't know

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.320
 if they fall in love, but we like to consider it."

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.560
 This is quite nice.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.040
 And then the article goes on, "Just for good measure,

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.800
 we asked whether, given a machine design,

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.120
 specifically for the purpose,

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.760
 a crow could drive a car."

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.160
 (laughing)

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.560
 - To which the scientist said, "I have no idea."

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.400
 (laughing)

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.800
 I think probably I have an idea that they probably,

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.080
 they can't even reach that, well.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.320
 - Did you see that stroke?

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.280
 What was it called when dogs fly a plane

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.680
 or something that was on recently?

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.520
 - And could they?

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.120
 - Well, they claimed it was flying the plane.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.720
 I think the dog was just sitting in a seat.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.560
 - I saw that.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.480
 - That was a cult pilot.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.880
 - It was a cult, yeah, I mean, you'd be mad

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.720
 (laughing)

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.960
 to send sensitive cameras and stuff.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.200
 Expensive filming equipment.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.280
 - With an unaccompanied tax.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.120
 (laughing)

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.600
 - On a 7472 in the next, you'll imagine,

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.520
 sitting in your seat, and over the tunnel.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.760
 (laughing)

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.600
 - Where?

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.960
 - You'll probably do it again in English in a minute.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.320
 (laughing)

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.880
 - So actually, just going back to that,

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.800
 what actually happened on this TV show?

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.040
 - I can't remember if it's the guy, the pilot took them up

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.840
 and then they handed over control to the dog.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:38.680
 (laughing)

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.480
 And there was a train over behind the dog.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.480
 I think what it was was the dog had it had it.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.840
 - The poor's were kind of through the joystick.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.680
 - Is it a joystick?

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.520
 - Yeah.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.480
 - Whatever steer is the plane.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.600
 The dog had that, and I think it made some turns,

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.360
 but also some unnext to them, and they were.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.640
 So they took a train to what to do.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.360
 I think Kroza never had a better chance.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.560
 'Cause Kroza is actually my anyway.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.560
 - I mean, I think we're flying out.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.400
 - Absolutely, yeah.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.160
 - Because they can talk, they can make the tunnel announcements

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.680
 and uncomprehensibly.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.360
 - What if it was a Kro and you didn't know?

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.360
 - Would you be angry or thrilled if the big reveal

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.960
 at the end of your 747 flight was a Kro

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.200
 coming out of the cockpit and going surprise?

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.840
 - I'd be a bit of both, I think.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.680
 - Yeah.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.200
 - I'd be surprised, sir.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.480
 (laughing)

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.440
 - Yeah, James is a stagger that the hummingbird hadn't done it.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.160
 - Why would you fly backwards all the way?

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.320
 (laughing)

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.800
 - I just wanted to say one thing about grudges.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.640
 - Okay.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.480
 - It's just quite...

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.440
 - Not now Anna, not now.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.440
 (laughing)

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.840
 - Let's talk about it after the recording ends.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.400
 - Andy, it was my last biscuit.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.400
 (laughing)

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.760
 - It was four years ago.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.720
 (laughing)

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.280
 - Men are more vengeful than women.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.800
 - We'll see about that.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.240
 (laughing)

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.920
 - That's just my fight.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.000
 - No, there was a study done saying men bear grudges more

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.200
 and they aren't as good at forgiving people

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.640
 when they've been wronged until you explain to them

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.080
 how they might have also done that.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.720
 - In words of one syllable.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.720
 (laughing)

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.800
 - Exactly.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.640
 So it seems bizarre.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.840
 It seems like when you show them and how to empathize

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.200
 then they do forgive as easily as women.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.800
 So in this study, the women who remembered their wrongs

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.320
 were no more likely to forgive those wrongs

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.040
 when you reminded women that they had also wronged people.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.880
 But the men became much more likely

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.100
 to forgive people who had wronged them

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.280
 when you reminded them, oh but didn't you do this person wrong.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.080
 So it's just many that little extra reminder.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.680
 - They're like simple crows aren't they?

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.640
 (laughing)

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.920
 - Women are hummingbirds to the male raven.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.500
 (upbeat music)

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.880
 - Let's move on to the final fact.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.920
 - And that is my fact.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:39.760
 - My fact is that in 1959, the man who set the record time

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.040
 for swimming the Panama Canal was declared an honorary ship

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.760
 by the Panama Canal Authority.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.600
 - That's crazy.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.440
 - Amazing.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.920
 Although on the way back he did have to carry a load

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.800
 of 450 cotton bales.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.400
 (laughing)

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.040
 - This was a guy called Captain Robert Legg.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.040
 (laughing)

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.280
 - He got all Bob Legg.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.840
 (laughing)

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.720
 - Well there's Bob Legg with his bobbing legs.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.000
 They called him as his swam by.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.800
 And he made the journey in 1958, in 21 hours and 54 minutes,

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.520
 which is pretty fast to swim the 77 kilometers

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.920
 of the Panama Canal.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.760
 And yeah, the next year, the governor of the Panama Canal

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.600
 authority, Mr. William Potter,

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.000
 presented him with a certificate,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.840
 which announced that he was an honorary ship,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.800
 an honorary vessel in recognition of his achievement.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.640
 - That's great.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.000
 - I like that if you work hard you could become anything.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.160
 (laughing)

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.560
 - Yeah, when he was a kid they probably said

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.800
 a little bobby leg.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.040
 What do you want to be when you grow up?

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.880
 He's like, I want to be a ship.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.880
 - You dreamer.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.720
 - Yeah.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.080
 - Well, can you be a bit more realistic please, Bob?

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:41.920
 (laughing)

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.760
 You'll be in a council.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.160
 (laughing)

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.120
 - That's fantastic.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:45.960
 - It is good.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.240
 Another thing I liked is that people who attempted

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.680
 to swim in the Panama Canal were treated like ships

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.600
 in another sense, which is that they had to pay tolls

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.800
 as they went through the locks.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.320
 And they were weight-based tolls.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.960
 So they had to be weighed and sized up to work out

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.520
 how much they had to pay.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.920
 And so, Bob leg had to pay 72 cents for each lock crossing

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.440
 which was actually the weight of a one ton vessel.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.600
 - But the first man who swam it paid 35 cents I think

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.960
 because he was only, he was declared a small proportion

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.000
 of a one ton vessel.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.960
 - I have 36 cents on my file.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.320
 I don't know which one's right.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.360
 He was called Richard Halliburton.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.200
 - Yes.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.760
 - I love Richard Halliburton so much.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.760
 So, he was an amazing guy.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.840
 Well, he disappeared in 1939, we assume he died.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.200
 I mean, he's probably dead now.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.800
 But he crossed the out by elephant.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.440
 He descended into the Mayan Well of Death.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.280
 (laughing)

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.120
 He wasn't a nice guy.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.360
 He flew a bike lane over the Taj Mahal upside down.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.200
 - That's fantastic.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.200
 Can I ask what the Mayan Well of Death is?

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.360
 - You can ask James.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.360
 (laughing)

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.560
 - If I had read that, that would be the first thing I googled.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.640
 - Oh, that wasn't curious.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.520
 (laughing)

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.840
 - The Mayan Well of Death is a Mayer sort of sacred well

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.720
 in I think it's in Colombia.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.200
 And lots of people have fallen into there

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.960
 and died and things, but not Halliburton.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.800
 - Halliburton.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.800
 - He was an unbelievable,

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.840
 and he wrote these newspaper columns and books

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.240
 all about his adventures all over the world.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.280
 And there was quite a lot of embellishment in them.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.680
 So, you know, some things need a pinch of salt.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.520
 But he swam the Panama Canal.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.600
 I think it was the first one to do it.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.680
 - He was the first one to do it.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.960
 It's going through all the locks as well.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.720
 Because the first people to actually swim

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.760
 from one end to the other were two people

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.760
 who worked on the canal.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.840
 'Cause they thought the honor of swimming

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.840
 it should go to people who worked on it.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.520
 And they, because they worked on the canal six days a week,

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.880
 they could only swim it on Sundays.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.960
 And so it took them quite a long time in stages.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.360
 - Yeah.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.520
 I like this headline from when Halliburton swam the canal in,

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.760
 so it was 1928 when he did it.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.280
 And I just read a headline from the time,

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.120
 which is, "Alligators annoy authors

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.520
 "froming Panama Canal."

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.360
 (laughing)

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.720
 - I just thought, "I think that's the wrong way round."

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.280
 Like, he's the one who's in their canal.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.200
 - You should have bought some autos to go off.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.440
 (laughing)

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.280
 - So about the prices that you have to pay,

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.600
 the most that anyone's ever paid is a cruise ship

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.280
 called the Norwegian Pearl.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.280
 And they paid $375,600 to go through.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.400
 You paid by birth, by the number of people you can carry.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.560
 And there's a thing called Priority Passage.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.880
 So if there's a queue,

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.320
 quite often there's a queue of a load of ships waiting.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.800
 There was one time, there was a seven-day delay,

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.720
 a 90-ship queue waiting.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.560
 And these people paid kind of extra money

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.240
 so they could kind of jump the queue.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.120
 And they paid $220,300.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.240
 And it would normally have been 13,430.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.840
 - Well, they really wanted to get their wares over.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.040
 - Yeah, I know, but that's,

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:45.840
 isn't it great though?

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.240
 Can you imagine sort of getting there

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.280
 and there's 90 ships ahead of you?

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.640
 - I don't know how they would overtake each other though.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.800
 - Because they are huge, aren't they?

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.000
 They're made to the ships that go down the Panagma Canal

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.560
 are often made specifically in order to fit through the canal.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.040
 And the technical term for them is Panamax,

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.880
 which is the maximum width you can be

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.720
 in order to get through.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.040
 And they don't look ridiculous if you don't have that.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.080
 - So is it Panama with an X at the end, Panamax?

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.400
 - You've got it, you've got it, one just.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:13.520
 - Smart, if only Edgar Allan Poe had that kind of forward thinking.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.040
 - Do you want to hear my favourite canal facts?

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.880
 - Yeah.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.520
 - In 1978 there was British waterways,

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.320
 the group were out, cleaning out the canal, dredging it,

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.600
 and they pulled out a chain with a bit of wood on the end,

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.080
 and it was a plug, and they drained the Chesterfield Canal.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:28.920
 - No.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.760
 - No.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.080
 - Oh, the fuck in it.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:31.920
 - Oh my god.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.920
 - And I thought that can't be true.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.200
 And I was googling it, and then there's a found a thing

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.400
 with the guy who did it, it was called Bill Thorpe,

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.480
 and his aunt told the story and said that Bill couldn't believe it.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.400
 And the canal crust said that every canal has

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.600
 some sort of draining system, that's how they're maintained.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.840
 - So you can't drain it now.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.240
 - They get a better, because I thought this is amazing.

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.720
 And I found in 2009 there's an aqueduct, an erectum,

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.880
 and it needs to be drained for inspection

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.040
 to see how it was all doing.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.720
 And so a ten-year-old boy won the chance

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.160
 to pull the plug in the competition.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.160
 - Oh.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.720
 - They let him drain the entire aqueduct.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.440
 - Can he really, a canal can be drained

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.160
 by a ten-year-old little weakling?

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.360
 - This is the aqueduct.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.000
 So it released 1.5 million liters of water in the aqueduct,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.600
 and he said it wasn't actually that hard to do.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.440
 - Wow.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.080
 - It's really cool to drain the aqueduct.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.920
 - It is cool, I want to do that.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:27.160
 - Yeah, you know, there was a phase in canals

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.760
 between when we decided that having mules pull our things

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.040
 along the water wasn't going to work.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.720
 And between that phase, and when we came up with diesel,

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.560
 there was a phase when canal boats were supposed

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.920
 to be electrically powered.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.200
 And there were quite a few built, especially in Germany

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.880
 and France and Belgium, I think, and a few in America,

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.760
 which had cables running along the top of them.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.080
 So it was like electricity lines.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.160
 And the canal boats would be connected to the electricity lines

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.280
 above them, and then be carried along like that.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.120
 That's us. - That's us.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.680
 - Very dangerous.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.960
 - Yeah, water and electricity.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.800
 - Yeah.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.000
 - And you were in the middle of it.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.560
 - It has on the tillet. - Incredible.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.520
 - There's still one left.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.320
 It's the Straussi ferry in Germany, if you want to visit.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.440
 They look really cool.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.600
 - That's amazing.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.400
 - So when they, obviously, they used to have horses

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.400
 pulling them along the banks.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.680
 And then, obviously that's a problem when you get to the tunnel

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.400
 'cause you can't just shove the horse in the canal

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.920
 and make it go along inside the tunnel.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.760
 So they had men called Leggers.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.880
 And what you would do, you would lie on top of the boat

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.320
 and you would stick your legs into the air

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.720
 and you would use that to slowly push, again,

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.280
 to sort of upside down, walk the canal boat

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.560
 along through the tunnel.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:27.560
 - That's so cool, right?

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.400
 - It's really interesting, right?

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.560
 - I used to love it in a blatant book called

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.560
 "Sawcy Jane Family."

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.400
 That was the name of the canal.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.240
 - "Sawcy Jane."

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.720
 - It was the family who got canal holiday.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.080
 And at some point, they sent the horse over the hill

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:38.920
 'cause they were going through tunnel,

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.600
 but they didn't explain how the boat carried on moving.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.440
 - Oh, yeah.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.760
 - So now I know that someone on the top

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.040
 was peddling against the ceiling.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.560
 - Yeah, that's so cool.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.560
 - "Sawcy Jane" lay on her back with a legs of the air.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.400
 (laughing)

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.400
 - Don't ruin my childhood.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.240
 - Why was that?

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.080
 - Quietly that out.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.400
 (laughing)

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.000
 (upbeat music)

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.760
 - Okay, that's all of our facts.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.920
