00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
 Hello club fishers, welcome to this week's bit of bonus material, it is another episode

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,700
 of droppers align where we listen to and respond to in a very polite manner.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:18,080
 Some of your emails, now the reason I'm here for a quick intro is because if you listen

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,760
 to the last episode that we did with Beck Hill you will have heard that we offered to

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,200
 give away a cabbage patch kid doll.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,200
 Now we've all signed it, it's in the QI office, it's ready to be packaged up and sent off

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,040
 to somewhere, hopefully not in Australia but you know we'll try and get it to whoever

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,120
 wins it and the way that you can win that prize is by going to our discord.

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:50,920
 Now our discord can be found at no such thing as a fish.com/fishcord that's F-I-S-H-C-O-R-D

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,720
 and when you go there it should hopefully be obvious because there will be a thread called

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,720
 cabbage patch kid or something like that because I haven't set it up yet but it will be very

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,680
 clear where to go when you get to our discord.

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,600
 Anyway, sorry for banging on, for all but one of you the cabbage patch kid chat is not

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,200
 all that important, what is important is our new episode of droppers align so I really

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,360
 hope you enjoy it.

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:33,240
 Hi, hello everybody, welcome to droppers align, the post room is the post room of club

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,080
 fish where we look through your correspondence and we read it, steam open those envelopes,

18
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,680
 thank you for sending those and we read out the contents of the things, steaming open

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,360
 an envelope when you want to read what's inside it but then you want to reseal it so

20
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,600
 the person doesn't know that you've read it already, you're holding over a kettle

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,200
 or whatever, but that's not really what we're doing here Andy.

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,680
 Well little do you know, I actually go through the inbox and I mark all as unread, it's

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,360
 the modern equivalent.

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,360
 So we've got some brilliant correspondence today, we've got some spicy meat, we've got

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,080
 some actuallys, we've got some get yourself off the hooks, so let's do it, let's crack

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
 on.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,600
 Tony Melton starts straight away with a get yourself off the hook, for the record, punch

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,040
 the opening for an email, the tallest unicycle in the world that has been ridden, when did

29
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,240
 we mention this recently?

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:38,120
 It was I said that if a child grew at the same speed as a whale shark then by the time

31
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,900
 it was three years old it would be the height of the world's largest unicycle.

32
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,400
 And that was 31 feet.

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
 About that, yeah.

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,000
 Well James it was a lovely comparison but you've been hoist on your own fatad here.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,840
 For the record, Tony says, the tallest unicycle in the world that has been ridden was 115

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
 feet tall.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
 What?

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,000
 Far taller than the measly 31 feet you suggested in your recent episode.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,280
 It was ridden by Sam Abrams who needed a crane to hoist it to a vertical position and

40
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
 mount it.

41
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,400
 Unfortunately his website about building and riding the unicycle is broken now, oh convenient.

42
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,200
 How interesting, I thought I'd gotten that from Guinness but maybe I just made a mistake.

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,480
 It might have been in previous Guinness or something.

44
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,480
 The previous record holder in quotes was Steve McPeak, that's a good name, who rode

45
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,800
 101 foot tall unicycle, he used a safety rope attached to a crane and rode it in a circle.

46
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,760
 But his record was accepted but controversial because in the video footage there is tension

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,520
 on the safety rope which means he was not fully riding it himself.

48
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,080
 His tension is a form of assistance which in the view of many invalidated his quotes

49
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
 record.

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
 Silly.

51
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
 I know.

52
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,920
 And that is from a new fish listener and long time rider of unicycles.

53
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
 Great.

54
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
 Tony Melton.

55
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
 Thank you.

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,520
 Does he say the highest unicycle he's ridden?

57
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,600
 He doesn't include that actually.

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
 No.

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,520
 I mean even a short unicycle is about six feet tall isn't it?

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,600
 It's really interesting because this was reported in the press this year in January this year

61
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:08,880
 of a Florida person called Wesley Williams, 25 year old who broke the Guinness World Record

62
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,120
 of the tallest unicycle, 31 feet and 10 inches.

63
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
 Probably this guy.

64
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
 Maybe he's unsupported.

65
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,480
 Okay, well I take about criticism, absolutely no problem.

66
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,400
 I wonder if there's a thing about unicycles where there was a study, it wasn't there about

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,920
 a person who rode around town in a unicycle and he made a note of what everyone said

68
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
 to him.

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
 Yeah.

70
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,560
 And it was something like almost half a people said was your extra wheel or you lost a wheel

71
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,680
 or something like that.

72
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
 Yeah.

73
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
 Yeah.

74
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
 It's like everyone has the same jokes to the same people.

75
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
 Everyone's got the same unicycle jokes haven't they?

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,680
 Yeah.

77
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
 Yeah.

78
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,840
 I love the way that you sort of have accepted the criticism there, sort of suggest that

79
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,160
 it wasn't as cool as, I just like, no that's cool, I'm a cool guy, I'm a cool guy, I accept

80
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
 that.

81
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
 Well done.

82
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
 Thank you for riding here.

83
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,680
 It's been me down for at least 15 years and you know exactly all of my techniques for

84
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
 accepting criticism.

85
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
 Yeah, yeah.

86
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
 And that's one of the better ones.

87
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,760
 No, they should not have put the listener though, I just hope it does have a slight

88
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
 sinisterism to it.

89
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
 Okay, I accept that.

90
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

91
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
 What's his name?

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
 What's his address?

93
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,760
 Tony, Tony, Tony.

94
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
 Mello.

95
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
 Tony, look out of your window, Tony.

96
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
 You'll see James.

97
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
 No, higher, higher.

98
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
 We've got 116 feet.

99
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
 Right.

100
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:24,440
 Sean Jake's rides in with some notes about sledging.

101
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
 Okay.

102
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,040
 And he says, in particular, it's very good in darts, sledging, because you need a lot

103
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
 of mind games.

104
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
 Oh yeah.

105
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,840
 He says the best of this was the late great Eric Bristow, who once asked Rod Harrington

106
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,440
 if he took a breath before he threw a dart.

107
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,000
 This completely put Rod off with the whole game against Eric because he was only focused

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,320
 on his breath pattern.

109
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
 That's brilliant.

110
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
 Look at that.

111
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
 Sure.

112
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
 Yeah.

113
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,000
 So, Dan, do you breathe in before you host an episode of Fish?

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,200
 I'll think about that later today.

115
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,600
 No, I don't say that to me.

116
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,840
 I've got like quite bad breathing problems at the moment, and now I'm actually thinking

117
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,440
 about my breathing all the time, and now I realise I haven't breathed for about 35 seconds.

118
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
 There we go.

119
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
 And now I'm really worried about that.

120
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
 James, you're going blue.

121
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
 You're going blue.

122
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,960
 Do you breathe before you're...

123
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
 Bye.

124
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,000
 Yeah, you've got to have a breath in to tackle that.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 That's a big moment.

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Yeah, yeah.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,840
 You know, it doesn't actually breathe in before he dives into the pool.

128
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,720
 Yeah, I guess that's the question.

129
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
 You must do.

130
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,800
 Speaking about putting people off, did you see recently someone message us saying that

131
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,840
 Greg Jenner, our friend, historian and podcaster, also does a bye at the end of his show.

132
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
 Oh, yes.

133
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
 Oh.

134
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,480
 So, does that put pressure on you, Andy, for your buys?

135
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
 Yeah, it's got to be good.

136
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
 It's got to be better.

137
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
 Better than Jenner.

138
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
 Yeah.

139
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,760
 It sounds like he's had more practice because we've only been doing drop of the line in

140
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
 what, a few months?

141
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
 Six months?

142
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

143
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,400
 I guess, are they suggesting that we're plagiarising?

144
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,160
 Is that so much Greg's thing?

145
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
 I hadn't got that.

146
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,000
 He's the only person who's allowed to say bye.

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,440
 I suppose in that iconic, his iconic bye.

148
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,960
 I mean, if, you know, if this wasn't behind the paywall would be being more trouble when

149
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
 this was exposed to the public.

150
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
 Oh, yeah.

151
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,040
 If this had any listeners at all, we'd be screwed, but as it is, it's just you and

152
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
 me, guys.

153
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
 At least two.

154
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
 Right.

155
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
 Here's James O'Brien.

156
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
 I don't think that one.

157
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,200
 I enjoy listening to the podcast on my walk, on his walk.

158
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,560
 However, today I had a tedious task to perform at home and put the latest episode on my phone

159
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
 speaker.

160
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,800
 I stepped out of the room for a minute to get something, whereupon I received some notifications

161
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,800
 on my smartwatch from Amazon regarding some orders added to my basket.

162
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,480
 I was very confused as I hadn't ordered anything.

163
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,900
 When I checked the Amazon app, it was all fish-related goodies.

164
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,120
 My first thought was that it was a new form of Amazon-induced Orwellian overreach trying

165
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,200
 to flog me stuff.

166
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,600
 I amended the order as I already have Andrew's books.

167
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,120
 The brackets are great, by the way.

168
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
 Thank you.

169
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
 Oh, my Jesus.

170
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
 Sorry.

171
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,120
 Could you not think of a better name than James O'Brien?

172
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,120
 Were you literally just scrolling through Twitter and you're like, "I need a fake name."

173
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,280
 James, you're going to want to be in on this because I left James and Anna's pre-order

174
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,040
 there, as I didn't know about that, and it looks interesting.

175
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
 How interesting.

176
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,540
 I didn't even know it's available on pre-order.

177
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,540
 Yes.

178
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,540
 I felt shamelessly manipulated.

179
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,920
 Everything to play for, the QI Book of Spots.

180
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,640
 Well, he doesn't know what it's called.

181
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,920
 Yes, I felt shamelessly manipulated into buying James and Anna's book, but I regained some

182
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,120
 agency by not buying Dan's.

183
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:29,220
 Well, fuck you, James O'Brien.

184
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,040
 It wasn't until I got back into the room and rewound the podcast where I'd left that I

185
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,920
 discovered the awful truth.

186
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,960
 It wasn't a shadowy global conspiracy penetrating our lives.

187
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,120
 It was the elves themselves, well-played elves.

188
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,300
 I have since disabled that feature on Alexa.

189
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,580
 Also, this is the closer from James, and I've also taken a long hard look at myself regarding

190
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,620
 buying Tat from Amazon.

191
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,780
 So basically, we said Alexa by what's your book called?

192
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:59,740
 The Theory of Everything Else, James, not you, this guy.

193
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,660
 So we said Alexa by The Theory of Everything Else by Dan Schreiber with the hope that people

194
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,220
 might accidentally buy it.

195
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,220
 And it did it.

196
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,060
 And you went into the top ten on Amazon.

197
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,060
 Yeah.

198
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,900
 I was thinking it was due to your amazing publicity push, but maybe it was just this.

199
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,860
 I didn't go into the top ten on Amazon with the sanctuary.

200
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,640
 Right, let's, okay, right.

201
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,600
 I think, okay, new section, plug corner.

202
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,760
 We'll go into the corner for a minute, and then we have to come out.

203
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,880
 Let's try to go down for next time.

204
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
 Plug corner.

205
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
 Right, plug corner.

206
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
 All right.

207
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,340
 I've got another, get yourself off the hook, but this time for Dan, not James.

208
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,340
 Okay.

209
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
 Okay.

210
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
 From Scott Mason.

211
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,340
 Yeah.

212
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,340
 Incorrect on Trash Talk is the subject.

213
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,340
 Okay.

214
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,460
 Here is where Coby, how my ass tastes originated from.

215
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,460
 Okay.

216
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,180
 Can you explain that?

217
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,900
 Shaquille O'Neal and Coby Bryant, it's an example of Trash Talking.

218
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,980
 It was from a book where they said that Coby, it's rare for Trash Talk to come from a book

219
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,980
 in the air.

220
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,560
 The Oxford Dictionary of Insulting Quotations.

221
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:13,040
 That was a book on MBA, and there's an example where Coby and Shaq were both known for, particularly

222
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,320
 Coby for his Trash Talking, his legend.

223
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,000
 And I can't remember the exact line, but it's something like, "You'll be tasting my

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 ass."

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,400
 And the idea is he's jumping so high, doing his slam dunk.

226
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
 Yeah.

227
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,600
 Thor is running away from him, and he's chasing his tail, something, something where his,

228
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,180
 you know, Shaq's very tall anyway, you know, his ass is very high.

229
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,020
 You'd have to go on a tall unicycle to taste that ass.

230
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,020
 Absolutely.

231
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,420
 Well, anyways, Scott sent a link to a YouTube video, which I couldn't watch because I was

232
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:51,000
 in the library when I got this, and they frown on you playing aggressive Trash Talk out loud.

233
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,740
 But the footage shows Shaquille O'Neal taking the mic at a New York club last night, unleashing

234
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,420
 a freestyle verbal assault directed at his arch enemy, Coby Bryant, blaming his former

235
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,920
 teammate for ruining his marriage and imploring him to tell me how my ass tastes.

236
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
 Okay.

237
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,640
 And what's the problem?

238
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,120
 He's saying it's not on the court.

239
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,120
 I think it was a fractional difference of origin story.

240
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,960
 It might, I mean, the story I read was it was on the court.

241
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,760
 So he might have said, you know, that might be his classic line that he says a bunch of

242
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
 times.

243
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
 Yeah.

244
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
 I think jury's out.

245
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
 Okay.

246
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,760
 Dan, sorry, can you take this with a bit more humility, please?

247
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,160
 Coby Bryant named after the beef, Coby Beef.

248
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
 That's right.

249
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
 Yeah, yeah.

250
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,820
 This is about him having beef with Shaquille O'Neal.

251
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,820
 That's right.

252
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,160
 But they were buddies at the end.

253
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
 Right.

254
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
 Yeah.

255
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,300
 Just, just like that article suggests that he broke up my marriage.

256
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,300
 We're not friends.

257
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,300
 They were, they were good friends.

258
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,460
 They managed to make friends after one of them broke up the other's marriage.

259
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,700
 I think everyone's marriage got broken up by each other.

260
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,460
 It's a, that's MBA for you.

261
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,460
 Oh yeah.

262
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,540
 It's a spicy, spicy land.

263
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,540
 A spicy meat.

264
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,540
 Yeah.

265
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
 Spicy beef.

266
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,540
 Spicy Coby.

267
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,540
 Half time.

268
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,540
 Half time.

269
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,540
 Yes.

270
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,540
 Okay.

271
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,540
 Well, I have just been on holiday.

272
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,540
 Yeah.

273
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:06,660
 To the, to Helsinki and Tallinn in Estonia and I bought a gift for one of you.

274
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,660
 Is this a new feature?

275
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,800
 Like, this, is this a halftime, like at a basketball match, you'd have a halftime show.

276
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,540
 I'm really happy for this to be a regular feature, but I will have to go on holiday

277
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,540
 every two weeks.

278
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,020
 Let me show you what it is.

279
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,020
 What is it?

280
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,020
 What would be able to tell?

281
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,460
 You'll be able to tell as soon as I get it out who it's for.

282
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,460
 It's definitely for Andy.

283
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,460
 Wow.

284
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,860
 So can you explain what it is, Dan?

285
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,700
 Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a black box.

286
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,740
 Oh, it's chocolate, it looks like, but it looks like it's moss or some sort of...

287
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,700
 It's chocolate, it's chocolate, but it's got sort of moss growing through it.

288
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
 Yeah.

289
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,700
 I believe it has moss on the inside.

290
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,700
 Oh my God.

291
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,140
 It's finlandish or Finnish as they sometimes say.

292
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,140
 Chocolate covered moss.

293
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,300
 Oh my God.

294
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
 Very happy for that to be for you, Andy.

295
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,340
 Oh, it smells so...

296
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,740
 Smells chocolaty, but I bet it'll taste mossy.

297
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,740
 The perfect result.

298
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,740
 That's amazing.

299
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,740
 That smells great.

300
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
 Thank you.

301
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,780
 I think it's reindeer algae, but then in brackets it says, or moss.

302
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,940
 That's nice, isn't it?

303
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,940
 It's safe to eat.

304
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,940
 Wow.

305
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:17,140
 Yeah, it is safe to eat, it's, it's, yeah, available to tourists if you visit Finland.

306
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,940
 By the 23rd of the 11th.

307
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,940
 Great.

308
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,940
 Easy.

309
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,940
 Yeah.

310
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,300
 You can't re-gift it over Christmas though.

311
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,300
 Oh no.

312
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,940
 As if I would re-gift it, so that's lovely.

313
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,940
 Thank you so much.

314
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,940
 That's very cool.

315
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,940
 I'm really excited.

316
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,940
 I'm really excited about that.

317
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,940
 Thank you, James.

318
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,940
 Cool packaging as well, right?

319
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,940
 Yeah, great packaging.

320
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,940
 Like it looks like a, what was the thing that you were doing?

321
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,940
 A terrarium, is it called?

322
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,940
 I bought a terrarium.

323
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,940
 Yeah, it kind of looks like that.

324
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,940
 It looks like a, because it's a see-through plastic with, yeah, it looks like a little...

325
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,940
 Yeah, if you had like little sort of ants living in there, they would have a whale of

326
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,940
 a time, wouldn't they?

327
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,940
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

328
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,740
 I bought a terrarium tool kit the other day.

329
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
 Great.

330
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,820
 It was curved-handled scissors, and that was curved-bladed scissors for pruning.

331
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,820
 Okay.

332
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,820
 Lovely.

333
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,820
 Next email.

334
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,660
 We got a nice email from Raphael Alvarez.

335
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,520
 It comes with a picture, which I don't have my screen open, so I can't show you now, but

336
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,540
 wanted to share this massive apple I saw at my local fruit stand.

337
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,140
 Oh, I saw that picture.

338
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,260
 Which reminded me of the one James mentioned he saw at the offices of We Buy Any Card.com.

339
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,260
 Did you send us that?

340
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,260
 You did.

341
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,260
 How did I find that?

342
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,260
 Yeah, you forwarded it, because I saw that.

343
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,260
 I think so.

344
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,140
 It's pretty easy to tell from the picture.

345
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,140
 It's pretty easy to tell.

346
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
 It's a big apple.

347
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,140
 But it seemed like it was the size of a baby's head.

348
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,540
 I wanted to get more pictures, but preferred not to hold up the line.

349
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,540
 I don't think we needed more pictures.

350
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,500
 I mean, the one you sent is powerful.

351
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,020
 I think his mistake was taking the photo, because in my head, it just gets bigger with

352
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,020
 every telling.

353
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,020
 Yeah.

354
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,020
 Yeah.

355
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,540
 You know, it's just, in my head, it's the biggest apple that's ever existed.

356
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,540
 It's possibly, you know, like Cinderella could have gone to the ball in it if she didn't

357
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,540
 have a pumpkin.

358
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,540
 Yeah, yeah.

359
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,540
 Like a giant apple.

360
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,540
 Exactly.

361
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,540
 Yeah.

362
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,540
 That's good.

363
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,860
 And I think, probably, if I ever went back now to the offices of Weebuyer at AnyCart.com,

364
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,380
 then I might be disappointed by how big the apple was.

365
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,380
 Do you think it's still there?

366
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,380
 Of course.

367
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,380
 Of course it's still there.

368
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,380
 Of course it's still there.

369
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,380
 Some of it will be.

370
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,820
 And Apple that big won't go off for years, for like, yeah.

371
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,300
 There is a type of apple that doesn't go off for like four months at a time, like there's

372
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,740
 a special type of apple.

373
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,740
 Oh, yeah.

374
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,740
 Irradiated.

375
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,740
 I think that's the cut.

376
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,740
 That is the cut.

377
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,740
 Yeah, they do.

378
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,740
 Don't they?

379
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,740
 No, they do do that.

380
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,020
 But there's like a special species that doesn't go off.

381
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
 Really?

382
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:31,340
 And they think that it might give the secret of everlasting life like a special apple.

383
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,340
 That's so cool.

384
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,340
 Is it?

385
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,340
 Yeah.

386
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,340
 I can't remember what it's called.

387
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,460
 Do they specifically breed it to give to like the U.S. Marines so that they can have

388
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,860
 an apple even after three months living in some reeds or whatever?

389
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,340
 No, they, it's, I think it's just a long lasting apple.

390
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,700
 And they think whenever anything's long lasting in nature, they think maybe this will be the

391
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,980
 solution of everlasting life and it very rarely is.

392
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,980
 Yeah.

393
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,980
 Yeah.

394
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,180
 Well, if it gets you four extra months, yeah, but yeah, this, this apple, I would say from

395
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,940
 the image that you sent, Andy, it was a similar size to the, to the one the guy sent.

396
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,900
 That is very, thank you, both James and Raphael for sort of agreeing that you've both seen

397
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
 very big apples.

398
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
 Well, mine was slightly bigger.

399
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,900
 Oh, sorry.

400
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:18,220
 But I say about the same size, you know, pure politeness, sorry Raphael crushed.

401
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:24,340
 We've had a lovely bit of bonus information, which I think is, is not the, I'm actually

402
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,340
 of the week because it's just a, this is a brilliant fact.

403
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,340
 We talked about Dallas.

404
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,340
 Yes.

405
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
 And.

406
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,340
 Shut J.R.

407
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,340
 Yeah.

408
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,820
 And so Peter Drake writes episode 479 discusses the TV show Dallas writing itself into a

409
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,180
 corner and then being renewed for another season, which happened.

410
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,180
 Yeah.

411
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,340
 Surely the greatest example of this is Sledgehammer, which I haven't ever seen.

412
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,340
 Oh, I have.

413
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,340
 I used to love that show.

414
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,340
 Okay.

415
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,340
 Yeah, yeah.

416
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,340
 Thanks for watching.

417
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,340
 Sledgehammer exclamation mark is the title of the show.

418
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,340
 Brilliant.

419
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,060
 The name of the detective, which was to end with the eponymous detective trying to defuse

420
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:00,620
 a nuclear warhead after emitting his catchphrase, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

421
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:07,240
 He accidentally detonates the bomb vaporizing San Francisco.

422
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:15,660
 When the show was then renewed, is it like a post-apocalyptic, solving crimes, but they're

423
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,940
 all mutant crimes.

424
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,940
 Yeah.

425
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,020
 No, the only solution was to proclaim the subsequent episodes were set five years before.

426
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,020
 Okay.

427
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,980
 I would have thought like, you know, a detective show where they're all cockroaches.

428
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,980
 Yeah.

429
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,980
 So good.

430
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,980
 Yeah.

431
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,980
 I mean, I would would watch.

432
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,980
 What an ending to Sledgehammer.

433
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,740
 I have the feeling that Sledgehammer was like a, trying to be like a naked gun, like it

434
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,980
 was quite a funny show.

435
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,980
 That's my memory of it.

436
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,980
 It sounds funny.

437
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,980
 Yeah.

438
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,480
 His catchphrase is trust me, I know what I'm doing.

439
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
 Yeah.

440
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
 And then that happens.

441
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
 Yeah.

442
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,940
 There's a little quiz.

443
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
 This is a fun thing.

444
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,940
 Okay.

445
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,940
 So Blade Fuller.

446
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,940
 Great name.

447
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,940
 What's the name?

448
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,940
 Yeah.

449
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,940
 Right.

450
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,860
 How far from Australia to Papua New Guinea?

451
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,860
 Oh.

452
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,860
 Right?

453
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,860
 Yeah.

454
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,860
 What's the shortest distance between Australia and Papua New Guinea?

455
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,860
 Okay.

456
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,860
 Well.

457
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,100
 So Dan's, and this is, so Dan, maybe, well, both take a guess.

458
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,500
 Well, Dan is from Australia.

459
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 Exactly.

460
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
 Exactly.

461
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
 So he should know this.

462
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
 Oh, before giving away the answer, make Dan guess.

463
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
 Blade rights.

464
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
 Blade.

465
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
 Yeah.

466
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,360
 He's a token Australian on the show.

467
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
 Ouch.

468
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
 Oh, God.

469
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,400
 My guess, well, my first guess while Dan's thinking, just looking at a map, is that they're

470
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,440
 going to be about 500 miles apart.

471
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,940
 Now I imagine there's probably some island like Christmas Island or something, which

472
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:36,320
 is half Australia and half Papua, and so actually you can just walk from one to the

473
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
 other.

474
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
 That's a really good point.

475
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
 Yeah.

476
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
 Because you'll guess 500 miles or nothing.

477
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
 Yeah.

478
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
 It's important.

479
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,320
 Somewhere between these two.

480
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
 500 miles, I think.

481
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,260
 Like, genuinely, I would say that's about what it is.

482
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,260
 I think that's probably right.

483
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,940
 There's probably an embassy in Sydney, which you can technically be on the last it doesn't

484
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,940
 count.

485
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,440
 I'm going to say four hour flight.

486
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,920
 Oh, thank you so much.

487
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,920
 Thank you so much.

488
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,480
 Is it in the Wright Brothers plane, or is it in a con card?

489
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,360
 It's the most unhelpful thing you could possibly say.

490
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,500
 Or is it a four hour flight of a mosquito, a bird, like a drifting cormorant?

491
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,860
 We're going to say, I could say classic 747 kind of airliner.

492
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,860
 Four hours.

493
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,860
 Four hours.

494
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,180
 That would get you to North Africa, I would say, in four hours.

495
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,180
 Or from Australia.

496
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,400
 Not from the UK, but as an equivalent distance.

497
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
 Right.

498
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:34,380
 What a messed up way of doing it, I was like, well, James, just give me the outro in 500

499
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,380
 miles.

500
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,380
 Thank you, James.

501
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,380
 Self ship, blade, whatever your name is.

502
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,420
 Well, is it 500 miles or four hours in a 747?

503
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,860
 What a stupid, come at me with those questions, you're going to get that.

504
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,140
 Two and a half acres, how can I say?

505
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,340
 Blade continues.

506
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,340
 Did he get it?

507
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,340
 I can tell you he didn't, blade.

508
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,220
 Most people I asked opted for answers around 100 kilometers, as they could picture Australia's

509
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,560
 northern tip being quite close.

510
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,340
 But the actual answer is much less than that, in fact, it is less than four kilometers.

511
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,500
 And it's exactly because of what James said, there is an island, 3.75 kilometers south

512
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,220
 of Papua New Guinea, called Saibai Island, which is Orsay Bay, which is technically Australian

513
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:19,380
 territory, part of the territory of Queensland, because they took it over to do some sea cucumber

514
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,380
 fishing.

515
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,380
 Oh, yeah.

516
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,380
 Well, that was a big deal, wasn't it?

517
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,380
 Sea cucumbers.

518
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,380
 Yeah.

519
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,380
 So it's swimming distance.

520
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,140
 You could, it says practically swimming distance, blade says.

521
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,140
 Yeah.

522
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,780
 I think at four kilometers you could swim, depending on what's on the order.

523
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,780
 Yeah.

524
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,020
 Personally speaking, I might struggle, but yeah.

525
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,020
 Oh, yeah.

526
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,020
 I meant one.

527
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,020
 I didn't mean me.

528
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
 Anyway.

529
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,020
 So thank you very much, Blade.

530
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,020
 That was a great quiz.

531
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,020
 How about this?

532
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
 Yeah.

533
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
 Hannah Vax.

534
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
 Vax?

535
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,020
 Right.

536
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,020
 How do you spell that?

537
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,020
 W-A-C-H-S.

538
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,020
 Okay.

539
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,020
 So I thought Vax.

540
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,020
 Vax.

541
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,020
 We're not anti-Vaxers here.

542
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,020
 Far from it.

543
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,020
 Sorry, Hannah.

544
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,020
 But she's never heard that before.

545
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,020
 Yeah.

546
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,020
 Sorry.

547
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,020
 God.

548
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,020
 Sorry, Hannah.

549
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,020
 Sorry.

550
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,020
 And she's written all the way from L.A. as well.

551
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,020
 Really?

552
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,020
 Yeah.

553
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,020
 Let's show some respect.

554
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,020
 Right.

555
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:11,020
 Hannah writes, "As always, I enjoyed the most recent episode, but I must argue with the

556
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,020
 assertion that the fact about Alan Thicke writing the different strokes theme is the

557
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,020
 most trivial trivia ever."

558
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,020
 Uh-huh.

559
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,020
 "I would wager that for Americans aged 40 to 60..."

560
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,020
 Who was that, say?

561
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,020
 Alan?

562
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
 Alan Thicke.

563
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,020
 So that feels like a U-fact.

564
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,020
 Robin Thicke.

565
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,020
 Who's Robin Thicke?

566
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,020
 Robin Thicke.

567
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,020
 Sorry, Robin Thicke.

568
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,020
 Oh, Robin Thicke.

569
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,020
 Oh, right, Robin.

570
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
 Oh, Alan Thicke.

571
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,020
 Alan Thicke.

572
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,020
 The guy who wrote the different strokes theme.

573
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,020
 Alan Thicke, yeah.

574
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,020
 Sorry.

575
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,020
 Of course.

576
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,020
 "I would wager that for Americans aged 40 to 60, Alan Thicke is the main original Thicke

577
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,020
 with Robin being a lesser-known spinoff."

578
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,020
 Right.

579
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,020
 Yeah.

580
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,020
 Now, here's when we get quite into the weeds.

581
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,020
 Thicke the Elder.

582
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,020
 Like, plenty of the Elder.

583
00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:00,260
 "Played the dad on the very popular late '80s sitcoms, Growing Pains, which is what Kirk

584
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,260
 Cameron was known for before he got into super Christian movies about the rapture."

585
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
 Okay.

586
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,260
 "He also wrote the theme tune to 'The Facts of Life,' which may be even more beloved

587
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,660
 than that of different strokes."

588
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,660
 Yeah.

589
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,660
 I must say I had read all that stuff about Alan Thicke, but the difference-

590
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,660
 What?

591
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,660
 I did not read it.

592
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,660
 I did not!

593
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,900
 Different strokes was a show that I'd heard of, and the others I hadn't really heard of.

594
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:30,900
 Sorry, that's the Thicke alarm going off.

595
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
 Okay, great.

596
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
 No, thanks for the inter-

597
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,900
 Thanks.

598
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,900
 If you at home have any interest, any facts about any of the Thicke family, then-

599
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
 Oh, please.

600
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,900
 Do please send in for the Thicke corner.

601
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:51,100
 Yeah, podcast@qo.com, and just put Thicke in the subject line, and it'll bump it up to

602
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
 the top of the inbox, basically.

603
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,100
 I'll set up a filter.

604
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,100
 We-

605
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,100
 Oh, hey, I've got a telling off that's only fair.

606
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
 Like, I've given you both a drumming.

607
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
 Matthew McKenzie says, "Love the podcast, but-"

608
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:11,100
 You didn't tell me how good your novels were!

609
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:31,100
 And that's from Laura Kunzberg.

610
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:38,100
 Matthew writes, Matthew writes, "Love the podcast, but-"

611
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,100
 This is great.

612
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:48,100
 But my mother died quite recently.

613
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:55,100
 It's quite a serious and dry point.

614
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
 It's quite a dry point.

615
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:02,100
 Love the podcast, but during episode 480, when you were talking about Thatched Roofs and

616
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,860
 what the UK's famous for, you mentioned that the UK is not a big player in microchips.

617
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,860
 Oh, yeah.

618
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,540
 Okay, in fact, ARM Limited, based in Cambridge, is the company responsible for designing the

619
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,940
 microchips in most of the world's smartphones.

620
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,940
 You know what?

621
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,860
 The reason I said that is because it had been in the news that week, haven't it?

622
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
 No, I think I said it.

623
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,860
 I think I said that we're not a big player in the microchip scene.

624
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,860
 That was my fault.

625
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
 Yeah, yeah.

626
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,900
 But I sort of meant, "Oh, are we not investing enough in it now?"

627
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,380
 But actually, I completely hold my hands up.

628
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,860
 I was speaking without full authority on that.

629
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,580
 Sorry, Matthew.

630
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,460
 And let the record stand, big microchip player.

631
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,460
 Great.

632
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,460
 Yeah.

633
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,460
 Okay.

634
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,460
 Bye.

635
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,460
 Oh, Greg?

636
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,460
 Is that you?

637
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,460
 No.

638
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,460
 Oh, sorry.

639
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,460
 No.

640
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,460
 No, it's Andy here.

641
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
 So, Andy.

642
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:57,980
 Thanks everybody for listening to Drop As Alive.

643
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,700
 We hope you've enjoyed it.

644
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,900
 And if you would like to be on it, then you just have to email podcast@qi.com with something

645
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:14,260
 sufficiently amusing or outrageous or, you know, correct, like pick us up on real mistakes.

646
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,140
 Don't just write it on spurious grounds about things that we might not have said for editorial

647
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,140
 reasons, you know.

648
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,060
 We'll give it a go actually, see, because I read everything.

649
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,020
 So anyway, yeah, podcast@qi.com will be back in months time with another one of these and

650
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,300
 in two weeks with a different thing altogether.

651
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,300
 Okay.

652
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:29,300
 Bye.

653
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,300
 Bye.

654
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,300
 Bye.

655
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:31,300
 Bye.

656
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,300
 Bye.

657
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
 Bye.

658
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:33,300
 Bye.

659
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
 Bye.

660
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:34,300
 Bye.

661
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,300
 Bye.

662
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,300
 Bye.

663
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,880
 (upbeat music)

664
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,460
 (upbeat music)
