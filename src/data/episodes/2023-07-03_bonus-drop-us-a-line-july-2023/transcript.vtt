00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
 Hello club fishers, welcome to this week's bit of bonus material, it is another episode

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.700
 of droppers align where we listen to and respond to in a very polite manner.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.080
 Some of your emails, now the reason I'm here for a quick intro is because if you listen

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.760
 to the last episode that we did with Beck Hill you will have heard that we offered to

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.200
 give away a cabbage patch kid doll.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.200
 Now we've all signed it, it's in the QI office, it's ready to be packaged up and sent off

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.040
 to somewhere, hopefully not in Australia but you know we'll try and get it to whoever

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.120
 wins it and the way that you can win that prize is by going to our discord.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.920
 Now our discord can be found at no such thing as a fish.com/fishcord that's F-I-S-H-C-O-R-D

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.720
 and when you go there it should hopefully be obvious because there will be a thread called

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.720
 cabbage patch kid or something like that because I haven't set it up yet but it will be very

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.680
 clear where to go when you get to our discord.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.600
 Anyway, sorry for banging on, for all but one of you the cabbage patch kid chat is not

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.200
 all that important, what is important is our new episode of droppers align so I really

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.360
 hope you enjoy it.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:33.240
 Hi, hello everybody, welcome to droppers align, the post room is the post room of club

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.080
 fish where we look through your correspondence and we read it, steam open those envelopes,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.680
 thank you for sending those and we read out the contents of the things, steaming open

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.360
 an envelope when you want to read what's inside it but then you want to reseal it so

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.600
 the person doesn't know that you've read it already, you're holding over a kettle

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.200
 or whatever, but that's not really what we're doing here Andy.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.680
 Well little do you know, I actually go through the inbox and I mark all as unread, it's

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.360
 the modern equivalent.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.360
 So we've got some brilliant correspondence today, we've got some spicy meat, we've got

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.080
 some actuallys, we've got some get yourself off the hooks, so let's do it, let's crack

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080
 on.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.600
 Tony Melton starts straight away with a get yourself off the hook, for the record, punch

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.040
 the opening for an email, the tallest unicycle in the world that has been ridden, when did

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.240
 we mention this recently?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:38.120
 It was I said that if a child grew at the same speed as a whale shark then by the time

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.900
 it was three years old it would be the height of the world's largest unicycle.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.400
 And that was 31 feet.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 About that, yeah.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.000
 Well James it was a lovely comparison but you've been hoist on your own fatad here.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.840
 For the record, Tony says, the tallest unicycle in the world that has been ridden was 115

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.840
 feet tall.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.840
 What?

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.000
 Far taller than the measly 31 feet you suggested in your recent episode.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.280
 It was ridden by Sam Abrams who needed a crane to hoist it to a vertical position and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.280
 mount it.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.400
 Unfortunately his website about building and riding the unicycle is broken now, oh convenient.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.200
 How interesting, I thought I'd gotten that from Guinness but maybe I just made a mistake.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.480
 It might have been in previous Guinness or something.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.480
 The previous record holder in quotes was Steve McPeak, that's a good name, who rode

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.800
 101 foot tall unicycle, he used a safety rope attached to a crane and rode it in a circle.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.760
 But his record was accepted but controversial because in the video footage there is tension

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.520
 on the safety rope which means he was not fully riding it himself.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.080
 His tension is a form of assistance which in the view of many invalidated his quotes

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.080
 record.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.080
 Silly.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.080
 I know.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.920
 And that is from a new fish listener and long time rider of unicycles.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.920
 Great.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.920
 Tony Melton.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.920
 Thank you.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.520
 Does he say the highest unicycle he's ridden?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.600
 He doesn't include that actually.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.600
 No.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.520
 I mean even a short unicycle is about six feet tall isn't it?

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.600
 It's really interesting because this was reported in the press this year in January this year

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.880
 of a Florida person called Wesley Williams, 25 year old who broke the Guinness World Record

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.120
 of the tallest unicycle, 31 feet and 10 inches.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.120
 Probably this guy.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.120
 Maybe he's unsupported.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.480
 Okay, well I take about criticism, absolutely no problem.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.400
 I wonder if there's a thing about unicycles where there was a study, it wasn't there about

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.920
 a person who rode around town in a unicycle and he made a note of what everyone said

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.920
 to him.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.920
 Yeah.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.560
 And it was something like almost half a people said was your extra wheel or you lost a wheel

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.680
 or something like that.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.680
 Yeah.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.680
 Yeah.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.680
 It's like everyone has the same jokes to the same people.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.680
 Everyone's got the same unicycle jokes haven't they?

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.680
 Yeah.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.680
 Yeah.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.840
 I love the way that you sort of have accepted the criticism there, sort of suggest that

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.160
 it wasn't as cool as, I just like, no that's cool, I'm a cool guy, I'm a cool guy, I accept

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.160
 that.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.160
 Well done.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.160
 Thank you for riding here.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.680
 It's been me down for at least 15 years and you know exactly all of my techniques for

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.680
 accepting criticism.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.680
 And that's one of the better ones.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.760
 No, they should not have put the listener though, I just hope it does have a slight

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.760
 sinisterism to it.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760
 Okay, I accept that.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.760
 What's his name?

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.760
 What's his address?

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.760
 Tony, Tony, Tony.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.760
 Mello.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.760
 Tony, look out of your window, Tony.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.760
 You'll see James.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.760
 No, higher, higher.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.760
 We've got 116 feet.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.760
 Right.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:24.440
 Sean Jake's rides in with some notes about sledging.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.440
 Okay.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.040
 And he says, in particular, it's very good in darts, sledging, because you need a lot

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.040
 of mind games.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040
 Oh yeah.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.840
 He says the best of this was the late great Eric Bristow, who once asked Rod Harrington

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.440
 if he took a breath before he threw a dart.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.000
 This completely put Rod off with the whole game against Eric because he was only focused

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.320
 on his breath pattern.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.320
 That's brilliant.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.320
 Look at that.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.320
 Sure.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320
 Yeah.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.000
 So, Dan, do you breathe in before you host an episode of Fish?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.200
 I'll think about that later today.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.600
 No, I don't say that to me.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.840
 I've got like quite bad breathing problems at the moment, and now I'm actually thinking

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.440
 about my breathing all the time, and now I realise I haven't breathed for about 35 seconds.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.440
 There we go.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.440
 And now I'm really worried about that.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.440
 James, you're going blue.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.440
 You're going blue.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.960
 Do you breathe before you're...

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.960
 Bye.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.000
 Yeah, you've got to have a breath in to tackle that.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 That's a big moment.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.840
 You know, it doesn't actually breathe in before he dives into the pool.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.720
 Yeah, I guess that's the question.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.720
 You must do.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.800
 Speaking about putting people off, did you see recently someone message us saying that

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.840
 Greg Jenner, our friend, historian and podcaster, also does a bye at the end of his show.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.840
 Oh, yes.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.840
 Oh.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.480
 So, does that put pressure on you, Andy, for your buys?

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.480
 Yeah, it's got to be good.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.480
 It's got to be better.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.480
 Better than Jenner.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.480
 Yeah.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.760
 It sounds like he's had more practice because we've only been doing drop of the line in

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.760
 what, a few months?

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.760
 Six months?

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.400
 I guess, are they suggesting that we're plagiarising?

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.160
 Is that so much Greg's thing?

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.160
 I hadn't got that.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.000
 He's the only person who's allowed to say bye.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.440
 I suppose in that iconic, his iconic bye.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.960
 I mean, if, you know, if this wasn't behind the paywall would be being more trouble when

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.960
 this was exposed to the public.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.040
 If this had any listeners at all, we'd be screwed, but as it is, it's just you and

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.040
 me, guys.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.040
 At least two.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.040
 Right.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.040
 Here's James O'Brien.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.040
 I don't think that one.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.200
 I enjoy listening to the podcast on my walk, on his walk.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.560
 However, today I had a tedious task to perform at home and put the latest episode on my phone

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560
 speaker.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.800
 I stepped out of the room for a minute to get something, whereupon I received some notifications

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.800
 on my smartwatch from Amazon regarding some orders added to my basket.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.480
 I was very confused as I hadn't ordered anything.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.900
 When I checked the Amazon app, it was all fish-related goodies.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.120
 My first thought was that it was a new form of Amazon-induced Orwellian overreach trying

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.200
 to flog me stuff.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.600
 I amended the order as I already have Andrew's books.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.120
 The brackets are great, by the way.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.120
 Thank you.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.120
 Oh, my Jesus.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.120
 Sorry.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.120
 Could you not think of a better name than James O'Brien?

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.120
 Were you literally just scrolling through Twitter and you're like, "I need a fake name."

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.280
 James, you're going to want to be in on this because I left James and Anna's pre-order

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.040
 there, as I didn't know about that, and it looks interesting.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.040
 How interesting.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.540
 I didn't even know it's available on pre-order.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.540
 Yes.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.540
 I felt shamelessly manipulated.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.920
 Everything to play for, the QI Book of Spots.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.640
 Well, he doesn't know what it's called.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.920
 Yes, I felt shamelessly manipulated into buying James and Anna's book, but I regained some

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.120
 agency by not buying Dan's.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:29.220
 Well, fuck you, James O'Brien.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.040
 It wasn't until I got back into the room and rewound the podcast where I'd left that I

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.920
 discovered the awful truth.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.960
 It wasn't a shadowy global conspiracy penetrating our lives.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.120
 It was the elves themselves, well-played elves.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.300
 I have since disabled that feature on Alexa.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:46.580
 Also, this is the closer from James, and I've also taken a long hard look at myself regarding

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.620
 buying Tat from Amazon.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.780
 So basically, we said Alexa by what's your book called?

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.740
 The Theory of Everything Else, James, not you, this guy.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.660
 So we said Alexa by The Theory of Everything Else by Dan Schreiber with the hope that people

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.220
 might accidentally buy it.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.220
 And it did it.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.060
 And you went into the top ten on Amazon.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.060
 Yeah.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.900
 I was thinking it was due to your amazing publicity push, but maybe it was just this.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:19.860
 I didn't go into the top ten on Amazon with the sanctuary.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.640
 Right, let's, okay, right.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.600
 I think, okay, new section, plug corner.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.760
 We'll go into the corner for a minute, and then we have to come out.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.880
 Let's try to go down for next time.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.880
 Plug corner.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.880
 Right, plug corner.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.880
 All right.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.340
 I've got another, get yourself off the hook, but this time for Dan, not James.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.340
 Okay.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.340
 Okay.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.340
 From Scott Mason.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.340
 Yeah.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.340
 Incorrect on Trash Talk is the subject.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.340
 Okay.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.460
 Here is where Coby, how my ass tastes originated from.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.460
 Okay.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.180
 Can you explain that?

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.900
 Shaquille O'Neal and Coby Bryant, it's an example of Trash Talking.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:01.980
 It was from a book where they said that Coby, it's rare for Trash Talk to come from a book

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:02.980
 in the air.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.560
 The Oxford Dictionary of Insulting Quotations.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:13.040
 That was a book on MBA, and there's an example where Coby and Shaq were both known for, particularly

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.320
 Coby for his Trash Talking, his legend.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.000
 And I can't remember the exact line, but it's something like, "You'll be tasting my

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 ass."

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.400
 And the idea is he's jumping so high, doing his slam dunk.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.400
 Yeah.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.600
 Thor is running away from him, and he's chasing his tail, something, something where his,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.180
 you know, Shaq's very tall anyway, you know, his ass is very high.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.020
 You'd have to go on a tall unicycle to taste that ass.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.020
 Absolutely.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.420
 Well, anyways, Scott sent a link to a YouTube video, which I couldn't watch because I was

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:51.000
 in the library when I got this, and they frown on you playing aggressive Trash Talk out loud.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.740
 But the footage shows Shaquille O'Neal taking the mic at a New York club last night, unleashing

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.420
 a freestyle verbal assault directed at his arch enemy, Coby Bryant, blaming his former

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.920
 teammate for ruining his marriage and imploring him to tell me how my ass tastes.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.920
 Okay.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.640
 And what's the problem?

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.120
 He's saying it's not on the court.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.120
 I think it was a fractional difference of origin story.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.960
 It might, I mean, the story I read was it was on the court.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.760
 So he might have said, you know, that might be his classic line that he says a bunch of

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.760
 times.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.760
 Yeah.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.760
 I think jury's out.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.760
 Okay.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.760
 Dan, sorry, can you take this with a bit more humility, please?

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.160
 Coby Bryant named after the beef, Coby Beef.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160
 That's right.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.820
 This is about him having beef with Shaquille O'Neal.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.820
 That's right.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.160
 But they were buddies at the end.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.160
 Right.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.160
 Yeah.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.300
 Just, just like that article suggests that he broke up my marriage.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.300
 We're not friends.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.300
 They were, they were good friends.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.460
 They managed to make friends after one of them broke up the other's marriage.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.700
 I think everyone's marriage got broken up by each other.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.460
 It's a, that's MBA for you.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.460
 Oh yeah.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.540
 It's a spicy, spicy land.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.540
 A spicy meat.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.540
 Yeah.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.540
 Spicy beef.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.540
 Spicy Coby.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.540
 Half time.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.540
 Half time.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.540
 Yes.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.540
 Okay.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.540
 Well, I have just been on holiday.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.540
 Yeah.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:06.660
 To the, to Helsinki and Tallinn in Estonia and I bought a gift for one of you.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.660
 Is this a new feature?

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.800
 Like, this, is this a halftime, like at a basketball match, you'd have a halftime show.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.540
 I'm really happy for this to be a regular feature, but I will have to go on holiday

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.540
 every two weeks.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.020
 Let me show you what it is.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.020
 What is it?

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.020
 What would be able to tell?

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.460
 You'll be able to tell as soon as I get it out who it's for.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.460
 It's definitely for Andy.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.460
 Wow.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.860
 So can you explain what it is, Dan?

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.700
 Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a black box.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.740
 Oh, it's chocolate, it looks like, but it looks like it's moss or some sort of...

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.700
 It's chocolate, it's chocolate, but it's got sort of moss growing through it.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.700
 Yeah.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:41.700
 I believe it has moss on the inside.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.700
 Oh my God.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.140
 It's finlandish or Finnish as they sometimes say.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.140
 Chocolate covered moss.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.300
 Oh my God.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.300
 Very happy for that to be for you, Andy.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.340
 Oh, it smells so...

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.740
 Smells chocolaty, but I bet it'll taste mossy.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.740
 The perfect result.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.740
 That's amazing.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.740
 That smells great.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.740
 Thank you.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.780
 I think it's reindeer algae, but then in brackets it says, or moss.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.940
 That's nice, isn't it?

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.940
 It's safe to eat.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.940
 Wow.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:17.140
 Yeah, it is safe to eat, it's, it's, yeah, available to tourists if you visit Finland.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.940
 By the 23rd of the 11th.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:20.940
 Great.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.940
 Easy.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:22.940
 Yeah.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.300
 You can't re-gift it over Christmas though.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.300
 Oh no.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.940
 As if I would re-gift it, so that's lovely.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:29.940
 Thank you so much.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.940
 That's very cool.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.940
 I'm really excited.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.940
 I'm really excited about that.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.940
 Thank you, James.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.940
 Cool packaging as well, right?

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:35.940
 Yeah, great packaging.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.940
 Like it looks like a, what was the thing that you were doing?

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:37.940
 A terrarium, is it called?

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.940
 I bought a terrarium.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.940
 Yeah, it kind of looks like that.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.940
 It looks like a, because it's a see-through plastic with, yeah, it looks like a little...

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.940
 Yeah, if you had like little sort of ants living in there, they would have a whale of

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:47.940
 a time, wouldn't they?

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:48.940
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.740
 I bought a terrarium tool kit the other day.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:52.740
 Great.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.820
 It was curved-handled scissors, and that was curved-bladed scissors for pruning.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.820
 Okay.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:58.820
 Lovely.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:59.820
 Next email.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.660
 We got a nice email from Raphael Alvarez.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:08.520
 It comes with a picture, which I don't have my screen open, so I can't show you now, but

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.540
 wanted to share this massive apple I saw at my local fruit stand.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.140
 Oh, I saw that picture.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.260
 Which reminded me of the one James mentioned he saw at the offices of We Buy Any Card.com.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.260
 Did you send us that?

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.260
 You did.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.260
 How did I find that?

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.260
 Yeah, you forwarded it, because I saw that.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.260
 I think so.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.140
 It's pretty easy to tell from the picture.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.140
 It's pretty easy to tell.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.140
 It's a big apple.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.140
 But it seemed like it was the size of a baby's head.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.540
 I wanted to get more pictures, but preferred not to hold up the line.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.540
 I don't think we needed more pictures.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.500
 I mean, the one you sent is powerful.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:41.020
 I think his mistake was taking the photo, because in my head, it just gets bigger with

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.020
 every telling.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.020
 Yeah.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.020
 Yeah.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.540
 You know, it's just, in my head, it's the biggest apple that's ever existed.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.540
 It's possibly, you know, like Cinderella could have gone to the ball in it if she didn't

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.540
 have a pumpkin.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:51.540
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.540
 Like a giant apple.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.540
 Exactly.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.540
 Yeah.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:55.540
 That's good.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.860
 And I think, probably, if I ever went back now to the offices of Weebuyer at AnyCart.com,

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.380
 then I might be disappointed by how big the apple was.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.380
 Do you think it's still there?

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.380
 Of course.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.380
 Of course it's still there.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.380
 Of course it's still there.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.380
 Some of it will be.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.820
 And Apple that big won't go off for years, for like, yeah.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.300
 There is a type of apple that doesn't go off for like four months at a time, like there's

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.740
 a special type of apple.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.740
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.740
 Irradiated.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.740
 I think that's the cut.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.740
 That is the cut.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.740
 Yeah, they do.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.740
 Don't they?

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.740
 No, they do do that.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.020
 But there's like a special species that doesn't go off.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.020
 Really?

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:31.340
 And they think that it might give the secret of everlasting life like a special apple.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.340
 That's so cool.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.340
 Is it?

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.340
 Yeah.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.340
 I can't remember what it's called.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.460
 Do they specifically breed it to give to like the U.S. Marines so that they can have

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.860
 an apple even after three months living in some reeds or whatever?

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.340
 No, they, it's, I think it's just a long lasting apple.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.700
 And they think whenever anything's long lasting in nature, they think maybe this will be the

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.980
 solution of everlasting life and it very rarely is.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.980
 Yeah.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:53.980
 Yeah.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:59.180
 Well, if it gets you four extra months, yeah, but yeah, this, this apple, I would say from

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.940
 the image that you sent, Andy, it was a similar size to the, to the one the guy sent.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.900
 That is very, thank you, both James and Raphael for sort of agreeing that you've both seen

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.900
 very big apples.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.900
 Well, mine was slightly bigger.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:11.900
 Oh, sorry.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:18.220
 But I say about the same size, you know, pure politeness, sorry Raphael crushed.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:24.340
 We've had a lovely bit of bonus information, which I think is, is not the, I'm actually

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.340
 of the week because it's just a, this is a brilliant fact.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.340
 We talked about Dallas.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.340
 Yes.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.340
 And.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.340
 Shut J.R.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.340
 Yeah.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.820
 And so Peter Drake writes episode 479 discusses the TV show Dallas writing itself into a

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.180
 corner and then being renewed for another season, which happened.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.180
 Yeah.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:43.340
 Surely the greatest example of this is Sledgehammer, which I haven't ever seen.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.340
 Oh, I have.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.340
 I used to love that show.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.340
 Okay.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.340
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.340
 Thanks for watching.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.340
 Sledgehammer exclamation mark is the title of the show.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.340
 Brilliant.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.060
 The name of the detective, which was to end with the eponymous detective trying to defuse

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.620
 a nuclear warhead after emitting his catchphrase, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:07.240
 He accidentally detonates the bomb vaporizing San Francisco.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:15.660
 When the show was then renewed, is it like a post-apocalyptic, solving crimes, but they're

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.940
 all mutant crimes.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:18.940
 Yeah.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.020
 No, the only solution was to proclaim the subsequent episodes were set five years before.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.020
 Okay.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.980
 I would have thought like, you know, a detective show where they're all cockroaches.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:28.980
 Yeah.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.980
 So good.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:30.980
 Yeah.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.980
 I mean, I would would watch.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.980
 What an ending to Sledgehammer.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.740
 I have the feeling that Sledgehammer was like a, trying to be like a naked gun, like it

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.980
 was quite a funny show.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.980
 That's my memory of it.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:39.980
 It sounds funny.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:40.980
 Yeah.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.480
 His catchphrase is trust me, I know what I'm doing.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.480
 Yeah.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.480
 And then that happens.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.480
 Yeah.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.940
 There's a little quiz.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.940
 This is a fun thing.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:48.940
 Okay.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:49.940
 So Blade Fuller.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:50.940
 Great name.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.940
 What's the name?

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:52.940
 Yeah.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:53.940
 Right.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.860
 How far from Australia to Papua New Guinea?

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.860
 Oh.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:58.860
 Right?

00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.860
 Yeah.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.860
 What's the shortest distance between Australia and Papua New Guinea?

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.860
 Okay.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.860
 Well.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.100
 So Dan's, and this is, so Dan, maybe, well, both take a guess.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.500
 Well, Dan is from Australia.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.500
 Exactly.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.500
 Exactly.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.500
 So he should know this.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.500
 Oh, before giving away the answer, make Dan guess.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.500
 Blade rights.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.500
 Blade.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.500
 Yeah.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.360
 He's a token Australian on the show.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.360
 Ouch.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.360
 Oh, God.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:22.400
 My guess, well, my first guess while Dan's thinking, just looking at a map, is that they're

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.440
 going to be about 500 miles apart.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.940
 Now I imagine there's probably some island like Christmas Island or something, which

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:36.320
 is half Australia and half Papua, and so actually you can just walk from one to the

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.320
 other.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.320
 That's a really good point.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.320
 Yeah.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.320
 Because you'll guess 500 miles or nothing.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.320
 Yeah.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320
 It's important.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.320
 Somewhere between these two.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.320
 500 miles, I think.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.260
 Like, genuinely, I would say that's about what it is.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.260
 I think that's probably right.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.940
 There's probably an embassy in Sydney, which you can technically be on the last it doesn't

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.940
 count.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.440
 I'm going to say four hour flight.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.920
 Oh, thank you so much.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.920
 Thank you so much.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:01.480
 Is it in the Wright Brothers plane, or is it in a con card?

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.360
 It's the most unhelpful thing you could possibly say.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.500
 Or is it a four hour flight of a mosquito, a bird, like a drifting cormorant?

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.860
 We're going to say, I could say classic 747 kind of airliner.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.860
 Four hours.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:17.860
 Four hours.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.180
 That would get you to North Africa, I would say, in four hours.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.180
 Or from Australia.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.400
 Not from the UK, but as an equivalent distance.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.400
 Right.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:34.380
 What a messed up way of doing it, I was like, well, James, just give me the outro in 500

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.380
 miles.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.380
 Thank you, James.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.380
 Self ship, blade, whatever your name is.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:41.420
 Well, is it 500 miles or four hours in a 747?

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.860
 What a stupid, come at me with those questions, you're going to get that.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.140
 Two and a half acres, how can I say?

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.340
 Blade continues.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.340
 Did he get it?

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.340
 I can tell you he didn't, blade.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.220
 Most people I asked opted for answers around 100 kilometers, as they could picture Australia's

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.560
 northern tip being quite close.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.340
 But the actual answer is much less than that, in fact, it is less than four kilometers.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:06.500
 And it's exactly because of what James said, there is an island, 3.75 kilometers south

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.220
 of Papua New Guinea, called Saibai Island, which is Orsay Bay, which is technically Australian

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:19.380
 territory, part of the territory of Queensland, because they took it over to do some sea cucumber

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.380
 fishing.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.380
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.380
 Well, that was a big deal, wasn't it?

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.380
 Sea cucumbers.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.380
 Yeah.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.380
 So it's swimming distance.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.140
 You could, it says practically swimming distance, blade says.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.140
 Yeah.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.780
 I think at four kilometers you could swim, depending on what's on the order.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.780
 Yeah.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.020
 Personally speaking, I might struggle, but yeah.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.020
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.020
 I meant one.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.020
 I didn't mean me.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.020
 Anyway.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.020
 So thank you very much, Blade.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.020
 That was a great quiz.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.020
 How about this?

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.020
 Yeah.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.020
 Hannah Vax.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.020
 Vax?

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.020
 Right.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.020
 How do you spell that?

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.020
 W-A-C-H-S.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.020
 Okay.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.020
 So I thought Vax.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.020
 Vax.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.020
 We're not anti-Vaxers here.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.020
 Far from it.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.020
 Sorry, Hannah.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.020
 But she's never heard that before.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.020
 Yeah.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.020
 Sorry.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.020
 God.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.020
 Sorry, Hannah.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.020
 Sorry.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.020
 And she's written all the way from L.A. as well.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.020
 Really?

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.020
 Yeah.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.020
 Let's show some respect.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.020
 Right.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:11.020
 Hannah writes, "As always, I enjoyed the most recent episode, but I must argue with the

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:17.020
 assertion that the fact about Alan Thicke writing the different strokes theme is the

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.020
 most trivial trivia ever."

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.020
 Uh-huh.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.020
 "I would wager that for Americans aged 40 to 60..."

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.020
 Who was that, say?

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.020
 Alan?

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.020
 Alan Thicke.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.020
 So that feels like a U-fact.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.020
 Robin Thicke.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.020
 Who's Robin Thicke?

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.020
 Robin Thicke.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.020
 Sorry, Robin Thicke.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.020
 Oh, Robin Thicke.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.020
 Oh, right, Robin.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.020
 Oh, Alan Thicke.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.020
 Alan Thicke.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.020
 The guy who wrote the different strokes theme.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.020
 Alan Thicke, yeah.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.020
 Sorry.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.020
 Of course.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:45.020
 "I would wager that for Americans aged 40 to 60, Alan Thicke is the main original Thicke

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.020
 with Robin being a lesser-known spinoff."

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.020
 Right.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.020
 Yeah.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.020
 Now, here's when we get quite into the weeds.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.020
 Thicke the Elder.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.020
 Like, plenty of the Elder.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:22:00.260
 "Played the dad on the very popular late '80s sitcoms, Growing Pains, which is what Kirk

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:04.260
 Cameron was known for before he got into super Christian movies about the rapture."

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.260
 Okay.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:09.260
 "He also wrote the theme tune to 'The Facts of Life,' which may be even more beloved

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:10.660
 than that of different strokes."

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.660
 Yeah.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:16.660
 I must say I had read all that stuff about Alan Thicke, but the difference-

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:17.660
 What?

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.660
 I did not read it.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.660
 I did not!

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.900
 Different strokes was a show that I'd heard of, and the others I hadn't really heard of.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:30.900
 Sorry, that's the Thicke alarm going off.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.900
 Okay, great.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.900
 No, thanks for the inter-

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:33.900
 Thanks.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:39.900
 If you at home have any interest, any facts about any of the Thicke family, then-

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.900
 Oh, please.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.900
 Do please send in for the Thicke corner.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:51.100
 Yeah, podcast@qo.com, and just put Thicke in the subject line, and it'll bump it up to

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.100
 the top of the inbox, basically.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.100
 I'll set up a filter.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.100
 We-

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.100
 Oh, hey, I've got a telling off that's only fair.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.100
 Like, I've given you both a drumming.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.100
 Matthew McKenzie says, "Love the podcast, but-"

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:11.100
 You didn't tell me how good your novels were!

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:31.100
 And that's from Laura Kunzberg.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:38.100
 Matthew writes, Matthew writes, "Love the podcast, but-"

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.100
 This is great.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:48.100
 But my mother died quite recently.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:55.100
 It's quite a serious and dry point.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.100
 It's quite a dry point.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:02.100
 Love the podcast, but during episode 480, when you were talking about Thatched Roofs and

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:07.860
 what the UK's famous for, you mentioned that the UK is not a big player in microchips.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.860
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:13.540
 Okay, in fact, ARM Limited, based in Cambridge, is the company responsible for designing the

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.940
 microchips in most of the world's smartphones.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:16.940
 You know what?

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.860
 The reason I said that is because it had been in the news that week, haven't it?

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:20.860
 No, I think I said it.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.860
 I think I said that we're not a big player in the microchip scene.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:24.860
 That was my fault.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.860
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.900
 But I sort of meant, "Oh, are we not investing enough in it now?"

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.380
 But actually, I completely hold my hands up.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.860
 I was speaking without full authority on that.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.580
 Sorry, Matthew.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:37.460
 And let the record stand, big microchip player.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.460
 Great.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.460
 Yeah.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.460
 Okay.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.460
 Bye.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.460
 Oh, Greg?

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.460
 Is that you?

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.460
 No.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.460
 Oh, sorry.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.460
 No.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.460
 No, it's Andy here.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.460
 So, Andy.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:57.980
 Thanks everybody for listening to Drop As Alive.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.700
 We hope you've enjoyed it.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:06.900
 And if you would like to be on it, then you just have to email podcast@qi.com with something

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:14.260
 sufficiently amusing or outrageous or, you know, correct, like pick us up on real mistakes.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:18.140
 Don't just write it on spurious grounds about things that we might not have said for editorial

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:19.140
 reasons, you know.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.060
 We'll give it a go actually, see, because I read everything.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:26.020
 So anyway, yeah, podcast@qi.com will be back in months time with another one of these and

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.300
 in two weeks with a different thing altogether.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.300
 Okay.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:29.300
 Bye.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.300
 Bye.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.300
 Bye.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:31.300
 Bye.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.300
 Bye.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.300
 Bye.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:33.300
 Bye.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.300
 Bye.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:34.300
 Bye.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.300
 Bye.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:35.300
 Bye.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.880
 (upbeat music)

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.460
 (upbeat music)
