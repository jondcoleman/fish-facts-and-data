00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show we wanted to introduce our"
00:00:06,00:00:11,special guest. She has been on the show once before and she was so great that we thought
00:00:11,00:00:16,"we had to have her back. It is the brilliant Sophie Duker. If you don't know Sophie already,"
00:00:16,00:00:21,"if you didn't listen to the episode she was already on, if you haven't seen her on Taskmaster,"
00:00:21,00:00:25,"she is a fantastic stand-up, she's really brilliant and you're about to hear that on"
00:00:25,00:00:30,"the show. So there's no need for further evidence of it really, but if once you've heard this show"
00:00:30,00:00:36,"you would like to see or hear a little bit more of Sophie's comedy, as you will, there are a"
00:00:36,00:00:41,"couple of ways to do that. So firstly she had a tour earlier this year which was called ""Hag""."
00:00:41,00:00:46,"That tour sold out and also is in the past so it's impossible to see it, but there are new"
00:00:46,00:00:53,"dates added to that tour. They're all on her website which is SophieDuker.com, a very Ronsiol"
00:00:53,00:00:57,"website there, but it does contain those dates so that's why you want to visit there. The other"
00:00:57,00:01:03,thing she's doing soon is that on the 26th of October this year she is hosting a one-off edition
00:01:03,00:01:09,"mega show at Hackney Empire in London. It's a show she's done loads of times before, it's called"
00:01:09,00:01:13,"""Wacky Racists"", but this one is going to be a bigger and better edition than ever. There are"
00:01:13,00:01:17,"going to be all-star guests, there are going to be stand-ups, there are going to be songs,"
00:01:17,00:01:21,"there are going to be stupid games, you name it, it will be there. It's going to be great fun."
00:01:21,00:01:25,"That's it for this introduction, I hope you've enjoyed it, but not as much as I hope you enjoy"
00:01:25,00:01:27,the show itself. On with the show.
00:01:27,00:01:49,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming"
00:01:49,00:01:57,"to you live from the Soho Theatre in London. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with"
00:01:57,00:02:02,"James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Sophie Juker and once again we have gathered around the"
00:02:02,00:02:07,microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order
00:02:07,00:02:15,"here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Sophie. What an honour. Oh, oh you're welcome."
00:02:15,00:02:24,"My fact is, Barbie, the lady of the moment, was based on a high-end German cool girl."
00:02:24,00:02:29,"That's right, there's a sex worker in your child's bedroom."
00:02:29,00:02:35,"That little freesong, that was 150 people just being slightly titillated by that thing."
00:02:35,00:02:42,"And shocked. Yes, shocked as well. She's based on a different doll, is Barbie. Picture the scene,"
00:02:43,00:02:49,"it's 1956. Cool. Your Ruth Handler, the inventor of Barbie. My mum was born 1956 and now I've"
00:02:49,00:02:57,got my mum in my head which might make this next bit difficult. It will. You're there with your mum.
00:02:57,00:03:04,It's pretty sexy and in the window. Dan's mum has just been born. Oh sorry.
00:03:07,00:03:15,"Like back to the future. This is way, way beyond. Your mum's been born, she's in a crib somewhere,"
00:03:15,00:03:23,"she's not involved. Cool. You are the doll, it doesn't matter who you are. It's 1956,"
00:03:23,00:03:30,there's a doll in a window. The doll is Bild Lilly. Bild is a German tabloid and Lilly is the doll that
00:03:30,00:03:36,"is sold in association with that tabloid and she was sort of a sexy, flusy. And that is what Barbie"
00:03:36,00:03:43,"is based on. When Ruth Handler saw Lilly in the window, she said and I quote, ""I didn't know then"
00:03:43,00:03:49,"who Lilly was. I saw only an adult-shaped body that I had been trying to describe for years,"
00:03:49,00:03:56,"which I love because presumably all around her were adults."" But I would say no adults in the"
00:03:56,00:04:02,"same shape as Barbie though. No, true. She's got weird proportions. And dolls, dolls were for children"
00:04:02,00:04:06,"and they were of children, weren't they, at the time? Yeah, that was the revolutionary thing."
00:04:06,00:04:11,"If anyone's seen the Barbie movie, which we are not promoting because their budget is big enough,"
00:04:11,00:04:18,"but if you've seen the Barbie movie, you'll see that a lot of dolls for kids were just of kids,"
00:04:18,00:04:24,"but Barbie was this like sexy, well not sexy, Barbie's not sexy, but she was kind of like older,"
00:04:24,00:04:30,mature. Yeah. I read there was a journalist from the New Yorker magazine called Ariel Levy who
00:04:30,00:04:37,"later referred to this as a sex doll, Lilly. Now, she was still only six inches high. Right, right."
00:04:37,00:04:41,"Oh, really? So, I don't know. I'd take some imagination to use that as a sex doll, I imagine."
00:04:41,00:04:46,"But they used to give it to people, like if you went on a stag do, you might get this"
00:04:46,00:04:52,"sexy doll, right? Or they would, some men would hang it on their windscreen of their car and stuff"
00:04:52,00:04:55,"like that. It's just like a sexy thing. Because that's what you do with your sex toys, you put them."
00:04:57,00:05:02,"Barbie gets a lot of stick for being regressive, but I think Ruth Handler was very progressive"
00:05:02,00:05:07,"and she was a very, she was an ambitious businesswoman. It was her and her husband,"
00:05:07,00:05:10,Elliot. They founded the company together. They made all the decisions about it. And I think the
00:05:10,00:05:18,"idea was that Barbie would never get married. Barbie was able to, it was to expand girls imaginations"
00:05:18,00:05:22,about what they could do and that their imaginations should extend beyond marriage and motherhood is
00:05:22,00:05:27,"the basic idea. Okay, right. Yeah, so in that sense, she did start as a fashion model and then"
00:05:27,00:05:33,"became a fashion editor the next year and then a fashion designer, but it's maybe career progression."
00:05:33,00:05:38,"Okay, Barbie did do a lot of stuff other than that. She went to space before Matt even went to"
00:05:38,00:05:41,"the moon. There was astronaut Barbie. Four years before Matt went to the moon, there was astronaut"
00:05:41,00:05:45,"Barbie. Okay, but we did go to space before we went to the moon, just not to... Yeah, okay, so."
00:05:47,00:05:53,"Before... Not to shit on that. Yeah, okay. Has Barbie been to the moon? Before we could even have"
00:05:53,00:05:59,"bank accounts. Oh, yeah. Barbie bought her first dream house. Oh, okay. Yeah, in 1962 she bought the"
00:05:59,00:06:05,"dream house. Wow. With whose money? Ken's. Yes, Ken's right. That's amazing. I like as well,"
00:06:05,00:06:09,"just speaking of astronauts, so the fact that Barbie was designed by a guy called Jack Ryan,"
00:06:09,00:06:15,"at least the physical making of Barbie was. And he was a guy who is, he was an engineer for the"
00:06:15,00:06:20,"Pentagon. He made missiles. So he was, yeah, he was someone who's had a whole different career,"
00:06:20,00:06:25,"and then Mattel hired him. And he worked out amazing things, like the fact that she had a"
00:06:25,00:06:29,"twistable waist, that was a new innovation to toys. And I don't know if you remember this, and I"
00:06:29,00:06:33,"very much remember this, the clickable knees of Barbie. How do you remember this? Because I used"
00:06:33,00:06:42,"to bring to school every day a disembodied leg of Barbie with me. Mr. Shriver, Mrs. Shriver, come in."
00:06:42,00:06:50,"Yeah, it's nothing bad. So I used to, when I was younger, and I still kind of do, and I should"
00:06:50,00:06:53,"have a Barbie leg on me again, actually, and this is advice for everyone listening."
00:06:53,00:06:58,"I click my fingers a lot, obsessively click my fingers, and I needed something to stop me. And"
00:06:58,00:07:03,the clickable leg of a Barbie gives you the same sensation as clicking your own finger. So I used
00:07:03,00:07:08,"to sit in class. So you probably disembodied leg. Yeah, I just used to sit clicking Barbie's leg over"
00:07:08,00:07:13,and over in school. And your sister had to bring in a Barbie with at least one of its legs missing.
00:07:13,00:07:16,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, she wasn't too happy about that. But I genuinely tried out if you've got"
00:07:16,00:07:21,a problem with clicking your fingers. Okay. Pretty. But I also think it's really interesting. I didn't
00:07:21,00:07:25,know that the guy that designed Barbie was a missiles designer because he actually made some
00:07:25,00:07:30,"quite big, that well Mattel made some quite big changes to Barbie when they changed her from"
00:07:30,00:07:35,the original prototype of Bill D'Lilli and the model which Mattel then bought up. They softened
00:07:35,00:07:41,"her eyebrows, relaxed her lips, upgraded her plastic and whited her skin. Okay."
00:07:41,00:07:44,"Well, we don't know what she could have been green."
00:07:44,00:07:51,And at one point the nipples and breasts of an early prototype were daintily filed off.
00:07:51,00:08:00,"Oh, can you daintily file nipples? It's a more difficult process than that. But related to that,"
00:08:00,00:08:05,"of course, is Ken's bulge. Oh, yeah. Which I haven't seen the movie, but I believe they reference"
00:08:05,00:08:12,"in the movie. And Ruth Handler, who created Barbie, she wanted Ken to have a proper bulge in his groin."
00:08:12,00:08:17,"And the people at Mattel were having none of it. They thought that no mother would buy a doll,"
00:08:17,00:08:22,which had a bulge in its groin. And this became a really big argument. They brought in a Freudian
00:08:22,00:08:27,"psychologist to ask them what to do. And he said, oh, yeah, well, all the girls are just going to"
00:08:27,00:08:31,"want to undress Ken. So, you know, you're going to have to think about it. You're going to have to"
00:08:31,00:08:34,do something. What were they thinking when they brought in a Freudian psychologist?
00:08:34,00:08:39,"Completely find a normal. Yeah, don't worry about it. Yeah, bringing a leg of a Barbie in school,"
00:08:39,00:08:45,completely normal. It's normal to fancy your mum when she's just born. Absolutely.
00:08:45,00:08:53,"But they came up with a solution, which was they were going to mold the swimsuit directly onto Ken."
00:08:53,00:08:58,So you wouldn't be able to get the swimsuit off. Did they do that? And they were going to put a very
00:08:58,00:09:02,"slight bump in the groin. So just enough that would keep Ruth happy, but not enough that would scare"
00:09:02,00:09:10,people off. But the problem was that it all came down to finance in the end. So putting the shots
00:09:10,00:09:16,"up, molding the shots on cost a couple of cents. Putting the extra lump on was about half a cent"
00:09:16,00:09:20,"worth of plastic. And they decided over the millions that they were going to make, it wasn't"
00:09:20,00:09:25,worth it to do it. And so that's why he ended up with the bulge. Yeah. Wow. That's a little bulge.
00:09:25,00:09:30,Wow. Yeah. And we were talking about Barbies in space earlier. Yeah. Something about sex dolls in
00:09:30,00:09:37,"space. The Russian cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, he spent the record amount of time on the MIR"
00:09:37,00:09:43,"space station. And according to him, the Russian government offered him a sex doll for his time"
00:09:43,00:09:48,"on the MIR. Oh, wow. Wait, what was the record? Do you know the record time? 14 months he was there."
00:09:48,00:09:56,Long time. It's a long time without a sex doll. Long time. Yep. But Polyakov decided that he
00:09:56,00:10:02,wouldn't take the sex doll onto MIR. Can you guess why he decided not to? Because it's so embarrassing.
00:10:02,00:10:08,"Because there's no one up. No, it's not like the aliens are going to turn up and go, what's this?"
00:10:08,00:10:12,"Cosmonaut Polyakov, we're getting your broadcast louder. Wait, is there an extra astronaut floating"
00:10:12,00:10:19,"past you? No, that wasn't it. Cos he was married. Oh, he was married actually, but that wasn't,"
00:10:19,00:10:25,"I guess it was kind of the reason. He decided that if he started using the sex doll in space,"
00:10:25,00:10:30,he might get so used to it that he wouldn't be able to give it up when he got back down to Earth.
00:10:30,00:10:37,"Right. Whereas on Earth, you do, is it different in space to sleep? I suppose you're lonely."
00:10:37,00:10:41,You might form an attachment like Tom Hanks and Wilson. Exactly. It goes away. Yeah. Did he have
00:10:41,00:10:51,"sex with that? It's implied. It's pretty heavily implied, guys. I don't know the Russian history"
00:10:51,00:10:59,"with sex dolls, but I did find out a fact when I was researching sex dolls, not for this, that in"
00:10:59,00:11:05,"2018, the mummified remains of a Russian man were found in his home and he was embracing"
00:11:05,00:11:13,"a sex doll on the sofa like in Pompeii. When I said like in Pompeii, I meant nothing like Pompeii."
00:11:13,00:11:20,We don't know that the sex dolls weren't in Pompeii because they would never have survived the
00:11:20,00:11:23,"volcano, would they? That's a good point. They didn't have the first things to go."
00:11:23,00:11:30,"Oh, we've got another Barbie thing. Can we talk about the Teen Talk Barbie?"
00:11:30,00:11:37,Okay. This was a later variable. So it was 1992. This was released. And each of the dolls sold
00:11:37,00:11:44,"said four of 270 possible phrases, right? So my doll might say four different things to your doll."
00:11:44,00:11:49,They worked out that they would have to sell 200 million of these things for there to be
00:11:49,00:11:53,"the odds that two of them would say exactly the same four phrases. That's a big selling point,"
00:11:53,00:11:58,obviously. But this was a controversial one because it's the one that said math class is tough
00:11:58,00:12:03,"as one of the phrases. And that's been slightly misremembered as her saying math is hard,"
00:12:03,00:12:05,"which she didn't say, but she did say math. It's pretty much the same thing."
00:12:05,00:12:11,"Yeah, it's pretty similar. And so this is prompted a bit of a pushback from people saying this isn't"
00:12:11,00:12:18,"a great message to say to girls. And in 1993, the next year, there was this group of performance"
00:12:18,00:12:22,"artists in Manhattan. They called themselves the Barbie Liberation Front, right? And this is"
00:12:22,00:12:28,what they did. This is so good. They bought a load of Teen Talk Barbies off the shelf.
00:12:28,00:12:34,"They also bought a load of G.I. Joe talking Duke dolls, right? They swapped the voice boxes"
00:12:34,00:12:42,"and then they put them back on the shelves. So you ended up with people who bought G.I. Joe dolls,"
00:12:42,00:12:51,"which said, will we ever have enough clothes or let's plan our dream wedding? And meanwhile,"
00:12:51,00:13:03,the matching Barbie was saying things like eat lead. That's so good. It is time for fact number
00:13:03,00:13:10,"two. And that is Andy. My fact is that Eastern screech owls have live in snakes as housekeepers,"
00:13:10,00:13:14,which their children sometimes eat. There's quite a bit going on here.
00:13:17,00:13:22,"There's a new book out, a new owl book out by Jennifer Ackerman and it's called What an Owl"
00:13:22,00:13:27,Knows as a Great Book. And she quotes this amazing study. There was a scientist called
00:13:27,00:13:32,"Frederick Gelbach who studied the Eastern screech owl, right? This is an owl. It lives in a nest."
00:13:32,00:13:37,"It lives in kind of Texas and thereabouts. Oh, it should be kind of called the Western"
00:13:37,00:13:43,"screech owl. They probably know what they're doing. Imagine they listen and they go, fuck,"
00:13:43,00:13:50,we're finally rumbled. We had like a hundred years of no one noticing. Murray?
00:13:50,00:13:56,And basically it turns out one in five nests of this Eastern screech owl contains a live snake
00:13:56,00:14:02,because the parents go and get food for the chicks and they bring back these snakes alive to the
00:14:02,00:14:10,"nest and they bring them back and some of them get eaten, a few do, but a lot burrow down into"
00:14:10,00:14:16,"the nest which is full of stuff that snakes love. You know, it's half-eaten bits of food and pellets"
00:14:16,00:14:24,and all sorts of fecal matter. And so a lot of insects turn up to eat those horrible things and
00:14:24,00:14:30,the snakes actually they like to eat the insects. So they tidy up the nest for the owls and it's
00:14:30,00:14:37,good because the owl chicks in snakes which contain a live housekeeping snake grow up bigger and
00:14:37,00:14:42,stronger and healthier than the chicks in the nest which don't contain a live snake. So it's
00:14:42,00:14:47,"actually a kind of, it's a mutual thing that's going on. Here's the thing though, just for"
00:14:47,00:14:52,"people's image at home of what's happening here. When we say snake, yeah, it's probably like a"
00:14:52,00:14:56,"cobra, right? Exactly. We're talking like, you know, they're twirling up and stuff. These things"
00:14:56,00:15:02,"are like smaller than worms, right? Like they're super tiny, exactly because there's a cool image"
00:15:02,00:15:07,"in your head of like a giant snake. Yeah, yeah, these are like little tiny little, oh yeah, but"
00:15:07,00:15:11,"they're snakes. They're small snakes. Oh, no, no, absolutely. Just, just. If you saw one, you would"
00:15:11,00:15:16,genuinely think it was a worm. The only difference is they have scales but the scales are almost
00:15:16,00:15:21,"impossible to see. It literally just looks like a worm. Yeah, but they're one cool thing. They eat a"
00:15:21,00:15:26,lot of other insects like they eat ants and stuff like that. But they like to eat baby ants and
00:15:26,00:15:30,they go into their ants' nests but obviously all the ants are going to attack them. And so what they
00:15:30,00:15:37,do is they secrete a noxious chemical and they shit at the same time and they mix these two
00:15:37,00:15:42,things up and they roll around in it so they're covered in noxious shit and then the ants will
00:15:42,00:15:47,"not go near them and then they can nom, nom, nom, nom, nom. Brilliant, Al. Yeah. I didn't look up any"
00:15:47,00:15:53,facts about the tiny snakes but I did think how do these Al babies get here? It's going to be through
00:15:53,00:16:01,Al's sex. Oh yeah. Very true. Yeah. Al's have sex in a really interesting way so like they don't
00:16:01,00:16:10,"have sex how we would imagine. Yeah. Yeah, sex. How are you imagining just for the... It's 1956."
00:16:10,00:16:16,"Do you imagine like a sort of... I'm, I'm, I'm finding a little better actually. I'm really"
00:16:16,00:16:21,trying to imagine. I'm thinking like doggy style because they can move their heads 360 degrees
00:16:21,00:16:26,"around. Just like, just like pet me. But I was thinking, yeah, that's going to be a scary moment."
00:16:26,00:16:31,What? Just when the head of your doggy style and suddenly the person's face is there again.
00:16:31,00:16:38,"It's basically like the exorcist, isn't it? I'd call an Uber at that point. It was so nice"
00:16:38,00:16:45,"meeting you. Blue eyes, I never properly noticed. I think you can have some respect. Call it hourly"
00:16:45,00:16:50,"style. Okay. Hourly style. Yeah, yeah. Oh my God. Hourly style sets. They only have sex in one"
00:16:50,00:16:54,position so you don't have to learn a whole bunch of different things. Okay. They've got a
00:16:54,00:16:59,cloaca which is an internal chamber with an opening and when it opens... An eternal chamber.
00:16:59,00:17:10,"Internal, not eternal. Quite a, quite a nice way of putting it, the eternal chamber. The eternal"
00:17:10,00:17:15,"chamber. Sure. It's a temporary chamber, opens up temporarily inside the chamber."
00:17:16,00:17:22,"It's either, depending on the sex of the owl, testes or ovaries. Wow. It's a rub of"
00:17:22,00:17:31,"requirement for the owl's jump. And when the owls want to get jiggy with it, get hourly with it,"
00:17:31,00:17:37,"they, the cloaca protrudes slightly and they rub them against each other. And that is owl sex."
00:17:37,00:17:43,"Like the sperm goes into the female cloaca, virtualizes the egg. Just one position. Okay."
00:17:43,00:17:49,"No kissing. Nice. No kissing. But it is called a cloacal kiss. So it's a kiss in a way. Oh,"
00:17:49,00:17:54,that is sweet. Do you know how eastern screech owls persuade their children to move away?
00:17:54,00:17:57,Do they explain to them how they had sex? Clearly.
00:17:57,00:18:08,"The eternal chamber is opening. Fly my children. No, they withhold food"
00:18:08,00:18:12,and then they remove any food they've stored in the nest. They basically empty the fridge
00:18:12,00:18:17,"and the cupboards. Oh, wow. Sorry. That's a great idea. And they also have a particular call,"
00:18:17,00:18:23,"which equates to go away. And it's all, obviously, it's good. It's to persuade them to, you know,"
00:18:23,00:18:27,move on to the next stage of their life. So it is a good thing. Right. That's right. But
00:18:27,00:18:31,"all owls have different tactics for getting their children to babies to fledge. Yeah, yeah."
00:18:31,00:18:37,"You know, so in, in sort of Western culture, we might have the boogie man as a terrifying"
00:18:37,00:18:42,thing for children. Do you know in Hungary what they have? What a Hungarian boogie man. Is it the
00:18:42,00:18:49,"boogie owl by any chance? It's the copper penis owl. Oh, gosh. Yeah. And if you're not careful,"
00:18:49,00:18:52,"copper penis owl is going to come for you. So what it is, if you picture a boogie man,"
00:18:52,00:18:58,"this is the same thing, but it's an owl with a copper penis. Is it copper colored or is it just"
00:18:58,00:19:04,metal? That's like metal. It's a copper penis. Is it oxidized? Is it? Yeah. But what's the threat
00:19:04,00:19:08,"if it's just a penis? Oh, he'll steal you. He'll steal you. Oh, he'll steal you. The detail of the"
00:19:08,00:19:13,"copper penis is not relevant, in fact. It's like, he just happens. It's noticeable. Like if you"
00:19:13,00:19:18,"described, described the owl that took your child, he could do the head thing and then there was this"
00:19:18,00:19:24,metal penis. It wasn't weird not to mention it in a way. Yeah. And it is like owls are associated
00:19:24,00:19:29,"with death around the world, I think. Quite often there'll be a superstition where if you see an owl,"
00:19:29,00:19:33,someone's going to die really soon. And there's quite a few theories as to why that happens. So
00:19:33,00:19:39,there was one guy who's an owl expert from South Africa who reckons that because people
00:19:39,00:19:42,quite often have heart attacks in the middle of the night and that's when owls are around.
00:19:42,00:19:46,Perhaps people have died and they've heard an owl and they associate them together.
00:19:46,00:19:52,There's another theory from Italy that you would put a body outside when someone's died and you
00:19:52,00:19:57,would put candles around it and the moths are attracted to the candles and then the owls are
00:19:57,00:20:02,attracted to the moths. So that's one possible version. And another version from India is that
00:20:02,00:20:08,possibly like in cemeteries you might leave food offerings for people and then you might get like
00:20:08,00:20:12,mice and rats coming for the food offerings and then the owls come for the mice or the rats.
00:20:12,00:20:16,Okay. So that's probably why all around the world people have this association.
00:20:16,00:20:20,It does. South Africa and they get a really bad rap in lots of places and they're not
00:20:20,00:20:24,beloved universally around the world and there are some places where they're still really ill
00:20:24,00:20:30,omany. In Ghana in the forest a lot of people associate them with witchcraft but it's actually
00:20:30,00:20:33,really important with the owl stay because otherwise the forests are full of rats.
00:20:33,00:20:38,Right. Exactly. There was a prediction in 2015 that wind turbines might all
00:20:38,00:20:46,be made like owls. To look like owls? To be given feathers. Because owls fly so quietly.
00:20:46,00:20:49,Because they do. It has to do with particular feathers they've got at the leading edge of
00:20:49,00:20:53,their wings. Right. And there was a suggestion why don't we just put feathers on all our wind
00:20:53,00:20:59,turbines so that they can turn faster and be quieter. And I don't want to live in a world
00:20:59,00:21:02,where we don't have feathery wind turbines. Yeah. That's cool. I just love it.
00:21:02,00:21:06,Not as part of research for this but I was reading today that we might be turning humans
00:21:06,00:21:14,into wind turbines soon. And go on. So it's a technology. I didn't fully read so I wasn't
00:21:14,00:21:18,prepared to talk about it today. But what it is is you'd have a contraption on you and what
00:21:18,00:21:21,"they've worked out is that when we're walking we're moving our arms all the time, right?"
00:21:21,00:21:25,Right. So we're generating movement. We're generating energy in the same way that a turbine
00:21:25,00:21:31,might. So why not bottle our arm swing and then we can power ourselves at night?
00:21:31,00:21:34,I know they can't see you on the podcast but you're literally walking like a Lego man.
00:21:34,00:21:38,"Also Dan, sorry, I can power myself at night already."
00:21:38,00:21:44,I don't need the hardest energy of my arm swing from the day. What do you mean we can
00:21:44,00:21:47,power ourselves at night? Well it might charge your phone when you're asleep.
00:21:47,00:21:50,"Exactly. Or the arm movement. No, no, you're generating for that. Okay, look, we're different."
00:21:51,00:21:56,"But you do get, I've read about there's been some gyms where they attach the treadmills"
00:21:56,00:21:59,to the lights and they get the lights going by people going on the treadmills all day.
00:21:59,00:22:03,"That is very cool. Yeah, I like that. It's possible. Okay, he likes that. That's fine."
00:22:03,00:22:07,"Sophie, we're one four and one against at the moment. Could you make the final call?"
00:22:07,00:22:15,"I don't like it. I, what if you've not got very strong arms, long arms? What if you've got no arms?"
00:22:17,00:22:22,"Is this the hell I want to die on? Okay, this is not Dragon's Den. I didn't invent this."
00:22:22,00:22:27,"This is a thing that is happening. Can I ask, can you attach it to other parts of your body that"
00:22:27,00:22:35,"swing while you're walking? What a confident way of putting it here. Do you think, oh,"
00:22:35,00:22:40,I'm actually powering a small turbine down here? Actually powering the whole of Milton Keyes just
00:22:40,00:22:49,walking to the shops. Can I tell you about the International Owl Centre in Minnesota?
00:22:49,00:22:53,"This is an amazing place. They do lots of brilliant work with owls, International Owl Centre,"
00:22:53,00:22:59,and staff have to be able to do owl noises to get a job. It's so cool. Is that just what
00:22:59,00:23:05,"they claim in the interview? Put on, like you put on your CV, you know, barn gray, all of that."
00:23:05,00:23:09,"No, because people come into the office saying, I heard a particular owl. Can you help me identify"
00:23:09,00:23:16,"it? And the staff obviously have to be able to say, Oh, did it go? Or did it go? Or whatever."
00:23:16,00:23:24,"That helps you identify it. So, you know, they may as well. Apparently, there's the hardest owl on"
00:23:24,00:23:29,"the planet to replicate is the brownfish owl, which is so low that most people can't even"
00:23:29,00:23:34,"reproduce the sound. Okay, it's almost impossible to do. I'm the farm brown. Oh,"
00:23:35,00:23:43,"brownfish. You got you got your misnamed yourself. So you have. Yeah, good. Yeah,"
00:23:43,00:23:48,"you have, like every everyone obviously thinks that owls just hoots and go hoot or whatever."
00:23:48,00:23:53,"But they shriek, yap, chitter, squeal, squawk, warble. This is all from the book that you read."
00:23:53,00:23:58,The Suty Owl makes a noise. It only speaks to Matthew Corbett. Really?
00:24:00,00:24:07,"What's that, Suty Owl? Is it named after us? No, it's because it's Suty as in the colour of"
00:24:07,00:24:16,"Sutt. They make a sound like a dropping bomb. Wow, that's amazing. I'm not sure if they have the"
00:24:16,00:24:21,"bomb bit at the end. I think it's just the thing. That's very cool. And the northern sore wet owl,"
00:24:21,00:24:28,"if he wants to find a, if it's a male and wants to find a female, then he does exactly 112 toots"
00:24:28,00:24:34,per minute to try and attract her. And he'll do that from half an hour after sunset until half an
00:24:34,00:24:42,hour before sunrise. So all night he's doing 112 toots per minute. Wow. Isn't that incredible?
00:24:42,00:24:48,"If a female comes into his territory and he notices her, he ratches it up to 260 toots per"
00:24:48,00:24:56,"minute. Right. And then if she buggers off, then he'll follow her doing 160 toots per minute."
00:24:56,00:25:02,Wow. Do they have secular breathing? Is it like beatboxing? Can they do...
00:25:02,00:25:06,"It's a great question. You probably need that, wouldn't you? I would say so. I don't know how"
00:25:06,00:25:11,"the syrinx of Owl works, but yeah, you would think they would have to breathe as well."
00:25:11,00:25:16,"Here's another question. It's so odd that this is a part of the show because of the last fact,"
00:25:16,00:25:24,but we used to leave my sister's Barbie dolls outside on a little veranda bit in Australia
00:25:24,00:25:29,where we lived. And we didn't play with them for a long time because none of them could stand.
00:25:29,00:25:37,She lost interest. And we went out one day and we got the toys out. And Barbie was basically
00:25:37,00:25:44,"hairless, bold-headed, right? And what we realized was a bird had been stealing strands of hair and"
00:25:44,00:25:49,"making a nest in a tree up. And I looked online all day to see whether or not that is a real thing,"
00:25:49,00:25:53,"because that's my memory of it, that we went out and we made that connection. And I saw there was"
00:25:53,00:25:58,"one image of the Barbie doll in its hole as part of a bird's nest, so the bird had grabbed the hair"
00:25:58,00:26:04,"and incorporated it into the nest. But do you think that's... Yeah, 100% that happens."
00:26:04,00:26:09,And it does happen in Owls as well. So the burrowing owl will try and put loads of really
00:26:09,00:26:16,"impressive stuff in his burrow. One to impress the females, but another one to say, ""I'm so great,"
00:26:16,00:26:24,"I managed to get all this stuff."" And so they'll get corn stalks, corn cobs, moss, Andy. Lovely."
00:26:24,00:26:29,"Yeah, lovely. The vertebrae of deer, sometimes they'll put on the outside. This is like decorating"
00:26:29,00:26:34,"the nest, but they will take lots of things that humans have put, like bits of cloth and stuff like"
00:26:34,00:26:40,"that, bits of concrete. And the idea, and always the idea is that the more difficult it is for"
00:26:40,00:26:45,"an owl to get it, the more impressive it is to the female and also to the other males that he"
00:26:45,00:26:51,"doesn't want in his area. So if I got all these bits of concrete, you do not want to fuck with me."
00:26:51,00:26:57,"I need to move us on, guys, to our next fact. I have a fact, but it's a bit sad. Oh, okay."
00:26:57,00:27:01,"Can I say it anyway? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm really sorry about this. Famous owl owners."
00:27:01,00:27:05,"Uh-huh. Are you asking for them? Yeah, why not? Florence Nightingale."
00:27:05,00:27:09,"Yep. Oh. Well, that was the one. Florence Nightingale."
00:27:09,00:27:13,"You said it's a sad fact, but I feel pretty happy."
00:27:14,00:27:17,"I was wondering if anyone might go anywhere else, but no, yeah, Florence Nightingale."
00:27:17,00:27:19,"Harry Potter. Yeah, everyone at Harry Potter's got an owl."
00:27:19,00:27:22,Sting. Sting. I'm taking a punt.
00:27:22,00:27:30,"Florence Nightingale, she had an owl called Athena, which she took from some little boys,"
00:27:30,00:27:35,were kind of playing with this owl and maybe mistreating it. She looked after it. She looked
00:27:35,00:27:41,"after it her whole, or its whole life. And because when war broke out in Crimea,"
00:27:41,00:27:47,"she had to go to the war. She couldn't take the owl with her. And so she put her owl in the attic,"
00:27:47,00:27:50,"and she thought they would be able to just kill all the mice that lived there,"
00:27:50,00:27:55,and stuff like that would be fine. But it was domesticated so much it didn't know how to catch.
00:27:55,00:28:00,"It's a sad fact. I should never have ended on this. And unfortunately, yeah."
00:28:00,00:28:02,"But a medical owl fact. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah."
00:28:02,00:28:07,That's the top of that. So lots of medieval recipes last year were digitized by Cambridge
00:28:07,00:28:14,"University, and a cure for gout is salting an owl, baking it until it be ground into a powder,"
00:28:14,00:28:18,"mixing it with boar's grease to make a salve, and rubbing it on the sufferer's body to cure the"
00:28:18,00:28:37,"gout. That's another sad fact. Every three seconds, another owl dies. In 2005, an owl who lived at"
00:28:37,00:28:46,"Warwick Castle was given L plates because he was so bad at flying. Unfortunately, they were so heavy,"
00:28:46,00:28:58,"he crashed into the ground and died. All right, we need to move on. It's time for fact number three,"
00:28:58,00:29:04,"and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that the poet William Blake's boss once visited"
00:29:04,00:29:11,him and his wife only to find them completely naked. It turns out they liked to cosplay as Adam
00:29:11,00:29:17,"and Eve. It's a great course. It's brilliant. It's brilliant, isn't it? He was a big fan of"
00:29:17,00:29:23,"Milton, wasn't he, Blake? Milton, yeah. So actually what they were doing, so just to say"
00:29:23,00:29:29,"Milton, Paradise Lost, they were reading some John Milton, and they possibly, William Blake,"
00:29:29,00:29:35,"as well as being a poet, he was known artist, and he might have wanted to illustrate Milton,"
00:29:35,00:29:40,and they thought that maybe he persuaded his wife that they would both read it and pretend to be
00:29:40,00:29:45,"Adam and Eve, so that maybe he'd be able to see the postures that they got into, and he'd be able"
00:29:45,00:29:52,"to do some good accurate drawings in his illustration of Milton. Very convoluted, isn't it? A way to get"
00:29:52,00:30:04,"your wife pregnant? Naked, yes. Same thing. But yeah, this is Blake's patron who was called Thomas"
00:30:04,00:30:16,Butts. Thomas Seymour Butts. One day he went to visit Blake because he was his patron. He was
00:30:16,00:30:20,"going to give him some money maybe, and he turned up, knocked on the door. Someone let him in,"
00:30:20,00:30:25,"and it turned out that Blake and his wife were in the garden, and Blake said, ""Come on in, it's only"
00:30:25,00:30:31,"Adam and Eve, you know."" And they were trying out naked postures. And this story comes from the first"
00:30:31,00:30:36,"biography of William Blake by a guy called Alexander Gilchrist, is what made Blake famous,"
00:30:36,00:30:43,"because he is a very famous poet now. He did, what did he do? Tiger, tiger, burning drawing,"
00:30:43,00:30:48,"all that kind of stuff. But before this, he wasn't famous at all. This very, very well-researched"
00:30:48,00:30:54,biography has this story. Some of Blake's friends or relatives of their friends said that it might
00:30:54,00:30:59,"not have been true, but most modern biographers, I think, pretty much believe it. The ONDB says"
00:30:59,00:31:04,that it does not seem out of character that this happened. That they would be naked. Yeah.
00:31:04,00:31:12,"He was a very visionary, imaginative, unusual guy. So in fact, he was constantly seeing angels and"
00:31:12,00:31:17,"having visions, and he was just like a full-on inner life, basically. And in fact, there's a thing"
00:31:17,00:31:22,"about him that's connected to something one of us has. Oh, yeah. What, Blake? Yeah. Daddy issues?"
00:31:22,00:31:32,"It's mummy issues, I like that. No, so James has a fantasia. I do. And that's where you can't"
00:31:32,00:31:37,"visualise things in your mind. Yeah, so if I close my eyes, I can't imagine what things look like."
00:31:37,00:31:44,"Yeah, yeah. So Blake, we reckon, or historians reckon, might have had hyperphantasia, which is"
00:31:44,00:31:47,where you see lots and lots and lots of things that often aren't there. So it's sort of an
00:31:47,00:31:51,"opposite-y thing there. But yeah, a lot of people think... It is really interesting that, because"
00:31:51,00:31:55,"like, if I close my eyes, I can just see nothing. It's just dark. I can't imagine things. Can't"
00:31:55,00:32:00,imagine what Square looks like. Can't imagine what my wife looks like. Just can't imagine anything.
00:32:00,00:32:06,"Can't imagine what Dan's mum looks like. Obviously, I can imagine that. Yeah. But it goes through"
00:32:06,00:32:11,different sort of phases. So there are some people who can just kind of make out slight images. There
00:32:11,00:32:17,"are some people who can almost see an entire movie that goes on in their head. Like, they can imagine"
00:32:17,00:32:20,their first day at school and they'll see it happening in their head. And then there are some
00:32:20,00:32:26,"people like Blake, who is a hyperphantasia, who can just imagine almost anything and things almost"
00:32:26,00:32:31,"come into him and he's not sure if they're real or not real. Yeah, it sounds like a mad life he had."
00:32:31,00:32:35,"Yeah, well, I mean, there's lots of people who were like, he was just quite mentally ill, but thought"
00:32:35,00:32:39,"he was seeing visions. But it started from when he was really, really young. So when he was four years"
00:32:39,00:32:45,"old, he first saw God's head in a window. And they described it as the first of many visions"
00:32:45,00:32:50,he would recount in the ordinary unempathetic tone in which we speak of trivial matters.
00:32:50,00:32:53,"So he was just kind of completely on his side, God's heads in the window."
00:32:53,00:33:00,"Well, that's yeah, because they came so much to him. It wasn't just angels and gods, it was the past"
00:33:00,00:33:05,people of the world. So kings and famous artists and stuff like that to the point where he would
00:33:05,00:33:10,"be sitting there, say, have a conversation with William Wallace. He's just having a chat in his"
00:33:10,00:33:15,head and then he'd get pissed off because King Edward I would suddenly just blunder in and he'd
00:33:15,00:33:18,"be like, Edward, we're trying to have a chat here. What are you doing? He would get pissed off with"
00:33:18,00:33:23,"the visions as well because there were too many going on. Yeah, interrupting. Incredible. That's"
00:33:23,00:33:29,"weird because he painted the body of Edward I, the embalmed body of Edward I who died 400, 500"
00:33:29,00:33:33,"years before. They opened up the tomb and he got to have a go at painting it. That is so weird,"
00:33:33,00:33:38,"isn't it? The idea that they would just open up the tomb of a dead monarch and just say, oh,"
00:33:38,00:33:41,you can paint them for an hour and then we'll close it again. It was one hour. It was like a
00:33:41,00:33:47,supermarket sweep thing and you had one hour to paint Edward I. And it was literally the king?
00:33:47,00:33:52,"It was the king. It was the Edward I. It was so weird. Has that ever been done since? 1774, they did it."
00:33:52,00:33:57,"How old he was when he did that? Was he a child? No, he was young. He was young. Is he still around"
00:33:57,00:34:03,"then? Is he in barmed bodies? No, all these people are dead. If he was in barmed, will he still be"
00:34:03,00:34:09,"there? Yes, they sealed up the tomb again. We could bring Edward I up. Damien Hurst has him this"
00:34:09,00:34:14,"year. Don't give him to Hurst. If you were going to open up the tomb of Edward, you should just"
00:34:14,00:34:24,"slip into his arms a little mummified sex doll. Speaking of sex dolls, no, speaking of Catherine,"
00:34:24,00:34:29,"Eve in this cosplay scenario, this roleplay, sexy roleplay they were having, apparently Catherine"
00:34:29,00:34:34,was great crack. She was like jokes. She was like a great cook. And one of the things that she used
00:34:34,00:34:39,"to do, despite being a great cook, was to serve up like empty plates as a reminder that he needed"
00:34:39,00:34:45,to start bringing some money home. Pointless when you're serving it to someone who has constant
00:34:45,00:34:54,"visions. He's like, well, hamburgers again. Apparently Blake really loved to eat cold"
00:34:54,00:35:00,"mutton and drink pints of porter from the local pub, but he didn't like wine glasses, which he"
00:35:00,00:35:05,"considered an absurd affectation, said from someone who cosplays as Adam and Eve. And once he"
00:35:05,00:35:09,"accepted a gift from admire, which was a whole bottle of walnut oil, he didn't know what to do"
00:35:09,00:35:15,"with it. So he drank it all monger. Oh, my God. He and his wife seem to have had a very nice"
00:35:15,00:35:21,relationship in almost all the time. There was no evidence he was unfaithful to her
00:35:21,00:35:25,"ever. There was a bit of gossip, but they loved talking. They loved walking. They ran their"
00:35:25,00:35:30,whole business together because he was a printer basically. And she and he together worked out
00:35:30,00:35:35,"the printing process. And they designed, they engraved, they printed, they made their own ink."
00:35:35,00:35:39,"Like they had this idea that if we can control every element of the production process,"
00:35:39,00:35:43,"everything except printing their own paper, then we'll control all of it, we'll make a load of"
00:35:43,00:35:49,money. And they did not do that. It's tragic because he was obviously seen as one of the
00:35:49,00:35:54,"greatest geniuses ever produced. And yet his poems sold, I think songs of innocence and experience"
00:35:54,00:35:59,"sold something like 20 copies in 30 years. It was really bad. Jerusalem sold nothing,"
00:35:59,00:36:06,did no business. Just absolutely nothing at all. So why was he allowed to paint a king?
00:36:06,00:36:10,Like what was the lead? I don't know. I think he was really quite young at that time. So I think
00:36:10,00:36:15,"he might have been studying or whatever. But he also, I'm very envious of his death because"
00:36:15,00:36:20,he is someone who did not think death was scary. I'm someone who does get scared of death and the
00:36:20,00:36:25,"idea of no more consciousness. And I know a lot of people aren't, but he particularly believed"
00:36:25,00:36:31,"in the afterlife so much that on his deathbed, he was literally singing with excitement on the day"
00:36:31,00:36:36,"he died going, you know, I'm going to the next place. Yeah. Yeah. Like whatever the song was."
00:36:36,00:36:41,"Those kind of sound like the words he would have used, right? As an amazing poet. But"
00:36:41,00:36:46,"and so his wife was upset, but also at the same time, she was like, cool, I'll catch you, I'll"
00:36:46,00:36:51,"catch you soon. And on her death day, she was calling to him as if he was in the next room going,"
00:36:51,00:36:57,"I'll be with you in a minute, William. I'm on my way. What a great way out. Yeah. He was a good"
00:36:57,00:37:03,"husband, I think. He once wrote that the female vulva is a little model of a chapel of God"
00:37:03,00:37:12,"that husbands must daily worship. Okay. Wow. Yeah, it's nice. It is nice. It's like an eternal chamber,"
00:37:12,00:37:18,you might say. And he's popular culture wise. You can see his footprint everywhere in ways
00:37:18,00:37:25,"you might not recognize. I'm like your sister's Barbie. So okay, the band, The Doors, The Doors"
00:37:25,00:37:31,"of Perception, that was a Blake poem that that's where Jim Morrison and the band got that line from."
00:37:31,00:37:37,"So that's down to Blake. Allen Ginsberg, one of the great American beat poets, read a poem of his"
00:37:37,00:37:42,"and he felt the presence of God. And he said, he said immediately afterwards, oh my God,"
00:37:42,00:37:48,I've just experienced something I've never experienced before. This poem and the LSD I took.
00:37:48,00:37:55,"I don't know if there was LSD, but he, yeah. So presence of God stuff. Do people sort of know"
00:37:55,00:38:01,what Jerusalem is about? Because it's a series of weird interlinked questions. I thought it was like
00:38:01,00:38:07,that Jerusalem comes to England or something like maybe Joseph of Arimathea is going to come to
00:38:07,00:38:11,England or something. That's it. And did those feet in ancient times walk up on England's mountains
00:38:11,00:38:17,green? It's about the myth that Jesus went to Glastonbury. That's literally what there was a
00:38:17,00:38:26,"myth that Jesus attended Glastonbury. So Jesus had a great uncle who was Joseph of Arimathea,"
00:38:26,00:38:34,like James says. And he was a sailor and maybe he came to Cornwall to buy some tin. And then maybe
00:38:34,00:38:41,they walked around Glastonbury for a bit. And this is when Jesus was tiny. And that was the idea
00:38:41,00:38:46,"behind that. That was the idea that Blake was writing about. In fact, it turns out Jesus didn't"
00:38:46,00:38:52,"go to Glastonbury, obviously. The story was made up by monks in the 12th century to boost the"
00:38:52,00:39:00,"tourism industry of the area. It's such a good scam. Okay, great. 1184, you're a monk. Your abbey's"
00:39:00,00:39:05,burned down. Nightmare. You need to rebuild it. You need to raise some cash. So all you do is you
00:39:05,00:39:09,"just say King Arthur came from here, you know, and no one can prove you wrong because it's the"
00:39:09,00:39:13,"12th century. They don't know fact checkers. And then King Arthur, you just add Jesus into"
00:39:13,00:39:18,"that and say, oh, Jesus came here too, actually. And the monks, this was the great bit of the con."
00:39:18,00:39:23,They built a wooden church in a style that would have been built centuries before to make it look
00:39:23,00:39:29,like their monastery was way older and might have hosted King Arthur and Jesus. At the same time.
00:39:29,00:39:35,"I don't know if there was a kind of supergroup element to it, but it was kind of like, it was"
00:39:35,00:39:40,"just like, oh, this is a very, very old place. That was their claim. And it was nonsense from"
00:39:40,00:39:44,"start to finish, but it worked because Glastonbury became the second richest abbey in the entire"
00:39:44,00:39:49,"country, partly because of this myth of, oh, yeah, Jesus, he was here. I've always said it,"
00:39:49,00:39:56,"you can't trust bugs. Well, they got their comeuppance. You'll be glad to hear Sophie, just 400"
00:39:56,00:40:02,years later. And what was the comeuppance? They had to say 12 Hail Marys. That was the dissolution
00:40:02,00:40:15,"of the monasteries. I admit, as a pretty neat reference to make, sorry. Okay, it is time for"
00:40:15,00:40:22,our final fact of the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that Lady Bird orgasms last
00:40:22,00:40:30,for 30 minutes. Pretty astonishing 30 minutes. Yeah. So their sex can last up to nine hours.
00:40:30,00:40:35,"So hence that's proportional orgasm, possibly to the amount of sex time that they're having."
00:40:35,00:40:40,"Well, yeah, what's that? What did you say? Half an hour. There's one 18th of the total"
00:40:40,00:40:43,time having sex. So that's a full second orgasm. Two minutes. Yep.
00:40:43,00:40:50,"Check that. Carry on. Wait, did you say two minutes? No, my numbers are all off then."
00:40:50,00:40:58,"So yeah, so they, yeah, nine hours. Nine hours. And actually during that time, the female might"
00:40:58,00:41:03,often get a bit bored and go around looking for food while the male is attached to the back of her.
00:41:03,00:41:08,"Well, that's the weird thing. There's been, they've seen sometimes this is how clueless the male Lady"
00:41:08,00:41:13,"Bird is during the sex that sometimes they'll get four hours into the sex and they'll be like,"
00:41:13,00:41:20,"oh, she's dead. They don't even know that for four hours they were sleeping with a dead Lady Bird."
00:41:21,00:41:28,"It's not incredible. Males are very, what's the one I'm looking for? Necrophilic?"
00:41:28,00:41:33,"No, they're just sort of they're very inattentive, male Lady Birds. They're very..."
00:41:33,00:41:35,"Are you being an apologist for Necrophilia, male Lady Birds?"
00:41:35,00:41:40,I cannot stress enough that I don't think our puny human judgment is applying this universe.
00:41:40,00:41:46,"No, so if a male Lady Bird meets another Lady Bird, he will climb on top of it no matter what."
00:41:46,00:41:51,"Oh, regardless. Regardless. And it might not be a female, you know. So Warwick University wrote"
00:41:51,00:41:56,an amazing study about the love lives of Lady Birds and they reported that if a male meets
00:41:56,00:42:00,another he will immediately make a full-hearted attempt to climb on top of the other one.
00:42:00,00:42:03,"If he discovers that he has mounted another male, he will retreat immediately."
00:42:03,00:42:06,"But if he was lucky to have met a female, he will try to sleep with her."
00:42:06,00:42:11,So they don't notice anything really. They just bump into another Lady Bird and start
00:42:11,00:42:15,"climbing up it. Yeah, because they can only see two centimetres ahead of them."
00:42:15,00:42:19,"So if there's something that looks a little bit like a Lady Bird there, you might as well have a go."
00:42:20,00:42:24,"Gosh. Really? And sometimes female Lady Birds get mounted by male Lady Birds,"
00:42:24,00:42:28,"which are not even the same species of Lady Bird. Yeah. And they say, ""What are you doing?"
00:42:28,00:42:36,"We're not even the same thing."" I mean, it's hard to tell the gender of a Lady Bird from two"
00:42:36,00:42:42,centimetres' sight. But it's your Lady Bird. But you're all Lady Birds. It's not Lady Birds and
00:42:42,00:42:47,"Laddie Birds. It's all Lady Birds. Yeah. They're all Lady Birds. You all look basically the same,"
00:42:47,00:42:51,"even though you can have different colours of Lady Bird. You can have red Lady Birds,"
00:42:51,00:42:56,"orange Lady Birds, black Lady Birds, blue Lady Birds. Wait, maybe I'll make that one up."
00:42:56,00:43:01,"Orange, black, brown and red. Those are the main types. There have been reports of"
00:43:01,00:43:09,"purple Lady Birds, but those are unreliable. One thing that I really like to my Lady Bird"
00:43:09,00:43:14,"research is that they're not a lot of Lady Birds in popular culture, but there is one Lady Bird"
00:43:14,00:43:18,"who is possibly Pixar's first transgender character, which is Francis from A Bugs Life."
00:43:18,00:43:25,"If Francis from A Bugs Life is constantly being misgendered as a lady, which he gets very upset"
00:43:25,00:43:32,"about, but if the Pixar forums, people have, I suppose, that maybe Francis is a"
00:43:32,00:43:35,delusion to a trans character. You're all taking that very seriously. Pixar did not do that.
00:43:35,00:43:41,But it is a constantly misgendered Lady Bird in A Bugs Life.
00:43:41,00:43:46,"It's hard to tell the species of Lady Bird because in the UK we have a seven-spot Lady Bird,"
00:43:46,00:43:50,"which is the most common, but you might get a 22-spot Lady Bird, a 13-spot Lady Bird,"
00:43:50,00:43:55,"10-spot Lady Bird, two-spot Lady Bird, 18-spot Lady Bird. These are all different species."
00:43:55,00:43:58,"And you know how you can tell which is which? Oh, number of spots. No."
00:43:58,00:44:05,This is the amazing thing. Some seven-spot Lady Birds can have anywhere between about five and
00:44:05,00:44:12,"nine spots, and 11-spot Lady Birds can have something like nine to maybe 15, something like that."
00:44:12,00:44:15,What was the point of anything then? What was the point of science?
00:44:15,00:44:21,"It's most of them do have the number of spots that their name says, but the problem is that some of"
00:44:21,00:44:26,"them don't, and like some of the spots sort of merge into each other, so you can have a seven-spot,"
00:44:26,00:44:30,"but actually five of the spots sort of all molded into one spot, so it's like just three spots."
00:44:30,00:44:32,You know what? I'm coming around to the point of view of the male Lady Bird here.
00:44:33,00:44:37,"If you don't even have the decency to have the number of spots that your literal name is,"
00:44:37,00:44:42,"that's crazy. Yeah, that's another crazy thing is that if they're mating, because obviously,"
00:44:42,00:44:47,"as I said, it can go up to nine hours, if they're mating and it gets the sun down"
00:44:47,00:44:54,"and the temperature drops, they become immobilized and they're just kind of stuck there. Yeah."
00:44:54,00:44:58,"Oh my god, so if you're going to do nine hours, you pretty much have to start"
00:44:58,00:45:02,"quite early in the morning, don't you? There's no point starting at midday because it's going to be..."
00:45:02,00:45:07,"Yeah, you've got to time it right, but you know, another argument in my favor for the solar powered"
00:45:07,00:45:15,"arms to give you night time energy. Six arms. Six arms. Six arms, yeah. I've got quite a cute Lady"
00:45:15,00:45:20,"Bird fact. Do you know who the Lady Bird's named after? A German cool girl? No, she's named..."
00:45:20,00:45:26,"She's slushy. They, the Lady Bird's are named after people think in lots of languages are Lady"
00:45:26,00:45:32,"the Virgin Mary. It was often depicted wearing a red cloak in like lots of things, but the word"
00:45:32,00:45:39,"Lady Bird in other languages and Irish, it's, I can't say it, it's boy day. Okay. It means God's"
00:45:39,00:45:46,"little cow. God's little cow. I feel like the Virgin Mary in heaven is like... Yeah, yeah."
00:45:46,00:45:54,"So the German word for Lady Bird is Marian Kaffa, which is Mary Beatles. It's using the"
00:45:55,00:46:08,"surname of Virgin Mary in that instance. Her first name was Virgin. Mum, Dad, why did you name me that?"
00:46:08,00:46:14,"Can we talk a bit about the Lady Bird explosion of 1976? Yes, please. This is great. Okay."
00:46:14,00:46:23,So Dan's mum was just a teenager. This is a thing that happened in 1976. The weather conditions
00:46:23,00:46:27,"for some reason were right. So 1975 was quite a good summer, then the winter was mild, then the"
00:46:27,00:46:32,"spring was warm, right? So what you had, you had this, you had all the preconditions for this amazing"
00:46:32,00:46:39,"number of Lady Bird's. Apparently during the summer of 1976, 400 miles of tide line on the South and"
00:46:39,00:46:44,East coast of England were nothing but Lady Bird's. Really? They were just solid Lady Bird's.
00:46:44,00:46:49,What? They think there might have been something like 23 billion Lady Bird's in the tide line at
00:46:49,00:46:55,"any one time, which is more than double the number of humans there have ever been."
00:46:55,00:47:01,"This is 1976. This is 1976. This is for one particular day in 1976, that 23 billion number."
00:47:01,00:47:05,Does anyone here must have been of age in 1976? Does anyone remember that?
00:47:05,00:47:09,There were a lot of Lady Bird's. There were a lot of Lady Bird's!
00:47:09,00:47:17,"It's good. Well, burration, corroboration. There were a lot of Lady Bird's. You weren't wrong. There"
00:47:17,00:47:22,were a lot of Lady Bird's. That's the happiest I've ever been. That's how we do our fact checking.
00:47:22,00:47:30,"The author who was writing about this, who was, his surname was Majeris, said, ""I was walking in"
00:47:30,00:47:35,"Brighton in late July. I tried a little experiment, walking along the almost deserted beach with a"
00:47:35,00:47:41,cone of yellowish vanilla ice cream held inside my jacket. I then held it out and timed how long
00:47:41,00:47:46,"it took to become completely submerged in Lady Bird's."" Oh my God, like hundreds and thousands."
00:47:46,00:47:54,"Yeah. Well, probably only 40 or 50, but no, the point is, 28 seconds. 28 seconds after he got the"
00:47:54,00:47:58,"ice cream out of his coat, it was covered in Lady Bird's. That's how many there were just around."
00:47:58,00:48:06,Wow. It was huge. Oh my God. Yeah. They fly so fast as well. They fly as fast as like a fast horse runs.
00:48:06,00:48:14,"That's how fast. That's fast. That's fast, yeah. That's what, like, yeah. And yet the plans for the"
00:48:14,00:48:19,"Lady Bird Grand National seem never, ever to get going. So sad. What's that, 40 miles an hour?"
00:48:19,00:48:24,"They can't go 40 miles an hour. They go really fast. If it's windy. Yeah, yeah."
00:48:24,00:48:29,"Who's timing a Lady Bird? There is a Norse legend that a Lady Bird, the Lady Bird came to Earth on"
00:48:29,00:48:33,"a bolt of lightning. So it's probably just someone watching her. Whoa, yeah. That's cool. You're"
00:48:33,00:48:39,"like, ""That's like a fast horse."" That's amazing. They get pubic lice as well, Lady Bird's."
00:48:39,00:48:45,"Are they? Yeah, it's the equivalent. So it's pubic lice. I'm doing air quotes here. Ectoparasitic"
00:48:45,00:48:50,"mites is what they get. But they, so they, Lady Birds are just absolutely riddled with STDs,"
00:48:50,00:48:56,because they shag so much and they spread it. So the mites hide underneath the shell. So you would
00:48:56,00:49:04,never see you in the mites. Although I've seen photos of STD riddled Lady Birds and it's...
00:49:06,00:49:15,"Those spots are natural, Dan. Well, I started off as a seven-spot, but I don't know what's going on here."
00:49:15,00:49:21,"But it's hard to hide when you see like a really riddled, so like, because they"
00:49:21,00:49:24,get like fungi and stuff like that. So they come in and they look like they're wearing greenery on
00:49:24,00:49:29,them. The fungi one's interesting because that has become a real problem over the last few years.
00:49:29,00:49:34,Yeah. Pretty much most of the Lady Birds you get in this country and around the world are starting
00:49:34,00:49:39,to get this fungi. But we don't know for sure that it's harmful. So we know that they're all
00:49:39,00:49:44,getting it and they all seem to get it from sex or actually in a nice way. Sometimes they like
00:49:44,00:49:49,to cuddle together and they can catch the fungus that way. So it's not always an STD. But we don't
00:49:49,00:49:53,know for sure that it's harmful. It could be just like getting athlete's foot. So it could be just
00:49:53,00:49:57,like we all have a big cuddle. We all get athlete's foot and we're kind of fine. Might be a little bit
00:49:57,00:50:01,"uncomfortable. Darling, it's fine. We were we were cuddling and then I came home and that was it."
00:50:03,00:50:05,They're just pubic lice in air quotes. It's fine.
00:50:05,00:50:10,I feel like we've got quite personal with the Lady Birds.
00:50:10,00:50:13,"Well, can I say something about orgasms then very quickly?"
00:50:13,00:50:14,Yeah. Yes. Clean it up.
00:50:14,00:50:21,So psychologists at Madrid University collected a lot of images of the faces of people when they
00:50:21,00:50:29,"orgasmed and they noted that 92 percent had their eyes closed, 79 percent had a dropping of the jaw"
00:50:29,00:50:34,"and 64 percent were frowning. So if you're having sex with your partner is eyes shut,"
00:50:34,00:50:37,"slack jawed with a frown on their face, then it means you're doing it right."
00:50:37,00:50:42,I've never been more conscious of the muscles of my face.
00:50:42,00:50:45,Not wanting to do anything with them.
00:50:45,00:50:50,"Oh, that's so interesting, James. Thank you."
00:50:50,00:50:52,It's just science then.
00:50:52,00:50:54,"No, I know. I love science."
00:50:54,00:50:55,I've got orgasm fat.
00:50:55,00:50:56,"Oh, yeah. Go for it."
00:50:56,00:51:03,"So if we imagine if we've got the fantasy of the two Lady Birds having sex, they reach climates,"
00:51:03,00:51:07,"the sun goes down and they're frozen like that forever, you think, what an amazing way to go?"
00:51:07,00:51:08,Yes.
00:51:08,00:51:13,"And so I was like, are there any people who were famously or allegedly died during sex?"
00:51:13,00:51:13,"Yeah, that's good."
00:51:13,00:51:19,And there is a list of people who have allegedly died at the point of climates and it's got one
00:51:19,00:51:25,president and four popes. Four popes. Wow.
00:51:25,00:51:31,"Pope Leo the 7th, Pope John the 12th, Pope John the 18th, Pope Paul the 2nd."
00:51:31,00:51:34,They all apparently died while shagging.
