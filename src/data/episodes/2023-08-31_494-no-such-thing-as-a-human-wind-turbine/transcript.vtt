WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show we wanted to introduce our

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.080
 special guest. She has been on the show once before and she was so great that we thought

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.280
 we had to have her back. It is the brilliant Sophie Duker. If you don't know Sophie already,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.080
 if you didn't listen to the episode she was already on, if you haven't seen her on Taskmaster,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.960
 she is a fantastic stand-up, she's really brilliant and you're about to hear that on

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.760
 the show. So there's no need for further evidence of it really, but if once you've heard this show

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.320
 you would like to see or hear a little bit more of Sophie's comedy, as you will, there are a

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.040
 couple of ways to do that. So firstly she had a tour earlier this year which was called "Hag".

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.680
 That tour sold out and also is in the past so it's impossible to see it, but there are new

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.720
 dates added to that tour. They're all on her website which is SophieDuker.com, a very Ronsiol

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.800
 website there, but it does contain those dates so that's why you want to visit there. The other

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.800
 thing she's doing soon is that on the 26th of October this year she is hosting a one-off edition

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.360
 mega show at Hackney Empire in London. It's a show she's done loads of times before, it's called

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.680
 "Wacky Racists", but this one is going to be a bigger and better edition than ever. There are

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.000
 going to be all-star guests, there are going to be stand-ups, there are going to be songs,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.320
 there are going to be stupid games, you name it, it will be there. It's going to be great fun.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.560
 That's it for this introduction, I hope you've enjoyed it, but not as much as I hope you enjoy

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.720
 the show itself. On with the show.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:49.160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:57.720
 to you live from the Soho Theatre in London. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.760
 James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Sophie Juker and once again we have gathered around the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.640
 microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.480
 here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Sophie. What an honour. Oh, oh you're welcome.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:24.920
 My fact is, Barbie, the lady of the moment, was based on a high-end German cool girl.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.720
 That's right, there's a sex worker in your child's bedroom.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.560
 That little freesong, that was 150 people just being slightly titillated by that thing.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.760
 And shocked. Yes, shocked as well. She's based on a different doll, is Barbie. Picture the scene,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.560
 it's 1956. Cool. Your Ruth Handler, the inventor of Barbie. My mum was born 1956 and now I've

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.160
 got my mum in my head which might make this next bit difficult. It will. You're there with your mum.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.280
 It's pretty sexy and in the window. Dan's mum has just been born. Oh sorry.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.720
 Like back to the future. This is way, way beyond. Your mum's been born, she's in a crib somewhere,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.320
 she's not involved. Cool. You are the doll, it doesn't matter who you are. It's 1956,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.040
 there's a doll in a window. The doll is Bild Lilly. Bild is a German tabloid and Lilly is the doll that

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.520
 is sold in association with that tabloid and she was sort of a sexy, flusy. And that is what Barbie

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.640
 is based on. When Ruth Handler saw Lilly in the window, she said and I quote, "I didn't know then

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.160
 who Lilly was. I saw only an adult-shaped body that I had been trying to describe for years,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.600
 which I love because presumably all around her were adults." But I would say no adults in the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.840
 same shape as Barbie though. No, true. She's got weird proportions. And dolls, dolls were for children

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.120
 and they were of children, weren't they, at the time? Yeah, that was the revolutionary thing.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.560
 If anyone's seen the Barbie movie, which we are not promoting because their budget is big enough,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.120
 but if you've seen the Barbie movie, you'll see that a lot of dolls for kids were just of kids,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.120
 but Barbie was this like sexy, well not sexy, Barbie's not sexy, but she was kind of like older,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.200
 mature. Yeah. I read there was a journalist from the New Yorker magazine called Ariel Levy who

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.160
 later referred to this as a sex doll, Lilly. Now, she was still only six inches high. Right, right.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.800
 Oh, really? So, I don't know. I'd take some imagination to use that as a sex doll, I imagine.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.840
 But they used to give it to people, like if you went on a stag do, you might get this

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.520
 sexy doll, right? Or they would, some men would hang it on their windscreen of their car and stuff

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.720
 like that. It's just like a sexy thing. Because that's what you do with your sex toys, you put them.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.280
 Barbie gets a lot of stick for being regressive, but I think Ruth Handler was very progressive

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.080
 and she was a very, she was an ambitious businesswoman. It was her and her husband,

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.920
 Elliot. They founded the company together. They made all the decisions about it. And I think the

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:18.280
 idea was that Barbie would never get married. Barbie was able to, it was to expand girls imaginations

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.680
 about what they could do and that their imaginations should extend beyond marriage and motherhood is

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.720
 the basic idea. Okay, right. Yeah, so in that sense, she did start as a fashion model and then

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.080
 became a fashion editor the next year and then a fashion designer, but it's maybe career progression.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.120
 Okay, Barbie did do a lot of stuff other than that. She went to space before Matt even went to

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.960
 the moon. There was astronaut Barbie. Four years before Matt went to the moon, there was astronaut

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.960
 Barbie. Okay, but we did go to space before we went to the moon, just not to... Yeah, okay, so.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.000
 Before... Not to shit on that. Yeah, okay. Has Barbie been to the moon? Before we could even have

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.800
 bank accounts. Oh, yeah. Barbie bought her first dream house. Oh, okay. Yeah, in 1962 she bought the

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.720
 dream house. Wow. With whose money? Ken's. Yes, Ken's right. That's amazing. I like as well,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.720
 just speaking of astronauts, so the fact that Barbie was designed by a guy called Jack Ryan,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.640
 at least the physical making of Barbie was. And he was a guy who is, he was an engineer for the

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.440
 Pentagon. He made missiles. So he was, yeah, he was someone who's had a whole different career,

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.000
 and then Mattel hired him. And he worked out amazing things, like the fact that she had a

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.080
 twistable waist, that was a new innovation to toys. And I don't know if you remember this, and I

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.880
 very much remember this, the clickable knees of Barbie. How do you remember this? Because I used

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:42.440
 to bring to school every day a disembodied leg of Barbie with me. Mr. Shriver, Mrs. Shriver, come in.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:50.040
 Yeah, it's nothing bad. So I used to, when I was younger, and I still kind of do, and I should

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.080
 have a Barbie leg on me again, actually, and this is advice for everyone listening.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.200
 I click my fingers a lot, obsessively click my fingers, and I needed something to stop me. And

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.640
 the clickable leg of a Barbie gives you the same sensation as clicking your own finger. So I used

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.120
 to sit in class. So you probably disembodied leg. Yeah, I just used to sit clicking Barbie's leg over

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.240
 and over in school. And your sister had to bring in a Barbie with at least one of its legs missing.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.840
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, she wasn't too happy about that. But I genuinely tried out if you've got

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.880
 a problem with clicking your fingers. Okay. Pretty. But I also think it's really interesting. I didn't

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.560
 know that the guy that designed Barbie was a missiles designer because he actually made some

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.520
 quite big, that well Mattel made some quite big changes to Barbie when they changed her from

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.560
 the original prototype of Bill D'Lilli and the model which Mattel then bought up. They softened

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:41.000
 her eyebrows, relaxed her lips, upgraded her plastic and whited her skin. Okay.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.920
 Well, we don't know what she could have been green.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:51.240
 And at one point the nipples and breasts of an early prototype were daintily filed off.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:08:00.200
 Oh, can you daintily file nipples? It's a more difficult process than that. But related to that,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.720
 of course, is Ken's bulge. Oh, yeah. Which I haven't seen the movie, but I believe they reference

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:12.280
 in the movie. And Ruth Handler, who created Barbie, she wanted Ken to have a proper bulge in his groin.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.720
 And the people at Mattel were having none of it. They thought that no mother would buy a doll,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.920
 which had a bulge in its groin. And this became a really big argument. They brought in a Freudian

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.880
 psychologist to ask them what to do. And he said, oh, yeah, well, all the girls are just going to

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.560
 want to undress Ken. So, you know, you're going to have to think about it. You're going to have to

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.360
 do something. What were they thinking when they brought in a Freudian psychologist?

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:39.480
 Completely find a normal. Yeah, don't worry about it. Yeah, bringing a leg of a Barbie in school,

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:45.240
 completely normal. It's normal to fancy your mum when she's just born. Absolutely.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:53.960
 But they came up with a solution, which was they were going to mold the swimsuit directly onto Ken.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.040
 So you wouldn't be able to get the swimsuit off. Did they do that? And they were going to put a very

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.920
 slight bump in the groin. So just enough that would keep Ruth happy, but not enough that would scare

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:10.760
 people off. But the problem was that it all came down to finance in the end. So putting the shots

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.280
 up, molding the shots on cost a couple of cents. Putting the extra lump on was about half a cent

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.040
 worth of plastic. And they decided over the millions that they were going to make, it wasn't

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.320
 worth it to do it. And so that's why he ended up with the bulge. Yeah. Wow. That's a little bulge.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:30.760
 Wow. Yeah. And we were talking about Barbies in space earlier. Yeah. Something about sex dolls in

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:37.400
 space. The Russian cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, he spent the record amount of time on the MIR

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:43.320
 space station. And according to him, the Russian government offered him a sex doll for his time

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.760
 on the MIR. Oh, wow. Wait, what was the record? Do you know the record time? 14 months he was there.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:56.120
 Long time. It's a long time without a sex doll. Long time. Yep. But Polyakov decided that he

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:02.680
 wouldn't take the sex doll onto MIR. Can you guess why he decided not to? Because it's so embarrassing.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:08.440
 Because there's no one up. No, it's not like the aliens are going to turn up and go, what's this?

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.520
 Cosmonaut Polyakov, we're getting your broadcast louder. Wait, is there an extra astronaut floating

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:19.720
 past you? No, that wasn't it. Cos he was married. Oh, he was married actually, but that wasn't,

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:25.640
 I guess it was kind of the reason. He decided that if he started using the sex doll in space,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.280
 he might get so used to it that he wouldn't be able to give it up when he got back down to Earth.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:37.400
 Right. Whereas on Earth, you do, is it different in space to sleep? I suppose you're lonely.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.560
 You might form an attachment like Tom Hanks and Wilson. Exactly. It goes away. Yeah. Did he have

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:51.640
 sex with that? It's implied. It's pretty heavily implied, guys. I don't know the Russian history

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:59.480
 with sex dolls, but I did find out a fact when I was researching sex dolls, not for this, that in

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:05.240
 2018, the mummified remains of a Russian man were found in his home and he was embracing

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:13.720
 a sex doll on the sofa like in Pompeii. When I said like in Pompeii, I meant nothing like Pompeii.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:20.440
 We don't know that the sex dolls weren't in Pompeii because they would never have survived the

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.320
 volcano, would they? That's a good point. They didn't have the first things to go.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:30.360
 Oh, we've got another Barbie thing. Can we talk about the Teen Talk Barbie?

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:37.480
 Okay. This was a later variable. So it was 1992. This was released. And each of the dolls sold

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:44.760
 said four of 270 possible phrases, right? So my doll might say four different things to your doll.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.720
 They worked out that they would have to sell 200 million of these things for there to be

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.560
 the odds that two of them would say exactly the same four phrases. That's a big selling point,

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.440
 obviously. But this was a controversial one because it's the one that said math class is tough

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.000
 as one of the phrases. And that's been slightly misremembered as her saying math is hard,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.480
 which she didn't say, but she did say math. It's pretty much the same thing.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:11.960
 Yeah, it's pretty similar. And so this is prompted a bit of a pushback from people saying this isn't

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:18.200
 a great message to say to girls. And in 1993, the next year, there was this group of performance

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.600
 artists in Manhattan. They called themselves the Barbie Liberation Front, right? And this is

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:28.040
 what they did. This is so good. They bought a load of Teen Talk Barbies off the shelf.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:34.040
 They also bought a load of G.I. Joe talking Duke dolls, right? They swapped the voice boxes

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:42.120
 and then they put them back on the shelves. So you ended up with people who bought G.I. Joe dolls,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:51.000
 which said, will we ever have enough clothes or let's plan our dream wedding? And meanwhile,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:03.400
 the matching Barbie was saying things like eat lead. That's so good. It is time for fact number

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:10.040
 two. And that is Andy. My fact is that Eastern screech owls have live in snakes as housekeepers,

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.440
 which their children sometimes eat. There's quite a bit going on here.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.520
 There's a new book out, a new owl book out by Jennifer Ackerman and it's called What an Owl

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.240
 Knows as a Great Book. And she quotes this amazing study. There was a scientist called

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.520
 Frederick Gelbach who studied the Eastern screech owl, right? This is an owl. It lives in a nest.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.320
 It lives in kind of Texas and thereabouts. Oh, it should be kind of called the Western

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:43.880
 screech owl. They probably know what they're doing. Imagine they listen and they go, fuck,

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:50.520
 we're finally rumbled. We had like a hundred years of no one noticing. Murray?

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:56.520
 And basically it turns out one in five nests of this Eastern screech owl contains a live snake

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:02.760
 because the parents go and get food for the chicks and they bring back these snakes alive to the

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:10.440
 nest and they bring them back and some of them get eaten, a few do, but a lot burrow down into

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:16.360
 the nest which is full of stuff that snakes love. You know, it's half-eaten bits of food and pellets

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:24.520
 and all sorts of fecal matter. And so a lot of insects turn up to eat those horrible things and

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:30.760
 the snakes actually they like to eat the insects. So they tidy up the nest for the owls and it's

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:37.240
 good because the owl chicks in snakes which contain a live housekeeping snake grow up bigger and

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:42.680
 stronger and healthier than the chicks in the nest which don't contain a live snake. So it's

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.080
 actually a kind of, it's a mutual thing that's going on. Here's the thing though, just for

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:52.120
 people's image at home of what's happening here. When we say snake, yeah, it's probably like a

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.760
 cobra, right? Exactly. We're talking like, you know, they're twirling up and stuff. These things

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:02.120
 are like smaller than worms, right? Like they're super tiny, exactly because there's a cool image

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.080
 in your head of like a giant snake. Yeah, yeah, these are like little tiny little, oh yeah, but

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.320
 they're snakes. They're small snakes. Oh, no, no, absolutely. Just, just. If you saw one, you would

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:16.280
 genuinely think it was a worm. The only difference is they have scales but the scales are almost

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:21.160
 impossible to see. It literally just looks like a worm. Yeah, but they're one cool thing. They eat a

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.200
 lot of other insects like they eat ants and stuff like that. But they like to eat baby ants and

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.680
 they go into their ants' nests but obviously all the ants are going to attack them. And so what they

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:37.560
 do is they secrete a noxious chemical and they shit at the same time and they mix these two

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.360
 things up and they roll around in it so they're covered in noxious shit and then the ants will

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.240
 not go near them and then they can nom, nom, nom, nom, nom. Brilliant, Al. Yeah. I didn't look up any

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:53.800
 facts about the tiny snakes but I did think how do these Al babies get here? It's going to be through

00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:01.480
 Al's sex. Oh yeah. Very true. Yeah. Al's have sex in a really interesting way so like they don't

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:10.840
 have sex how we would imagine. Yeah. Yeah, sex. How are you imagining just for the... It's 1956.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.840
 Do you imagine like a sort of... I'm, I'm, I'm finding a little better actually. I'm really

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.720
 trying to imagine. I'm thinking like doggy style because they can move their heads 360 degrees

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.680
 around. Just like, just like pet me. But I was thinking, yeah, that's going to be a scary moment.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.560
 What? Just when the head of your doggy style and suddenly the person's face is there again.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:38.600
 It's basically like the exorcist, isn't it? I'd call an Uber at that point. It was so nice

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:45.880
 meeting you. Blue eyes, I never properly noticed. I think you can have some respect. Call it hourly

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.920
 style. Okay. Hourly style. Yeah, yeah. Oh my God. Hourly style sets. They only have sex in one

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.120
 position so you don't have to learn a whole bunch of different things. Okay. They've got a

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:59.400
 cloaca which is an internal chamber with an opening and when it opens... An eternal chamber.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:10.520
 Internal, not eternal. Quite a, quite a nice way of putting it, the eternal chamber. The eternal

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.400
 chamber. Sure. It's a temporary chamber, opens up temporarily inside the chamber.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:22.200
 It's either, depending on the sex of the owl, testes or ovaries. Wow. It's a rub of

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:31.320
 requirement for the owl's jump. And when the owls want to get jiggy with it, get hourly with it,

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:37.720
 they, the cloaca protrudes slightly and they rub them against each other. And that is owl sex.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:43.560
 Like the sperm goes into the female cloaca, virtualizes the egg. Just one position. Okay.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:49.080
 No kissing. Nice. No kissing. But it is called a cloacal kiss. So it's a kiss in a way. Oh,

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:54.600
 that is sweet. Do you know how eastern screech owls persuade their children to move away?

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.560
 Do they explain to them how they had sex? Clearly.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:08.040
 The eternal chamber is opening. Fly my children. No, they withhold food

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.760
 and then they remove any food they've stored in the nest. They basically empty the fridge

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.800
 and the cupboards. Oh, wow. Sorry. That's a great idea. And they also have a particular call,

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.320
 which equates to go away. And it's all, obviously, it's good. It's to persuade them to, you know,

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.080
 move on to the next stage of their life. So it is a good thing. Right. That's right. But

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.480
 all owls have different tactics for getting their children to babies to fledge. Yeah, yeah.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:37.720
 You know, so in, in sort of Western culture, we might have the boogie man as a terrifying

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.040
 thing for children. Do you know in Hungary what they have? What a Hungarian boogie man. Is it the

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:49.080
 boogie owl by any chance? It's the copper penis owl. Oh, gosh. Yeah. And if you're not careful,

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.920
 copper penis owl is going to come for you. So what it is, if you picture a boogie man,

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:58.040
 this is the same thing, but it's an owl with a copper penis. Is it copper colored or is it just

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:04.600
 metal? That's like metal. It's a copper penis. Is it oxidized? Is it? Yeah. But what's the threat

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.200
 if it's just a penis? Oh, he'll steal you. He'll steal you. Oh, he'll steal you. The detail of the

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:13.800
 copper penis is not relevant, in fact. It's like, he just happens. It's noticeable. Like if you

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.920
 described, described the owl that took your child, he could do the head thing and then there was this

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:24.040
 metal penis. It wasn't weird not to mention it in a way. Yeah. And it is like owls are associated

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:29.080
 with death around the world, I think. Quite often there'll be a superstition where if you see an owl,

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:33.800
 someone's going to die really soon. And there's quite a few theories as to why that happens. So

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:39.000
 there was one guy who's an owl expert from South Africa who reckons that because people

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.920
 quite often have heart attacks in the middle of the night and that's when owls are around.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.600
 Perhaps people have died and they've heard an owl and they associate them together.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:52.280
 There's another theory from Italy that you would put a body outside when someone's died and you

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.160
 would put candles around it and the moths are attracted to the candles and then the owls are

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.760
 attracted to the moths. So that's one possible version. And another version from India is that

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:08.520
 possibly like in cemeteries you might leave food offerings for people and then you might get like

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.600
 mice and rats coming for the food offerings and then the owls come for the mice or the rats.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.920
 Okay. So that's probably why all around the world people have this association.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.200
 It does. South Africa and they get a really bad rap in lots of places and they're not

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.520
 beloved universally around the world and there are some places where they're still really ill

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:30.360
 omany. In Ghana in the forest a lot of people associate them with witchcraft but it's actually

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.240
 really important with the owl stay because otherwise the forests are full of rats.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.520
 Right. Exactly. There was a prediction in 2015 that wind turbines might all

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:46.120
 be made like owls. To look like owls? To be given feathers. Because owls fly so quietly.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.480
 Because they do. It has to do with particular feathers they've got at the leading edge of

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.720
 their wings. Right. And there was a suggestion why don't we just put feathers on all our wind

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:59.480
 turbines so that they can turn faster and be quieter. And I don't want to live in a world

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.760
 where we don't have feathery wind turbines. Yeah. That's cool. I just love it.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.360
 Not as part of research for this but I was reading today that we might be turning humans

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:14.200
 into wind turbines soon. And go on. So it's a technology. I didn't fully read so I wasn't

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.520
 prepared to talk about it today. But what it is is you'd have a contraption on you and what

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.560
 they've worked out is that when we're walking we're moving our arms all the time, right?

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.800
 Right. So we're generating movement. We're generating energy in the same way that a turbine

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:31.000
 might. So why not bottle our arm swing and then we can power ourselves at night?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.120
 I know they can't see you on the podcast but you're literally walking like a Lego man.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.680
 Also Dan, sorry, I can power myself at night already.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:44.200
 I don't need the hardest energy of my arm swing from the day. What do you mean we can

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.000
 power ourselves at night? Well it might charge your phone when you're asleep.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.520
 Exactly. Or the arm movement. No, no, you're generating for that. Okay, look, we're different.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.440
 But you do get, I've read about there's been some gyms where they attach the treadmills

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.800
 to the lights and they get the lights going by people going on the treadmills all day.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.320
 That is very cool. Yeah, I like that. It's possible. Okay, he likes that. That's fine.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.320
 Sophie, we're one four and one against at the moment. Could you make the final call?

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:15.720
 I don't like it. I, what if you've not got very strong arms, long arms? What if you've got no arms?

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.840
 Is this the hell I want to die on? Okay, this is not Dragon's Den. I didn't invent this.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.960
 This is a thing that is happening. Can I ask, can you attach it to other parts of your body that

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:35.080
 swing while you're walking? What a confident way of putting it here. Do you think, oh,

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:40.440
 I'm actually powering a small turbine down here? Actually powering the whole of Milton Keyes just

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:49.480
 walking to the shops. Can I tell you about the International Owl Centre in Minnesota?

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.880
 This is an amazing place. They do lots of brilliant work with owls, International Owl Centre,

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:59.960
 and staff have to be able to do owl noises to get a job. It's so cool. Is that just what

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:05.720
 they claim in the interview? Put on, like you put on your CV, you know, barn gray, all of that.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.960
 No, because people come into the office saying, I heard a particular owl. Can you help me identify

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:16.360
 it? And the staff obviously have to be able to say, Oh, did it go? Or did it go? Or whatever.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:24.120
 That helps you identify it. So, you know, they may as well. Apparently, there's the hardest owl on

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:29.400
 the planet to replicate is the brownfish owl, which is so low that most people can't even

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:34.120
 reproduce the sound. Okay, it's almost impossible to do. I'm the farm brown. Oh,

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:43.320
 brownfish. You got you got your misnamed yourself. So you have. Yeah, good. Yeah,

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:48.760
 you have, like every everyone obviously thinks that owls just hoots and go hoot or whatever.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:53.880
 But they shriek, yap, chitter, squeal, squawk, warble. This is all from the book that you read.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:58.520
 The Suty Owl makes a noise. It only speaks to Matthew Corbett. Really?

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:07.720
 What's that, Suty Owl? Is it named after us? No, it's because it's Suty as in the colour of

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:16.520
 Sutt. They make a sound like a dropping bomb. Wow, that's amazing. I'm not sure if they have the

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:21.800
 bomb bit at the end. I think it's just the thing. That's very cool. And the northern sore wet owl,

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:28.600
 if he wants to find a, if it's a male and wants to find a female, then he does exactly 112 toots

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:34.680
 per minute to try and attract her. And he'll do that from half an hour after sunset until half an

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:42.840
 hour before sunrise. So all night he's doing 112 toots per minute. Wow. Isn't that incredible?

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:48.840
 If a female comes into his territory and he notices her, he ratches it up to 260 toots per

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:56.360
 minute. Right. And then if she buggers off, then he'll follow her doing 160 toots per minute.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:02.760
 Wow. Do they have secular breathing? Is it like beatboxing? Can they do...

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.760
 It's a great question. You probably need that, wouldn't you? I would say so. I don't know how

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:11.480
 the syrinx of Owl works, but yeah, you would think they would have to breathe as well.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:16.920
 Here's another question. It's so odd that this is a part of the show because of the last fact,

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:24.440
 but we used to leave my sister's Barbie dolls outside on a little veranda bit in Australia

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.320
 where we lived. And we didn't play with them for a long time because none of them could stand.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:37.640
 She lost interest. And we went out one day and we got the toys out. And Barbie was basically

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:44.200
 hairless, bold-headed, right? And what we realized was a bird had been stealing strands of hair and

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:49.720
 making a nest in a tree up. And I looked online all day to see whether or not that is a real thing,

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.320
 because that's my memory of it, that we went out and we made that connection. And I saw there was

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:58.840
 one image of the Barbie doll in its hole as part of a bird's nest, so the bird had grabbed the hair

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:04.120
 and incorporated it into the nest. But do you think that's... Yeah, 100% that happens.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:09.400
 And it does happen in Owls as well. So the burrowing owl will try and put loads of really

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:16.200
 impressive stuff in his burrow. One to impress the females, but another one to say, "I'm so great,

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:24.120
 I managed to get all this stuff." And so they'll get corn stalks, corn cobs, moss, Andy. Lovely.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:29.560
 Yeah, lovely. The vertebrae of deer, sometimes they'll put on the outside. This is like decorating

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:34.680
 the nest, but they will take lots of things that humans have put, like bits of cloth and stuff like

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:40.600
 that, bits of concrete. And the idea, and always the idea is that the more difficult it is for

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.880
 an owl to get it, the more impressive it is to the female and also to the other males that he

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.000
 doesn't want in his area. So if I got all these bits of concrete, you do not want to fuck with me.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.880
 I need to move us on, guys, to our next fact. I have a fact, but it's a bit sad. Oh, okay.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.960
 Can I say it anyway? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm really sorry about this. Famous owl owners.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.960
 Uh-huh. Are you asking for them? Yeah, why not? Florence Nightingale.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.160
 Yep. Oh. Well, that was the one. Florence Nightingale.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:13.400
 You said it's a sad fact, but I feel pretty happy.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.160
 I was wondering if anyone might go anywhere else, but no, yeah, Florence Nightingale.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.640
 Harry Potter. Yeah, everyone at Harry Potter's got an owl.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.440
 Sting. Sting. I'm taking a punt.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:30.840
 Florence Nightingale, she had an owl called Athena, which she took from some little boys,

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:35.000
 were kind of playing with this owl and maybe mistreating it. She looked after it. She looked

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.240
 after it her whole, or its whole life. And because when war broke out in Crimea,

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:47.400
 she had to go to the war. She couldn't take the owl with her. And so she put her owl in the attic,

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.440
 and she thought they would be able to just kill all the mice that lived there,

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:55.080
 and stuff like that would be fine. But it was domesticated so much it didn't know how to catch.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.040
 It's a sad fact. I should never have ended on this. And unfortunately, yeah.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.120
 But a medical owl fact. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:07.640
 That's the top of that. So lots of medieval recipes last year were digitized by Cambridge

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:14.680
 University, and a cure for gout is salting an owl, baking it until it be ground into a powder,

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.680
 mixing it with boar's grease to make a salve, and rubbing it on the sufferer's body to cure the

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:37.240
 gout. That's another sad fact. Every three seconds, another owl dies. In 2005, an owl who lived at

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:46.680
 Warwick Castle was given L plates because he was so bad at flying. Unfortunately, they were so heavy,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:58.120
 he crashed into the ground and died. All right, we need to move on. It's time for fact number three,

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:04.840
 and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that the poet William Blake's boss once visited

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:11.320
 him and his wife only to find them completely naked. It turns out they liked to cosplay as Adam

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:17.960
 and Eve. It's a great course. It's brilliant. It's brilliant, isn't it? He was a big fan of

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:23.320
 Milton, wasn't he, Blake? Milton, yeah. So actually what they were doing, so just to say

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:29.720
 Milton, Paradise Lost, they were reading some John Milton, and they possibly, William Blake,

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:35.320
 as well as being a poet, he was known artist, and he might have wanted to illustrate Milton,

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:40.920
 and they thought that maybe he persuaded his wife that they would both read it and pretend to be

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.560
 Adam and Eve, so that maybe he'd be able to see the postures that they got into, and he'd be able

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:52.040
 to do some good accurate drawings in his illustration of Milton. Very convoluted, isn't it? A way to get

00:29:52.040 --> 00:30:04.920
 your wife pregnant? Naked, yes. Same thing. But yeah, this is Blake's patron who was called Thomas

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:16.360
 Butts. Thomas Seymour Butts. One day he went to visit Blake because he was his patron. He was

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.760
 going to give him some money maybe, and he turned up, knocked on the door. Someone let him in,

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:25.000
 and it turned out that Blake and his wife were in the garden, and Blake said, "Come on in, it's only

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.640
 Adam and Eve, you know." And they were trying out naked postures. And this story comes from the first

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:36.440
 biography of William Blake by a guy called Alexander Gilchrist, is what made Blake famous,

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:43.400
 because he is a very famous poet now. He did, what did he do? Tiger, tiger, burning drawing,

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:48.040
 all that kind of stuff. But before this, he wasn't famous at all. This very, very well-researched

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:54.760
 biography has this story. Some of Blake's friends or relatives of their friends said that it might

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.880
 not have been true, but most modern biographers, I think, pretty much believe it. The ONDB says

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.040
 that it does not seem out of character that this happened. That they would be naked. Yeah.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:12.040
 He was a very visionary, imaginative, unusual guy. So in fact, he was constantly seeing angels and

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:17.240
 having visions, and he was just like a full-on inner life, basically. And in fact, there's a thing

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:22.680
 about him that's connected to something one of us has. Oh, yeah. What, Blake? Yeah. Daddy issues?

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:32.920
 It's mummy issues, I like that. No, so James has a fantasia. I do. And that's where you can't

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.640
 visualise things in your mind. Yeah, so if I close my eyes, I can't imagine what things look like.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:44.040
 Yeah, yeah. So Blake, we reckon, or historians reckon, might have had hyperphantasia, which is

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.240
 where you see lots and lots and lots of things that often aren't there. So it's sort of an

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.240
 opposite-y thing there. But yeah, a lot of people think... It is really interesting that, because

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.800
 like, if I close my eyes, I can just see nothing. It's just dark. I can't imagine things. Can't

00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.040
 imagine what Square looks like. Can't imagine what my wife looks like. Just can't imagine anything.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:06.360
 Can't imagine what Dan's mum looks like. Obviously, I can imagine that. Yeah. But it goes through

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:11.480
 different sort of phases. So there are some people who can just kind of make out slight images. There

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:17.000
 are some people who can almost see an entire movie that goes on in their head. Like, they can imagine

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.920
 their first day at school and they'll see it happening in their head. And then there are some

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:26.200
 people like Blake, who is a hyperphantasia, who can just imagine almost anything and things almost

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:31.320
 come into him and he's not sure if they're real or not real. Yeah, it sounds like a mad life he had.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.240
 Yeah, well, I mean, there's lots of people who were like, he was just quite mentally ill, but thought

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:39.240
 he was seeing visions. But it started from when he was really, really young. So when he was four years

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:45.320
 old, he first saw God's head in a window. And they described it as the first of many visions

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:50.040
 he would recount in the ordinary unempathetic tone in which we speak of trivial matters.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.880
 So he was just kind of completely on his side, God's heads in the window.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:33:00.760
 Well, that's yeah, because they came so much to him. It wasn't just angels and gods, it was the past

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.320
 people of the world. So kings and famous artists and stuff like that to the point where he would

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:10.520
 be sitting there, say, have a conversation with William Wallace. He's just having a chat in his

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:15.080
 head and then he'd get pissed off because King Edward I would suddenly just blunder in and he'd

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.840
 be like, Edward, we're trying to have a chat here. What are you doing? He would get pissed off with

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:23.880
 the visions as well because there were too many going on. Yeah, interrupting. Incredible. That's

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:29.720
 weird because he painted the body of Edward I, the embalmed body of Edward I who died 400, 500

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.080
 years before. They opened up the tomb and he got to have a go at painting it. That is so weird,

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.680
 isn't it? The idea that they would just open up the tomb of a dead monarch and just say, oh,

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.720
 you can paint them for an hour and then we'll close it again. It was one hour. It was like a

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:47.160
 supermarket sweep thing and you had one hour to paint Edward I. And it was literally the king?

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:52.120
 It was the king. It was the Edward I. It was so weird. Has that ever been done since? 1774, they did it.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:57.400
 How old he was when he did that? Was he a child? No, he was young. He was young. Is he still around

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:03.800
 then? Is he in barmed bodies? No, all these people are dead. If he was in barmed, will he still be

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:09.480
 there? Yes, they sealed up the tomb again. We could bring Edward I up. Damien Hurst has him this

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.840
 year. Don't give him to Hurst. If you were going to open up the tomb of Edward, you should just

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:24.360
 slip into his arms a little mummified sex doll. Speaking of sex dolls, no, speaking of Catherine,

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:29.320
 Eve in this cosplay scenario, this roleplay, sexy roleplay they were having, apparently Catherine

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:34.440
 was great crack. She was like jokes. She was like a great cook. And one of the things that she used

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:39.960
 to do, despite being a great cook, was to serve up like empty plates as a reminder that he needed

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:45.160
 to start bringing some money home. Pointless when you're serving it to someone who has constant

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:54.920
 visions. He's like, well, hamburgers again. Apparently Blake really loved to eat cold

00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:00.120
 mutton and drink pints of porter from the local pub, but he didn't like wine glasses, which he

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:05.560
 considered an absurd affectation, said from someone who cosplays as Adam and Eve. And once he

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.080
 accepted a gift from admire, which was a whole bottle of walnut oil, he didn't know what to do

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:15.240
 with it. So he drank it all monger. Oh, my God. He and his wife seem to have had a very nice

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:21.320
 relationship in almost all the time. There was no evidence he was unfaithful to her

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.480
 ever. There was a bit of gossip, but they loved talking. They loved walking. They ran their

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:30.440
 whole business together because he was a printer basically. And she and he together worked out

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:35.560
 the printing process. And they designed, they engraved, they printed, they made their own ink.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.880
 Like they had this idea that if we can control every element of the production process,

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.560
 everything except printing their own paper, then we'll control all of it, we'll make a load of

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:49.400
 money. And they did not do that. It's tragic because he was obviously seen as one of the

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.600
 greatest geniuses ever produced. And yet his poems sold, I think songs of innocence and experience

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:59.880
 sold something like 20 copies in 30 years. It was really bad. Jerusalem sold nothing,

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:06.120
 did no business. Just absolutely nothing at all. So why was he allowed to paint a king?

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.440
 Like what was the lead? I don't know. I think he was really quite young at that time. So I think

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:15.560
 he might have been studying or whatever. But he also, I'm very envious of his death because

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:20.840
 he is someone who did not think death was scary. I'm someone who does get scared of death and the

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:25.080
 idea of no more consciousness. And I know a lot of people aren't, but he particularly believed

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:31.560
 in the afterlife so much that on his deathbed, he was literally singing with excitement on the day

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:36.120
 he died going, you know, I'm going to the next place. Yeah. Yeah. Like whatever the song was.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:41.160
 Those kind of sound like the words he would have used, right? As an amazing poet. But

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:46.040
 and so his wife was upset, but also at the same time, she was like, cool, I'll catch you, I'll

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:51.800
 catch you soon. And on her death day, she was calling to him as if he was in the next room going,

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:57.480
 I'll be with you in a minute, William. I'm on my way. What a great way out. Yeah. He was a good

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:03.240
 husband, I think. He once wrote that the female vulva is a little model of a chapel of God

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:12.360
 that husbands must daily worship. Okay. Wow. Yeah, it's nice. It is nice. It's like an eternal chamber,

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:18.680
 you might say. And he's popular culture wise. You can see his footprint everywhere in ways

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:25.720
 you might not recognize. I'm like your sister's Barbie. So okay, the band, The Doors, The Doors

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:31.480
 of Perception, that was a Blake poem that that's where Jim Morrison and the band got that line from.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:37.880
 So that's down to Blake. Allen Ginsberg, one of the great American beat poets, read a poem of his

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:42.520
 and he felt the presence of God. And he said, he said immediately afterwards, oh my God,

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:48.120
 I've just experienced something I've never experienced before. This poem and the LSD I took.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:55.560
 I don't know if there was LSD, but he, yeah. So presence of God stuff. Do people sort of know

00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:01.080
 what Jerusalem is about? Because it's a series of weird interlinked questions. I thought it was like

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:07.480
 that Jerusalem comes to England or something like maybe Joseph of Arimathea is going to come to

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.080
 England or something. That's it. And did those feet in ancient times walk up on England's mountains

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:17.480
 green? It's about the myth that Jesus went to Glastonbury. That's literally what there was a

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:26.600
 myth that Jesus attended Glastonbury. So Jesus had a great uncle who was Joseph of Arimathea,

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:34.280
 like James says. And he was a sailor and maybe he came to Cornwall to buy some tin. And then maybe

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:41.160
 they walked around Glastonbury for a bit. And this is when Jesus was tiny. And that was the idea

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:46.120
 behind that. That was the idea that Blake was writing about. In fact, it turns out Jesus didn't

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:52.280
 go to Glastonbury, obviously. The story was made up by monks in the 12th century to boost the

00:38:52.280 --> 00:39:00.600
 tourism industry of the area. It's such a good scam. Okay, great. 1184, you're a monk. Your abbey's

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:05.160
 burned down. Nightmare. You need to rebuild it. You need to raise some cash. So all you do is you

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.080
 just say King Arthur came from here, you know, and no one can prove you wrong because it's the

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.240
 12th century. They don't know fact checkers. And then King Arthur, you just add Jesus into

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:18.200
 that and say, oh, Jesus came here too, actually. And the monks, this was the great bit of the con.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:23.880
 They built a wooden church in a style that would have been built centuries before to make it look

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:29.720
 like their monastery was way older and might have hosted King Arthur and Jesus. At the same time.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:35.080
 I don't know if there was a kind of supergroup element to it, but it was kind of like, it was

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:40.360
 just like, oh, this is a very, very old place. That was their claim. And it was nonsense from

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.920
 start to finish, but it worked because Glastonbury became the second richest abbey in the entire

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:49.320
 country, partly because of this myth of, oh, yeah, Jesus, he was here. I've always said it,

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:56.120
 you can't trust bugs. Well, they got their comeuppance. You'll be glad to hear Sophie, just 400

00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:02.360
 years later. And what was the comeuppance? They had to say 12 Hail Marys. That was the dissolution

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:15.480
 of the monasteries. I admit, as a pretty neat reference to make, sorry. Okay, it is time for

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:22.600
 our final fact of the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that Lady Bird orgasms last

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:30.280
 for 30 minutes. Pretty astonishing 30 minutes. Yeah. So their sex can last up to nine hours.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:35.800
 So hence that's proportional orgasm, possibly to the amount of sex time that they're having.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.360
 Well, yeah, what's that? What did you say? Half an hour. There's one 18th of the total

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.640
 time having sex. So that's a full second orgasm. Two minutes. Yep.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:50.040
 Check that. Carry on. Wait, did you say two minutes? No, my numbers are all off then.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:58.360
 So yeah, so they, yeah, nine hours. Nine hours. And actually during that time, the female might

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:03.800
 often get a bit bored and go around looking for food while the male is attached to the back of her.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:08.280
 Well, that's the weird thing. There's been, they've seen sometimes this is how clueless the male Lady

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:13.080
 Bird is during the sex that sometimes they'll get four hours into the sex and they'll be like,

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:20.920
 oh, she's dead. They don't even know that for four hours they were sleeping with a dead Lady Bird.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:28.040
 It's not incredible. Males are very, what's the one I'm looking for? Necrophilic?

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:33.320
 No, they're just sort of they're very inattentive, male Lady Birds. They're very...

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.800
 Are you being an apologist for Necrophilia, male Lady Birds?

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:40.840
 I cannot stress enough that I don't think our puny human judgment is applying this universe.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:46.920
 No, so if a male Lady Bird meets another Lady Bird, he will climb on top of it no matter what.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:51.240
 Oh, regardless. Regardless. And it might not be a female, you know. So Warwick University wrote

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:56.360
 an amazing study about the love lives of Lady Birds and they reported that if a male meets

00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:00.040
 another he will immediately make a full-hearted attempt to climb on top of the other one.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.880
 If he discovers that he has mounted another male, he will retreat immediately.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.680
 But if he was lucky to have met a female, he will try to sleep with her.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:11.080
 So they don't notice anything really. They just bump into another Lady Bird and start

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:15.480
 climbing up it. Yeah, because they can only see two centimetres ahead of them.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.560
 So if there's something that looks a little bit like a Lady Bird there, you might as well have a go.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.520
 Gosh. Really? And sometimes female Lady Birds get mounted by male Lady Birds,

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.040
 which are not even the same species of Lady Bird. Yeah. And they say, "What are you doing?

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:36.760
 We're not even the same thing." I mean, it's hard to tell the gender of a Lady Bird from two

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:42.200
 centimetres' sight. But it's your Lady Bird. But you're all Lady Birds. It's not Lady Birds and

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:47.240
 Laddie Birds. It's all Lady Birds. Yeah. They're all Lady Birds. You all look basically the same,

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.000
 even though you can have different colours of Lady Bird. You can have red Lady Birds,

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.680
 orange Lady Birds, black Lady Birds, blue Lady Birds. Wait, maybe I'll make that one up.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:01.960
 Orange, black, brown and red. Those are the main types. There have been reports of

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:09.320
 purple Lady Birds, but those are unreliable. One thing that I really like to my Lady Bird

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:14.040
 research is that they're not a lot of Lady Birds in popular culture, but there is one Lady Bird

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.760
 who is possibly Pixar's first transgender character, which is Francis from A Bugs Life.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:25.400
 If Francis from A Bugs Life is constantly being misgendered as a lady, which he gets very upset

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:32.120
 about, but if the Pixar forums, people have, I suppose, that maybe Francis is a

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.720
 delusion to a trans character. You're all taking that very seriously. Pixar did not do that.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:41.320
 But it is a constantly misgendered Lady Bird in A Bugs Life.

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:46.040
 It's hard to tell the species of Lady Bird because in the UK we have a seven-spot Lady Bird,

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.520
 which is the most common, but you might get a 22-spot Lady Bird, a 13-spot Lady Bird,

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:55.400
 10-spot Lady Bird, two-spot Lady Bird, 18-spot Lady Bird. These are all different species.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.680
 And you know how you can tell which is which? Oh, number of spots. No.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:05.800
 This is the amazing thing. Some seven-spot Lady Birds can have anywhere between about five and

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:12.200
 nine spots, and 11-spot Lady Birds can have something like nine to maybe 15, something like that.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.880
 What was the point of anything then? What was the point of science?

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:21.720
 It's most of them do have the number of spots that their name says, but the problem is that some of

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:26.680
 them don't, and like some of the spots sort of merge into each other, so you can have a seven-spot,

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:30.920
 but actually five of the spots sort of all molded into one spot, so it's like just three spots.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.920
 You know what? I'm coming around to the point of view of the male Lady Bird here.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.560
 If you don't even have the decency to have the number of spots that your literal name is,

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:42.680
 that's crazy. Yeah, that's another crazy thing is that if they're mating, because obviously,

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:47.800
 as I said, it can go up to nine hours, if they're mating and it gets the sun down

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:54.200
 and the temperature drops, they become immobilized and they're just kind of stuck there. Yeah.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:58.040
 Oh my god, so if you're going to do nine hours, you pretty much have to start

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.520
 quite early in the morning, don't you? There's no point starting at midday because it's going to be...

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:07.000
 Yeah, you've got to time it right, but you know, another argument in my favor for the solar powered

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 arms to give you night time energy. Six arms. Six arms. Six arms, yeah. I've got quite a cute Lady

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.520
 Bird fact. Do you know who the Lady Bird's named after? A German cool girl? No, she's named...

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:26.440
 She's slushy. They, the Lady Bird's are named after people think in lots of languages are Lady

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:32.440
 the Virgin Mary. It was often depicted wearing a red cloak in like lots of things, but the word

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:39.480
 Lady Bird in other languages and Irish, it's, I can't say it, it's boy day. Okay. It means God's

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:46.920
 little cow. God's little cow. I feel like the Virgin Mary in heaven is like... Yeah, yeah.

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:54.520
 So the German word for Lady Bird is Marian Kaffa, which is Mary Beatles. It's using the

00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:08.200
 surname of Virgin Mary in that instance. Her first name was Virgin. Mum, Dad, why did you name me that?

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:14.040
 Can we talk a bit about the Lady Bird explosion of 1976? Yes, please. This is great. Okay.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:23.080
 So Dan's mum was just a teenager. This is a thing that happened in 1976. The weather conditions

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:27.960
 for some reason were right. So 1975 was quite a good summer, then the winter was mild, then the

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:32.120
 spring was warm, right? So what you had, you had this, you had all the preconditions for this amazing

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:39.800
 number of Lady Bird's. Apparently during the summer of 1976, 400 miles of tide line on the South and

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:44.120
 East coast of England were nothing but Lady Bird's. Really? They were just solid Lady Bird's.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:49.720
 What? They think there might have been something like 23 billion Lady Bird's in the tide line at

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:55.240
 any one time, which is more than double the number of humans there have ever been.

00:46:55.240 --> 00:47:01.320
 This is 1976. This is 1976. This is for one particular day in 1976, that 23 billion number.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:05.880
 Does anyone here must have been of age in 1976? Does anyone remember that?

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.880
 There were a lot of Lady Bird's. There were a lot of Lady Bird's!

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:17.480
 It's good. Well, burration, corroboration. There were a lot of Lady Bird's. You weren't wrong. There

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:22.920
 were a lot of Lady Bird's. That's the happiest I've ever been. That's how we do our fact checking.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:30.200
 The author who was writing about this, who was, his surname was Majeris, said, "I was walking in

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:35.080
 Brighton in late July. I tried a little experiment, walking along the almost deserted beach with a

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:41.000
 cone of yellowish vanilla ice cream held inside my jacket. I then held it out and timed how long

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.360
 it took to become completely submerged in Lady Bird's." Oh my God, like hundreds and thousands.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:54.360
 Yeah. Well, probably only 40 or 50, but no, the point is, 28 seconds. 28 seconds after he got the

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:58.840
 ice cream out of his coat, it was covered in Lady Bird's. That's how many there were just around.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:06.040
 Wow. It was huge. Oh my God. Yeah. They fly so fast as well. They fly as fast as like a fast horse runs.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:14.040
 That's how fast. That's fast. That's fast, yeah. That's what, like, yeah. And yet the plans for the

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:19.240
 Lady Bird Grand National seem never, ever to get going. So sad. What's that, 40 miles an hour?

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:24.680
 They can't go 40 miles an hour. They go really fast. If it's windy. Yeah, yeah.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:29.720
 Who's timing a Lady Bird? There is a Norse legend that a Lady Bird, the Lady Bird came to Earth on

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:33.720
 a bolt of lightning. So it's probably just someone watching her. Whoa, yeah. That's cool. You're

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:39.720
 like, "That's like a fast horse." That's amazing. They get pubic lice as well, Lady Bird's.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:45.160
 Are they? Yeah, it's the equivalent. So it's pubic lice. I'm doing air quotes here. Ectoparasitic

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:50.360
 mites is what they get. But they, so they, Lady Birds are just absolutely riddled with STDs,

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:56.040
 because they shag so much and they spread it. So the mites hide underneath the shell. So you would

00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:04.440
 never see you in the mites. Although I've seen photos of STD riddled Lady Birds and it's...

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:15.080
 Those spots are natural, Dan. Well, I started off as a seven-spot, but I don't know what's going on here.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:21.160
 But it's hard to hide when you see like a really riddled, so like, because they

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.920
 get like fungi and stuff like that. So they come in and they look like they're wearing greenery on

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:29.720
 them. The fungi one's interesting because that has become a real problem over the last few years.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:34.040
 Yeah. Pretty much most of the Lady Birds you get in this country and around the world are starting

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:39.480
 to get this fungi. But we don't know for sure that it's harmful. So we know that they're all

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:44.360
 getting it and they all seem to get it from sex or actually in a nice way. Sometimes they like

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:49.320
 to cuddle together and they can catch the fungus that way. So it's not always an STD. But we don't

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:53.640
 know for sure that it's harmful. It could be just like getting athlete's foot. So it could be just

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:57.960
 like we all have a big cuddle. We all get athlete's foot and we're kind of fine. Might be a little bit

00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:01.880
 uncomfortable. Darling, it's fine. We were we were cuddling and then I came home and that was it.

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.640
 They're just pubic lice in air quotes. It's fine.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:10.120
 I feel like we've got quite personal with the Lady Birds.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:13.240
 Well, can I say something about orgasms then very quickly?

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.280
 Yeah. Yes. Clean it up.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:21.800
 So psychologists at Madrid University collected a lot of images of the faces of people when they

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:29.160
 orgasmed and they noted that 92 percent had their eyes closed, 79 percent had a dropping of the jaw

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:34.440
 and 64 percent were frowning. So if you're having sex with your partner is eyes shut,

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.400
 slack jawed with a frown on their face, then it means you're doing it right.

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:42.360
 I've never been more conscious of the muscles of my face.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.480
 Not wanting to do anything with them.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:50.120
 Oh, that's so interesting, James. Thank you.

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.920
 It's just science then.

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.040
 No, I know. I love science.

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.160
 I've got orgasm fat.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.040
 Oh, yeah. Go for it.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:03.400
 So if we imagine if we've got the fantasy of the two Lady Birds having sex, they reach climates,

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:07.800
 the sun goes down and they're frozen like that forever, you think, what an amazing way to go?

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.200
 Yes.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:13.160
 And so I was like, are there any people who were famously or allegedly died during sex?

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:13.960
 Yeah, that's good.

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:19.240
 And there is a list of people who have allegedly died at the point of climates and it's got one

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:25.800
 president and four popes. Four popes. Wow.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:31.960
 Pope Leo the 7th, Pope John the 12th, Pope John the 18th, Pope Paul the 2nd.

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.680
 They all apparently died while shagging.

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:35.400
 Oh, my God.

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.000
 Funny fact, they all died on the same day.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.600
 There was a lot of white smoke.

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.080
 Well, that's it. That's all of our facts.

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.760
 Thank you so much for listening.
