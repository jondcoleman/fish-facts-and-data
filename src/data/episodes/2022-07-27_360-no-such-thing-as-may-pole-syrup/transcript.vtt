 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.120
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.320
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.280
 Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.120
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.640
 Starting with fact number one and that's my fact. My fact this week is that in the 1910s

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.960
 animal dances including the camel walk, the turkey trot, the crab step, the chicken flip,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.360
 and the kangaroo dip was so controversial they were banned at the White House,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.960
 condemned by the Pope and warned against by doctors. Wow, why were they so bad? Were they

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.040
 sexy? I bet they were sexy dances they always are aren't they? I watched the turkey trot,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.440
 you could argue there's a bit of sex in there but ultimately you just look like an idiot I think.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.400
 I mean what could sound sexier than the crab step? It's very raunchy stuff, the chicken flip,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.160
 there are all these, no the sloth squeeze was another one? Yeah, the boll weevil wiggle,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.440
 that was another one. It doesn't exactly sound like twerking, it's they're quite, they're very tame

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.680
 from. They were tame, yeah but they were sort of that moment where it felt like people were

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.440
 liberating and this was seen as people going out and having a wild time and they really did take

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.120
 it seriously so a number of US cities really cracked down on it and in Boston, John F. Kennedy's

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.360
 grandfather who was the mayor ordered it so that there was a matron and policeman posted to every

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.160
 dance hall in the city and they would crack down on anyone they saw doing that. They had people,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.240
 just police forces out arresting whole groups, it was a bit of a mania. A lot of the reporters at

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.000
 the time said they were, to be fair to the people banning them, actual imitations of the sex acts

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.360
 of these animals. Now it is quite difficult to believe that when you watch for instance a turkey

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.800
 trot which sort of involves jumping, hopping to one side and then hopping to the other side and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.720
 then flapping your wings a bit but they were meant to be kind of re-enacting sex between these

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.160
 creatures. It feels to me that if that's the way turkeys have sex then we'd all be going hungry at

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.560
 Christmas because there would be not many bacon turkeys around. Well as no doubt people would

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.360
 mention I don't think any turkey that we eat has sex does it? I think oh my god imagine if the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.080
 turkey trot dance was someone extracting some semen from your penis and then putting it in a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.800
 little test tube and then shoving it into your partner. It would be the turkey base instead of

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.440
 the turkey trot as a dance. I really like what you said about the White House Dan. This is amazing

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.240
 that in 1913 there was going to be an inaugural ball for President Woodrow Wilson, obviously very

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.960
 exciting and then it was cancelled because just because of the risk that people might start doing

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.240
 the turkey trot and he denied that but the ball was cancelled it didn't go ahead and so there was

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.840
 no chance for anyone to do the the grizzly bear. Yeah he denied it probably because it wasn't

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.280
 true. Charlie that wasn't the reason. It was on the front page of the New York Times so the headline

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.600
 was Wilson banned ball fearing turkey trot and that was on Jan 13th 1913 and it was a big story but

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.800
 obviously yeah he denied that that would happen but it was it was a real story. It was from White

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.040
 House Insiders so it was just I reckon he probably did ban it because of that. It was probably like

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.640
 I don't love spending all this money and he might have been specifically worried about his

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.560
 daughters who are massive fans of animal dances so he knew he knew the underworld of animal dancing.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.560
 So one person who intervened in this debate was the ex-president of the University of Missouri's

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.040
 medical school. He was a guy called Dr. S Grover and he claimed in 1915 that it led to insanity

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.480
 to do these dances. He said many of the cases of insanity developed in the United States within

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.560
 the last few years may be traced to modern eccentric dances. One tenth of the insane of this country

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.720
 have lost their mind on account of troubles which may commonly be traced to modern dances.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.280
 One in ten. They also said that it would give you some kind of foot illness didn't it? It was like

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.080
 there was like a turkey trot photo turkey trot and stuff or something like that which would

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.600
 make you lame if you did this too much. But then some doctors said it was good for you so there

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.160
 was a doctor called Dr. A. A. Brill who sounds like a really good doctor and he said that modern

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.760
 dances should be considered beneficial and they're soothing to the pop place as rocking is to an infant.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.280
 So like when you're rock and rolling you're also kind of being rocked like a baby.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.280
 It's like everything. It's probably best done in moderation isn't it? I'm sure if you did dance for

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.480
 14 hours a day you would actually get quite sore feet and I think that's absolutely fair enough.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.600
 I just think it's unlikely many people were doing that. Yeah. And it was I think it was tango foot

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:14.560
 was the precursor to that which was a big scare. There was a really nice news article from 1914

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.280
 which pointed out that no sooner has a new entrancing diversion come in than someone appears

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.240
 to forbid it and it pointed out that tango foot is the modern version of bicycle knee and automobile

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.480
 face which I think I feel like we may have talked about those before. Also movie eye he said people

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.360
 used to tell us we'd all get movie eye from the cinemas and we haven't and it was quite a good

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.160
 article to remind you that whenever there's a new trend everyone always says this is going to ruin

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:52.480
 us. Yeah I always get Pokemon shin and Fortnite anus. We've got anyone binging us watch out for

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.560
 podcast ear lobe. Oh yeah. I want to know what Fortnite's anus is. Well the problem is people

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.920
 sit down playing video games for too long right and they sit in the same place and it can give you

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:11.200
 problems like tiles and hemorrhoids. No no no I'm making it all up. Oh okay I've just started

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.960
 playing Fortnite and I need to know if my anus is safe. You're allowed for no more than two weeks

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.320
 after that it's a problem. One of these animal dances survives today which is so exciting because

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.680
 I've never heard of the bunny hug or the there were others called the like the buzzard lobe. There

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.320
 was one called the fish walk. Did you hear that one? I mean that is the one thing that fish don't do.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:39.520
 Yeah insane but the one that survived into the modern age is the bunny hug because it kind of

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.800
 became the fox trot and the fox trot was coined and popularized around the same time as all these

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.040
 other dances and it was refined a bit and you know there are various sources to who exactly came up

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.000
 with it but it's basically a slightly more neat version of the bunny hug. But it's not named

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.240
 after the fox right it was named after a guy called fox that's what most people think these days.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.920
 I didn't know that. Yeah there was a guy called fox who was like the guy who popularized the

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.440
 fox trot and they think although it makes much more sense if there was a you know a grizzly bear

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.000
 jump and a bunny hug it makes sense that it would be named after a fox. All these dances were named

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.600
 after people the the turkey trot was named after Sir Leonard Turkey and yeah well the bunny hug

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.760
 there is a famous version of it being danced in a movie starring a man called John Bunny but he

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.920
 didn't invent it I think that just happened to be a coincidence. Really? Yeah he's one of the most

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.400
 well-known comedians of his day in America I've never heard of him but he's got a huge

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:41.600
 what was he called? John Bunny. Not Jack Benny you just misread it. Yeah John Bunny. So speaking

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:50.960
 of band dances have you guys heard of the cushion dance? No I haven't. This is the 16th 17th century

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.720
 version of the turkey trot because it was a scandalous sexy dance and what it is is you run

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.680
 around the place with a cushion for a bit you dance around holding a cushion and then you put it down

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.760
 in front of a woman and she will kneel on it and then you give her. Give you a blow job. No

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:16.720
 you give her a kiss on the cheek and then you pick up the cushion and you dance around a bit

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.640
 more and it's very innocent and sweet. It's not as sexy as I thought it was going to be.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.600
 I sort of assumed the blow, I mean that's what you're led to believe by the description.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.520
 It's a completely innocuous dance but it was very scandalous at the time.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:38.480
 Oh god I'm blushing over zoom. Take your camera down. Did the woman get to get up before you took

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.000
 the cushion out or was it a sort of tablecloth trick where you spawn her off the cushion?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.680
 I don't know maybe she gets the cushion then. I haven't actually got the full mechanics of

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.960
 it worked out. Maybe it's like past the cushion and then she gets to put the cushion down in front

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.400
 of someone else. Who gives her Codilingus? No okay we have to stop this. But there was a

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.600
 worry right. I read about this cushion dance which they were saying a story that in 1633

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.960
 the idea is that it would lead to sexual acts and a couple were accused I think after maybe having

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.440
 done this dance and taking it a bit further of having sex against the village maypole.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:18.640
 That's going to be uncomfortable. Yeah you're going to end up with maypole anus.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.720
 The only reason they were found out was because apparently there was a bell on top of it which

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:32.160
 they didn't know about which was alerting the neighbour. That's the story all right. If I had

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.120
 to write that up in a 16th century newspaper I would make the headline maypole sauce okay.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.640
 So it's like a pun on maypole sauce but it's the saucy thing happening up against the maypole.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.040
 Did they have maypole sauce back then? No they didn't I guess. Wow so you would have been going

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:54.640
 to get a whole new 1633 yeah they had maypole sauce. It's always called maypole syrup so I don't

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:02.800
 know why we're even talking about it. The animal dances were part of the ragtime genre really

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.960
 weren't they? It was just part of the much broader ragtime era which is basically the first jazz or

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:15.200
 the precursor to jazz. It's the first time you started having syncopated ragged rhythm and the

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:21.040
 story of ragtime is just it's kind of cool. It's this Scott Joplin who's the king of ragtime.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.280
 He'd been born to a former enslaved person who used to play the violin for plantation parties so

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:32.720
 that's where he got his musical skill and he died eventually in 1917 I think of syphilis and he died

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.880
 really upset that he'd never been able to be famous for a serious music and today he gets 200,000

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:45.360
 listens a month on Spotify which is just such a nice thing to not be able to tell him. Yeah and he

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:52.640
 will be I guess he'll be able to earn 15 cents from those 200,000. But luckily the turn of the

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.000
 20th century that will have bought him a lot of stuff right so the problem is not that Spotify

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.120
 isn't paying people enough it's that they're not paying people 100 years ago. Oh I think we're just

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:11.920
 about guaranteed we still get to be hosted cool. The conga was illegal in Cuba for a while I don't

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:18.480
 think it still is might be. This was due to a politician called Desiderio and as the second

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:25.360
 and the reason was because it had come over to Cuba from Africa and they thought that it had

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:31.840
 lots of immoral gestures and semi-naked people doing the conga everywhere. Like at weddings.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:38.960
 Yeah that conga you know where you hold onto the waist of someone behind. Now we do the blowjob.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:48.160
 So it was banned by this politician but then the politician ended up being put in prison like

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:54.560
 politicians often do in some countries and the son of the politician called Desi Arnaz he

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:01.760
 fled to America and then became like the king of the conga. Like he went around the whole of America

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.800
 touring going on TV going to all the different cities teaching them the conga and what I like

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.000
 to think is that when he went from one city to the other everyone just followed him and did the

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.560
 conga with him from you know LA to San Francisco to Seattle. You can see the king of conga coming

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:24.880
 from a long way away if you run his way into town. I'm very impressed if you managed to make a living

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.360
 out of teaching people the conga because I would say it is at maximum my one lesson dance unless

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.080
 it's got all right but I last did it. 300 million people in America that's a lot of lessons.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.520
 Yeah and you didn't even know you're supposed to take your clothes off and

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:53.120
 Okay it is time for fact number two and that is James. Okay my fact this week

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:58.320
 is that there is a type of pasta that only three women in the world know how to make.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:06.080
 Oh will we have heard of it? Is it fusilli? It's not going to be spaghetti is it? It's not

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.840
 going to be. They're amazingly productive like they're kingpins. You will have heard of it because

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.480
 you've spent the last couple of days researching about it but I think the people at home will not

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:24.320
 have heard of it so this is called Su Filendeu literally threads of God and it's a Sardinian

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:32.640
 pasta and it's made once a year for the feast of San Francisco and there is basically a group of

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:38.320
 women who have always been able to make it and they pass the recipe down to their daughters who

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.680
 pass it down to their daughters who pass it down to their daughters but there are only three women

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:51.280
 left who know how to do it really. One of them is a lady called Paola Abrini and her niece and her

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.320
 sister-in-law all know how to do it but her daughters aren't really that interested they kind of know

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:02.240
 the technique but it's really really complicated and they're not particularly good at it and because

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.760
 all these three women who are doing it are all kind of I wouldn't say old but getting that way

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:13.520
 you know in the 50s and 60s the people are a little bit worried that this might die out so

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.480
 we need to get more people learning quick and we tried to teach Jamie Oliver but he just couldn't

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:24.560
 hack it. Well this is the weird thing about it it's that it's not even like it's a secret recipe

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.480
 it's not something that they're hiding they're constantly trying to teach it to people

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.400
 including Jamie Oliver and after a few hours of like nah bullshit I'm not doing this. Are we

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.240
 serious that Jamie Oliver's tried to learn it? Yeah he tried to do it he tried to do it for two

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.120
 hours and gave up. Wow. It's for the people at home I'll tell you how to do it because I know

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.960
 how to do it basically you get some semolina wheat you get some water you get some salt you need it

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:52.080
 and need it and need it and then at just the right moment which is the main difficult part

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:58.880
 then you put it into loads and loads of really really really fine strings you get 256 of these

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.520
 filaments and you put them all together and then kind of mesh them all up and then cut it up and

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:09.840
 then that's your pasta and then you put it with some tasty sheep's broth and some pecorino cheese

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:15.600
 bish bash bosh that's basically a hello fresh recipe that I've given you there isn't it? Yeah

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.160
 it went a bit Jamie Oliver at the end when he's a bish bash bosh and he's a pucker.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:28.960
 It's like that is the thing if you do get a hello fresh and it is the Sue Philandau meal

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.240
 it will take you exactly 48 years to do this. Although it wouldn't be it would be one of those

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.680
 annoying recipes because that's just the prep so it would say cook time 12 minutes and then at the

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:46.400
 very end it would say prep time 10 years and lifetime yeah so actually lots of people know

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.400
 how to make it it's just the fact that only three people can make it. Yeah it's really really difficult

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:55.760
 because you just need to get at exactly the right moment it's the elasticity of the dough that you

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.800
 need to get perfectly right because if you don't do it perfectly you can't make these threads thin

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:06.800
 enough and you can only do it from playing with the dough and just knowing from generation on

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.160
 generation and generation and knowledge to knowledge to knowledge just knowing the exact

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.920
 moment to do it. But the other thing is it's given an impression that it's much harder to learn

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.240
 because you know Jamie Oliver stopped after two hours I think it's fair enough that he didn't

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.800
 master it in two hours this has been a generational thing that's passed on that's you know you need

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.240
 two weeks. Because if you're Jamie Oliver if you're Jamie Oliver you can in that time you could

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:31.600
 have made eight of your 15 minute meals. That's an interesting way of cooking. I did read because

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.400
 these women they're as you said James right they're in the same family so one of their male

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.760
 relatives is currently one of the Luke Skywalker figures who is in the process of learning how to

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:48.800
 make it to their Yoda. He's obviously also I guess Sardinian he's called Leo Gilsemino

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:55.440
 and he's Aussie. Well he's Australian. Yeah I mean he's their family so I don't know when

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.240
 he moved to Australia or when the family moved but yeah they've given him a little masterclass

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:06.000
 and he has a certificate but I think he's still in the training zone. Yeah so basically it's kind

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.960
 of a tradition where they have these kind of matrilineal or matriarchal cuisines which you do

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.840
 pass on from mother to daughter to daughter to daughter but because they're so worried about

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.600
 this dying out they have recently said okay we're going to let men do it as well

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:25.280
 and they are trying to teach more and more people. I actually read this article in the BBC I think it

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.880
 was in 2016 so it could be possible that few people have picked it up since then but if they

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.120
 have they won't be nearly as good as these three women who absolutely smash it every time because

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:40.400
 they don't have the special sense. Is that you know we've done how you know we have more than five

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:47.280
 senses. Is the special ability to feel pasta. I don't think that's an X-Men character we're

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:55.520
 going to see covered up. Actually I just thought of something which is that you know how we were

00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:02.560
 talking about maple sauce earlier on Andy. Yes well the related food maple syrup is also was

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.720
 traditionally a thing that passed from mother to daughter to mother to daughter because in the

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:15.440
 first peoples tribes of Canada you the men would often go out hunting and the women would be in

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:21.840
 charge of all of the planting and stuff like that and the maple syrup came in that territory

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:27.760
 and so you would as a woman you would go to your maple grove and you would get the syrup every year

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:33.360
 which would give lots of energy to your to your tribes but you would pass on the knowledge to

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.600
 your daughter and you would even pass on your groves to your daughter as well so wherever

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.480
 your grove of maples was that would be yours through generations through generations through

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.640
 generations so there are quite a few of these kind of metrilineal cuisines around the world

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.760
 and you pass that would be you pass on the knowledge of you make a hole in the tree and wait

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.840
 for the stuff to come out of it because that I like did the women tell the men it was a really

00:18:53.840 --> 00:19:00.400
 complicated process it's the equivalent of the conga king passing it on to his conga son

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:08.000
 he's next in line literally first you put a hole in the tree then you wait for the sap to come out

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.640
 no because actually there's more to it with maple syrup oh you've got to concentrate it a little

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.520
 bit you've got to lose some of the fluids you have to leave it out overnight so it freezes and all

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.280
 the water comes to the top and then you skim off the water and then you boil it to get rid of more

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:29.600
 of the water it's like that's what my mum told me anyway just on pasta shapes oh yeah do you guys

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:37.760
 know you know the tortelloni the little wrapped up parcel thing uh yeah I think I call it tortellini

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:43.440
 I call it tortellini oh I'm sorry tortellini sorry sorry tortellini that shape is supposedly based

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:50.400
 on Lucrezia Borgia's naval and you know Lucrezia Borgia of the famous poisoning but aristocratic

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:56.880
 Borgia family she was staying in an inn uh in Italy and the innkeeper um was so excited to have

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.360
 this beautiful aristocratic lady in his inn that he crept up to the keyhole to have a to have a

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.880
 perv but all he could see was the naval through her navel through the door but what a naval foar

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:14.240
 and he rushed down to the kitchen to recreate it making pasta for him that's a terrible ouchy she

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:22.960
 had isn't it it's an absolutely fucked up umbilical cord coming right there and he um also the next

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:30.560
 day he went up and saw her husband and invented the Bologna sausage didn't he do you know when

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:38.400
 my past has so many different shapes um well I think people think they know or the theory is

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.880
 that the reason it does and it is a ridiculous number so there are more than 300 pasta shapes and

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:49.680
 I think 1300 different pasta names and it's partly because it was so it was such rivalry

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:55.280
 throughout Italy so some of the earliest Italian gills were pasta guilds the vermicelli and the

00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:01.280
 macaroni and um you'd have lots of little different localities trying to rival each

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.520
 other's pasta quality with their own pasta and so you made it into one into a bow tie and then

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.640
 you'd make your own spiral to be like our spirals are better than their bow ties and it was very

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.280
 heated and they used to get so I mean they got so competitive that the pope had to step in a few

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:22.560
 times I think between pasta guilds and he ruled in the 1400s he ruled that pasta making illegal

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.720
 pasta making would be punished by a fine and three lashings of a whip because you know if you're

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.280
 not allowed if you're not in the guild that's allowed to make that twirly pasta then you're

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.960
 going to be beaten I tell you what I didn't really appreciate until we did the research for this

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:40.720
 episode how busy the pope's life actually is he's just constantly banning pasta shapes or turkey

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:47.920
 trot dances the guy's furious calling out stuff he's got a lot on yeah there was actually um with

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.000
 what you were saying with these sort of um these guilds and so on it it went a bit further in the

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:59.440
 Renaissance courts there was there's one particular pasta shape which is causetti which um the idea is

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.000
 that it's imprinted with the coat of arms of the royal families that would eat it so you would have

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.760
 these these pieces of pasta that would each have the coat of arms to where you were eating on your

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:14.800
 plate which is pretty extraordinary I love that as a yeah because they're all they're all very there's

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.280
 this great book called the encyclopedia of pasta I don't know if you guys read about it in the course

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:28.560
 of this research by oretta what's it about oretta zanini devita is her name and she's went round

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:34.320
 italy just asking every local person from a different town city village about the story

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:39.440
 behind a different kind of famous local pasta and she created this encyclopedia so it's a real

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:44.080
 firsthand encyclopedia and it's got all the stories about how the shapes came about there's

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:50.480
 the ave Maria pasta which is a great little one that's simply it's not anything to do with the

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.360
 shape it's about the timing of what you cook it for so you chuck it into the boiling water and if

00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.640
 you say a hail mary that's how long you cook it for the ave Maria um and there's a apparently a

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:06.160
 whole trinity of different pastas uh with the different lengths uh that you say the prayer to

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:12.480
 that will be the perfect cooking doesn't feel like a particularly long amount of time to cook pasta

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:17.600
 say the hail mary i don't know how long it takes to say a whole mary okay hail mary follow grace

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.280
 along it's with the dressed up that looks women invest in the fruits of thy womb jesus holy mary

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.520
 mother of god pray to us sinners now at the hour of death amen do you have a very quickly you're

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:32.160
 i think your pasta's very authentic change to be the most annoying priest as he's powering through

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.960
 the entire sermon hey i had to go through a lot of confessions in my time and had to get through a

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:49.680
 lot of hail maries okay it is time for fact number three and that is andy my fact is that every hour

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:55.920
 the buglers of krakow have to climb 272 steps play five notes then walk back down again

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:05.360
 and this is a job that you can have if you're a bugler and you live in krakow um they have this

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:11.920
 church called st mary's basilica and since 1392 uh on and off they've been doing this thing where

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:17.520
 every hour there's a bugle call from the top um it's called mary's fanfare it's only got five

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.800
 notes in it so actually it's it's not it goes up and down a bit and it takes about i don't know

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:29.760
 half a minute to play so it goes up and down but only on those five notes um and you play the tune

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.560
 to each point of the compass and um and then you stop and then you go back down again and then the

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:39.440
 next hour you climb back up again but actually don't you stop the fourth time you do it you stop

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:47.920
 halfway through i read um that's because in 1241 there was a bugler who was like telling about

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:54.000
 some mongols who were attacking the city and he was shot by an arrow uh halfway through his bugle

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.240
 and so in honor of this sky they they kind of stopped the last bugle well that's the story

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.760
 but there's a lot of stories about krakow i learned which we might get to in a bit but go on

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:13.040
 well it's first recorded in 1928 and from 1241 there's obviously quite a gap before anyone

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:19.440
 wrote it down so and it's first recorded by an american author who may have been locals may have

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.720
 played a trick on him but it might also have been an oral legend before that it's just that there

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:29.920
 isn't much written record but there was actually a trumpeter who did die on duty in 1901 so only

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.880
 about 20 years before this guy wrote the story down and he had played the tune three out of four

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.040
 times because you do it to each point of the compass so he did it three times but then he

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:44.160
 died of a heart condition before he could play it the fourth time so that might be where that sort

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:51.360
 of fed into local myth and yeah yeah that must have been such a weird moment for the town when

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:56.720
 you're waiting you're so used every hour to hearing these four and you're like what i don't

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:03.120
 go but i thought wasn't it even um did you say the first mention of the bugler is 1928 or the

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.360
 first mention of this legend is 1928 the mongol thing the bugle thing's been going for donkeys

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.520
 yes yeah because i read that the bugle thing even they only used to do it sort of once a day until

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:17.600
 the until the 20th century and then suddenly they decided to torture this guy by ramping up to once

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:24.240
 every hour there is a they're in a squad so i think you do you have to be a fireman by the way

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.760
 to have this job that's just part of the conditions for entry these days so the reason this is

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.120
 current now is because they just announced they're recruiting for a new one and they've had their

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:39.200
 first ever application from a woman for the position so great social progress is being made now if she

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:46.160
 gets it if she gets it yeah if she gets it um but it's for the audition process and it's crazy it's

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:51.760
 saying you got to in order to become a bugler for uh for the church you need to go through a whole

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:57.440
 process of doing chin-ups you need a beep fitness test um they have a medicine ball tossing thing

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:02.560
 that you need to do and you need to scale a 20 meter ladder at an angle of 75 degrees to ensure

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.480
 that you're not afraid of heights but i would have thought that all these things if you're a fireman

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.840
 you probably would already be able to glow up ladders wouldn't you no yeah that's true yeah i

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:18.000
 gotta say i have been to crack off on a stag do once and i think i might be right right about saying

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.320
 this is the square is basically just a load of bars all the way around it with mostly when i

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:28.320
 went there just full of stag do's so just that's that seems to be the only people who are enjoying

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:33.520
 these bugles is it market square is it the main square isn't it i think i remember hearing it when

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.680
 i was in crack off market square was the biggest square biggest medieval square in europe i think

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.160
 wasn't it it was yanesco heritage sort of it was one of the very first places to get yanesco

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:47.600
 heritage i think yeah it is beautiful it's really big and really cool and this st murray's tower

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.560
 is quite famous because it's got two towers that are slightly different heights

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.040
 and i know andy's going to tell me this isn't true now but i'm going to tell the story of why

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:04.080
 this happened so they had the church there and there was a guy who was in charge of crack off at

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:10.960
 the time who was called juke borislaus the modest okay and he's like we need some new towers here

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.600
 not too big because i'm modest but we need some new towers here we need two new towers

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.240
 and they tried to find the people to do it and they got two brothers one of whom was going

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.200
 to do one tower and one who would do the other tower one of the brothers did his tower and then

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:30.640
 the other brother did his tower slightly bigger and the brother with the shorter tower got really

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:37.280
 jealous and so killed his brother for doing such a bigger tower and then he could have made his

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.160
 tower back to the equal height but then he felt so guilty about killing his brother that he didn't

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.640
 do it anymore he's going to tell me that's not true either andy i'm not going to say that no way

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:52.880
 no it's probably it's probably not true crack doesn't make up for killing your brother i'll

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.880
 tell you that if i was murdered but then i found out that the person didn't actually go through

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:03.200
 with the stupid bet we had it's still not okay to murder you no you're right but there are great

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.440
 stories of crack off and i'm james the only reason i'm not going to tell you that your one isn't true

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:14.160
 is because the only other one i know is about of crack off is about the dragon who lived under the

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:21.360
 hill and it's a medieval story of crack off and the dragon loved eating virgins they all do don't

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:29.360
 they it's the whole species yeah there was only one virgin left after this huge virgin eating

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.560
 rampage that the dragon had been on anyway this poor cobbler filled up a sheepskin with sulfur

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:40.240
 and salt and then left that outside the dragon's cape anyway the dragon eats it and it's so full

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:46.160
 of salt that he feels so thirsty he drinks so much water at the dragon that he explodes and dies

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:51.040
 and then the cobbler is rewarded by getting married to the king's daughter who happens to be the

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:59.440
 last virgin in the city okay that's the story yeah and and the dragon's bones now hang out of the front

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:05.600
 of vavel cathedral which is in crack off it's the big cathedral there the bones hang from the door

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:11.440
 all the bones are they not the realness of the bones are they some bones some bones are there

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:16.320
 they think they're quite i wish they'd study them so they're not allowed to take them down right

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.920
 because there's this idea that if they fall down then the world will end immediately

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:25.280
 so they're hung up by these chains which are constantly checked which is kind of a shame because

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.840
 apparently the bones belong to some creature from the Pleistocene that mammoth or maybe a

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.040
 maybe a whale and we just won't know because the only way of checking them involves the world ending

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:40.800
 at which point i suppose you can't check the bones it's a real catch 22 they've done an

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:46.960
 awesome statue of this dragon it was first put up i think in 1972 and they decided on to have it

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:52.720
 brief fire huge like like a flamethrower and it used to do that every five minutes or so but

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.960
 actually they've started a new service whereas you're walking by you can text the dragon and ask

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:04.240
 it to breathe fire and we'll do it on command so it can actually go every 15 seconds if it needs to

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:11.280
 the 15 second intervals between breathing fire um codish leaders of crack off have had fun names

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.840
 over time i realized i was looking into the history of crack off like particularly like the 1200s

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:23.040
 where the duke of crack off was called tangle foot that was in 1210 and he died and was replaced by

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:28.800
 spindle shanks what i think there was someone in between spindle shanks replaced him and actually

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.880
 spindle shanks ended up getting killed by a german girl that he was trying to sexually assault so

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:40.400
 well done well he was she killed him so well yeah yeah well it was a bad start to the story but you

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:44.880
 know he got his good it was a happy ending i thought spindle shanks would have been killed by

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:53.200
 Voldemort by the sounds of him this one enemy was henry the bearded tangle foot and spindle

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.040
 shanks were on the same side and then henry the bearded was their enemy and eventually became

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:02.080
 duke of crack off cool that's great it does sound like a jk rolling plot doesn't it i really like

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:09.520
 king zygman the old uh because him and his wife bonnar spotzer um brought super vegetables to

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.880
 poland super vegetables in the 16th century that's what they're famous for i mean i what's

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:20.640
 james i don't want to quibble but all vegetables soup vegetables well they brought she was uh

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:26.400
 bonnar spots and was italian and so they brought a lot of um vegetables that didn't grow naturally

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:31.920
 in um poland and they brought them over but that's what they're famous for tomatoes i suppose you

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.080
 wouldn't get tomatoes in poland but you wouldn't get them anywhere in europe but she brought them

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.920
 over market them as soup vegetables is that how they got them selling that's what they're known

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:47.120
 as now like polish soup vegetables i guess um their daughter was called ana jagiellen and she

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:52.880
 was the last female ruler of poland uh and she was basically part of the family where she was

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:58.560
 like the youngest daughter and everyone thought that she was like an old kind of spinster who would

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:04.640
 never get married kind of thing and then suddenly everyone else in her family died and she was going

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:10.960
 to be the ruler of poland and suddenly she became the hottest ticket in town and um i've had the

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:16.720
 terrible wanted to marry her and um honry val y in france wanted to marry everyone wanted to

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:21.760
 marry all the habsbergs wanted to marry her and stuff i think this would make a great kind of

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:30.480
 1990s teen comedy of you know like the overlooked girl suddenly becoming the hottest girl in class

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:35.360
 kind of thing yeah you need to i think you need to rewrite the bit where sort of all her

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.480
 siblings were bruceal murdered or died in horrible ways for the teen comedy audience but she's in

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:46.240
 the poster she's surrounded by soup vegetables and she's looking to the camera and going oh i like it

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:53.360
 well she eventually married a hungarian prince called bathery um but they didn't really get on

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:59.600
 very well um he refused to learn polish and so they spoke through an interpreter for the rest of

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:06.720
 his life and then eventually he died and instead of taking over herself she pushed her nephew who

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:12.560
 was called sigman the third vassar who became actually like one of the great leaders in in polish

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:19.200
 history there's your sequel exactly but he was actually the one who moved the capital of poland

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:25.600
 away from krakow to warsaw so you know thoms down from this episode because the warsaw episode in

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:32.800
 100 is he's a hero oh by the way for americans you call it krakow just in case you've been

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:38.080
 wondering all this time what we're talking about but we call it krakow thousands of americans are

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:45.840
 just going oh everything we've said they're like that's so weird they have that in krakow as well

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:54.640
 i found a thing which is that america is running out of buglers and they desperately need them

00:34:54.640 --> 00:35:01.120
 they need them because in 2000 at the beginning of 2000 a new law was passed that if you were

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:06.960
 an army veteran and you had died you were entitled to a military funeral and so what they would do

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:13.920
 is they would have to send out three people to be their present and do a few military um uh regalia

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.480
 type things one of which is they would have to play taps on the bugle taps being that song

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:27.440
 i'm murdering that song but it's it's you know the classic american tune um now the problem is is

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:33.200
 they don't have enough buglers to go and play this song so what they've had to invent is a ceremonial

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:40.400
 bugle and the ceremonial bugle has inside it a sound system with the song pre-loaded so what you

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:45.120
 end up having is these people playing the song but what they're doing is once they press down on one

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:51.040
 of the buttons it just plays the song through a speaker system that is at the top of the bugle

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:56.160
 and they just pretend that they're playing it because that's the best way in order to

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.680
 commemorate the person who's being buried yeah dan i read about it it's so weird it seems like it's

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.920
 this little black box that you shove into the end of your bugle and then you just press a button on

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:09.040
 it and then you just hold the bugle it's really bizarre it's quite controversial isn't it because

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:15.040
 some people are like well surely you should have a proper bugler at a funeral but then other people

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:20.000
 say well you know what if we there is a shortage like dan says so if we don't do this we're just

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.760
 going to have to have a boombox with playing the tap so that's going to be even worse but then the

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:31.200
 other argument again is that you know when dan really murdered that tune a few seconds ago

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:37.760
 that's kind of part of it so it's not really supposed to be perfect note for note when you play

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.320
 the taps it's supposed to have emotion in it because the person who's playing it is quite upset

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.440
 and so the the notes are supposed to be slightly often a bit shaky and stuff like that and you

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:52.880
 obviously don't get that with the recording it'll get used to it it's like do you remember when

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:58.800
 taxi drivers first started using sat nav and it was really disappointing and then you realize

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:04.160
 that it's actually fine it's a bit like that yeah you're usually being taken three miles around the

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.400
 houses and that's part of the ritual and the tradition it shows the emotion in the taxi driver

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:13.120
 that you're being charged an extra tenor because he's not going to ask what exactly where this

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:20.080
 which is going to be going to yeah i accidentally researched you know the band the bugles who did

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:26.320
 video killed the radio star the bugles exactly i only realized that about an hour into my research

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:31.520
 i spent genuinely an hour looking at every song they did to see if a bugle had ever been played

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.640
 by the bugles and as far as i could find it hasn't but it doesn't matter anyway because that's not

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:44.480
 what they're called the bugles did have a member called trevor horn so they'd get one thing out

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:55.120
 of it so it wasn't wasted which is still not wasted now okay it is time for our final fact of the

00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:01.600
 show and that is Anna my fact this week is that when the conservationist Amy Dickman booked a

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.560
 dentist appointment in Namibia she neglected to mention to the dentist that the patient

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:14.800
 was a leopard how did the appointment go do we know it actually went quite well yeah it was a

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:20.880
 series of appointments in the end as often happens with the dentist um and this was it was on the

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:26.640
 BBC website a while back i think and it was an interview with her and she was saying that she

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.840
 works in various african countries with threatened species she was in Namibia and she found a leopard

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:37.200
 that got into a farmer's trap because farmers trap them to stop them killing their livestock

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:43.280
 and she saw it had a broken canine so she anesthetized it and she called the local dentist and just

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:46.720
 booked an appointment and then she said she arrived and there are obviously lots of people in the waiting

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.080
 room who are frightened enough already because they're in a dentist waiting room and then a

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:55.040
 leopard gets carried through and apparently the dentist really took to it after a while and

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.960
 she explained it's okay i've anesthetized it so it's not going to wake up and eat you and so

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:03.520
 the dentist was like how brilliant and they had to make a specially hard tooth for the leopard

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.400
 because obviously they do much more tearing of their food than we do so he plotted using

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:14.240
 titanium and steel and silver to make this tooth and it was basically okay well hang on scary moment

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:20.240
 at the end when it went up missing the big end apart from when it better face off apart everyone

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:26.160
 died and that's the end of my story no there was a moment where it had to go back for repeated

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:31.520
 fittings and on the very last appointment she said she thinks there was a dodgy anesthetic

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.960
 and all these crowds had gathered around to watch at this point because they've got quite a name

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.720
 for themselves for having this leopard in the dentist so crowds of people in the room the

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.640
 dentist said i'm pretty sure the leopard just blinked at me and they said don't be silly it's an

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:48.720
 esotize 30 seconds later it that a massive roar and then climbed up off the table she said the

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.440
 crowd she's never seen a crowd disappear from a room so fast they just jumped out the windows and

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:58.800
 stuff and uh they had to chase it around and anesthetize it again which she then pointed out

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.280
 i'd only ever really worked on cheaters which apparently who knew have very prominent veins

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:11.120
 so very easy to um to vaccinate to anesthetize difficult to catch though the cheater but one

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:16.640
 of the things they had to do as well so the the um the line had got up and sorry the leopard had

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:22.160
 got up and it was walking around and the the dentist was too freaked out and didn't want to help with

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.800
 the grappling of it and they were all freaking out and some of them ran out onto the road and by

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:32.560
 chance the vet was walking down the road and they're like vet get here and out and the vet was

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:36.960
 like what's something we've got a leopard that's awake and he ran in and helped hold down the

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:41.440
 leopard and they they re-anesthetized it but like just total coincidence as they ran out that this

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.280
 guy was just probably going to the shops and suddenly there was a leopard crisis in a film

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:50.560
 he'd be like what are the chances he's walking by at that moment not realistic i think anesthetizing

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:57.040
 the animals is one of the main problems of these kind of veterinary dentist isn't it because you

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.760
 know anesthetizing animals is just a difficult thing to do i was reading about one in 24 which

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:10.560
 was a jaguar called hebalba who needed five root canals and um they gave it anesthetic but unfortunately

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:16.720
 the jaguar went into cardiac arrest and stopped breathing because it reacted badly to the anesthesia

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:23.360
 and so the dentist who was called Nameak said that they tried a quick yank on the cat's testicles

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:31.040
 and he was awake just like that and the jaguar completely recovered that's yeah dentists do

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:36.640
 that that's normal isn't it yank on your butch did i yeah you um you swallow your rinse you spit

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:40.080
 the dentist gives you a quick yank down there and then you go you get the sticker isn't it

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:49.680
 i have my testicles yanked by mr smithson it seems like you have to have nerves of steel to go into

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:55.360
 this kind of dentistry the animal world dentistry i was reading about a guy called peter emily he's

00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:00.800
 82 years old and he's a pioneer in this territory he says that he's operated basically on everything

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:07.440
 with a mouth so he's done kangaroo he's done ferrets he did syggreen royce he's done a river

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:15.760
 and in this article he was operating on a lion's head so you can imagine if that line wakes up

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.000
 it's going to be terrifying while he was operating on the lion's mouth can we just say that as a

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.280
 dentist most of the work he does is head based isn't it oh yes true what my point of saying that

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:31.200
 though is at the very same time someone's down at the other end removing the lion's testicles so it

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:37.600
 was it's a scary procedure yeah if you woke up that's one pissed off lion and then as he's doing

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:42.480
 that procedure they bring in next to him a black leopard which is just laying perpendicular on the

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:48.080
 table next to this lion so he's just surrounded in animals that if i can i ask would just rip his

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.720
 head off why did they decide to take the testicles and the teeth out of the same time it's a two for

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:59.120
 one also i don't just have one of those oh yeah yeah i have to say no complaints they are

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:07.280
 in this case they were they were using them to um grow stem cells so it was two different

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.920
 things happening from two different people it wasn't yeah in order to help out with a tooth

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.680
 i guess if anesthetizing is hard which it is and i guess you don't want to do it too often so i

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:20.720
 suppose you sort of take what chances you get while you've got a knocked out lion so there was

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:26.480
 a guy a zoo dentist in the uk called peter another peter actually peter katech of paint and zoo he is

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:33.040
 again one of the only zoo dentists in the world and in 2008 he did an operation on a gorilla

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:37.840
 at paint and zoo and it took about 10 people to remove the gorilla's tooth because you've

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.440
 got people positioning the gorilla you've got people monitoring the anesthetics you've got all

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:46.720
 sorts of activity happening around and there's this huge you know 300 pound gorilla sitting

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:52.320
 in the chair completely dead to the world and he's having to operate on it and he said peter

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.120
 peter katech was interviewed and he said people often asked me if it is fun working on gorillas

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:04.720
 and tigers it certainly is not fun it is very hard and serious work oh what a killjoy he's having

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:10.800
 fun watching sat next to heaven and wedding yeah well tell us about the gorilla it's not fun

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:21.680
 oh my god what a cool job wow it's actually horrible okay moving on um in terms of dentistry

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:26.000
 it's not even just the teeth that they have to deal with so um this guy that was talking about

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:33.040
 peter emily he also works on bird beaks as well and he's pioneered a speciality which he calls

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:39.040
 ortho beakics and beak braces right i think he's the guy who does bird braces for beaks if you've

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:43.760
 got i think the condition is called scissor beak technically isn't you know when you have a faulty

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:49.200
 pair of scissors and the you can imagine the two bits not a faulty pair of scissors sorry a functioning

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:54.160
 pair of scissors but the two bits don't crash into each other like a beak should they slide over

00:44:54.160 --> 00:45:01.120
 each other and so that's what scissor beak is um so he has braces for birds that they have to wear

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:06.400
 and eventually it wrenches them back into place but they do get bullied at school i just say if

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:13.040
 it's a crossbill they're supposed to be like that oh no do you think he's ruined loads of crossbills

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:22.320
 they're just called bell yeah um rats if anyone has a pet rat uh they sometimes perform dentistry

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:32.720
 on their owners oh and this is a thing that people let them do as i i find rats quite gross uh as i

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.840
 think a lot of us do but what they like to do is inspect each other's teeth for spare food so they

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.240
 often get food stuck in their teeth and their mate will have you know a bit of dairy milk stuck in

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:48.160
 its tooth so they'll go and lick the food off and if you own a rat and you show it your teeth no it

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.960
 will lick between your teeth and lick the food out and who needs a toothpick when you've got a pet

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:59.520
 rat and people have been doing this i mean how many is is this a comment i have a friend who had a

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:04.880
 pet rat i'm not going to tell you who it is because you know them i don't think that they will have

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:10.240
 done that what you're saying james is that is this is this rare enough that we can make fun of it

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.800
 and shame the people who do it or is it very common and we should be careful is it so common

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:23.680
 that i need to rethink my friend's group they also have rank teeth anyway rats sorry no offense to

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.880
 rats but they grow faster than human nails so they have to be constantly gnawing so you need to give

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:33.680
 them stuff to chew all the time and they grow in spirals at an 85 degree angle so if their teeth come

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:39.680
 out their mouths and they don't gnaw enough then they grow in this big spiral and when they're

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:45.040
 chewing the masseter muscle which is the muscle that controls their jaw is positioned behind

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.200
 their eyeballs so if you watch videos of rats chewing they do a thing called boggling at the

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.880
 same time which is when their eyes that's dan's favourite band isn't it the boggles

00:46:52.880 --> 00:47:02.800
 sorry what is a boggling sorry ana it's known as what you think their eyes pop in and out of

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:10.160
 their heads as they chew can i give you guys the fact about just general dentistry you know how we

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:15.600
 all love uh nominative determinism yeah well i have gone off it a little bit i have to say

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:20.480
 i have to read in this fact and i think that it might not be true um because i read that the first

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:27.120
 woman to qualify as a dentist in england was called miss fanny pain and i think if nominative

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:34.320
 determinism was real she would have been a gynecologist yeah fanny there should be something

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:39.440
 called nominative anti determinism or something where they've gone the wrong way um so she um

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:45.200
 qualified in 1914 there were um there were a few dentists before her because a few people

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:51.040
 qualified in scotland before that uh female dentist i should say but like in the 19th century really

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:56.640
 you only had male dentists uh and then there was fanny pain uh and there was another woman called

00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:02.560
 lillian lindsey um who became the first um female to qualify as a dentist in the whole u k because

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:09.840
 she did hers in in scotland uh and it was so looked down upon um that when she tried to join the

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:16.080
 national dental hospital in great portland street um the dean who was called harry vice harry harry

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:25.440
 what harry harry vice yeah that's what causes the fanny pain he was called harry vice harry

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.760
 wise harry vice and he refused to admit her because she was a woman and then when she

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:34.240
 really insisted um he would only interview her on the pavement outside the school because he

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:40.720
 didn't want her to distract all the other dentists who were inside wow but yeah eventually they did

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:47.040
 and now i think um it's more than 50 of dentists in europe i think are women um people are trying

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:52.800
 home dentistry now are they and i'll think it flies not to so is this a coronavirus thing

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.040
 yep the economist reported on various dentists saying that they're very worried because a lot

00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.560
 of their patients are saying they're doing things like uh using needles to burst their

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:05.280
 own abscesses uh in their mouths they're using knives and forks to take their teeth out and nail

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:10.480
 files to cut down broken teeth my word i've actually been doing this myself at home and it's a real

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:18.240
 nightmare because i've been having to yank on my own testicles when i'm finished okay that's it
