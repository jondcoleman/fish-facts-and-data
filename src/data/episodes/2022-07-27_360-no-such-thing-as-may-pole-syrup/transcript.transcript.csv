00:00:14,00:00:18,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:18,00:00:23,a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:26,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:00:26,00:00:31,Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:31,00:00:37,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:37,00:00:42,Starting with fact number one and that's my fact. My fact this week is that in the 1910s
00:00:42,00:00:48,"animal dances including the camel walk, the turkey trot, the crab step, the chicken flip,"
00:00:48,00:00:53,"and the kangaroo dip was so controversial they were banned at the White House,"
00:00:53,00:00:58,"condemned by the Pope and warned against by doctors. Wow, why were they so bad? Were they"
00:00:58,00:01:03,"sexy? I bet they were sexy dances they always are aren't they? I watched the turkey trot,"
00:01:03,00:01:07,you could argue there's a bit of sex in there but ultimately you just look like an idiot I think.
00:01:07,00:01:14,"I mean what could sound sexier than the crab step? It's very raunchy stuff, the chicken flip,"
00:01:14,00:01:20,"there are all these, no the sloth squeeze was another one? Yeah, the boll weevil wiggle,"
00:01:20,00:01:27,"that was another one. It doesn't exactly sound like twerking, it's they're quite, they're very tame"
00:01:27,00:01:31,"from. They were tame, yeah but they were sort of that moment where it felt like people were"
00:01:31,00:01:37,liberating and this was seen as people going out and having a wild time and they really did take
00:01:37,00:01:43,"it seriously so a number of US cities really cracked down on it and in Boston, John F. Kennedy's"
00:01:43,00:01:49,grandfather who was the mayor ordered it so that there was a matron and policeman posted to every
00:01:49,00:01:54,"dance hall in the city and they would crack down on anyone they saw doing that. They had people,"
00:01:54,00:02:00,"just police forces out arresting whole groups, it was a bit of a mania. A lot of the reporters at"
00:02:00,00:02:06,"the time said they were, to be fair to the people banning them, actual imitations of the sex acts"
00:02:06,00:02:11,of these animals. Now it is quite difficult to believe that when you watch for instance a turkey
00:02:11,00:02:16,"trot which sort of involves jumping, hopping to one side and then hopping to the other side and"
00:02:16,00:02:22,then flapping your wings a bit but they were meant to be kind of re-enacting sex between these
00:02:22,00:02:28,creatures. It feels to me that if that's the way turkeys have sex then we'd all be going hungry at
00:02:28,00:02:34,Christmas because there would be not many bacon turkeys around. Well as no doubt people would
00:02:34,00:02:41,mention I don't think any turkey that we eat has sex does it? I think oh my god imagine if the
00:02:41,00:02:48,turkey trot dance was someone extracting some semen from your penis and then putting it in a
00:02:48,00:02:52,little test tube and then shoving it into your partner. It would be the turkey base instead of
00:02:52,00:02:57,the turkey trot as a dance. I really like what you said about the White House Dan. This is amazing
00:02:57,00:03:02,"that in 1913 there was going to be an inaugural ball for President Woodrow Wilson, obviously very"
00:03:02,00:03:06,exciting and then it was cancelled because just because of the risk that people might start doing
00:03:06,00:03:12,the turkey trot and he denied that but the ball was cancelled it didn't go ahead and so there was
00:03:12,00:03:17,no chance for anyone to do the the grizzly bear. Yeah he denied it probably because it wasn't
00:03:17,00:03:23,true. Charlie that wasn't the reason. It was on the front page of the New York Times so the headline
00:03:23,00:03:29,was Wilson banned ball fearing turkey trot and that was on Jan 13th 1913 and it was a big story but
00:03:29,00:03:34,obviously yeah he denied that that would happen but it was it was a real story. It was from White
00:03:34,00:03:39,House Insiders so it was just I reckon he probably did ban it because of that. It was probably like
00:03:39,00:03:42,I don't love spending all this money and he might have been specifically worried about his
00:03:42,00:03:48,daughters who are massive fans of animal dances so he knew he knew the underworld of animal dancing.
00:03:48,00:03:54,So one person who intervened in this debate was the ex-president of the University of Missouri's
00:03:54,00:04:01,medical school. He was a guy called Dr. S Grover and he claimed in 1915 that it led to insanity
00:04:01,00:04:06,to do these dances. He said many of the cases of insanity developed in the United States within
00:04:06,00:04:12,the last few years may be traced to modern eccentric dances. One tenth of the insane of this country
00:04:12,00:04:16,have lost their mind on account of troubles which may commonly be traced to modern dances.
00:04:16,00:04:23,One in ten. They also said that it would give you some kind of foot illness didn't it? It was like
00:04:23,00:04:28,there was like a turkey trot photo turkey trot and stuff or something like that which would
00:04:28,00:04:33,make you lame if you did this too much. But then some doctors said it was good for you so there
00:04:33,00:04:40,was a doctor called Dr. A. A. Brill who sounds like a really good doctor and he said that modern
00:04:40,00:04:45,dances should be considered beneficial and they're soothing to the pop place as rocking is to an infant.
00:04:45,00:04:51,So like when you're rock and rolling you're also kind of being rocked like a baby.
00:04:51,00:04:57,It's like everything. It's probably best done in moderation isn't it? I'm sure if you did dance for
00:04:57,00:05:02,14 hours a day you would actually get quite sore feet and I think that's absolutely fair enough.
00:05:02,00:05:07,I just think it's unlikely many people were doing that. Yeah. And it was I think it was tango foot
00:05:07,00:05:14,was the precursor to that which was a big scare. There was a really nice news article from 1914
00:05:14,00:05:19,which pointed out that no sooner has a new entrancing diversion come in than someone appears
00:05:19,00:05:26,to forbid it and it pointed out that tango foot is the modern version of bicycle knee and automobile
00:05:26,00:05:32,face which I think I feel like we may have talked about those before. Also movie eye he said people
00:05:32,00:05:37,used to tell us we'd all get movie eye from the cinemas and we haven't and it was quite a good
00:05:37,00:05:42,article to remind you that whenever there's a new trend everyone always says this is going to ruin
00:05:42,00:05:52,us. Yeah I always get Pokemon shin and Fortnite anus. We've got anyone binging us watch out for
00:05:52,00:05:58,podcast ear lobe. Oh yeah. I want to know what Fortnite's anus is. Well the problem is people
00:05:58,00:06:03,sit down playing video games for too long right and they sit in the same place and it can give you
00:06:03,00:06:11,problems like tiles and hemorrhoids. No no no I'm making it all up. Oh okay I've just started
00:06:11,00:06:16,playing Fortnite and I need to know if my anus is safe. You're allowed for no more than two weeks
00:06:16,00:06:22,after that it's a problem. One of these animal dances survives today which is so exciting because
00:06:22,00:06:27,I've never heard of the bunny hug or the there were others called the like the buzzard lobe. There
00:06:27,00:06:32,was one called the fish walk. Did you hear that one? I mean that is the one thing that fish don't do.
00:06:32,00:06:39,Yeah insane but the one that survived into the modern age is the bunny hug because it kind of
00:06:39,00:06:44,became the fox trot and the fox trot was coined and popularized around the same time as all these
00:06:44,00:06:49,other dances and it was refined a bit and you know there are various sources to who exactly came up
00:06:49,00:06:54,with it but it's basically a slightly more neat version of the bunny hug. But it's not named
00:06:54,00:06:58,after the fox right it was named after a guy called fox that's what most people think these days.
00:06:58,00:07:03,I didn't know that. Yeah there was a guy called fox who was like the guy who popularized the
00:07:03,00:07:09,fox trot and they think although it makes much more sense if there was a you know a grizzly bear
00:07:09,00:07:14,jump and a bunny hug it makes sense that it would be named after a fox. All these dances were named
00:07:14,00:07:19,after people the the turkey trot was named after Sir Leonard Turkey and yeah well the bunny hug
00:07:19,00:07:23,there is a famous version of it being danced in a movie starring a man called John Bunny but he
00:07:23,00:07:27,didn't invent it I think that just happened to be a coincidence. Really? Yeah he's one of the most
00:07:27,00:07:32,well-known comedians of his day in America I've never heard of him but he's got a huge
00:07:32,00:07:41,what was he called? John Bunny. Not Jack Benny you just misread it. Yeah John Bunny. So speaking
00:07:41,00:07:50,of band dances have you guys heard of the cushion dance? No I haven't. This is the 16th 17th century
00:07:50,00:07:56,version of the turkey trot because it was a scandalous sexy dance and what it is is you run
00:07:56,00:08:01,around the place with a cushion for a bit you dance around holding a cushion and then you put it down
00:08:01,00:08:07,in front of a woman and she will kneel on it and then you give her. Give you a blow job. No
00:08:07,00:08:16,you give her a kiss on the cheek and then you pick up the cushion and you dance around a bit
00:08:16,00:08:20,more and it's very innocent and sweet. It's not as sexy as I thought it was going to be.
00:08:20,00:08:25,"I sort of assumed the blow, I mean that's what you're led to believe by the description."
00:08:25,00:08:29,It's a completely innocuous dance but it was very scandalous at the time.
00:08:29,00:08:38,Oh god I'm blushing over zoom. Take your camera down. Did the woman get to get up before you took
00:08:38,00:08:42,the cushion out or was it a sort of tablecloth trick where you spawn her off the cushion?
00:08:42,00:08:47,I don't know maybe she gets the cushion then. I haven't actually got the full mechanics of
00:08:47,00:08:50,it worked out. Maybe it's like past the cushion and then she gets to put the cushion down in front
00:08:50,00:08:56,of someone else. Who gives her Codilingus? No okay we have to stop this. But there was a
00:08:56,00:09:01,worry right. I read about this cushion dance which they were saying a story that in 1633
00:09:01,00:09:06,the idea is that it would lead to sexual acts and a couple were accused I think after maybe having
00:09:06,00:09:11,done this dance and taking it a bit further of having sex against the village maypole.
00:09:11,00:09:18,That's going to be uncomfortable. Yeah you're going to end up with maypole anus.
00:09:18,00:09:24,The only reason they were found out was because apparently there was a bell on top of it which
00:09:24,00:09:32,they didn't know about which was alerting the neighbour. That's the story all right. If I had
00:09:32,00:09:37,to write that up in a 16th century newspaper I would make the headline maypole sauce okay.
00:09:37,00:09:42,So it's like a pun on maypole sauce but it's the saucy thing happening up against the maypole.
00:09:42,00:09:47,Did they have maypole sauce back then? No they didn't I guess. Wow so you would have been going
00:09:47,00:09:54,to get a whole new 1633 yeah they had maypole sauce. It's always called maypole syrup so I don't
00:09:54,00:10:02,know why we're even talking about it. The animal dances were part of the ragtime genre really
00:10:02,00:10:08,weren't they? It was just part of the much broader ragtime era which is basically the first jazz or
00:10:08,00:10:15,the precursor to jazz. It's the first time you started having syncopated ragged rhythm and the
00:10:15,00:10:21,story of ragtime is just it's kind of cool. It's this Scott Joplin who's the king of ragtime.
00:10:21,00:10:25,He'd been born to a former enslaved person who used to play the violin for plantation parties so
00:10:25,00:10:32,that's where he got his musical skill and he died eventually in 1917 I think of syphilis and he died
00:10:32,00:10:38,"really upset that he'd never been able to be famous for a serious music and today he gets 200,000"
00:10:38,00:10:45,listens a month on Spotify which is just such a nice thing to not be able to tell him. Yeah and he
00:10:45,00:10:52,"will be I guess he'll be able to earn 15 cents from those 200,000. But luckily the turn of the"
00:10:52,00:10:58,20th century that will have bought him a lot of stuff right so the problem is not that Spotify
00:10:58,00:11:03,isn't paying people enough it's that they're not paying people 100 years ago. Oh I think we're just
00:11:03,00:11:11,about guaranteed we still get to be hosted cool. The conga was illegal in Cuba for a while I don't
00:11:11,00:11:18,think it still is might be. This was due to a politician called Desiderio and as the second
00:11:18,00:11:25,and the reason was because it had come over to Cuba from Africa and they thought that it had
00:11:25,00:11:31,lots of immoral gestures and semi-naked people doing the conga everywhere. Like at weddings.
00:11:32,00:11:38,Yeah that conga you know where you hold onto the waist of someone behind. Now we do the blowjob.
00:11:38,00:11:48,So it was banned by this politician but then the politician ended up being put in prison like
00:11:48,00:11:54,politicians often do in some countries and the son of the politician called Desi Arnaz he
00:11:54,00:12:01,fled to America and then became like the king of the conga. Like he went around the whole of America
00:12:01,00:12:06,touring going on TV going to all the different cities teaching them the conga and what I like
00:12:06,00:12:12,to think is that when he went from one city to the other everyone just followed him and did the
00:12:12,00:12:18,conga with him from you know LA to San Francisco to Seattle. You can see the king of conga coming
00:12:18,00:12:24,from a long way away if you run his way into town. I'm very impressed if you managed to make a living
00:12:24,00:12:29,out of teaching people the conga because I would say it is at maximum my one lesson dance unless
00:12:29,00:12:34,it's got all right but I last did it. 300 million people in America that's a lot of lessons.
00:12:34,00:12:37,Yeah and you didn't even know you're supposed to take your clothes off and
00:12:37,00:12:53,Okay it is time for fact number two and that is James. Okay my fact this week
00:12:53,00:12:58,is that there is a type of pasta that only three women in the world know how to make.
00:12:58,00:13:06,Oh will we have heard of it? Is it fusilli? It's not going to be spaghetti is it? It's not
00:13:06,00:13:11,going to be. They're amazingly productive like they're kingpins. You will have heard of it because
00:13:11,00:13:16,you've spent the last couple of days researching about it but I think the people at home will not
00:13:16,00:13:24,have heard of it so this is called Su Filendeu literally threads of God and it's a Sardinian
00:13:24,00:13:32,pasta and it's made once a year for the feast of San Francisco and there is basically a group of
00:13:32,00:13:38,women who have always been able to make it and they pass the recipe down to their daughters who
00:13:38,00:13:43,pass it down to their daughters who pass it down to their daughters but there are only three women
00:13:43,00:13:51,left who know how to do it really. One of them is a lady called Paola Abrini and her niece and her
00:13:51,00:13:56,sister-in-law all know how to do it but her daughters aren't really that interested they kind of know
00:13:56,00:14:02,the technique but it's really really complicated and they're not particularly good at it and because
00:14:02,00:14:07,all these three women who are doing it are all kind of I wouldn't say old but getting that way
00:14:07,00:14:13,you know in the 50s and 60s the people are a little bit worried that this might die out so
00:14:13,00:14:18,we need to get more people learning quick and we tried to teach Jamie Oliver but he just couldn't
00:14:18,00:14:24,hack it. Well this is the weird thing about it it's that it's not even like it's a secret recipe
00:14:24,00:14:28,it's not something that they're hiding they're constantly trying to teach it to people
00:14:28,00:14:32,including Jamie Oliver and after a few hours of like nah bullshit I'm not doing this. Are we
00:14:32,00:14:36,serious that Jamie Oliver's tried to learn it? Yeah he tried to do it he tried to do it for two
00:14:36,00:14:41,hours and gave up. Wow. It's for the people at home I'll tell you how to do it because I know
00:14:41,00:14:46,how to do it basically you get some semolina wheat you get some water you get some salt you need it
00:14:46,00:14:52,and need it and need it and then at just the right moment which is the main difficult part
00:14:52,00:14:58,then you put it into loads and loads of really really really fine strings you get 256 of these
00:14:58,00:15:03,filaments and you put them all together and then kind of mesh them all up and then cut it up and
00:15:03,00:15:09,then that's your pasta and then you put it with some tasty sheep's broth and some pecorino cheese
00:15:09,00:15:15,bish bash bosh that's basically a hello fresh recipe that I've given you there isn't it? Yeah
00:15:15,00:15:20,it went a bit Jamie Oliver at the end when he's a bish bash bosh and he's a pucker.
00:15:20,00:15:28,It's like that is the thing if you do get a hello fresh and it is the Sue Philandau meal
00:15:28,00:15:34,it will take you exactly 48 years to do this. Although it wouldn't be it would be one of those
00:15:34,00:15:39,annoying recipes because that's just the prep so it would say cook time 12 minutes and then at the
00:15:39,00:15:46,very end it would say prep time 10 years and lifetime yeah so actually lots of people know
00:15:46,00:15:50,how to make it it's just the fact that only three people can make it. Yeah it's really really difficult
00:15:50,00:15:55,because you just need to get at exactly the right moment it's the elasticity of the dough that you
00:15:55,00:16:00,need to get perfectly right because if you don't do it perfectly you can't make these threads thin
00:16:00,00:16:06,enough and you can only do it from playing with the dough and just knowing from generation on
00:16:06,00:16:10,generation and generation and knowledge to knowledge to knowledge just knowing the exact
00:16:10,00:16:13,moment to do it. But the other thing is it's given an impression that it's much harder to learn
00:16:13,00:16:18,because you know Jamie Oliver stopped after two hours I think it's fair enough that he didn't
00:16:18,00:16:22,master it in two hours this has been a generational thing that's passed on that's you know you need
00:16:22,00:16:26,two weeks. Because if you're Jamie Oliver if you're Jamie Oliver you can in that time you could
00:16:26,00:16:31,have made eight of your 15 minute meals. That's an interesting way of cooking. I did read because
00:16:31,00:16:36,these women they're as you said James right they're in the same family so one of their male
00:16:36,00:16:41,relatives is currently one of the Luke Skywalker figures who is in the process of learning how to
00:16:41,00:16:48,make it to their Yoda. He's obviously also I guess Sardinian he's called Leo Gilsemino
00:16:48,00:16:55,and he's Aussie. Well he's Australian. Yeah I mean he's their family so I don't know when
00:16:55,00:17:00,he moved to Australia or when the family moved but yeah they've given him a little masterclass
00:17:00,00:17:06,and he has a certificate but I think he's still in the training zone. Yeah so basically it's kind
00:17:06,00:17:10,of a tradition where they have these kind of matrilineal or matriarchal cuisines which you do
00:17:10,00:17:15,pass on from mother to daughter to daughter to daughter but because they're so worried about
00:17:15,00:17:19,this dying out they have recently said okay we're going to let men do it as well
00:17:19,00:17:25,and they are trying to teach more and more people. I actually read this article in the BBC I think it
00:17:25,00:17:30,was in 2016 so it could be possible that few people have picked it up since then but if they
00:17:30,00:17:35,have they won't be nearly as good as these three women who absolutely smash it every time because
00:17:35,00:17:40,they don't have the special sense. Is that you know we've done how you know we have more than five
00:17:40,00:17:47,senses. Is the special ability to feel pasta. I don't think that's an X-Men character we're
00:17:47,00:17:55,going to see covered up. Actually I just thought of something which is that you know how we were
00:17:55,00:18:02,talking about maple sauce earlier on Andy. Yes well the related food maple syrup is also was
00:18:02,00:18:08,traditionally a thing that passed from mother to daughter to mother to daughter because in the
00:18:08,00:18:15,first peoples tribes of Canada you the men would often go out hunting and the women would be in
00:18:15,00:18:21,charge of all of the planting and stuff like that and the maple syrup came in that territory
00:18:21,00:18:27,and so you would as a woman you would go to your maple grove and you would get the syrup every year
00:18:27,00:18:33,which would give lots of energy to your to your tribes but you would pass on the knowledge to
00:18:33,00:18:37,your daughter and you would even pass on your groves to your daughter as well so wherever
00:18:37,00:18:42,your grove of maples was that would be yours through generations through generations through
00:18:42,00:18:46,generations so there are quite a few of these kind of metrilineal cuisines around the world
00:18:46,00:18:49,and you pass that would be you pass on the knowledge of you make a hole in the tree and wait
00:18:49,00:18:53,for the stuff to come out of it because that I like did the women tell the men it was a really
00:18:53,00:19:00,complicated process it's the equivalent of the conga king passing it on to his conga son
00:19:00,00:19:08,he's next in line literally first you put a hole in the tree then you wait for the sap to come out
00:19:08,00:19:12,no because actually there's more to it with maple syrup oh you've got to concentrate it a little
00:19:12,00:19:17,bit you've got to lose some of the fluids you have to leave it out overnight so it freezes and all
00:19:17,00:19:21,the water comes to the top and then you skim off the water and then you boil it to get rid of more
00:19:21,00:19:29,of the water it's like that's what my mum told me anyway just on pasta shapes oh yeah do you guys
00:19:29,00:19:37,know you know the tortelloni the little wrapped up parcel thing uh yeah I think I call it tortellini
00:19:37,00:19:43,I call it tortellini oh I'm sorry tortellini sorry sorry tortellini that shape is supposedly based
00:19:43,00:19:50,on Lucrezia Borgia's naval and you know Lucrezia Borgia of the famous poisoning but aristocratic
00:19:50,00:19:56,Borgia family she was staying in an inn uh in Italy and the innkeeper um was so excited to have
00:19:56,00:20:01,this beautiful aristocratic lady in his inn that he crept up to the keyhole to have a to have a
00:20:01,00:20:06,perv but all he could see was the naval through her navel through the door but what a naval foar
00:20:06,00:20:14,and he rushed down to the kitchen to recreate it making pasta for him that's a terrible ouchy she
00:20:14,00:20:22,had isn't it it's an absolutely fucked up umbilical cord coming right there and he um also the next
00:20:22,00:20:30,day he went up and saw her husband and invented the Bologna sausage didn't he do you know when
00:20:30,00:20:38,my past has so many different shapes um well I think people think they know or the theory is
00:20:38,00:20:42,that the reason it does and it is a ridiculous number so there are more than 300 pasta shapes and
00:20:42,00:20:49,I think 1300 different pasta names and it's partly because it was so it was such rivalry
00:20:49,00:20:55,throughout Italy so some of the earliest Italian gills were pasta guilds the vermicelli and the
00:20:55,00:21:01,macaroni and um you'd have lots of little different localities trying to rival each
00:21:01,00:21:05,other's pasta quality with their own pasta and so you made it into one into a bow tie and then
00:21:05,00:21:10,you'd make your own spiral to be like our spirals are better than their bow ties and it was very
00:21:10,00:21:15,heated and they used to get so I mean they got so competitive that the pope had to step in a few
00:21:15,00:21:22,times I think between pasta guilds and he ruled in the 1400s he ruled that pasta making illegal
00:21:22,00:21:26,pasta making would be punished by a fine and three lashings of a whip because you know if you're
00:21:26,00:21:31,not allowed if you're not in the guild that's allowed to make that twirly pasta then you're
00:21:31,00:21:34,going to be beaten I tell you what I didn't really appreciate until we did the research for this
00:21:34,00:21:40,episode how busy the pope's life actually is he's just constantly banning pasta shapes or turkey
00:21:40,00:21:47,trot dances the guy's furious calling out stuff he's got a lot on yeah there was actually um with
00:21:47,00:21:52,what you were saying with these sort of um these guilds and so on it it went a bit further in the
00:21:52,00:21:59,Renaissance courts there was there's one particular pasta shape which is causetti which um the idea is
00:21:59,00:22:04,that it's imprinted with the coat of arms of the royal families that would eat it so you would have
00:22:04,00:22:09,these these pieces of pasta that would each have the coat of arms to where you were eating on your
00:22:09,00:22:14,plate which is pretty extraordinary I love that as a yeah because they're all they're all very there's
00:22:14,00:22:19,this great book called the encyclopedia of pasta I don't know if you guys read about it in the course
00:22:19,00:22:28,of this research by oretta what's it about oretta zanini devita is her name and she's went round
00:22:28,00:22:34,italy just asking every local person from a different town city village about the story
00:22:34,00:22:39,behind a different kind of famous local pasta and she created this encyclopedia so it's a real
00:22:39,00:22:44,firsthand encyclopedia and it's got all the stories about how the shapes came about there's
00:22:44,00:22:50,the ave Maria pasta which is a great little one that's simply it's not anything to do with the
00:22:50,00:22:55,shape it's about the timing of what you cook it for so you chuck it into the boiling water and if
00:22:55,00:23:00,you say a hail mary that's how long you cook it for the ave Maria um and there's a apparently a
00:23:00,00:23:06,whole trinity of different pastas uh with the different lengths uh that you say the prayer to
00:23:06,00:23:12,that will be the perfect cooking doesn't feel like a particularly long amount of time to cook pasta
00:23:12,00:23:17,say the hail mary i don't know how long it takes to say a whole mary okay hail mary follow grace
00:23:17,00:23:21,along it's with the dressed up that looks women invest in the fruits of thy womb jesus holy mary
00:23:21,00:23:25,mother of god pray to us sinners now at the hour of death amen do you have a very quickly you're
00:23:25,00:23:32,i think your pasta's very authentic change to be the most annoying priest as he's powering through
00:23:32,00:23:36,the entire sermon hey i had to go through a lot of confessions in my time and had to get through a
00:23:36,00:23:49,lot of hail maries okay it is time for fact number three and that is andy my fact is that every hour
00:23:49,00:23:55,the buglers of krakow have to climb 272 steps play five notes then walk back down again
00:23:55,00:24:05,and this is a job that you can have if you're a bugler and you live in krakow um they have this
00:24:05,00:24:11,church called st mary's basilica and since 1392 uh on and off they've been doing this thing where
00:24:11,00:24:17,every hour there's a bugle call from the top um it's called mary's fanfare it's only got five
00:24:17,00:24:22,notes in it so actually it's it's not it goes up and down a bit and it takes about i don't know
00:24:22,00:24:29,half a minute to play so it goes up and down but only on those five notes um and you play the tune
00:24:29,00:24:34,to each point of the compass and um and then you stop and then you go back down again and then the
00:24:34,00:24:39,next hour you climb back up again but actually don't you stop the fourth time you do it you stop
00:24:39,00:24:47,halfway through i read um that's because in 1241 there was a bugler who was like telling about
00:24:47,00:24:54,some mongols who were attacking the city and he was shot by an arrow uh halfway through his bugle
00:24:54,00:25:00,and so in honor of this sky they they kind of stopped the last bugle well that's the story
00:25:00,00:25:05,but there's a lot of stories about krakow i learned which we might get to in a bit but go on
00:25:05,00:25:13,well it's first recorded in 1928 and from 1241 there's obviously quite a gap before anyone
00:25:13,00:25:19,wrote it down so and it's first recorded by an american author who may have been locals may have
00:25:19,00:25:22,played a trick on him but it might also have been an oral legend before that it's just that there
00:25:22,00:25:29,isn't much written record but there was actually a trumpeter who did die on duty in 1901 so only
00:25:29,00:25:34,about 20 years before this guy wrote the story down and he had played the tune three out of four
00:25:34,00:25:39,times because you do it to each point of the compass so he did it three times but then he
00:25:39,00:25:44,died of a heart condition before he could play it the fourth time so that might be where that sort
00:25:44,00:25:51,of fed into local myth and yeah yeah that must have been such a weird moment for the town when
00:25:51,00:25:56,you're waiting you're so used every hour to hearing these four and you're like what i don't
00:25:56,00:26:03,go but i thought wasn't it even um did you say the first mention of the bugler is 1928 or the
00:26:03,00:26:07,first mention of this legend is 1928 the mongol thing the bugle thing's been going for donkeys
00:26:07,00:26:11,yes yeah because i read that the bugle thing even they only used to do it sort of once a day until
00:26:11,00:26:17,the until the 20th century and then suddenly they decided to torture this guy by ramping up to once
00:26:17,00:26:24,every hour there is a they're in a squad so i think you do you have to be a fireman by the way
00:26:24,00:26:29,to have this job that's just part of the conditions for entry these days so the reason this is
00:26:29,00:26:33,current now is because they just announced they're recruiting for a new one and they've had their
00:26:33,00:26:39,first ever application from a woman for the position so great social progress is being made now if she
00:26:39,00:26:46,gets it if she gets it yeah if she gets it um but it's for the audition process and it's crazy it's
00:26:46,00:26:51,saying you got to in order to become a bugler for uh for the church you need to go through a whole
00:26:51,00:26:57,process of doing chin-ups you need a beep fitness test um they have a medicine ball tossing thing
00:26:57,00:27:02,that you need to do and you need to scale a 20 meter ladder at an angle of 75 degrees to ensure
00:27:02,00:27:06,that you're not afraid of heights but i would have thought that all these things if you're a fireman
00:27:06,00:27:11,you probably would already be able to glow up ladders wouldn't you no yeah that's true yeah i
00:27:11,00:27:18,gotta say i have been to crack off on a stag do once and i think i might be right right about saying
00:27:18,00:27:22,this is the square is basically just a load of bars all the way around it with mostly when i
00:27:22,00:27:28,went there just full of stag do's so just that's that seems to be the only people who are enjoying
00:27:28,00:27:33,these bugles is it market square is it the main square isn't it i think i remember hearing it when
00:27:33,00:27:37,i was in crack off market square was the biggest square biggest medieval square in europe i think
00:27:37,00:27:42,wasn't it it was yanesco heritage sort of it was one of the very first places to get yanesco
00:27:42,00:27:47,heritage i think yeah it is beautiful it's really big and really cool and this st murray's tower
00:27:48,00:27:52,is quite famous because it's got two towers that are slightly different heights
00:27:52,00:27:57,and i know andy's going to tell me this isn't true now but i'm going to tell the story of why
00:27:57,00:28:04,this happened so they had the church there and there was a guy who was in charge of crack off at
00:28:04,00:28:10,the time who was called juke borislaus the modest okay and he's like we need some new towers here
00:28:10,00:28:15,not too big because i'm modest but we need some new towers here we need two new towers
00:28:15,00:28:20,and they tried to find the people to do it and they got two brothers one of whom was going
00:28:20,00:28:25,to do one tower and one who would do the other tower one of the brothers did his tower and then
00:28:25,00:28:30,the other brother did his tower slightly bigger and the brother with the shorter tower got really
00:28:30,00:28:37,jealous and so killed his brother for doing such a bigger tower and then he could have made his
00:28:37,00:28:42,tower back to the equal height but then he felt so guilty about killing his brother that he didn't
00:28:42,00:28:46,do it anymore he's going to tell me that's not true either andy i'm not going to say that no way
00:28:46,00:28:52,no it's probably it's probably not true crack doesn't make up for killing your brother i'll
00:28:52,00:28:56,tell you that if i was murdered but then i found out that the person didn't actually go through
00:28:56,00:29:03,with the stupid bet we had it's still not okay to murder you no you're right but there are great
00:29:03,00:29:07,stories of crack off and i'm james the only reason i'm not going to tell you that your one isn't true
00:29:07,00:29:14,is because the only other one i know is about of crack off is about the dragon who lived under the
00:29:14,00:29:21,hill and it's a medieval story of crack off and the dragon loved eating virgins they all do don't
00:29:21,00:29:29,they it's the whole species yeah there was only one virgin left after this huge virgin eating
00:29:29,00:29:34,rampage that the dragon had been on anyway this poor cobbler filled up a sheepskin with sulfur
00:29:34,00:29:40,and salt and then left that outside the dragon's cape anyway the dragon eats it and it's so full
00:29:40,00:29:46,of salt that he feels so thirsty he drinks so much water at the dragon that he explodes and dies
00:29:46,00:29:51,and then the cobbler is rewarded by getting married to the king's daughter who happens to be the
00:29:51,00:29:59,last virgin in the city okay that's the story yeah and and the dragon's bones now hang out of the front
00:29:59,00:30:05,of vavel cathedral which is in crack off it's the big cathedral there the bones hang from the door
00:30:05,00:30:11,all the bones are they not the realness of the bones are they some bones some bones are there
00:30:11,00:30:16,they think they're quite i wish they'd study them so they're not allowed to take them down right
00:30:16,00:30:19,because there's this idea that if they fall down then the world will end immediately
00:30:19,00:30:25,so they're hung up by these chains which are constantly checked which is kind of a shame because
00:30:25,00:30:29,apparently the bones belong to some creature from the Pleistocene that mammoth or maybe a
00:30:29,00:30:35,maybe a whale and we just won't know because the only way of checking them involves the world ending
00:30:35,00:30:40,at which point i suppose you can't check the bones it's a real catch 22 they've done an
00:30:40,00:30:46,awesome statue of this dragon it was first put up i think in 1972 and they decided on to have it
00:30:46,00:30:52,brief fire huge like like a flamethrower and it used to do that every five minutes or so but
00:30:52,00:30:56,actually they've started a new service whereas you're walking by you can text the dragon and ask
00:30:56,00:31:04,it to breathe fire and we'll do it on command so it can actually go every 15 seconds if it needs to
00:31:04,00:31:11,the 15 second intervals between breathing fire um codish leaders of crack off have had fun names
00:31:11,00:31:15,over time i realized i was looking into the history of crack off like particularly like the 1200s
00:31:15,00:31:23,where the duke of crack off was called tangle foot that was in 1210 and he died and was replaced by
00:31:23,00:31:28,spindle shanks what i think there was someone in between spindle shanks replaced him and actually
00:31:28,00:31:32,spindle shanks ended up getting killed by a german girl that he was trying to sexually assault so
00:31:32,00:31:40,well done well he was she killed him so well yeah yeah well it was a bad start to the story but you
00:31:40,00:31:44,know he got his good it was a happy ending i thought spindle shanks would have been killed by
00:31:44,00:31:53,Voldemort by the sounds of him this one enemy was henry the bearded tangle foot and spindle
00:31:53,00:31:57,shanks were on the same side and then henry the bearded was their enemy and eventually became
00:31:57,00:32:02,duke of crack off cool that's great it does sound like a jk rolling plot doesn't it i really like
00:32:02,00:32:09,king zygman the old uh because him and his wife bonnar spotzer um brought super vegetables to
00:32:09,00:32:14,poland super vegetables in the 16th century that's what they're famous for i mean i what's
00:32:14,00:32:20,james i don't want to quibble but all vegetables soup vegetables well they brought she was uh
00:32:20,00:32:26,bonnar spots and was italian and so they brought a lot of um vegetables that didn't grow naturally
00:32:26,00:32:31,in um poland and they brought them over but that's what they're famous for tomatoes i suppose you
00:32:31,00:32:36,wouldn't get tomatoes in poland but you wouldn't get them anywhere in europe but she brought them
00:32:36,00:32:39,over market them as soup vegetables is that how they got them selling that's what they're known
00:32:39,00:32:47,as now like polish soup vegetables i guess um their daughter was called ana jagiellen and she
00:32:47,00:32:52,was the last female ruler of poland uh and she was basically part of the family where she was
00:32:52,00:32:58,like the youngest daughter and everyone thought that she was like an old kind of spinster who would
00:32:58,00:33:04,never get married kind of thing and then suddenly everyone else in her family died and she was going
00:33:04,00:33:10,to be the ruler of poland and suddenly she became the hottest ticket in town and um i've had the
00:33:10,00:33:16,terrible wanted to marry her and um honry val y in france wanted to marry everyone wanted to
00:33:16,00:33:21,marry all the habsbergs wanted to marry her and stuff i think this would make a great kind of
00:33:21,00:33:30,1990s teen comedy of you know like the overlooked girl suddenly becoming the hottest girl in class
00:33:30,00:33:35,kind of thing yeah you need to i think you need to rewrite the bit where sort of all her
00:33:35,00:33:40,siblings were bruceal murdered or died in horrible ways for the teen comedy audience but she's in
00:33:40,00:33:46,the poster she's surrounded by soup vegetables and she's looking to the camera and going oh i like it
00:33:46,00:33:53,well she eventually married a hungarian prince called bathery um but they didn't really get on
00:33:53,00:33:59,very well um he refused to learn polish and so they spoke through an interpreter for the rest of
00:33:59,00:34:06,his life and then eventually he died and instead of taking over herself she pushed her nephew who
00:34:06,00:34:12,was called sigman the third vassar who became actually like one of the great leaders in in polish
00:34:12,00:34:19,history there's your sequel exactly but he was actually the one who moved the capital of poland
00:34:19,00:34:25,away from krakow to warsaw so you know thoms down from this episode because the warsaw episode in
00:34:25,00:34:32,100 is he's a hero oh by the way for americans you call it krakow just in case you've been
00:34:32,00:34:38,wondering all this time what we're talking about but we call it krakow thousands of americans are
00:34:38,00:34:45,just going oh everything we've said they're like that's so weird they have that in krakow as well
00:34:45,00:34:54,i found a thing which is that america is running out of buglers and they desperately need them
00:34:54,00:35:01,they need them because in 2000 at the beginning of 2000 a new law was passed that if you were
00:35:01,00:35:06,an army veteran and you had died you were entitled to a military funeral and so what they would do
00:35:06,00:35:13,is they would have to send out three people to be their present and do a few military um uh regalia
00:35:13,00:35:18,type things one of which is they would have to play taps on the bugle taps being that song
00:35:21,00:35:27,i'm murdering that song but it's it's you know the classic american tune um now the problem is is
00:35:27,00:35:33,they don't have enough buglers to go and play this song so what they've had to invent is a ceremonial
00:35:33,00:35:40,bugle and the ceremonial bugle has inside it a sound system with the song pre-loaded so what you
00:35:40,00:35:45,end up having is these people playing the song but what they're doing is once they press down on one
00:35:45,00:35:51,of the buttons it just plays the song through a speaker system that is at the top of the bugle
00:35:51,00:35:56,and they just pretend that they're playing it because that's the best way in order to
00:35:56,00:35:59,commemorate the person who's being buried yeah dan i read about it it's so weird it seems like it's
00:35:59,00:36:03,this little black box that you shove into the end of your bugle and then you just press a button on
00:36:03,00:36:09,it and then you just hold the bugle it's really bizarre it's quite controversial isn't it because
00:36:09,00:36:15,some people are like well surely you should have a proper bugler at a funeral but then other people
00:36:15,00:36:20,say well you know what if we there is a shortage like dan says so if we don't do this we're just
00:36:20,00:36:25,going to have to have a boombox with playing the tap so that's going to be even worse but then the
00:36:25,00:36:31,other argument again is that you know when dan really murdered that tune a few seconds ago
00:36:31,00:36:37,that's kind of part of it so it's not really supposed to be perfect note for note when you play
00:36:37,00:36:42,the taps it's supposed to have emotion in it because the person who's playing it is quite upset
00:36:42,00:36:47,and so the the notes are supposed to be slightly often a bit shaky and stuff like that and you
00:36:47,00:36:52,obviously don't get that with the recording it'll get used to it it's like do you remember when
00:36:52,00:36:58,taxi drivers first started using sat nav and it was really disappointing and then you realize
00:36:58,00:37:04,that it's actually fine it's a bit like that yeah you're usually being taken three miles around the
00:37:04,00:37:08,houses and that's part of the ritual and the tradition it shows the emotion in the taxi driver
00:37:08,00:37:13,that you're being charged an extra tenor because he's not going to ask what exactly where this
00:37:13,00:37:20,which is going to be going to yeah i accidentally researched you know the band the bugles who did
00:37:20,00:37:26,video killed the radio star the bugles exactly i only realized that about an hour into my research
00:37:26,00:37:31,i spent genuinely an hour looking at every song they did to see if a bugle had ever been played
00:37:31,00:37:36,by the bugles and as far as i could find it hasn't but it doesn't matter anyway because that's not
00:37:36,00:37:44,what they're called the bugles did have a member called trevor horn so they'd get one thing out
00:37:44,00:37:55,of it so it wasn't wasted which is still not wasted now okay it is time for our final fact of the
00:37:55,00:38:01,show and that is Anna my fact this week is that when the conservationist Amy Dickman booked a
00:38:01,00:38:06,dentist appointment in Namibia she neglected to mention to the dentist that the patient
00:38:06,00:38:14,was a leopard how did the appointment go do we know it actually went quite well yeah it was a
00:38:14,00:38:20,series of appointments in the end as often happens with the dentist um and this was it was on the
00:38:20,00:38:26,BBC website a while back i think and it was an interview with her and she was saying that she
00:38:26,00:38:31,works in various african countries with threatened species she was in Namibia and she found a leopard
00:38:31,00:38:37,that got into a farmer's trap because farmers trap them to stop them killing their livestock
00:38:37,00:38:43,and she saw it had a broken canine so she anesthetized it and she called the local dentist and just
00:38:43,00:38:46,booked an appointment and then she said she arrived and there are obviously lots of people in the waiting
00:38:46,00:38:50,room who are frightened enough already because they're in a dentist waiting room and then a
00:38:50,00:38:55,leopard gets carried through and apparently the dentist really took to it after a while and
00:38:55,00:38:58,she explained it's okay i've anesthetized it so it's not going to wake up and eat you and so
00:38:58,00:39:03,the dentist was like how brilliant and they had to make a specially hard tooth for the leopard
00:39:03,00:39:08,because obviously they do much more tearing of their food than we do so he plotted using
00:39:08,00:39:14,titanium and steel and silver to make this tooth and it was basically okay well hang on scary moment
00:39:14,00:39:20,at the end when it went up missing the big end apart from when it better face off apart everyone
00:39:20,00:39:26,died and that's the end of my story no there was a moment where it had to go back for repeated
00:39:26,00:39:31,fittings and on the very last appointment she said she thinks there was a dodgy anesthetic
00:39:31,00:39:34,and all these crowds had gathered around to watch at this point because they've got quite a name
00:39:34,00:39:38,for themselves for having this leopard in the dentist so crowds of people in the room the
00:39:38,00:39:42,dentist said i'm pretty sure the leopard just blinked at me and they said don't be silly it's an
00:39:42,00:39:48,esotize 30 seconds later it that a massive roar and then climbed up off the table she said the
00:39:48,00:39:53,crowd she's never seen a crowd disappear from a room so fast they just jumped out the windows and
00:39:53,00:39:58,stuff and uh they had to chase it around and anesthetize it again which she then pointed out
00:39:58,00:40:03,i'd only ever really worked on cheaters which apparently who knew have very prominent veins
00:40:03,00:40:11,so very easy to um to vaccinate to anesthetize difficult to catch though the cheater but one
00:40:11,00:40:16,of the things they had to do as well so the the um the line had got up and sorry the leopard had
00:40:16,00:40:22,got up and it was walking around and the the dentist was too freaked out and didn't want to help with
00:40:22,00:40:26,the grappling of it and they were all freaking out and some of them ran out onto the road and by
00:40:26,00:40:32,chance the vet was walking down the road and they're like vet get here and out and the vet was
00:40:32,00:40:36,like what's something we've got a leopard that's awake and he ran in and helped hold down the
00:40:36,00:40:41,leopard and they they re-anesthetized it but like just total coincidence as they ran out that this
00:40:41,00:40:45,guy was just probably going to the shops and suddenly there was a leopard crisis in a film
00:40:45,00:40:50,he'd be like what are the chances he's walking by at that moment not realistic i think anesthetizing
00:40:50,00:40:57,the animals is one of the main problems of these kind of veterinary dentist isn't it because you
00:40:57,00:41:01,know anesthetizing animals is just a difficult thing to do i was reading about one in 24 which
00:41:01,00:41:10,was a jaguar called hebalba who needed five root canals and um they gave it anesthetic but unfortunately
00:41:10,00:41:16,the jaguar went into cardiac arrest and stopped breathing because it reacted badly to the anesthesia
00:41:17,00:41:23,and so the dentist who was called Nameak said that they tried a quick yank on the cat's testicles
00:41:23,00:41:31,and he was awake just like that and the jaguar completely recovered that's yeah dentists do
00:41:31,00:41:36,that that's normal isn't it yank on your butch did i yeah you um you swallow your rinse you spit
00:41:36,00:41:40,the dentist gives you a quick yank down there and then you go you get the sticker isn't it
00:41:42,00:41:49,i have my testicles yanked by mr smithson it seems like you have to have nerves of steel to go into
00:41:49,00:41:55,this kind of dentistry the animal world dentistry i was reading about a guy called peter emily he's
00:41:55,00:42:00,82 years old and he's a pioneer in this territory he says that he's operated basically on everything
00:42:00,00:42:07,with a mouth so he's done kangaroo he's done ferrets he did syggreen royce he's done a river
00:42:10,00:42:15,and in this article he was operating on a lion's head so you can imagine if that line wakes up
00:42:15,00:42:20,it's going to be terrifying while he was operating on the lion's mouth can we just say that as a
00:42:20,00:42:25,dentist most of the work he does is head based isn't it oh yes true what my point of saying that
00:42:25,00:42:31,though is at the very same time someone's down at the other end removing the lion's testicles so it
00:42:31,00:42:37,was it's a scary procedure yeah if you woke up that's one pissed off lion and then as he's doing
00:42:37,00:42:42,that procedure they bring in next to him a black leopard which is just laying perpendicular on the
00:42:42,00:42:48,table next to this lion so he's just surrounded in animals that if i can i ask would just rip his
00:42:48,00:42:52,head off why did they decide to take the testicles and the teeth out of the same time it's a two for
00:42:52,00:42:59,one also i don't just have one of those oh yeah yeah i have to say no complaints they are
00:43:02,00:43:07,in this case they were they were using them to um grow stem cells so it was two different
00:43:07,00:43:11,things happening from two different people it wasn't yeah in order to help out with a tooth
00:43:11,00:43:15,i guess if anesthetizing is hard which it is and i guess you don't want to do it too often so i
00:43:15,00:43:20,suppose you sort of take what chances you get while you've got a knocked out lion so there was
00:43:20,00:43:26,a guy a zoo dentist in the uk called peter another peter actually peter katech of paint and zoo he is
00:43:26,00:43:33,again one of the only zoo dentists in the world and in 2008 he did an operation on a gorilla
00:43:33,00:43:37,at paint and zoo and it took about 10 people to remove the gorilla's tooth because you've
00:43:37,00:43:41,got people positioning the gorilla you've got people monitoring the anesthetics you've got all
00:43:41,00:43:46,sorts of activity happening around and there's this huge you know 300 pound gorilla sitting
00:43:46,00:43:52,in the chair completely dead to the world and he's having to operate on it and he said peter
00:43:52,00:43:57,peter katech was interviewed and he said people often asked me if it is fun working on gorillas
00:43:57,00:44:04,and tigers it certainly is not fun it is very hard and serious work oh what a killjoy he's having
00:44:04,00:44:10,fun watching sat next to heaven and wedding yeah well tell us about the gorilla it's not fun
00:44:10,00:44:21,oh my god what a cool job wow it's actually horrible okay moving on um in terms of dentistry
00:44:21,00:44:26,it's not even just the teeth that they have to deal with so um this guy that was talking about
00:44:26,00:44:33,peter emily he also works on bird beaks as well and he's pioneered a speciality which he calls
00:44:33,00:44:39,ortho beakics and beak braces right i think he's the guy who does bird braces for beaks if you've
00:44:39,00:44:43,got i think the condition is called scissor beak technically isn't you know when you have a faulty
00:44:43,00:44:49,pair of scissors and the you can imagine the two bits not a faulty pair of scissors sorry a functioning
00:44:49,00:44:54,pair of scissors but the two bits don't crash into each other like a beak should they slide over
00:44:54,00:45:01,each other and so that's what scissor beak is um so he has braces for birds that they have to wear
00:45:01,00:45:06,and eventually it wrenches them back into place but they do get bullied at school i just say if
00:45:06,00:45:13,it's a crossbill they're supposed to be like that oh no do you think he's ruined loads of crossbills
00:45:13,00:45:22,they're just called bell yeah um rats if anyone has a pet rat uh they sometimes perform dentistry
00:45:22,00:45:32,on their owners oh and this is a thing that people let them do as i i find rats quite gross uh as i
00:45:32,00:45:37,think a lot of us do but what they like to do is inspect each other's teeth for spare food so they
00:45:37,00:45:42,often get food stuck in their teeth and their mate will have you know a bit of dairy milk stuck in
00:45:42,00:45:48,its tooth so they'll go and lick the food off and if you own a rat and you show it your teeth no it
00:45:48,00:45:52,will lick between your teeth and lick the food out and who needs a toothpick when you've got a pet
00:45:52,00:45:59,rat and people have been doing this i mean how many is is this a comment i have a friend who had a
00:45:59,00:46:04,pet rat i'm not going to tell you who it is because you know them i don't think that they will have
00:46:04,00:46:10,done that what you're saying james is that is this is this rare enough that we can make fun of it
00:46:10,00:46:14,and shame the people who do it or is it very common and we should be careful is it so common
00:46:14,00:46:23,that i need to rethink my friend's group they also have rank teeth anyway rats sorry no offense to
00:46:23,00:46:28,rats but they grow faster than human nails so they have to be constantly gnawing so you need to give
00:46:28,00:46:33,them stuff to chew all the time and they grow in spirals at an 85 degree angle so if their teeth come
00:46:33,00:46:39,out their mouths and they don't gnaw enough then they grow in this big spiral and when they're
00:46:39,00:46:45,chewing the masseter muscle which is the muscle that controls their jaw is positioned behind
00:46:45,00:46:49,their eyeballs so if you watch videos of rats chewing they do a thing called boggling at the
00:46:49,00:46:52,same time which is when their eyes that's dan's favourite band isn't it the boggles
00:46:52,00:47:02,sorry what is a boggling sorry ana it's known as what you think their eyes pop in and out of
00:47:02,00:47:10,their heads as they chew can i give you guys the fact about just general dentistry you know how we
00:47:10,00:47:15,all love uh nominative determinism yeah well i have gone off it a little bit i have to say
00:47:15,00:47:20,i have to read in this fact and i think that it might not be true um because i read that the first
00:47:20,00:47:27,woman to qualify as a dentist in england was called miss fanny pain and i think if nominative
00:47:27,00:47:34,determinism was real she would have been a gynecologist yeah fanny there should be something
00:47:34,00:47:39,called nominative anti determinism or something where they've gone the wrong way um so she um
00:47:39,00:47:45,qualified in 1914 there were um there were a few dentists before her because a few people
00:47:45,00:47:51,qualified in scotland before that uh female dentist i should say but like in the 19th century really
00:47:51,00:47:56,you only had male dentists uh and then there was fanny pain uh and there was another woman called
00:47:56,00:48:02,lillian lindsey um who became the first um female to qualify as a dentist in the whole u k because
00:48:02,00:48:09,she did hers in in scotland uh and it was so looked down upon um that when she tried to join the
00:48:09,00:48:16,national dental hospital in great portland street um the dean who was called harry vice harry harry
00:48:16,00:48:25,what harry harry vice yeah that's what causes the fanny pain he was called harry vice harry
00:48:25,00:48:29,wise harry vice and he refused to admit her because she was a woman and then when she
00:48:29,00:48:34,really insisted um he would only interview her on the pavement outside the school because he
00:48:34,00:48:40,didn't want her to distract all the other dentists who were inside wow but yeah eventually they did
00:48:40,00:48:47,and now i think um it's more than 50 of dentists in europe i think are women um people are trying
00:48:47,00:48:52,home dentistry now are they and i'll think it flies not to so is this a coronavirus thing
00:48:52,00:48:57,yep the economist reported on various dentists saying that they're very worried because a lot
00:48:57,00:49:00,of their patients are saying they're doing things like uh using needles to burst their
00:49:00,00:49:05,own abscesses uh in their mouths they're using knives and forks to take their teeth out and nail
00:49:05,00:49:10,files to cut down broken teeth my word i've actually been doing this myself at home and it's a real
00:49:10,00:49:18,nightmare because i've been having to yank on my own testicles when i'm finished okay that's it
00:49:18,00:49:22,that is all of our facts thank you so much for listening if you'd like to get in contact with any
