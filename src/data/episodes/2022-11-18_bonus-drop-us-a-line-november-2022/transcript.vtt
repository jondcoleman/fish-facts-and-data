00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:13.280
 - Hello and welcome to another episode of Drops Aligned.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.080
 This is the bit of club fish where we talk about

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.680
 the facts and the complaints and the comments

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.360
 and everything that you have sent in to us.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.360
 We've been monitoring the inbox like crazy

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.160
 and we've had some beautiful correspondence

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.040
 about all the stuff we've said recently.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.160
 So, should we start off with a quick correction?

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.000
 - Yeah, I don't.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.880
 - Okay, this is from Kate and Kate Rimes.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.880
 - Kate with a K.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.720
 - Kate with a K.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.560
 - Okay.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.080
 - Correction with a C.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.760
 - Correction also with a K.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.840
 - Oh.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.320
 - Hopefully not a third K.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.520
 - No, okay, anyway.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.080
 Just catching up on some old episodes,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.520
 needing to correct, I'm sorry, Dan.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.040
 Dan's fact, in episode 435.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.080
 - Yeah.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.560
 - 22 inches is not an enormous head.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.400
 (laughing)

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.240
 - Oh, no.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.080
 - Oh, okay.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.920
 - Oh, God.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.760
 - George Eliot.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.600
 - George Eliot.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.400
 - Yeah, she says, "My head is 24 and a half inches

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.200
 and no one has ever stopped me in the street to say,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.320
 "Oh my God, you have a big head.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.200
 "Although it is true,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 "I have never been able to buy a woman's hat."

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.540
 (laughing)

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.320
 - She's still allowed to buy it.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.560
 (laughing)

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.960
 I think I said on the show that my head was bigger

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.960
 than George Eliot's.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.360
 I think I'd measured my head

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.960
 and said it was a couple of inches bigger on the day.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.000
 - You are huge.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.600
 - I do and I can't get Christmas cracker hats

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.440
 to fit my head.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.280
 - Really?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.080
 - And in fact, it's a really sad moment

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.320
 every Christmas in the Harkin household

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.200
 because all of the Harkins have enormous heads.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.320
 And so every year we pull crackers

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.400
 and then we have these hats that no one can fit on

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.920
 and they just get a punch at the very top.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.480
 And then one year my mum managed to find

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.120
 extra-large hat crackers.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.960
 - That's great.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.800
 That exists.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.240
 - It was like it's a wonderful life.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.040
 (laughing)

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.000
 - I'm in tears imagining the scene.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.720
 - Look, can I just say to Kate with a C?

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.560
 - With a K.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.400
 - With a K?

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.800
 That's, it's not like I generated this fact.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.640
 I didn't look at the size of her head and go,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.520
 "I've discovered she has a massive head."

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.960
 Someone took her on a train to London from rural England

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.240
 to have it measured because he said, "This is massive."

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.200
 And then when she got there,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.560
 the person who measures head went,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.360
 "Yeah, that's a massive head."

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.440
 This is historically agreed upon as a massive head.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.920
 And I apologize that she can't find a hat that fits.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.760
 - Yeah.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.560
 - You don't need to apologize for that.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.400
 That's not your fault.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.600
 - I was just trying to sort of--

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.760
 - You don't control the hat industry?

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.760
 - I'm not angry at her.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.600
 - Okay, yeah, yeah.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.800
 I don't think she's angry at you.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.120
 I don't think anyone's, yeah, yeah.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.960
 - We're cool.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.800
 Kate, we're cool.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.640
 - We're all cool, definitely.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.480
 - Cool with a K.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.680
 - Oh, no, it's the three Ks.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.920
 (laughing)

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.760
 - All right, here's another one.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.120
 This is from an anonymous listener.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.960
 - Yeah.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.600
 - That does not bode well, does it?

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.560
 - Actually, they gave their name,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.440
 but they then asked later on for their name

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.120
 to be withheld from broadcast.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.960
 - Oh, interesting.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.800
 - Interesting, yeah.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.620
 - That is a celebrity.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.960
 - I don't think so.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.880
 - Okay.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.120
 - Right, a message for Dan.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.440
 I'm a long-time fish listener.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.280
 - Thank you.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.280
 - And was listening to you rave about the future

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.760
 of breakfast buffet technology

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.120
 on the latest podcast episode.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.480
 - Yes.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.160
 - I regret to inform you that such machines

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.960
 are not the future,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.400
 and have, I believe, been around since 1971,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.240
 at least according to this patent website,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.560
 a fascinating explanation of bread-pumping machines.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.240
 - Can you remind us what the machine was?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.560
 - Okay, so I was in Italy,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.940
 and I went to the--

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.040
 - Four-star.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.780
 - Four-star, never doing that again.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.400
 It's a star, it's a big dip down from the seven-star

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.880
 I stayed in, in Turkey.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.520
 And basically, they had a croissant machine

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.200
 where it was kind of like when you go to a pub

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.240
 and they pull pints.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.840
 It was, what you would do is you'd stick your croissant

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.560
 into a pipe, and then they would inject maybe Nutella

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.520
 or jam or something on the inside.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.840
 Now, okay, I can see what they're saying.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.120
 It's patented, sorry, patented.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.120
 Oh, how do I say that?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.960
 - It's tough, isn't it?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.800
 Where's that N going?

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.800
 - Do you use the word ten in the middle?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.200
 - Patented.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.040
 - Flawless.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.860
 - Yeah.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.840
 - Patented invention in the '70s,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.180
 but when was it?

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.760
 (all laughing)

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.800
 - You were working so hard on patented.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.920
 - But when's it been applied to real life?

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.760
 - Well, listen.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.600
 - Because none of us had heard of it.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.000
 - The first time our correspondent saw one was in 2000

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.720
 as they were a norm in Slovak bakeries

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.800
 where I lived, just lived.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.640
 - Lived in a bakery.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.400
 - Resume works.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.920
 But anyway, our correspondent also writes,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.480
 and I'm not giving away any details about them,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.400
 I also used to work at a crispy cream factory, okay,

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.720
 where we use these machines.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.300
 Every night shift, we made thousands of donuts,

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.200
 most filled, right, filled donuts.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.160
 You grab one in each hand and push them simultaneously

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.920
 into the machine needles,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.320
 which shoot out the filling from a tub.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.480
 The tub, incidentally, is refilled by hand,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.360
 ungloved, as is all of the donut making.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.240
 (all laughing)

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.280
 - Yeah, but it's not refilled.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.400
 What, by the way, we're scooping the actual bare hands

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.240
 into a big tub of jam.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.720
 - That's why they're called crispy creams,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.840
 it's all fingernails.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.080
 (all laughing)

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.960
 - We scooped out the cream, strawberry jam,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.920
 and other fillings with our bare hands.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.360
 A bit gross at first, but after a while,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.520
 you don't think about it.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.920
 This is why our correspondent didn't want to be named.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.120
 From a giant meter high container,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.280
 a meter high container of jam,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.320
 and put it into the tub,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.960
 and then for a minimum wage, well, for that wage,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.000
 we pumped these at a rate of about one pump,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 two donuts per second.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.560
 - Amazing, that's pretty cool.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.800
 - And our KPI, the sort of thing you're aiming at,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.080
 is to complete a full trolley of 384 donuts

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.480
 in under 15 minutes, two seconds per two donuts.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.960
 - Wow. - Can I just say

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.120
 that I'm pretty sure that crispy cream these days,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.240
 in all of its places where it works,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.480
 has got extremely high hygiene standards.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.560
 - Stop trying to get freebies, crispy cream, freebies, okay?

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.760
 - I think it's just trying to not be sued.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.400
 - Freebies? - Yeah.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.000
 - All right, do you want to hear about leaving children?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.160
 Oh, leaving children at the thing?

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.840
 - The cinema? - The cinema, oh yeah, okay.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.560
 - In the cloakroom, it's not as you go to see a film

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.920
 and leave your kid behind.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.720
 - I did in fact, not too long ago,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.120
 which is sad that-- - The damn heavy drop is alive.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.200
 - In Melbourne, there was a cinema that operated

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.680
 where you left your child in a sort of cloakroom

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.280
 in their pram, and you took a ticket,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.640
 and then when you were watching the film,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.600
 if the kid was awake and crying,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.160
 your number would flash up on the screen

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.480
 to let you know to go and to help, yeah.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.800
 - Okay, so two people got in touch and said,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.040
 "That cinema in Melbourne was called The Sun."

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.280
 That cinema is run by a guy called Michael Smith,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.600
 who's a legend.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.800
 Michael Smith has flown around the world in a seaplane.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.040
 - Okay. - Michael Smith is a really cool guy.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.480
 He's always having amazing adventures.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.160
 And then we've got another email in the e-box

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.880
 from one Michael Smith.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.240
 - No! - Yeah.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.080
 - It's got a common name, though,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.640
 so is it something completely different?

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.440
 - No, it's Michael of The Sun in Melbourne.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.280
 - That's great.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.080
 - Yeah, and he said, "When we bought The Cinema in the '90s,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.640
 "it was derelict and had been closed for nearly 20 years.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.720
 "During the rebuild, we planned to include

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.920
 "the pram room idea.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.640
 "They wanted to bring it back,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.080
 "so they were thwarted by red tape."

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.840
 - That sounds like a supervillain.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.680
 Red tape.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.920
 (laughing)

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.360
 - That's it.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.600
 - And so anyway, that's Michael.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.640
 But we got loads of correspondence from other people

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.040
 who remember this happening in the UK,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.360
 the baby leaving thing.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.960
 So Ben Wright says, "Buttlands, holiday camps in the UK,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.640
 "buttlands, big chain of holiday camps,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.600
 "if you're not listening to Breton,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.120
 "they used to have a system

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.800
 "that would alert people to baby crying in a Chalet X."

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.160
 Right, so you were at the bar,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.720
 you'd left your child in the cottage

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.400
 or the house you were staying in,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.920
 and there would be a light-up thing at the bar

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.960
 saying there's a baby crying there,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.720
 and they would have people patrolling Buttlands,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.240
 listening for crying babies.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.320
 - Wow. - And they would radio into the bar,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.480
 and the bar would put it up on the screen.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.320
 - That's great. - And you'd see

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.160
 and you'd go back.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.280
 - But can I put a quick calling out to our listeners?

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.960
 This was something I couldn't verify,

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.240
 but I was told it by someone,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.040
 and this supposedly happened in America.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.680
 In cinemas, they would have,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.520
 children would go to see the movies,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.240
 and they would be watching the film,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.480
 and then their parents would call in

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.360
 from home to the cinema.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.600
 And on the screen, it would say,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.160
 "Michael Smith, your mother's called,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.000
 "you need to get home." - Where'd you go?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.280
 Where'd you put that name up?

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.840
 (all laughing)

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.760
 - And so then the child would know to go home

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.320
 during the movie if they were needed.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.560
 And I couldn't find that anywhere,

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.080
 which is what led me to discovering

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.600
 the Sun Theatre in Melbourne.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.640
 - Did you say USA? - Yeah, exactly.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.640
 So anyone in America listening,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.640
 if you've ever heard of this,

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.480
 I'd love to find out if it's true.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.840
 - So let me halfway through the movie,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.200
 you get told it's your bedtime,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.040
 you'll have to leave,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040
 and you miss the end of the movie.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.000
 - If you're needed for dinner,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.600
 or if you're needed just to get home

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.880
 for whatever reason.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.960
 - Yeah, way to ruin a kid's reputation.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.480
 Imagine how embarrassing.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.080
 - It depends what you're putting on the screen.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.480
 You could say it's time for your fungus application.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.320
 (all laughing)

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.880
 - Cream. - Yeah.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.920
 - When I was a kid, I used to,

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.440
 I would play football outside,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.400
 and then my parents would tell me to come in for bed.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.760
 And then I would climb out of the window of my bedroom

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.120
 and go outside and play football in my pajamas.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.120
 - How do you fit your huge head out of the bedroom window?

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.160
 - So many times the fire brigade were cold.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.880
 (all laughing)

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.960
 Can I tell you something that someone tweeted me?

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.720
 This is from Tom Diel, I suppose it's Delsiel,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.560
 but I suppose it's pronounced Diel.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.720
 Do you remember, Andy,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.680
 you mentioned a particular movie about dancing in America.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.520
 - The Shag.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.680
 - The Shag. - The Shag dance, yeah.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.880
 - And there was a movie called Shag,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.680
 and at the end they have a big Shag Off

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.360
 to see who's the best Shagger.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.960
 It's called Shag.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.960
 But Tom Diel sent me a photo from 1989

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.840
 of his local cinema in Muir End in Glasgow,

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.080
 and it had three films on that weekend.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.120
 The first one was Big with Tom Hanks.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.960
 The second one was Roman Polanski's Frantic,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.280
 and the third one was the movie Shag.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.520
 And on the sides it just says Big Frantic Shag.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.360
 - Beautiful.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.560
 - That's the best day of that cinema in my life.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.040
 - It's so good.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:44.960
 - It's good, isn't it?

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.120
 - God, that's amazing.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.080
 - Yeah.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.160
 - Okay, we've had an email from a Hollywood producer.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.400
 - Oh yeah?

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.240
 - I mean, yes.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.360
 - Here we go.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.200
 - James Cameron.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.040
 - Full nudity.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:54.860
 Fine.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.680
 (all laughing)

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.520
 It was you guys.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.920
 - You won't do it unless there's full nudity of all.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.680
 - So he's called Quentin Plock, brilliant name.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.520
 - What a name.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.000
 - And it's just a quick note regarding one of Dan's

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.520
 quote mark facts from the end of the Shirley Temple segment.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.680
 Unfair, 'cause it's actually not a complaint.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.320
 But Quentin is a producer in Los Angeles

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.560
 and sent the rules for, you remember baby actors,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.760
 you know the Shirley Temple thing?

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.600
 - Oh yeah.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.040
 - And there's this whole chart.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.000
 Look, I'll show it to you here.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.240
 It's how long minors are allowed to be on set.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.000
 Okay, and it's really complicated,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.840
 depending on the--

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.880
 - This is an audio format.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.860
 So, at home, just imagine a chart.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.620
 - If anything, it was less exciting in the room

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.740
 than it was for you guys at home to hear.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.660
 - At least you guys had the potential of thinking

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.620
 this might be a good chart.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.460
 - Yeah.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.980
 - So if you're between 15 days and six months old,

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.980
 you're only allowed to be working for 20 minutes.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.260
 And then you need now 40 minutes of R and R, you know.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.060
 And also, okay, here's a quiz for you guys.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.220
 Newborns are sometimes referred to as bagels on set.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.460
 Can you guess why?

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.860
 - Full of cream cheese.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.420
 - No.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.940
 - Yes, exactly.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.020
 - They're covered in what?

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.900
 - They're covered in cream cheese and jam.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.060
 And it's to simulate the fluids

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.900
 you're covered in when you're born.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.740
 - Oh, really?

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.580
 - What?

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.400
 - Yeah, kind of cream cheese.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.240
 - What the hell?

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.460
 - I'm sorry I took so long to reply,

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.380
 'cause I just can't believe that you got it in one.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.220
 - What?

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.060
 - Yeah, 'cause they don't put--

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.420
 - Like the verniks kind of thing.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.260
 - Like the verniks, the sort of weird cheesy stuff

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.380
 you're covered in when you come out of the room.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.220
 Yeah, yeah.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.040
 - Wow.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.260
 - And that's why they're called bagels.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.100
 - Yum.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.460
 - 'Cause they're covered in cream cheese and jam.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.260
 - Was there any logic to you picking that?

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.740
 - Well, it's what you're getting bagels.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:30.580
 - Bagels?

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.420
 - Oh, yeah.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.740
 (laughing)

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.580
 - The logic is the same logic weirdly that they're using.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.820
 - Okay, it's weirdly less impressive now that I know that.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.700
 - It was a hard time to follow.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.780
 - You've seen behind the scenes.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.620
 - Well, so has Quentin Plock offered to put us in a movie?

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.340
 - I have written back and offered our services.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.220
 - Go ahead, you gotta send your next Plockbuster.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.060
 - Hey.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:51.900
 - Thank you very much.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.540
 (laughing)

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.220
 - Dan also available for script writing.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.660
 - There we go.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.940
 - Hey, can I show you a discovery of mine for this week?

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.980
 - Is this another visual?

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.500
 - No, it's not a visual actually.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.500
 I've discovered that there's a website

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.300
 that's been transcribing every single one of our episodes.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.220
 So you can have it as a written transcript.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.060
 - That's really useful.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:10.900
 - Is there really?

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.740
 - They're really useful.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.620
 - So yeah, so it's podgist.com.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.260
 And then, so that's podcast transcripts.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.420
 But if you put in no such thing as a fish transcripts

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.540
 into Google, you'll find it.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.820
 It's not the greatest of...

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.660
 - Transcripts.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.940
 (all laughing)

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.420
 - So I've just taken down a few of the introductions

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.100
 just to give you an idea of how the transcribing comes out.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.500
 So hello and welcome to another episode.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.620
 No such thing as a fish.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.580
 My name is Dam Shriver.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.300
 I'm sitting here with addictives

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.940
 since King Andrew Hunter, Murray and Jeans Oregon.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:44.900
 (all laughing)

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.740
 And once again, we have, so that's one.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.060
 My name is Dead and Shriver.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.060
 I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter,

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.100
 Marie Amiturkinsky and Joy.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.700
 (all laughing)

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.700
 Miss Harkin.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.220
 And then welcome.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.740
 And this is an episode that I wasn't on.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.140
 This is when Tim Harford came on.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.620
 So my name is Anna Tushit Ski.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.020
 (all laughing)

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.740
 And I'm here with James Aitian.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.060
 Want and our very special guest, Tim Harford.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:13.900
 So it's...

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.220
 - That is how we introduce that one.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.060
 - Yes.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.260
 (all laughing)

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.580
 - I'm sitting here with an addition skiing.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.180
 Andrew events, unmarried and James Harkin.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.700
 (all laughing)

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.100
 I think maybe all future episodes,

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.460
 I'll just do an intro from a previous episode.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.780
 - Oh my God.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.260
 - Tushitski.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.420
 - It's like the opening of "Forty Towers"

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.260
 every time when they rearrange.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.260
 (all laughing)

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.100
 - Oh, that's great.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.260
 - That's great.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.060
 - Do you wanna hear a fact of the...

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:43.900
 - One last fact.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.740
 - One last fact.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.380
 This is kind of a slow burn effect,

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.300
 but I think it's brilliant.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.260
 It's from a listener called David Childs,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.460
 who was researching lakes.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.300
 Good thing to do.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.140
 - Yeah.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.220
 - Limnologist.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.260
 - Yeah.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.340
 There's a lake on Ontario.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.180
 - Ontario.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.020
 - Ontario.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.620
 It's a place called Heart Lake, right?

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.980
 And there's a lake next door to Heart Lake

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.500
 called Teapot Lake, right?

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.580
 - Yeah.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.180
 - And David was researching Teapot Lake

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.980
 and found out that it is a specific kind of lake

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.460
 caused by the melting of glaciers

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.900
 which creates an indentation in the earth, right?

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.940
 And that is known as a cattle lake.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.980
 So Teapot Lake is a cattle lake.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.100
 - Very nice.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.260
 Isn't that great?

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.780
 What's Heart Lake got to do with this, generally?

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.220
 - It's just more famous, I guess.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.060
 It's a bigger lake.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.260
 - It was David's way into how we found out about Teapot Lake.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.500
 - It's the only way you can get to Teapot Lake.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.500
 It's through the heart.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.340
 - Oh.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.060
 - It's a nice note to end on.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.780
 Anyway, thank you, David, for that lovely fact.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.620
 It's a great fact.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.260
 - Yeah.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.100
 - All right, bye.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.340
 (laughing)

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:51.060
 - It feels more and more natural every week when you do it.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.820
 - Do you want to tell people what to do

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.580
 if they have any quiggles or anything like that?

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.060
 - Okay, that's it for this drop of the line.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.620
 If you would like to get in touch,

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.860
 or send us a fact or a comment or bonus info,

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.900
 we love hearing extra stuff about whether it's the Sun Theatre

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.500
 or whether it's about bagels or donuts or whatever it is.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.380
 It's so interesting to hear.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.140
 All you have to do is email podcast@qi.com

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.420
 or we're all on Twitter,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.500
 apart from Anna, if you have an individual comment too.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.140
 - And we have a group Twitter account @NoSuchThing.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.980
 - We certainly do.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.220
 - And we aren't mastered on yet.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.820
 - Not yet, but it's only a matter of time.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.260
 I set us up on Truth Social.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.220
 I hope you guys don't mind.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.060
 (laughing)

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.900
 And just one last thing.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.980
 You can also get to our Discord,

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.780
 the super secret bonus bit of club fish

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.060
 where you can chat about the show,

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.940
 swap theories about what we might be doing right now,

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.020
 exchange your own facts.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.300
 It's a really fun place to be.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.500
 And we're there, we pop in and we monitor the chat sometimes

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.580
 and say hello.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.180
 Dan, you've been doing that, I think, Dan.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.020
 (laughing)

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.060
 - One of us does, one of us does.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:47.900
 - And you can get that.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.740
 If you're listening to this,

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.220
 you can get that by going to

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:54.340
 nosuchthingsafish.com/fishcord.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.700
 So we do hope that some of you will be seeing down there.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.780
 All right, that's it.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.820
 - Andy, why don't you take us out

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.260
 by reading how a transcript ends a regular show.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.220
 - Oh yeah.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.380
 - So thank you so much for listening.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.580
 - Thank you so much for listening.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.900

 I don't come yet, but you can go to our group,

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.580
 which is that no such thing or website.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:34.380
 Come back here next week.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.780
 We will be here waiting for you with another episode.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.020
 We'll see them good.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:38.860
 Bye.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.100
 (laughing)

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.520
 (upbeat music)

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.100
 (upbeat music)

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.680

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.100

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.680
