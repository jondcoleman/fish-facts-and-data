1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,720
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,400
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,200
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,800
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,960
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,200
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,640
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,040
 And once again, we have gathered

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,440
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,040
 from the last seven days.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,520
 And in no particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,320
 Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,240
 - My fact is that the first man to use the word avocado

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,360
 in English was a pirate.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,700
 - Oh.

17
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,520
 - Arvacado.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,280
 - Arvacado.

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,280
 - That just sounds like you saying it normally, Dan.

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,160
 (laughing)

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,200
 - Wow, okay.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,360
 - This is a guy called William Dampier

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,320
 and he was an explorer.

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,800
 He lived from 1651 to 1715.

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,120
 And he was lots of things, actually.

26
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,520
 He was a hydrographer.

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,560
 He was a scientist, a writer, a naturalist,

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,920
 Royal Navy captain.

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,200
 And we have a picture of him.

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,840
 It's in the National Gallery.

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,760
 It's the only 100% genuine portrait of a British pirate.

32
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,600
 - Ooh.

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,440
 - So he's quite--

34
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,840
 - Does he have a pirate on his shoulder?

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,080
 - Yeah, I patch.

36
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,760
 He's biting a gold doubloon.

37
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,520
 (laughing)

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,840
 - So it's sort of making someone walk the plank, yeah.

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,480
 No, I don't think he is.

40
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,760
 I think he looks like a normal man.

41
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,080
 But he was a pirate, among lots of other things.

42
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,040
 And he wrote this account of the avocado pear tree.

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,280
 And that's in the OED.

44
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,520
 When you look under avocado, his entry is the first one.

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,240
 He gave a little report about the avocado

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,080
 and said how nice it was.

47
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,560
 - How many entries are there for avocado

48
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,880
 then after his one?

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,640
 - Well, loads, 'cause the OED sort of gives,

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,480
 they give a load of different--

51
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,640
 - When it's an exciter and stuff.

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,240
 - Yeah, it's about five or six.

53
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,000
 - Well, I think there's only one definition.

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,200
 I'm not sure you've got like the verb avocado.

55
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,680
 (laughing)

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,920
 - This isn't the definition.

57
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,400
 This is the citation.

58
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
 - Yes, yeah.

59
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,480
 - He actually has over a thousand entries in the OED.

60
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,120
 - Of all the things that he has in the OED,

61
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,600
 I looked at them all where he's the first citation.

62
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,320
 So the first example we have,

63
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,080
 he was the first person to use the word thunder cloud.

64
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,920
 - Wow.

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,320
 - Which is quite good.

66
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,920
 To frape the verb.

67
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,760
 - Facebook.

68
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,160
 (laughing)

69
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,000
 - Is it a frape?

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 - He used the word meaning to bind tightly.

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,240
 - Soy sauce as well.

72
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,200
 Soy sauce, which is my favorite.

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,120
 - Chopsticks.

74
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,240
 - Chopsticks, which are my favorite utensils.

75
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,120
 - And a lot of this is 'cause I guess he was travelling

76
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,600
 so much, and he was writing reports on his travels

77
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,440
 and so he was coming into contact around the world

78
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
 with a lot of words not previously known to English.

79
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,960
 So that's part of the reason why.

80
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,480
 - Well, I think that maybe even more amazing thing

81
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,840
 about him is that he had a great recipe for avocado,

82
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,640
 which involves smashing it to pieces

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,000
 and adding sugar and lime juice by making guacamole.

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,040
 - Such a hipster.

85
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
 - He gave us guac.

86
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,640
 - Although the tragic thing about him is

87
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,880
 he wrote so much about guacamole

88
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,760
 that he was never actually able to afford his own pirate ship

89
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,840
 'cause he just spent so much money on the...

90
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,640
 - On frat pays as well.

91
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,960
 (laughing)

92
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,480
 - So he always stopped renting those ships,

93
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,320
 wasn't he?

94
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,040
 He couldn't burn anything on the walls.

95
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,800
 - So these words, he wrote quite a few books,

96
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
 but he had a very, very famous one,

97
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,600
 which was A New Voyage Around the World,

98
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,640
 which was a book that was so influential

99
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,920
 that Darwin took a copy of it onto the Beagle with him.

100
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,880
 And, you know, is it this one book

101
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,120
 where we get a lot of these?

102
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,160
 - Most of them are from that.

103
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
 I mean, that's pretty crazy.

104
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,000
 - I think that was his main book.

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,800
 I think he wrote lots of other random stuff,

106
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,080
 but yeah, that was his big one, wasn't it?

107
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,240
 And it was really popular, 1697.

108
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,680
 And it was when he'd gone around the world

109
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,920
 for the first time, was it?

110
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,440
 And then he went around another two times.

111
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,840
 And it was full of food recipes.

112
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
 He was a foodie.

113
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,760
 He was a big old hipster foodie.

114
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,120
 Barbecue, kumquat, tortilla,

115
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,720
 and he included recipes

116
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,280
 of what was the best thing to do with them.

117
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,840
 So he really recommended Flamingo Tongue,

118
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,640
 if you're ever in the market.

119
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,080
 He said it's very good, it's lean and black,

120
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,640
 and it's neither fishy nor unsavory.

121
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,480
 - Yummy.

122
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,960
 - He also had armadillo,

123
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,280
 which he said tastes a bit like lan turtle,

124
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,800
 if you're not sure.

125
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,960
 - Oh, like lan turtle, no, I can picture it, yeah, yummy.

126
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,440
 - Prickly pears, right?

127
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,400
 Which is a type of cactus.

128
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,960
 And he said that it turned his urine so red

129
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,640
 that it looked like blood.

130
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,480
 - Yeah.

131
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,320
 - Okay, but I actually have some prickly pear candy at home.

132
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,600
 So I tried some yesterday

133
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,120
 and I'm yet to experience any red urine.

134
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,840
 But I thought I'd bring you all some.

135
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,760
 - Oh, no, a bit of urine?

136
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,320
 Or it's just a small vial James is getting at.

137
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,520
 - I've got some prickly pear candies

138
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,000
 that I thought you might want to munch on

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,840
 if you feel like it. - Oh, lovely.

140
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,080
 Oh my God, they're delicious.

141
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,200
 - And they're very red.

142
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,280
 They look a bit like Turkish delight, don't they?

143
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,400
 - I'm a huge fan of the show and tell element

144
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
 of the podcast now.

145
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,240
 I really like James' experience corner.

146
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,280
 - That's good for the listeners.

147
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,720
 - What do you really enjoy about it?

148
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,560
 - It's so yummy.

149
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,760
 - They taste a bit like fruit pastels, don't they?

150
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,240
 - Yes, exactly like that.

151
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,360
 - I'm really excited because I got these at Christmas

152
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
 and they've just been sat there

153
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,520
 'cause I didn't really want to eat them

154
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,960
 'cause they're made of cactus.

155
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,520
 I finally got an excuse to.

156
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,800
 - They're so good.

157
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,880
 He also used to eat sea turtles,

158
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,400
 but he had a preference for the ones that were grass fed.

159
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,520
 - Grass fed sea turtles. - Was that an ethical preference

160
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,480
 or you don't want the ones that are grain fed

161
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,800
 and kept in cages?

162
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
 - Yeah, exactly.

163
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,280
 No, he just said that they're the best of that sort,

164
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,200
 both in largeness and in sweetness.

165
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,280
 So quantity and taste.

166
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,280
 And it's just quite amazing to imagine that this guy

167
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,960
 who was a pirate, let's remember him,

168
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,080
 yeah, was going around.

169
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,240
 It's like, can I get grass fed turtles please?

170
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,080
 - I don't know.

171
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,240
 - True, yeah, yeah.

172
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,360
 He wasn't a very good pirate at first.

173
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,680
 His first act of piracy was an absolute disaster.

174
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,800
 So it was like the British government was given

175
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,440
 in permission to take over Spanish ships, wasn't it?

176
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,640
 - He was a bit more of a privateer,

177
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,960
 a sort of licensed pirate than a Blackbeard figure.

178
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,880
 - The Spanish would call him a pirate for sure.

179
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,000
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

180
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,840
 From their perspective.

181
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,480
 - The Spanish would call him a lot of things, wouldn't they?

182
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,920
 - Well, he and his fellow Buccaneers,

183
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,360
 they attacked a Spanish fort.

184
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,200
 It was very exciting.

185
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,040
 They managed to take it over,

186
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,000
 but the townspeople had left

187
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,240
 with absolutely everything valuable.

188
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
 So it was a complete disaster.

189
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,400
 And lots of his voyages were failures actually financially,

190
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,760
 but he was always making observations,

191
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,120
 writing down recipes,

192
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,920
 and it was basically long-distance book research

193
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,000
 that he was doing.

194
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,480
 - It's not what you've sent him for, is it?

195
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,800
 I haven't got you any gold,

196
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,360
 but I've come back with a Delia Smith-esque tone.

197
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,200
 - So, well, Delia Smith actually used to be a pirate.

198
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,320
 It was a mercenary.

199
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,200
 She was a soldier of fortune in the 80s,

200
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,680
 but a lot of that was recipe collected, yeah.

201
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,480
 - Another thing that William Dampier did

202
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,280
 was he was the first British sailor to reach Australia.

203
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,360
 He got there way before the first fleets got over there.

204
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,480
 And weirdly, he has a few moments

205
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,280
 that we don't really give him the sort of acknowledgement for.

206
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,600
 There's this weird passage in his book

207
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,760
 where he's in the Galapagos

208
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,240
 and he's looking at the turtles there,

209
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,760
 and he's saying, "Oh, they look a different breed."

210
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,680
 And I wonder if that's helping towards their mating

211
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,520
 and so on, just writes a few random lines,

212
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,400
 just sort of suggesting that there's sort of evolutionary

213
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,080
 benefit to the way that they're shaped

214
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,280
 without naming that specifically.

215
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,000
 - Oh, so he says these suit their environment

216
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,920
 because they look like this.

217
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,680
 - Exactly, yeah.

218
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,040
 Which is just so Darwinian.

219
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,320
 - And Darwin had the book.

220
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,160
 - Nice.

221
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
 - He became very famous,

222
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,280
 which is once his voyaging days were over.

223
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,800
 He went to dinner with Samuel Peeps.

224
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,920
 He lectured at the Royal Society.

225
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
 And the last bit of Galapagos travels

226
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,840
 is based on his journeys in part.

227
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,800
 - Did he meet like a tribe of giants and all that stuff?

228
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,280
 - That's the second book of Galapagos travels,

229
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,800
 not the final one, it's a bit more normal.

230
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,520
 It just contains talking horses.

231
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,040
 - Well, he was in South America

232
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,280
 and he did see some horses there.

233
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,920
 He said, "Here they have several horses,

234
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,480
 "but what is most worthy of note

235
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,360
 "is a sort of sheep they have,

236
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,640
 "which inhabitants call conera de terra.

237
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,960
 "The creature is four foot and a half high

238
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,760
 "and they're frequently ridden

239
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,000
 "by two of the lustiest men of the area," he said.

240
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,680
 And he's almost certainly talking about llamas, we think.

241
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,240
 So he's one of the first people to see llamas from the West.

242
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,640
 - Cool, what a life.

243
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,200
 - It's very difficult when you read about him

244
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,160
 because he was in many ways quite a bad guy.

245
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,000
 - Okay.

246
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,160
 - Oh, he is a Spanish person.

247
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,720
 (laughing)

248
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
 - I've been talking to some of my friends in Madrid

249
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,000
 and they do not go down well there.

250
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,240
 As anyone in that period, it was nuanced

251
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,840
 to say the least relationship with the natives

252
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,520
 that he met at various places and wrote some pretty awful things

253
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,240
 for instance about Australian Aboriginals.

254
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,440
 As a leader as well, he was pretty widely disliked.

255
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,520
 So we should say that the thing maybe he's most famous

256
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,720
 for today is that he was also responsible

257
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
 for Robinson Crusoe, essentially,

258
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,800
 because Alexander Selkirk,

259
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,200
 who we think Robinson Crusoe was based on,

260
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,760
 was on his ship and hated him so much

261
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,200
 or thought that he was very bad at maintaining the ship

262
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,920
 and said, "I think this ship's gonna sink.

263
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,960
 "I'm not gonna get on it until we fix it."

264
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,280
 And I think it was Dampier who said, "No, the ship's fine.

265
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,880
 "We can sail this ship."

266
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,680
 - So was this halfway through a voyage, do you mean?

267
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,000
 - Halfway through a voyage.

268
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,240
 - So basically they were going around Cape Horn

269
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,400
 and this guy, Selkirk, said, "Don't go around Cape Horn.

270
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,840
 "It's a terrible place to go around.

271
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,520
 "It's always stormed, it's high winds.

272
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,680
 "It's like the middle of hurricane season or whatever.

273
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,880
 "We can't do that."

274
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,600
 And then they went, "Well, we're gonna do it anyway."

275
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,120
 And so by the time they got through,

276
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,920
 all of the ships were a little bit bashed

277
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,520
 and he was like, "These are gonna sink on the way home.

278
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,560
 "Get me off here.

279
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,200
 "Get me to wherever the nearest island is.

280
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,960
 "I wanna go to the nearest island."

281
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,840
 And so they sent him to the nearest island

282
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,840
 and as he got there, the other ship started to go away

283
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,760
 and he's like, "I've changed my mind, I've changed my mind."

284
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,520
 And they were like pretending they couldn't hear him

285
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,560
 and saying, "What, what, sorry, we love it."

286
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,400
 And I read Robinson Crusoe a year or two ago

287
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,960
 and there's no mention at the beginning of it

288
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,040
 that he was a really annoying backseat driver

289
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,800
 after the voyage and it's very sympathetically presented

290
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,640
 into Facebook.

291
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,240
 - Well, to be fair, he had a very good point

292
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
 because the ship sank shortly afterwards

293
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,480
 and most of the crew died and the rest ended up in prison.

294
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,560
 - It was more annoying when the backseat driver

295
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,400
 turns out to be right.

296
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,720
 That's really frustrating.

297
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,440
 - Didn't Selkirk then get picked up four years later

298
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,880
 on another ship that had dampier honors?

299
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,720
 - Yeah, he did.

300
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,600
 - Imagine that, he's like, "Finally, someone's coming to us."

301
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,840
 - But then when he got back on that ship, he realized

302
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,000
 and he was like, "No, I want to be marooned again."

303
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,960
 And they eventually talked him round.

304
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,280
 - As in he genuinely was, yeah.

305
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,280
 That sounds like a joke, but yeah, he genuinely did say.

306
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,200
 Set me off.

307
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,960
 - As they picked up Selkirk, they managed to find

308
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,240
 a Spanish fleet, didn't they?

309
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,960
 And they managed to get a load of treasure

310
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,360
 from them, a load of booty,

311
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,960
 which meant Selkirk got a load of money

312
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,400
 and he could retire when he got back to Britain.

313
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,280
 So he came home, he was very rich,

314
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,040
 but he couldn't quite readjust to society

315
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,840
 'cause he'd been on this island for however long,

316
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,600
 being a Robinson Crusoe guy.

317
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,120
 And so he went to Scotland

318
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,280
 and spent 15 years living in a cave.

319
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,440
 - Oh my God.

320
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,160
 - Which feels to me like a missed sequel

321
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,680
 to Robinson Crusoe, doesn't it?

322
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,000
 - Yeah.

323
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,800
 - Robinson Crusoe lives in a cave.

324
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,200
 - I think it's got all the promise

325
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,240
 of a disappointing second series, I have to say.

326
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,200
 - I got like Robinson too, so.

327
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,040
 - Yeah.

328
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,960
 - With what I would call it.

329
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,880
 - Nice.

330
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,720
 - I like it.

331
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,560
 - Will you write books now?

332
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,400
 - Thank you.

333
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,800
 - So Dampier, the first person in the OED

334
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,920
 to mention the word avocado, as we say it today.

335
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,520
 But before that, they had different ways

336
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,680
 of saying the word.

337
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,760
 So we kind of get it from the Spanish word.

338
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,120
 People would say Aguacarta or Aguacardo

339
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,520
 and stuff like that.

340
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,000
 You can see online a big list of all the early times

341
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,800
 when people mentioned this fruit.

342
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,480
 They started in 1562, going to the 17th century.

343
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,920
 And in 1660, they talk about this poem

344
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,600
 that was written by Abraham Cowley,

345
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,400
 which mentions avocados.

346
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,920
 But they don't say what the poem is.

347
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,000
 None of the places say what the poem is.

348
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,160
 And that really intrigued me.

349
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,600
 I'm like, why are they glossing over this?

350
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,740
 So I found this poem.

351
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,720
 "A fragrant leaf, the Aguacarta bears,

352
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,640
 "her fruit in fashion of an egg appears,

353
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,800
 "with such a white and sperm-y juice itself

354
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,160
 "as represents moist life's first principles."

355
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,000
 I said that as a completely flawed description.

356
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,720
 Are we sure they don't want the avocado?

357
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,440
 I've never got white juice swelling out of my avocados.

358
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,080
 No, sperm-y juice in your avocado.

359
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,000
 No, am I not leaving it long enough to ripen?

360
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,840
 They had different types of avocados.

361
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,840
 The one that we eat now is a Hass avocado most of the time.

362
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,360
 And this was an old kind of one that you would get.

363
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,040
 Some of them were white and egg-shaped.

364
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,600
 I think the main crime there is rhyming

365
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,840
 swells with principles, which is not...

366
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,280
 That's what offends me the most,

367
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,840
 apart from the sperm-y juice.

368
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,680
 Do you know there's a Hass avocado board

369
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,440
 with the official authorities on Hass avocados,

370
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,800
 which is the ones that almost everyone eats today.

371
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,160
 And they have huge amounts of data on their website

372
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,160
 about avocado consumption, US-based, mainly.

373
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,680
 So is that why that guy was following me

374
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,760
 when I went to my local organic shop to buy some avocados?

375
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,040
 Yeah, that's right, yeah, yeah.

376
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,200
 Would you say it's very sperm-y, sir?

377
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,000
 It's quite sperm-y, very sperm-y.

378
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Two sperm-y. They released a bit of research recently

379
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,640
 that they found that avocado shoppers

380
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,800
 divided into several distinct tranches.

381
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,400
 There are people who buy no avocados, first of all.

382
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,080
 They're not really interested in those people.

383
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,840
 No, quite. They're moderate shoppers.

384
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,280
 Then they have mega shoppers who buy a lot of avocados.

385
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,400
 But above them, there's a top tier, ultra shoppers.

386
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
 Wow. How many do you have to be going through

387
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,000
 to get to an ultra shopper level?

388
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,600
 I think it's achievable. I go through six a week.

389
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,840
 Stop it. Yeah.

390
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,440
 We do about the same in our house, yeah.

391
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,600
 I think you guys might be a new category.

392
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,080
 No. So, ultra shoppers in America

393
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,680
 spend $100 a year on avocados.

394
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,160
 Oh, I spend way more than that.

395
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,680
 Well, there we go.

396
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,040
 The ultra shoppers go to the shop 183 times a year

397
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,720
 and one trip in seven, they buy an avocado.

398
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,640
 OK, well, I have a avocado, so I don't go to the shop.

399
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,800
 Oh, my God. Is a avocado named after avocados?

400
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,840
 I don't know.

401
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,800
 Avocado. All these others are avocados, isn't it?

402
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,640
 Why does everyone use this?

403
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,440
 Let's avocado.

404
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,600
 It's all replacement products, isn't it?

405
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,280
 We didn't have your pint of milk as an avocado.

406
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,400
 We didn't have a pint of milk.

407
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,720
 What you've got is a bit sperm-y.

408
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:06,040
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

409
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,880
 My fact this week is that there's a Puerto Rican island

410
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,520
 where monkeys roam free,

411
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,240
 but the humans have to eat their meals in cages.

412
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,640
 It's like Planet of the Apes.

413
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,920
 It's like a reverse zoo.

414
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,760
 Is it like Planet of the Apes?

415
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,200
 It's like both the things we just said.

416
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,640
 Yeah, it is like Planet of the Apes.

417
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,120
 The apes keep the humans in cages in Planet of the Apes.

418
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,080
 God, I always come visit with 2001 a space odyssey.

419
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,400
 Sorry, I haven't seen Planet of the Apes.

420
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,560
 Sorry, we're getting sidetracked.

421
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,600
 Yeah, so this is, it is like a reverse zoo,

422
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,160
 sort of, in that it's an island called Decaio Santiago

423
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,560
 off the coast of Puerto Rico, and it's a research centre.

424
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,400
 It was started in the 1930s.

425
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,800
 Basically, it's full of monkeys,

426
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,840
 and humans are not allowed to go there

427
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,720
 unless they are researchers.

428
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,400
 And it's part of the discipline of it.

429
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,760
 You really can't disturb the monkeys.

430
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
 It has to be like they're living completely wildly.

431
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,080
 They're resus macaques.

432
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,040
 And so, if you're going to go and eat a meal,

433
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,640
 you can't just do it out in the open

434
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,520
 where you could get in their way if they want to, you know,

435
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,440
 cross your path.

436
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,120
 So they sit in a cage and eat their meal.

437
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,000
 Yeah, and the reason for it as well

438
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,920
 is because this is such a deadly island to humans

439
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,800
 if you go there.

440
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,200
 The reason it's a deadly island

441
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,840
 is because the monkeys there have herpes, a kind of herpes.

442
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,720
 Sorry, it's a deadly island,

443
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,840
 because the monkeys are not herpes.

444
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,920
 Darling, I'm about to tell you there's good news and bad news.

445
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,120
 Like, what's the good news?

446
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,200
 The good news is I didn't catch it from a person.

447
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,560
 Does it count as cheating?

448
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,600
 Catch what from a person?

449
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,440
 Well, there, that brings me on to the bad news.

450
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,320
 So, I have a question.

451
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,840
 Yeah.

452
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,000
 How am I going to catch herpes from a monkey?

453
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,200
 Do I have to use the same toilet seat as them or what?

454
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,800
 Well, no.

455
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,600
 Why is it dangerous?

456
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,720
 It's dangerous because they might use you as a toilet.

457
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,640
 So that's the problem.

458
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,320
 They can transfer herpes via their urine.

459
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,680
 So if it makes contact with you,

460
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,760
 they can transfer it by their feces.

461
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,200
 And, you know, Reese's macaques love to throw feces at people.

462
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,120
 So, you know.

463
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,600
 So if you do happen to catch herpes

464
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,000
 and you need to go to your partner and say that you've got it,

465
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 you can say I caught it off a monkey throwing poo at me.

466
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,320
 Exactly. There's a legit reason.

467
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,440
 Someone right now, I bet, is dealing with this dilemma

468
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,560
 on the way home.

469
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,680
 You better hope you just film holiday to India

470
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,040
 because like me and you, Andy,

471
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,160
 once both held a koala, didn't we?

472
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,480
 Yes.

473
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,120
 And they're riddled with chlamydia.

474
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,680
 Yeah.

475
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,200
 So that would be a reasonable excuse for that as well.

476
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,640
 You could come home with all the STIs after a tour.

477
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,000
 Blame it on the local animals.

478
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,480
 And the gonorrhea is from a millipede

479
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,920
 that I met in San Diego.

480
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,840
 Really nice legs.

481
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,920
 Really nice legs.

482
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,080
 Just to wrap up, the reason that the cages are in place

483
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,760
 is because for that reason, if you're eating your food,

484
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,120
 the monkeys will desperately want to try and get it off of you.

485
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,360
 And so the cages are to protect you from getting herpes

486
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,600
 while you're eating your meal.

487
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,080
 OK.

488
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,960
 The story of how they got there is amazing.

489
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,800
 It's really cool.

490
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,400
 So they were brought over from India in 1938.

491
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,640
 And it was for scientific purposes, wasn't it?

492
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,840
 There was a scientist called Clarence Carpenter,

493
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,000
 which is a great name, who was responsible for bringing that,

494
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,680
 wanted to study their social groups and such like.

495
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,480
 But the second war was about to break out.

496
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,200
 So this ship with 500 monkeys on it, this must have been.

497
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,760
 I want to see a movie about the journey.

498
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,240
 Yeah, yeah.

499
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,960
 Because they wanted to go through the Suez Canal,

500
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,240
 but they couldn't because tensions were high

501
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,920
 and the war was close to breaking out.

502
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,400
 So they had to go around the southern tip of Africa instead.

503
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,560
 And it turned into a much longer journey.

504
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,320
 The voyage lasted way longer than it was meant to.

505
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,160
 It lasted nearly 50 days.

506
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,120
 And he was on board with them all the time.

507
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,520
 He was.

508
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,240
 And have you seen the one photo of him on board?

509
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,000
 No.

510
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,440
 It's so he's wearing a bathing suit.

511
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,200
 It's quite odd.

512
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,440
 I don't know if he was going for swims in the Pacific

513
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,320
 on the way over.

514
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,920
 But yeah, Clarence Carpenter.

515
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,760
 Begging for herpes in that kind of outfit.

516
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,960
 I love that was a movie.

517
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,680
 I'd love to see it as sort of like a William Dampier pirate

518
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,160
 sort of trying to take over the ship.

519
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,080
 That just turns out to have 500 monkeys on it.

520
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,600
 So you've got the two staries kind of weaving in and out

521
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,120
 of each other.

522
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,720
 And it ends with a pirate attacking the monkeys

523
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,760
 and catching herpes with the most

524
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,360
 ambitious crossover in movie history.

525
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,680
 Gandhi was very much against them, wasn't he?

526
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,800
 What against them taking the monkeys?

527
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,360
 Against them taking the monkeys.

528
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,440
 Life magazine did some articles when it was established.

529
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,480
 And in one of them, they talked about Gandhi

530
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,360
 preaching against the exploitation of India's sacred

531
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,040
 rhesus monkeys.

532
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,480
 And eventually they banned it, but not for quite a few years

533
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,600
 after Gandhi had died.

534
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,520
 They used to have people living on there.

535
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,160
 So the first caretakers of the monkeys

536
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,000
 were this couple called the Tomolins.

537
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,640
 And they kept one of them as a pet called Pijita.

538
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,560
 And yet the rest of them-- well, I

539
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,360
 don't know what's better, being a pet of two humans

540
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,560
 and stroked constantly and fussed over by them

541
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,320
 or just being led to live your life.

542
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:51,800
 I don't know.

543
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,960
 Left to live your life.

544
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,680
 But anyway, they--

545
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,760
 That's a really philosophical question, isn't it?

546
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,120
 Isn't it one of the more amazing--

547
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,280
 Are you happy with servitude or would you like freedom?

548
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,400
 Yeah, yeah.

549
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,680
 When you put it like that, it's actually quite easy.

550
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,160
 Look at the bars of the cage are made of gold.

551
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,600
 And there's a nice bed in the cage.

552
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,920
 And then put them on the other side.

553
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,640
 Freedom.

554
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,400
 Yeah.

555
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,480
 Who of us can say what bars surround us?

556
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,920
 Well, Tate.

557
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,560
 You know, what compromises--

558
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,800
 I can say what bars surrounds me most not.

559
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,680
 So I think the monkeys all had this conference, this chat,

560
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,280
 and they nominated Pijita.

561
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,000
 But Michael Tomlin sounded quite fun.

562
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,400
 He would apparently regularly swim the one kilometer channel

563
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,440
 back to the mainland.

564
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,560
 Would drink a fifth of vodka.

565
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,240
 I actually don't know what was a fifth of.

566
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,120
 Well, that's what Eminem says in that stand.

567
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,360
 He goes, I just drank a fifth of vodka.

568
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,200
 Dare me to drive?

569
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,160
 I think he says that.

570
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,080
 Who says that?

571
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,800
 Eminem.

572
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,600
 Does he?

573
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,080
 I think so.

574
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,680
 So it's obviously enough that you're going to be drunk.

575
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,280
 I can't believe this guy, Michael Tomlin,

576
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,000
 is cooler than we are in that he gets Eminem slang.

577
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,280
 Well, that's on a monkey island.

578
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,920
 He's way cooler than we are.

579
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,800
 What are you talking about?

580
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 I think American listeners will be writing in droves

581
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,560
 very shortly for explaining exactly how much for this.

582
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,640
 Just so we're clear, in the UK, we don't use that scheme.

583
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,120
 We don't.

584
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,640
 And this was in the 1930s.

585
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,960
 Anyway, apparently it wasn't even vodka.

586
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,360
 People just said that because he was Russian.

587
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,960
 He actually preferred rum and coke.

588
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,240
 So anyway, he'd swim over and then swim back, presumably

589
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,160
 hammered to the island where his wife was looking

590
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,880
 after the pet monkey.

591
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,600
 These days, there are 2,000 Reese's macaques

592
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,960
 on Kyo's Santiago.

593
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,240
 But also, I find this so creepy, almost all of them

594
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,320
 have tattoos.

595
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,560
 Sorry, that's not the creepy bit.

596
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,240
 It's a bit creepy.

597
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,840
 It's a bit strange.

598
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,600
 They haven't chosen to get a tattoo.

599
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,080
 That's even creepier, arguably.

600
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,560
 Is it?

601
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
 I don't know what's creepier.

602
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,520
 What are they tattoos of?

603
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:34,760
 They're not--

604
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,720
 Scientific stuff.

605
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,680
 The eye, heart, lung.

606
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
 No, sorry.

607
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,320
 Scientific stuff.

608
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,600
 Yeah, like an equals MC squared.

609
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,440
 That's being like a vacuum is.

610
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,520
 That kind of stuff.

611
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,040
 No, sorry, that's not the creepy bit.

612
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,520
 The creepy bit is that the island is also

613
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,320
 home to a collection of 3,300 monkey skeletons.

614
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,840
 Oh, OK.

615
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,920
 You mean the dead monkeys?

616
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,200
 The dead monkeys.

617
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,960
 Well, yeah, obviously, they're the dead monkeys.

618
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,040
 But what they didn't do is bring in the monkeys

619
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,520
 and say, what would they like around them?

620
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,960
 What kind of furnishings can we add?

621
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,240
 Like in a fish tank, you know, on a skull, off to the skull.

622
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,920
 You never have a dead fish in a fish tank.

623
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,480
 You never have a giant dead fish swimming in an bathtub.

624
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,440
 But it is creepy.

625
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,360
 OK, so the question is, why did they not

626
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,960
 take away the skeletons or bury them or whatever?

627
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,920
 And I guess, well, they still need them to study them

628
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,200
 as in such a long-running research center now

629
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,160
 that you can study generations going back,

630
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
 and you can obviously study the bones of the monkeys

631
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,280
 that lived there before.

632
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,800
 But I think it would be creepy if they had a cool mausoleum

633
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,120
 full of all the monkey skeletons.

634
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,360
 But they don't have that.

635
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,840
 No, it depends.

636
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,320
 I don't think mausoleum makers are allowed on the island.

637
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,840
 I don't think that research project's going to get funding.

638
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,920
 But that's a good scene for the "Dampier Monkey" movie,

639
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,200
 where that's where the treasure's buried.

640
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,800
 It's like at the Goonies, you know, the cave.

641
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,600
 Oh, yeah.

642
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,240
 Wow.

643
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,840
 So anyway, some food for thought.

644
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,440
 Yeah.

645
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,200
 Yeah.

646
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,200
 Obviously, these sick tattoos that the monkeys have,

647
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,360
 Einstein with his tongue out on his bicep.

648
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,600
 They do-- I mean, it is a really important island,

649
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,160
 because they do discover stuff.

650
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,360
 We haven't just done monkeys there and sort of forgotten

651
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,040
 about it.

652
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,080
 And I think it's sort of like a rite of passage

653
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,560
 if you're a monkey researcher.

654
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,480
 I reckon if you said to your monkey researcher mates,

655
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,240
 hey, I'm doing a Chiosantiago research project,

656
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,800
 you'd be the coolest kid in town.

657
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,760
 So some stuff they've discovered recently

658
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,600
 is that after any kind of trauma,

659
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,200
 scientists now think that we probably

660
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,160
 age by, apparently, up to eight years.

661
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,520
 And this is based on--

662
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,160
 Oh, my god.

663
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,360
 It's a spurious link.

664
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,600
 But that's what scientists do.

665
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,840
 This is based on Hurricane Maria, that awful hurricane

666
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,000
 in 2017.

667
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,160
 It killed a lot of people in Puerto Rico.

668
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,520
 Didn't kill any of the monkeys, but totally

669
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,680
 destroyed the island.

670
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,360
 So all the trees were blown down.

671
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,280
 There's no shade.

672
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,600
 The average temperature on the island

673
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,560
 rose by eight degrees.

674
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,640
 Oh, wow.

675
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,480
 Rough.

676
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
 Because they take blood from the monkeys all the time

677
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,200
 for scientific reasons.

678
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,040
 They had the samples before that they

679
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,840
 could compare to the samples afterwards.

680
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
 And they looked at, like, lots of markers in the blood,

681
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,600
 and the immune system, and the proteins.

682
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,480
 And they found they showed signs of aging by about two years

683
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,880
 just from that hurricane.

684
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,480
 Wow.

685
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,160
 Because there was a stress about it.

686
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,720
 What in humans live much longer?

687
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,560
 So they've sort of extrapolated.

688
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,920
 Inhuman years, apparently.

689
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,680
 OK.

690
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,280
 Yeah.

691
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,400
 There's another monkey island, which is in Liberia,

692
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,920
 which is a bit sad, because it was a monkey island that

693
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,400
 didn't have any natural resources.

694
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,680
 So the monkeys there had to be fed daily

695
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,120
 by the researchers.

696
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,440
 So they would bring bananas over every single day.

697
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,240
 But then in the 1990s, there was the war.

698
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,120
 And as a result, the research unit fled.

699
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,800
 And these monkeys were just left on their own.

700
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,880
 And so they had no one to feed them except one guy called

701
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,840
 Joseph Thomas, who, for the last 40 years,

702
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,720
 has been going twice a day to this island with bananas

703
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,120
 and feeding these beautiful monkeys who come into the water

704
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,520
 to him.

705
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,320
 And he knows them by names, like Mabel and so on.

706
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,520
 Mabel, Edith, Prudence, Aggie, you know, and all the life.

707
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,480
 Very funny.

708
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,160
 Did you hear how Joseph Thomas was recruited for the job?

709
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
 I don't think so.

710
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,480
 So this was in the '70s.

711
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,040
 And this was another research island.

712
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,200
 It was set up by a woman called Betsy Brotman.

713
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,720
 And she was trying to find a vaccine for Hep B.

714
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,000
 And she actually did come away with a vaccine for Hep B,

715
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,960
 although she's since said it's a vaccine for Hep B.

716
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,760
 And she actually did come away with a vaccine for Hep B.

717
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,560
 Although she's since said it's actually

718
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,160
 a bad idea to test on animals.

719
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,720
 But at the time, she set this research

720
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,960
 island up in the '70s.

721
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,400
 And I think it was her who recruited Joseph Thomas,

722
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,000
 because she went to him and said,

723
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,360
 I really want to learn to play tennis.

724
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,600
 You're good at tennis.

725
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,760
 I also need someone to help me on my monkey research.

726
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,520
 And they made a deal where if he taught her tennis,

727
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,040
 he would work on her monkey research.

728
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,520
 Now, I know that now.

729
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,200
 He's on the very one-sided exchange.

730
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,640
 I tell you what, we'll do a deal.

731
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,520
 If you do all this work, I'll also

732
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,120
 let you do all this work.

733
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,320
 It was basically that.

734
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,720
 You know, there is an island where

735
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,520
 you've got lots of potential tennis partners you can go to.

736
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,720
 Monkey tennis, anyone?

737
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:09,360
 I've been to a monkey temple in, what was it, in Nepal.

738
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,800
 And that's another place where there's just monkeys everywhere.

739
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,560
 They're just kind of running around and stuff.

740
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,880
 And when I was there, you have to keep hold of your stuff

741
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,040
 all the time, because I saw a monkey stealing someone's

742
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,400
 mobile phone and their bag.

743
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,080
 And then running to the top of a huge building.

744
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,080
 And then the guys who were kind of in charge

745
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
 had to come with a big stick and prop him.

746
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,680
 And then someone climbed up to get the mobile phone and stuff.

747
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,400
 Do you know, this is something Ethan, our fellow researcher,

748
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,640
 told me yesterday that they know that mobile phones are

749
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,800
 more valuable than, let's say, something less valuable.

750
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,400
 I don't know if they know an iPhone is more valuable than a Nokia.

751
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,880
 But they did a study at another monkey temple.

752
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,200
 Do you think you'd be completely safe if you went there, Anna?

753
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,360
 Because your phone was made in 1983.

754
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,040
 I've got nothing desirable for the monkeys.

755
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,600
 You actually wouldn't recognize your phone as a phone.

756
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,480
 They did this amazing study over-- so they

757
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,080
 filmed monkeys for 270 days in Bali at this one temple.

758
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,680
 And they realized that when monkeys take something off you,

759
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,040
 they negotiate with you for food in exchange for it.

760
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,400
 So they take your phone, and then if you give them two bananas,

761
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,720
 they give it back, whatever.

762
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,560
 And by watching them, they realized

763
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,080
 that the higher the value of the item, if they're still

764
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,920
 on a phone rather than a camera case,

765
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,680
 then they'll barter for more bananas.

766
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,160
 Wow.

767
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,080
 That's really clever.

768
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,000
 It's really good, isn't it?

769
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,120
 That's incredible.

770
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
 Terrifying.

771
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,440
 Have you guys heard of Snake Island?

772
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,200
 Oh, yeah.

773
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,920
 Where is that?

774
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,400
 It's off the coast of Brazil.

775
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,320
 And it's called Ilha da Queimada Grande.

776
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,640
 And it's completely dominated by a special kind of snake,

777
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,600
 a special kind of snake, a particular kind of snake.

778
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,800
 They're golden lancehead pit vipers.

779
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,480
 Oh, gosh.

780
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,600
 They sound scary and dangerous, maybe.

781
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,760
 They are dangerous.

782
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,280
 They're venomous.

783
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,440
 Their venom melts the flesh that they bite into.

784
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,600
 And they evolved venom to incapacitate and kill

785
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,400
 the seabirds that land on the island.

786
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,920
 They are not nice snakes.

787
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,880
 They can climb trees, which helps them

788
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,960
 to eat the birds that they love to feed on.

789
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,280
 And on this island, there is about one snake per square meter.

790
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,780
 Wow.

791
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,280
 What?

792
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,480
 So you--

793
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:07,880
 Yeah.

794
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,560
 Oh, my god.

795
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,800
 A lot of them will be in the same square meter, though,

796
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,280
 right?

797
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,720
 Yeah.

798
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,680
 Yeah, yeah, that's true.

799
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,200
 Even so.

800
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,360
 It's not one every square meter, but nonetheless.

801
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,600
 They're not perfectly arranged like on a chess board.

802
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,560
 They're playing with huge island wide gamers, snakes,

803
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,040
 and ladders.

804
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,600
 Yeah, yeah, it's very hard to win.

805
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,200
 It just sounds completely terrifying.

806
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,600
 Why would you stay there if you were a bird?

807
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,000
 Mike, Mike Wright, what are you doing?

808
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,120
 I don't think they're reading TripAdvisor.

809
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,720
 I think, you know, I'll risk it.

810
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,920
 Like, they're just flying and they end up there.

811
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,480
 Yeah, but get back.

812
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
 Tell the others.

813
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,040
 I've been to a rabbit island.

814
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,720
 Have you?

815
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

816
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,080
 Near Hiroshima, it's like just an island full of rabbits.

817
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,840
 Wow.

818
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,040
 It's not a research island.

819
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,600
 There's just loads of rabbits there.

820
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,240
 In Sydney, where I live, we used to have a rabbit problem

821
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,000
 down in the northern reaches Palm Beach

822
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,920
 and used to drive down at night.

823
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,000
 And you'd put the headlights on of the car at high beam

824
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,040
 and you would just see what were in the daytime empty fields

825
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,960
 just packed like they're at Glastonbury watching.

826
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,800
 It's really, honestly, it's quite scary

827
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,000
 because you walk down the street in this Japanese island

828
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,200
 and the rabbits just follow you because they

829
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,720
 used to be in fed by tourists.

830
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,400
 Oh, no.

831
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,400
 And so you sort of turn around and there's 20 rabbits behind you

832
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,120
 and you kind of walk a bit faster

833
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,280
 and you turn around and there's 30 rabbits behind you.

834
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,680
 That's really scary.

835
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,600
 That is a good horror film.

836
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,920
 What STI did you get up there?

837
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,200
 [LAUGHTER]

838
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,160
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

839
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,920
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

840
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,480
 OK, my fact this week is that in 14th century Italy,

841
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,120
 if you wanted to insult a nearby city,

842
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,960
 you would send all your prostitutes

843
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,640
 to take part in a running race around their walls.

844
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,840
 I didn't have any prostitutes.

845
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,120
 Well, you've just been in a war, probably, with that city.

846
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,600
 You probably picked up a few on the way, is the truth.

847
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,520
 You didn't know I was into that.

848
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,720
 So I saw this in a book called Running Through the Ages

849
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,960
 by Edward Sears, and we're talking so Middle Ages Italy.

850
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,640
 You've got loads of different areas

851
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
 owned by different peoples.

852
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,280
 You've got Papal States, you've got Sicily,

853
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,360
 but then you've got places like Florence, Pisa, Siena, Luca,

854
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,120
 Milan, Genoa, all those kind of city states, you would say.

855
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,880
 And from around the 13th century, for about 400 years,

856
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,120
 we seem to have this really odd tradition

857
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,360
 of whenever you're battling with another city,

858
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,400
 or you've beaten them and you want to celebrate that,

859
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,120
 or you just want to stick it to them,

860
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,600
 you would have a running race around their town.

861
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,880
 And it's so weird.

862
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,600
 And there were lots of different versions of this,

863
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,400
 but one of the biggest insults was

864
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,480
 you would get a load of mules or donkeys,

865
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,400
 and then you would get all your sex workers,

866
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,560
 either from your city or ones that you picked up

867
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,640
 through the war, and you would just get them to race around.

868
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,120
 - Yeah, it did sound a bit like, 'cause armies,

869
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,320
 as you say, they would gather the sex workers

870
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,120
 and they would bring them along for the battles even.

871
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,880
 You know, if the armies were facing off,

872
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,600
 they would have them do races sort of in the front.

873
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,520
 And they said, that's why they're here, darling.

874
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,080
 - That's why we brought them for the racing.

875
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,400
 - Do you think this is all fake news?

876
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,440
 - I do. - This isn't happening at all.

877
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,880
 The wives turned up to surprise their husbands one day.

878
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,800
 - We came for the races.

879
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,640
 - Shit.

880
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,840
 - The point of it, as far as I can tell,

881
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,560
 is that it was a big collective screw you

882
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,880
 to the other city that you're--

883
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,720
 - That's it.

884
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,560
 - Yeah, yeah.

885
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,800
 And so they would do loads of different things.

886
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,640
 So one of the things they did,

887
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,920
 they would gather outside the city,

888
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,880
 so you gathered outside the opposing city state,

889
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,360
 then you would find the oldest tree in the area,

890
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,880
 and you cut it down, which is a symbolic castration,

891
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,280
 apparently, I know.

892
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
 And then they put the tree on a wagon

893
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,840
 and wheel it up to the city,

894
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,520
 like just really up close, like look,

895
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,360
 that was your tree.

896
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,200
 - Look, this is your penis.

897
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,480
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

898
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,560
 And then they would go to the stump of the tree,

899
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,800
 and they would start minting coins on the stump.

900
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,640
 - What?

901
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,480
 - I know, this is completely--

902
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,160
 - But the base of your castrated penis.

903
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,000
 - We're gonna make coins.

904
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,560
 And then basically, what they were saying was,

905
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,840
 we're gonna change the currency that you operate in.

906
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,680
 We're minting coins.

907
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,240
 Some of the coins would, I think, depict

908
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,840
 a picture of someone minting a coin on your tree.

909
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,640
 Yeah, but it was this whole--

910
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,720
 - I think they'd show them being vanquished, wouldn't they?

911
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,120
 Or they'd show humiliating scenes

912
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,480
 for the enemy, these coins.

913
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,000
 But the tree thing does imply

914
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,200
 that there's a lot of explaining to do

915
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,400
 when you show them the tree in the city.

916
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,400
 There you have to say, "This is your oldest tree, guys."

917
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,240
 They go, "Oh, is it? Okay."

918
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,800
 - We couldn't tell which was your oldest tree.

919
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,160
 We counted the rings.

920
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,840
 We think it's pretty old.

921
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,800
 It's, I mean, it was your tallest tree,

922
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,160
 but that might have been a different breed.

923
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
 Actually, that was, "Shut up, shut up!"

924
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,800
 - And then one of them says, "Okay, so."

925
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,200
 And then you have to say, "No, but metaphorically,

926
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,920
 "it represents us castracing you."

927
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,760
 I don't know how upset you're gonna be.

928
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,600
 This is starving.

929
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,960
 - Also, are you yelling to the top of the guys on the wall?

930
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,400
 It's a hell of a complicated conversation.

931
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,200
 - We're sending messages on paper aeroplanes over the wall.

932
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,160
 - Look, forget the penis thing.

933
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,920
 We're talking about the coins now.

934
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,440
 It doesn't matter about the penis thing, all right?

935
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,400
 Move on.

936
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,520
 - All right, raise the prostitutes.

937
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,160
 - Yeah, release the prostitute.

938
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,400
 - Well, the thing with the prostitutes

939
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,720
 is it was slightly more literal

940
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,960
 in that they would often race around land in the city even,

941
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,880
 and so that you're basically saying,

942
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,680
 "We can do what we want around here."

943
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,720
 You know what, you think that you own this place,

944
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,640
 we can run our prostitutes through, yeah.

945
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,800
 - I read an account of the prostitute races

946
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,120
 not being just for when you're sieging and at battle.

947
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,880
 You would do it in generally around town.

948
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,680
 So like, there would be kings who would use them

949
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,920
 to do it as a display,

950
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,880
 just to show a sort of minority of society

951
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
 doing something a bit derogatory.

952
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,720
 - Humiliating.

953
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,680
 - Yeah, just to sort of push the point of like,

954
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,480
 "I'm the king and I'm running this place."

955
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,720
 And what's interesting about it is,

956
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,680
 so there was one that was done

957
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,520
 where the race would end up at St. Peter's Square.

958
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,360
 - Well, Rome.

959
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,040
 - Yeah, and so it was done there.

960
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,080
 This is in the 1500s.

961
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,400
 - You don't get that these days.

962
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,480
 I don't know if you've been to St. Peter's Square, but.

963
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,760
 - The Pope is not gonna like that.

964
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,960
 - So this is 1503 and it wasn't just prostitutes

965
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,080
 who were part of the race.

966
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,280
 It was, you know, elderly people were in it,

967
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,720
 children were in it as well.

968
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,840
 They would all be naked,

969
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,680
 but the prostitutes would be wearing underwear.

970
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,520
 It's very odd.

971
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,880
 - Underwear, very racy in those days,

972
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,520
 wasn't it, underwear, I think.

973
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,520
 - More racy than having your genitals hanging out.

974
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,360
 - I believe because a lot of people

975
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,840
 didn't really wear underwear.

976
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,680
 I'm going off memory here,

977
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,960
 but a lot of people didn't wear underwear.

978
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,560
 But prostitutes would wear them

979
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,600
 because it's, you know, a nice bit of,

980
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
 ooh, look what might be in there.

981
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,280
 - Scantily cladded saucier than nude, you know.

982
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,120
 - Yeah.

983
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,440
 - It depends on context.

984
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,000
 - It does, but you know, Adam and Eve,

985
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,760
 just innocent, pure, first people alive.

986
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,800
 Adam and Eve wearing a kind of,

987
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,120
 it's kind of thongs made of leaves.

988
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,960
 - Suddenly sexy.

989
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,800
 - Yeah.

990
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,640
 - And that was the problem.

991
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,480
 - Yeah.

992
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,320
 - Yeah.

993
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,160
 - Using the snake as a garser.

994
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,000
 - Yeah.

995
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,840
 - That's a sexy thing now.

996
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,320
 - Well, it depends if it's one of those pit vipers.

997
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,160
 (laughing)

998
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,000
 - Yeah, Adam and Eve.

999
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,840
 - Fiction melty.

1000
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,080
 (laughing)

1001
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,480
 - So they weren't even hot.

1002
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,560
 They were just naked.

1003
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,520
 Or even half-naked.

1004
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,360
 'Cause they were,

1005
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,080
 people do seem to be described as half-naked a lot.

1006
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,040
 - Yeah.

1007
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,880
 - Doing it.

1008
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,720
 - Sometimes.

1009
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,880
 - And it's all too,

1010
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,040
 it's all just about insulting and humiliating, isn't it?

1011
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,800
 And I would quite an interesting description

1012
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,840
 of why this was so common in Italy,

1013
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,760
 these taunting.

1014
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,080
 And it's because obviously Italy wasn't Italy,

1015
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,680
 the country until extremely recently.

1016
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,840
 It was just loads of city-states.

1017
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,120
 And so warfare was quite different to a lot of other places

1018
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,200
 because it was just city-states against each other.

1019
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,000
 So it wouldn't be there's like lots of action

1020
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,360
 on these big battlefields and seizing lots of territory.

1021
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,880
 It was pretty much just sitting there besieging a city.

1022
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,160
 So you just start doing nothing for months on end.

1023
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,080
 So you had to think of other things to do

1024
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,200
 to make them feel bad.

1025
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,400
 - Like a sports day.

1026
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,240
 - It's a sports day.

1027
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,080
 (laughing)

1028
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,920
 - Egg and a spin race.

1029
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
 Bring out the prostitutes.

1030
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,360
 - They should do a sack race.

1031
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
 'Cause you're trying to sack the city.

1032
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,200
 - Yeah, nice.

1033
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,040
 - That's where it comes from.

1034
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,640
 - That feels like a trick you play as a besieged city.

1035
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,360
 Persuade them all to climb into sacks.

1036
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,200
 - Oh right.

1037
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
 Was that the original Trojan horse?

1038
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,040
 - That's the Trojan sack.

1039
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1040
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,880
 - It's 5,000 sacks.

1041
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,800
 - Then left out the front.

1042
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,040
 (laughing)

1043
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,440
 The other really interesting thing in the source

1044
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,840
 that you sent around, James, was about the ripples.

1045
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,680
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

1046
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,880
 - So I didn't know if you get,

1047
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,800
 like the word rippled that we used today.

1048
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,160
 So rippled is in, you know, like rude and raunchy.

1049
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,440
 A bit of a rippled joke.

1050
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,360
 Rippleds back then were people in,

1051
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,720
 like low people in the army, seems like.

1052
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,560
 And they would do these races with the prostitutes.

1053
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,000
 Or I think they were sort of pimps as well sometimes.

1054
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,800
 So they were, I guess, tasked

1055
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,120
 with sourcing the prostitutes sometimes.

1056
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,960
 And they seemed to do kind of all the low stuff

1057
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,360
 that other people, like the knights, wouldn't want to do.

1058
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,800
 So they would have to drop their pants in front of the enemy

1059
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,880
 and shout swear words.

1060
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,840
 - Well, it's very hard to drop a suit of armor.

1061
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,560
 (laughing)

1062
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,960
 - It's like Dongarees, you have to do it all over the shoulders.

1063
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,720
 It's so annoying going to a loo.

1064
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,640
 - So they'd shout swear words at the enemy

1065
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,480
 and they would, they'd scale up the walls.

1066
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,000
 The responsibility was scaling up the walls

1067
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 because they didn't really get given many good weapons.

1068
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,480
 And the pillaging, a lot of the pillaging,

1069
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,040
 which is a bit un-gentlemanly,

1070
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,880
 the rippleds would do that.

1071
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,160
 - They were kind of like your first,

1072
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,920
 they were like cannon fodder slash first line of attack,

1073
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,200
 right? - Yeah, yeah.

1074
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,520
 - But yeah, really interesting.

1075
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,840
 I did find it really interesting

1076
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,080
 that they would be the pillaging

1077
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,680
 because the knights couldn't really pillage

1078
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,520
 'cause you were a knight.

1079
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,000
 So you couldn't really do any of that stuff

1080
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,800
 or they could go in and they'd grab a load of stuff

1081
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,560
 and then just gamble it away, wouldn't they?

1082
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,240
 - Yeah, which I'm surprised

1083
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,840
 because I think what it smoothed over,

1084
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,720
 'cause I know that knights returned from warfare

1085
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,400
 with a lot of stuff that they'd stolen,

1086
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,600
 I reckon they had a sharp word with the rippleds

1087
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,760
 after they'd done the pillaging and said,

1088
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,000
 "All right, hand some of that over."

1089
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 - Right? - I'm sure you're right.

1090
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,840
 - Surely. - Yeah.

1091
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,720
 - The rippleds were nicknamed the Knights of Shit.

1092
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,080
 (all laugh)

1093
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,520
 They were just, yeah, they're just absolute base grunts

1094
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,360
 in the army, yeah.

1095
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,120
 - Knights of Shit. - Darling, I've got a job.

1096
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,480
 I'm a knight, is it?

1097
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,160
 (all laugh)

1098
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,000
 I'm a knight.

1099
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,200
 - You definitely put the end of that in your business card.

1100
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,880
 The word knight will be very big.

1101
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,520
 (all laugh)

1102
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,800
 The Yipang Palace is in China,

1103
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,280
 and there would be people, soldiers in armor,

1104
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,560
 who would kind of besieging the palace,

1105
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,960
 and the people inside the palace would taunt them.

1106
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,560
 Why do you think they might do that?

1107
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,080
 To come towards the gates?

1108
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,560
 - Is it because they're taunting them

1109
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,400
 to get to the point

1110
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,480
 where they pour the boiling oil on their heads?

1111
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,160
 - It's close to that, actually.

1112
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,000
 - Okay. - It's quite close.

1113
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,960
 - So the people inside are taunting the besieging

1114
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,560
 forces of the palace. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1115
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,120
 - But it is getting them close, right?

1116
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,800
 Okay, so it's either gonna be like spikes

1117
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,600
 come up through the ground,

1118
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,560
 or they're gonna then say, "Ha ha,

1119
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,120
 the tree's actually that way.

1120
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,560
 You've got miles to run."

1121
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,400
 (all laugh)

1122
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,240
 - That's good.

1123
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,920
 - They're wearing iron armor.

1124
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,960
 Oh, it's a magnet.

1125
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,600
 - It's a magnet. - What?

1126
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,440
 - The gate. - What?

1127
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,280
 - I kind of thought that was a joke.

1128
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,240
 - The gate. - What?

1129
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,920
 - Is a magnet. - Oh, no!

1130
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,280
 - No, not strong enough to what, suck the meat.

1131
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,440
 (all laugh)

1132
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,520
 - This is what the stories of the times say,

1133
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,720
 that their gates were made of lodestone,

1134
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,960
 which attracted iron,

1135
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
 and so whenever the soldiers came near it,

1136
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,680
 they would kind of be all over the place.

1137
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,440
 They couldn't move properly and stuff like that.

1138
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,840
 And so the people in the palace would go,

1139
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,240
 "Ah, fuck you.

1140
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,960
 You can't even come close, can you?"

1141
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,080
 - God, so could you wake up in the morning one day,

1142
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,680
 go outside your castle? - You just stuck on there.

1143
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,800
 - Yeah, and a nighttime commando army

1144
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,640
 who tried to take over and just plastered around the corner.

1145
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,200
 - Every morning you just scraped the nights off the door.

1146
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,520
 - Yeah.

1147
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,720
 - It's not sticking them directly to it,

1148
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,680
 which was actually your comedic version of that.

1149
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,200
 Actually, it just makes it more difficult

1150
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,600
 for them to run around.

1151
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,560
 - Oh, wow, would it feel a bit soupy?

1152
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,680
 - That's a suggestion.

1153
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,600
 I mean, this actually happened.

1154
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,960
 - Well, no, not here when you put two pencil rubbers

1155
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
 and you face them as like a weird force in between.

1156
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,680
 - But there's no way this Chinese propagandist

1157
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,920
 who was making this up about a thousand years ago or whatever,

1158
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,760
 there's no way they actually had magnets strong enough

1159
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,840
 that an entire army starts crumbling.

1160
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,640
 - I gotta say, I didn't think

1161
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,720
 that the loadstone was a real thing.

1162
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,640
 - Well, you can get magnetic magnetites, for instance.

1163
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,600
 What Chinese people would call loadstone

1164
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,320
 in these accounts, we think probably was magnetite.

1165
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,160
 - Okay.

1166
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,440
 - But it's interesting, then, if that came out

1167
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,120
 as a rumor of being truth,

1168
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,120
 because then if you were approaching the castle

1169
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,240
 and you had your armor on, you might take it off,

1170
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,560
 thinking I don't want to get sucked up all the walls.

1171
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,520
 - You'd start just feeling a bit awkward

1172
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,720
 about whatever you were doing.

1173
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,640
 You know, when you can't move anything right,

1174
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,160
 you know, just 'cause you're feeling embarrassed.

1175
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,680
 You'd start thinking, oh, well, this is probably

1176
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,680
 the magnetite making me move awkwardly.

1177
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,240
 - Like placebo. - And then move more awkwardly.

1178
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,080
 - What?

1179
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,440
 - Like a placebo effect. - Like a no-cebo.

1180
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,200
 - Yeah, like a no-cebo. - Like a no-cebo.

1181
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,920
 - Although I do like Dan's version better,

1182
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,600
 which is you're worried about it,

1183
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,880
 you take your armor off and then you just get attached.

1184
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,720
 That's clever.

1185
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,240
 - Oh, you must have read that story,

1186
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,280
 but if anyone didn't read that story

1187
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,000
 a few weeks ago at Hadrian's Wall,

1188
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,480
 it was one of my favorite news stories in years.

1189
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,240
 Please look it up, 'cause you need to see the visuals,

1190
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,280
 but basically, archeologists were digging around

1191
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,680
 at Hadrian's Wall recently,

1192
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,480
 and they found this volunteer, actually,

1193
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,720
 volunteer-retired biochemist called Dylan Herbert

1194
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,920
 found a 40-centimeter-wide sort of block of stone

1195
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,440
 with an engraving on it, which is a flawless cock and balls.

1196
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,320
 Like, it looks stunning.

1197
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,920
 The best a 12-year-old boy could master.

1198
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,400
 And underneath it, it has the word secondenous cacor,

1199
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,100
 which is like slang, secondenous the shitter,

1200
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:18,080
 just perfectly written there, 1700 years old.

1201
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,960
 And that's there, secondenous, that's how he's remembered.

1202
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,240
 And the BBC article reported that the experts

1203
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,480
 who uncovered this believe the phallic image

1204
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,120
 alongside the quote adds to the force

1205
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,480
 of the written insults.

1206
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,240
 - Undoubtedly, imagine that secondenous,

1207
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,080
 like, we don't know anything about this person, right?

1208
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,200
 - We know one thing.

1209
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,360
 - That is the most successful bit of insulting in history.

1210
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,700
 - That's the dream of when you insult someone.

1211
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,040
 - That's great.

1212
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,420
 - Poor guy.

1213
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,860
 The guy, actually, the guy who found it,

1214
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,740
 sorry, it sounds so fun finding it as well.

1215
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,020
 This old guy said, "Only when I removed the mud

1216
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,100
 "did I realize the full extent of what I'd uncovered."

1217
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,300
 And I was absolutely delighted.

1218
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,620
 (all laughing)

1219
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,200
 (upbeat music)

1220
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,260
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

1221
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,460
 And that is my fact.

1222
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,180
 My fact this week is that a member

1223
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,680
 of the Romanov royal family, Prince Rostislav Romanov,

1224
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,360
 lives in Hastings as a painter.

1225
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,320
 His friend and wife refer to him

1226
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,380
 as the artist formerly known as Prince.

1227
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,120
 - Brilliant.

1228
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,960
 - That's very funny.

1229
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,120
 - It's a wonderful little gag.

1230
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,020
 - It doesn't work, does it?

1231
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,200
 'Cause he's not been a prince.

1232
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,040
 - Well, he--

1233
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,560
 - The Romanovs were gone a long time

1234
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,160
 before he was born, I'm guessing.

1235
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,160
 - Yeah, but they were, absolutely.

1236
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,120
 But he and they still are trying to sort of suggest

1237
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,440
 that maybe one day they can return

1238
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,940
 to their keeping the titles and they keep it alive.

1239
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,900
 - Okay, so is he technically a prince?

1240
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,660
 Does he call himself, does he style himself as a prince?

1241
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,500
 - Yeah, he does.

1242
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,580
 I think he does interviews as a prince.

1243
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,820
 He talks about the royal family in exile.

1244
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:53,660
 They have as part of the Romanov surviving family ahead

1245
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,100
 who would be the heir apparent to any return

1246
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,260
 that would be made of the family.

1247
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,940
 So yeah, I would say he is a prince.

1248
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,980
 So he was born overseas from Russia.

1249
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,380
 All of the Romanov family had to leave.

1250
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,540
 And as a result, none of them have ever lived within Russia.

1251
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,560
 Apart from the ones who were brutally murdered

1252
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,200
 by the Bolsheviks, of course.

1253
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,040
 - Yeah, they're still there.

1254
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,220
 - It's still leaving, isn't it?

1255
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,280
 (all laughing)

1256
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,720
 - Nowadays, he finds himself living in Hastings

1257
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,640
 where he is an artist.

1258
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,400
 You can go on his Instagram account.

1259
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,000
 I like his art actually, it's pretty fun.

1260
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,840
 - Oh yeah.

1261
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,040
 - And yeah, and he does interviews occasionally

1262
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,280
 to talk about his relationship with the family

1263
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,440
 and what's gonna happen one day

1264
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,720
 and how they might return and so on.

1265
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,880
 - Is he plotting a comeback?

1266
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,320
 It's worth a try.

1267
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,000
 - I would say it's actually not worth a try.

1268
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,020
 - I have to say, I would not be wanting

1269
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,620
 to invade Russia right now, I don't think.

1270
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:44,340
 As an artist living in Hastings, I wouldn't back my chances.

1271
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,420
 - Well, here's the thing.

1272
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,740
 There are attempts occasionally

1273
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,920
 to bring them back into power.

1274
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,860
 So we were just talking about monkey islands.

1275
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:53,220
 Someone actually tried to set up a Romanov island.

1276
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,940
 And this was the Pacific Island of Kiribati.

1277
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,940
 And the idea was that they wanted to take over this island,

1278
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,300
 turn it into a sort of a resort.

1279
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,580
 But they said, could we revitalize the royal family

1280
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,740
 and have them rule over here?

1281
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,320
 - So they tried to have monkey island.

1282
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,600
 - It was a Russian MP.

1283
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,800
 Yeah, he was called Anton Bakov.

1284
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,360
 And he, it was quite critical of the Putin government.

1285
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,920
 - And Putin said, "Bakov."

1286
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,400
 (all laughing)

1287
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,360
 - Yeah, and he wanted three islands.

1288
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,200
 They were uninhabited.

1289
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,160
 So they would have been a great place

1290
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,320
 to kickstart the whole Romanov dynasty again.

1291
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,560
 And the islands were called Molden,

1292
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,120
 Starbucks and Millennium.

1293
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,960
 - Starbucks.

1294
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,040
 - I know.

1295
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,040
 I don't know why.

1296
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:32,880
 - I mean--

1297
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,520
 - No big thing or the restaurant chain.

1298
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,320
 - You would think Moby Dick thing.

1299
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,860
 - And also, can we just pick up on Anna

1300
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,620
 calling Starbucks a restaurant chain?

1301
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,780
 (all laughing)

1302
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,280
 Says a lot about your standards.

1303
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,420
 Oh, Anna's taken me to a restaurant tonight.

1304
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,180
 Oh, great, I wonder which one.

1305
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,620
 - Just seven coffees for dinner.

1306
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,460
 - Yeah.

1307
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,300
 - Do they have?

1308
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,620
 - No, he wanted to make kind of a micro nation.

1309
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,540
 But I think the Kiribati government refused.

1310
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,220
 They said, "Our sovereignty is not for sale."

1311
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,420
 - Well, he was also talking to the Gambia

1312
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,660
 and apparently had support of Yaya Jame,

1313
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,780
 who was in charge of Gambia at the time.

1314
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,420
 And that was to construct some artificial islands

1315
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,420
 off the coast of the Gambia.

1316
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,540
 - Do we know what his plan is after?

1317
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,820
 I see that that bit is easy enough.

1318
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,040
 You go to a tiny island where no one lives

1319
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,380
 and you declare yourself a czar.

1320
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,720
 How are you gonna then go from there--

1321
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,560
 - It's a stepping stone.

1322
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,400
 - To ruling Russia.

1323
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,240
 - It's a stepping stone.

1324
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,080
 You've gotta have a base.

1325
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,800
 I would argue that perhaps his long-term,

1326
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,600
 might not even be to take over Russia,

1327
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,720
 is just to have the Romanov Empire back.

1328
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,560
 - Oh, it's a bit sad.

1329
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,080
 I imagine if you called back the Romanos

1330
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,440
 and showed them some crappy little rock in the Pacific

1331
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,160
 and said, "This is what your empire is."

1332
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,220
 - He also bought some land

1333
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,860
 beside the Vatican in Montenegro.

1334
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,340
 So he's trying it in loads of different countries.

1335
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,180
 - Nice.

1336
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,020
 I like that.

1337
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:43,860
 It's like risk, you know?

1338
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,420
 You just plot yourself and it looks like

1339
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,980
 nothing's going on and then suddenly

1340
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,340
 a couple of moves and you've taken over the world.

1341
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,260
 - I don't believe you ever won a game of risk.

1342
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,500
 (all laughing)

1343
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,580
 - Dan is playing risk control and negotiating

1344
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:58,940
 for three uninhabited islands in Kyrgyzstan.

1345
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,520
 (all laughing)

1346
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,020
 - Yeah, Prince Philip, linked to the Romanovs.

1347
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:06,860
 - Yeah.

1348
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,700
 - In fact, so linked to the Romanovs

1349
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,000
 because when his parents got married,

1350
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,120
 Tsar Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia,

1351
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,200
 was at the wedding and his great aunt Ella became a nun.

1352
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,040
 Prince Philip's great aunt Ella became a nun

1353
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,880
 and after her death, became a saint.

1354
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,080
 And they were always rather proud

1355
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,480
 that they had a saint in the family.

1356
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,320
 I think it's fair enough.

1357
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,680
 - Yeah, do we know what were her miracles?

1358
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,520
 - Saintly moves.

1359
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,520
 I don't know what her miracles were.

1360
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,360
 No, no, no.

1361
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,180
 That's all I know.

1362
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,440
 - But Philip was used recently, wasn't he?

1363
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,200
 Just before his death for a blood sample

1364
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,620
 to confirm the identity of what was it?

1365
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:40,060
 - Yes, it was, bones of the Romanovs were contested

1366
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,420
 and the scientists were trying to work out

1367
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,420
 whether they really were the Romanovs family.

1368
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,220
 - So they were in Katerinburg

1369
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,300
 and they were attacked by the Bolsheviks

1370
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,740
 and they killed all of this family,

1371
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,780
 but there was two of them who were supposedly breathing

1372
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,700
 when they took the bodies away

1373
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,620
 and there's a suggestion that those two had escaped.

1374
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,300
 Now, when they found the bodies,

1375
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,620
 they found all of them apart from these two bodies

1376
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,960
 and they tested them and they realized

1377
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,800
 they were the Romanovs,

1378
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,900
 so that kind of gave fire to the conspiracy theory,

1379
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,080
 but then they found another two bodies nearby

1380
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,720
 and that's the recent test that they did

1381
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,520
 and they found that they were related to the Romanovs.

1382
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,360
 - 'Cause one of the supposed princesses lived

1383
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,960
 for many decades, didn't she?

1384
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,760
 And always insisted that she was the surviving daughter.

1385
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,600
 - Oh, there was a home.

1386
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,440
 - Anastasia.

1387
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,000
 - Yeah, you don't want the kids' film.

1388
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,360
 - I actually didn't know about that film,

1389
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,760
 but Anastasia was one of these two people

1390
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,660
 and there was a hugs of someone called Anna Anderson

1391
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,460
 who claimed to be her.

1392
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,780
 - Yeah, that's who I'm thinking.

1393
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,120
 - And she got really famous, I think.

1394
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,220
 - Yeah, but it turned out she wasn't.

1395
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,060
 - No.

1396
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:41,900
 - Right.

1397
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,300
 - It is strange being descended from defunct royalty,

1398
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,140
 isn't it?

1399
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,400
 It's a very, very strange life.

1400
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,020
 I was, there was an Oscar in Newsweek

1401
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,080
 saying that London is actually the hot destination

1402
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,620
 for most, as heaving is all worth.

1403
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,820
 - Throw a brick.

1404
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,100
 - Well, I guess it's because they're like,

1405
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,620
 we haven't retained a royal family.

1406
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,960
 - Most of the other countries sort of haven't.

1407
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,120
 - And it's also one of the really flashy royal families.

1408
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,480
 I think British people don't appreciate

1409
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,240
 how high investment the British royal family is compared

1410
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,580
 with the other European royal families.

1411
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,040
 - Oh my God, they're so humble, yeah.

1412
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,040
 They've got a little cottage.

1413
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,280
 - But there are only about half a dozen monarchies

1414
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,300
 left in Europe, I think.

1415
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,120
 And the British one is the sort of biggest ticket one.

1416
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:19,960
 - It's a biggie.

1417
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,800
 - Yeah, it's a biggie.

1418
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,720
 - And people have been coming here

1419
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,840
 since people started opposing royal families.

1420
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,000
 Obviously, it became very trendy

1421
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,640
 from like pre-Second World War

1422
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,320
 and then under communism, of course,

1423
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,980
 in Eastern Europe, they didn't love having the kings

1424
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,920
 and queens there.

1425
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,660
 I think King Zog of Albania was stationed at the Ritz

1426
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,340
 for a long time after he was forced into exile.

1427
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,340
 - Speaking of Zog, there is a crown prince

1428
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,420
 of the Albanians today.

1429
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:47,420
 That is Lika Anwar, Zog Reza Badawin, Mziziwe Zogu.

1430
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:53,100
 And this is the person that should the Albanian royal family

1431
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,700
 ever come back, he will take over.

1432
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,020
 It's quite a good name, isn't it?

1433
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,600
 - Obviously, him turning up at customs, basically,

1434
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,440
 and opening his passport and then opening

1435
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,200
 the next wing of his passport.

1436
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,940
 (all laughing)

1437
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,400
 - Do you think he has a concertina thing that folds up?

1438
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,240
 - He has to wind it all.

1439
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,080
 - A tiny little trumpet.

1440
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,880
 (all laughing)

1441
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,200
 - But it's really interesting because Anwar,

1442
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,040
 part of his name, is named after Anwar Sabat.

1443
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:17,880
 - Egypt.

1444
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,440
 - Yeah, and Reza is named after Muhammad Reza Pahlavi,

1445
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,920
 who was the last Shah of Iran.

1446
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,760
 - In Iran, yeah.

1447
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,360
 - And so he's basically taken all of these names

1448
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,420
 from all the different deposed people

1449
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,460
 and then put them into his name.

1450
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,460
 - Wow, like he has to be his parents have.

1451
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,500
 He basically lives in Tehran or anyway,

1452
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,860
 capital of Albania, and he has a little royal residence.

1453
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,900
 It's quite a nice house, but it's not a mansion,

1454
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,180
 it's not a palace.

1455
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:44,500
 And when he opens his gate, he has a little yard there,

1456
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,020
 and inside the yard, it's all the unwanted statues

1457
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,020
 from the last, you know, 100 years

1458
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,820
 that they got rid of when communism fell.

1459
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,700
 So there's like a statue of Hodja

1460
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,660
 and a statue of Lenin and Stalin

1461
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,960
 and stuff like that.

1462
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,760
 It's funny that he's got them as the King Monkei.

1463
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,120
 - Well, they're like, who's gonna want these?

1464
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,320
 And they look at his name and they're like,

1465
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,160
 oh, he'll want them.

1466
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,800
 - But it's kind of, that's kind of sad, isn't it?

1467
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,800
 'Cause in a way, he's the final statue.

1468
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,160
 You know, he's sort of purposeless.

1469
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,200
 - One day he'll just walk through the garden and freeze,

1470
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,040
 won't he?

1471
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:12,880
 - Oh my God.

1472
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,720
 - Oh my God.

1473
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,540
 - That's a nice fairy tale.

1474
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,380
 - That's really good.

1475
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,640
 - Yeah, I really like, do you know

1476
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,800
 of Princess Kamatari of Burundi?

1477
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,280
 So she moved to France in the 1970s,

1478
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,080
 and she did this because her father

1479
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,820
 was assassinated and then the King of Burundi

1480
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,500
 was assassinated in 1972.

1481
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,180
 So she fled, she went to France,

1482
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,740
 where she became the first ever black supermodel in France.

1483
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,580
 - Oh, really?

1484
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,420
 - And there might have been others,

1485
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,660
 but she was really the first one

1486
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,980
 who was going on the front of magazines.

1487
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,820
 - Super famous, yeah.

1488
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,660
 - Yeah, and so on.

1489
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,780
 And she says that obviously it was her connection

1490
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,740
 to the royal family that got her the gig,

1491
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,100
 because the magazines at the time

1492
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,300
 were basically only putting on blonde hair,

1493
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,180
 blue eye models, but she was brought on as a princess.

1494
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,820
 So she said, you know, I could have been black or blue

1495
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,560
 or a crocodile, they would have put me on

1496
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,960
 because I was a princess.

1497
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,700
 And then people thought she was so beautiful

1498
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,320
 that she became an actual model.

1499
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,200
 So she did that for years and years and years,

1500
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,560
 but then she moved back to Burundi

1501
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,500
 because she thought, you know what,

1502
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,360
 I'm gonna run for president.

1503
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,040
 So she set up a big campaign

1504
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,240
 where she was gonna try and become

1505
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,600
 president of the country.

1506
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,960
 And I love that one of her priorities

1507
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,640
 as the presidential candidate was

1508
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,080
 to bring back the monarchy.

1509
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,400
 (laughing)

1510
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,240
 - That was like a pretty bit.

1511
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,840
 - Well, that's good if you're open about it, I think.

1512
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,680
 - Yeah.

1513
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,020
 - Yeah, so if you're obviously campaigning for it.

1514
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,120
 - I was just wondering what the weirdest fate

1515
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,320
 of a descendant was.

1516
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,240
 And I was reading about the daughter

1517
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,040
 of Romanian King Michael I,

1518
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,120
 who had to abdicate in 1947.

1519
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,900
 She's called Irina Walker.

1520
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:41,900
 And in 2014, she was done for staging cockfights.

1521
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,080
 - Really?

1522
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,800
 - That's her life now, yeah.

1523
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,280
 - Oh my God.

1524
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,120
 - So when you say staging, you've just been putting them on.

1525
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,240
 You don't mean like fixing them.

1526
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,880
 - No, but I think they're very often fixed.

1527
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,720
 - Yeah, but that's another level of illegality.

1528
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,960
 It's not only when you do the cock fight.

1529
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,000
 (laughing)

1530
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,460
 - It wasn't even fair.

1531
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:04,160
 - She's very successful at it, it sounded like.

1532
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,400
 She used to charge spectators $20 each.

1533
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,240
 She lives in Oregon.

1534
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,120
 She lives in Irrigan, in Oregon.

1535
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:09,960
 - Brilliant, stop it.

1536
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,800
 - Good stuff.

1537
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,640
 - And what's her name, Irina?

1538
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,840
 - Irina, Irina in Irrigan, in Oregon.

1539
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,680
 (laughing)

1540
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,600
 And yeah, she charges people to watch Rooster's fight

1541
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,320
 with knives attached to their legs.

1542
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,160
 - Oh my goodness.

1543
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,160
 - And the winners would get up to 18 grand.

1544
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,600
 - The Greek royal family, they were abolished in 1974.

1545
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,240
 So they were exiled overseas.

1546
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,040
 And one of the princes, Prince Nicolaus of Greece,

1547
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,200
 was discovered in 1995,

1548
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,440
 working under a pseudonym as a production assistant

1549
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,800
 for Fox News.

1550
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,920
 - Really?

1551
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,160
 - The channel.

1552
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,640
 And yeah, so he'd been working there

1553
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,640
 as this production assistant.

1554
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,920
 And the only reason he was outed is because they were doing

1555
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,800
 a story about his brother, Prince Nicolaus' brother,

1556
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,040
 getting married, and they saw their standing

1557
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,480
 as one of the groomsmen, their production assistant.

1558
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,320
 - That's amazing.

1559
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,640
 - They were like, "What are you doing here?"

1560
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,840
 - Oh my God, that's incredible.

1561
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,160
 - Yeah.

1562
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,760
 - I was reading about Crown Prince Otto,

1563
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,160
 of the Austro-Hungarian emperor.

1564
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,160
 He would've been the Crown Prince of it.

1565
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,040
 - Okay, is he current, is he alive?

1566
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,120
 - No, he died in 2011.

1567
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,600
 At the edge of it, I think about '99.

1568
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,680
 It was really at old when he died.

1569
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,280
 So the Austro-Hungarian emperor was dissolved

1570
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,200
 when he was, I think, about seven years old.

1571
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,480
 But he was officially the King of Hungary in Bohemia,

1572
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,680
 Grand Prince of Transylvania.

1573
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,520
 - That's a good one.

1574
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,360
 - It is a pretty good one.

1575
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,600
 His name was Franz Josef Otto Robert,

1576
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,800
 Maria Anton Karl Max, Heinrich Sixtus Xavier,

1577
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,040
 Felix Renatis Ludwig, Guy N. Pius Ignatius.

1578
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,640
 - Was his dad Jacob Riesemann?

1579
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,280
 Can I just say Maria in there is a weird one, isn't it?

1580
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,360
 - This is, I noticed that.

1581
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,160
 I think I didn't read the full thing when I was,

1582
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,120
 I just can't be pasted in, when you're reading it out.

1583
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:44,960
 It's like, what? - It gives me a surprise

1584
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,800
 to me.

1585
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,880
 There's their excuse as well.

1586
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,960
 - Also, I didn't fully read this one, were you?

1587
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,880
 - But also he had Karl Max in his name.

1588
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,720
 - Karl Max?

1589
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,540
 - Really?

1590
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,380
 - Yeah, yeah.

1591
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,200
 But he, so he was, you know, seven years old,

1592
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,280
 the empire is dissolved,

1593
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,040
 which he's the crown prince of technically.

1594
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,200
 So, and he had to kind of rebuild his life.

1595
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,240
 And he, you know, he learned seven languages.

1596
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,040
 He became an MEP, which I find interesting.

1597
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:04,880
 - Really?

1598
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,880
 - God, that was a fool from grace, isn't it?

1599
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,720
 You're gonna be prince of an MEP.

1600
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,360
 - That's a big ballot as well, isn't it?

1601
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,200
 - Yeah.

1602
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,720
 - When you've got all of his name on.

1603
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,560
 (laughing)

1604
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,400
 - He actually got the votes

1605
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,880
 of about 17 different candidates.

1606
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,000
 They thought they were very different people.

1607
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,320
 - I'm gonna vote for Maria.

1608
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,480
 (laughing)

1609
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,120
 - And I love this bit of his history and his life.

1610
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,320
 So he had really interesting life.

1611
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:27,120
 He helped organize the Pan-European Picnic of 1989,

1612
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,720
 which is a little-known bit of the end of the Cold War.

1613
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,720
 And it was on the border between Austria and Hungary.

1614
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,500
 So you've got, you know,

1615
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,760
 Free Market West on one side

1616
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,920
 and Communists on the other in the East.

1617
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,280
 And thousands of people came and sort of gathered there

1618
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,400
 to have a kind of cross-border picnic, as it were.

1619
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,240
 And then actually 600 East Germans just moved into Austria.

1620
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,760
 They just sort of fled across the boundary.

1621
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,360
 - Like during the picnic kind of thing.

1622
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,600
 Like can I borrow your ketchup?

1623
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,880
 Oh, I'm here now.

1624
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,600
 (laughing)

1625
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,120
 - Oh, sorry, I was just running away from my wasp.

1626
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,960
 Yeah, yeah, they're coming.

1627
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,540
 (upbeat music)

1628
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,440
 - Okay, that's it.

1629
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,400
 That's all of our facts.

1630
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,920
