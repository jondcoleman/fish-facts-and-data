00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.720
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.400
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.200
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.800
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.960
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.200
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.640
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.040
 And once again, we have gathered

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.440
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.040
 from the last seven days.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.520
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.320
 Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.240
 - My fact is that the first man to use the word avocado

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.360
 in English was a pirate.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.700
 - Oh.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.520
 - Arvacado.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.280
 - Arvacado.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.280
 - That just sounds like you saying it normally, Dan.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.160
 (laughing)

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.200
 - Wow, okay.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.360
 - This is a guy called William Dampier

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.320
 and he was an explorer.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.800
 He lived from 1651 to 1715.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.120
 And he was lots of things, actually.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.520
 He was a hydrographer.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.560
 He was a scientist, a writer, a naturalist,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.920
 Royal Navy captain.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.200
 And we have a picture of him.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.840
 It's in the National Gallery.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.760
 It's the only 100% genuine portrait of a British pirate.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.600
 - Ooh.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.440
 - So he's quite--

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.840
 - Does he have a pirate on his shoulder?

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.080
 - Yeah, I patch.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.760
 He's biting a gold doubloon.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.520
 (laughing)

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.840
 - So it's sort of making someone walk the plank, yeah.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.480
 No, I don't think he is.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.760
 I think he looks like a normal man.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.080
 But he was a pirate, among lots of other things.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.040
 And he wrote this account of the avocado pear tree.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.280
 And that's in the OED.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.520
 When you look under avocado, his entry is the first one.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.240
 He gave a little report about the avocado

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.080
 and said how nice it was.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.560
 - How many entries are there for avocado

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.880
 then after his one?

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.640
 - Well, loads, 'cause the OED sort of gives,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.480
 they give a load of different--

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.640
 - When it's an exciter and stuff.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.240
 - Yeah, it's about five or six.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.000
 - Well, I think there's only one definition.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.200
 I'm not sure you've got like the verb avocado.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.680
 (laughing)

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.920
 - This isn't the definition.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.400
 This is the citation.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 - Yes, yeah.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.480
 - He actually has over a thousand entries in the OED.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.120
 - Of all the things that he has in the OED,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.600
 I looked at them all where he's the first citation.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.320
 So the first example we have,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.080
 he was the first person to use the word thunder cloud.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.920
 - Wow.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.320
 - Which is quite good.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.920
 To frape the verb.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.760
 - Facebook.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.160
 (laughing)

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.000
 - Is it a frape?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 - He used the word meaning to bind tightly.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.240
 - Soy sauce as well.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.200
 Soy sauce, which is my favorite.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.120
 - Chopsticks.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.240
 - Chopsticks, which are my favorite utensils.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.120
 - And a lot of this is 'cause I guess he was travelling

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.600
 so much, and he was writing reports on his travels

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.440
 and so he was coming into contact around the world

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.440
 with a lot of words not previously known to English.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.960
 So that's part of the reason why.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.480
 - Well, I think that maybe even more amazing thing

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.840
 about him is that he had a great recipe for avocado,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.640
 which involves smashing it to pieces

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.000
 and adding sugar and lime juice by making guacamole.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.040
 - Such a hipster.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.040
 - He gave us guac.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.640
 - Although the tragic thing about him is

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.880
 he wrote so much about guacamole

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.760
 that he was never actually able to afford his own pirate ship

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.840
 'cause he just spent so much money on the...

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.640
 - On frat pays as well.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.960
 (laughing)

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.480
 - So he always stopped renting those ships,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.320
 wasn't he?

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.040
 He couldn't burn anything on the walls.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.800
 - So these words, he wrote quite a few books,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.200
 but he had a very, very famous one,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.600
 which was A New Voyage Around the World,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.640
 which was a book that was so influential

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.920
 that Darwin took a copy of it onto the Beagle with him.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.880
 And, you know, is it this one book

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.120
 where we get a lot of these?

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.160
 - Most of them are from that.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.160
 I mean, that's pretty crazy.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.000
 - I think that was his main book.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.800
 I think he wrote lots of other random stuff,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.080
 but yeah, that was his big one, wasn't it?

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.240
 And it was really popular, 1697.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.680
 And it was when he'd gone around the world

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.920
 for the first time, was it?

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.440
 And then he went around another two times.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.840
 And it was full of food recipes.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840
 He was a foodie.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.760
 He was a big old hipster foodie.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.120
 Barbecue, kumquat, tortilla,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.720
 and he included recipes

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.280
 of what was the best thing to do with them.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.840
 So he really recommended Flamingo Tongue,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.640
 if you're ever in the market.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.080
 He said it's very good, it's lean and black,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.640
 and it's neither fishy nor unsavory.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.480
 - Yummy.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.960
 - He also had armadillo,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.280
 which he said tastes a bit like lan turtle,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.800
 if you're not sure.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.960
 - Oh, like lan turtle, no, I can picture it, yeah, yummy.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.440
 - Prickly pears, right?

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.400
 Which is a type of cactus.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.960
 And he said that it turned his urine so red

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.640
 that it looked like blood.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.480
 - Yeah.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.320
 - Okay, but I actually have some prickly pear candy at home.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.600
 So I tried some yesterday

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.120
 and I'm yet to experience any red urine.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.840
 But I thought I'd bring you all some.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.760
 - Oh, no, a bit of urine?

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.320
 Or it's just a small vial James is getting at.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.520
 - I've got some prickly pear candies

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.000
 that I thought you might want to munch on

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.840
 if you feel like it. - Oh, lovely.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.080
 Oh my God, they're delicious.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.200
 - And they're very red.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.280
 They look a bit like Turkish delight, don't they?

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.400
 - I'm a huge fan of the show and tell element

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.400
 of the podcast now.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.240
 I really like James' experience corner.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.280
 - That's good for the listeners.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.720
 - What do you really enjoy about it?

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.560
 - It's so yummy.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.760
 - They taste a bit like fruit pastels, don't they?

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.240
 - Yes, exactly like that.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.360
 - I'm really excited because I got these at Christmas

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.360
 and they've just been sat there

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.520
 'cause I didn't really want to eat them

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.960
 'cause they're made of cactus.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.520
 I finally got an excuse to.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.800
 - They're so good.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.880
 He also used to eat sea turtles,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.400
 but he had a preference for the ones that were grass fed.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.520
 - Grass fed sea turtles. - Was that an ethical preference

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.480
 or you don't want the ones that are grain fed

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.800
 and kept in cages?

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.640
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.280
 No, he just said that they're the best of that sort,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.200
 both in largeness and in sweetness.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.280
 So quantity and taste.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.280
 And it's just quite amazing to imagine that this guy

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.960
 who was a pirate, let's remember him,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.080
 yeah, was going around.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.240
 It's like, can I get grass fed turtles please?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.080
 - I don't know.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.240
 - True, yeah, yeah.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.360
 He wasn't a very good pirate at first.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.680
 His first act of piracy was an absolute disaster.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.800
 So it was like the British government was given

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.440
 in permission to take over Spanish ships, wasn't it?

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.640
 - He was a bit more of a privateer,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.960
 a sort of licensed pirate than a Blackbeard figure.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.880
 - The Spanish would call him a pirate for sure.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.000
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.840
 From their perspective.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.480
 - The Spanish would call him a lot of things, wouldn't they?

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.920
 - Well, he and his fellow Buccaneers,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.360
 they attacked a Spanish fort.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.200
 It was very exciting.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.040
 They managed to take it over,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.000
 but the townspeople had left

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.240
 with absolutely everything valuable.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.240
 So it was a complete disaster.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.400
 And lots of his voyages were failures actually financially,

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.760
 but he was always making observations,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.120
 writing down recipes,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.920
 and it was basically long-distance book research

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.000
 that he was doing.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.480
 - It's not what you've sent him for, is it?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.800
 I haven't got you any gold,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.360
 but I've come back with a Delia Smith-esque tone.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.200
 - So, well, Delia Smith actually used to be a pirate.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.320
 It was a mercenary.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.200
 She was a soldier of fortune in the 80s,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.680
 but a lot of that was recipe collected, yeah.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.480
 - Another thing that William Dampier did

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.280
 was he was the first British sailor to reach Australia.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.360
 He got there way before the first fleets got over there.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.480
 And weirdly, he has a few moments

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.280
 that we don't really give him the sort of acknowledgement for.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.600
 There's this weird passage in his book

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.760
 where he's in the Galapagos

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.240
 and he's looking at the turtles there,

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.760
 and he's saying, "Oh, they look a different breed."

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.680
 And I wonder if that's helping towards their mating

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.520
 and so on, just writes a few random lines,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.400
 just sort of suggesting that there's sort of evolutionary

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.080
 benefit to the way that they're shaped

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.280
 without naming that specifically.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.000
 - Oh, so he says these suit their environment

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.920
 because they look like this.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.680
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.040
 Which is just so Darwinian.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.320
 - And Darwin had the book.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.160
 - Nice.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.000
 - He became very famous,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.280
 which is once his voyaging days were over.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.800
 He went to dinner with Samuel Peeps.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.920
 He lectured at the Royal Society.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.920
 And the last bit of Galapagos travels

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.840
 is based on his journeys in part.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.800
 - Did he meet like a tribe of giants and all that stuff?

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.280
 - That's the second book of Galapagos travels,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.800
 not the final one, it's a bit more normal.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.520
 It just contains talking horses.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.040
 - Well, he was in South America

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.280
 and he did see some horses there.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.920
 He said, "Here they have several horses,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.480
 "but what is most worthy of note

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.360
 "is a sort of sheep they have,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.640
 "which inhabitants call conera de terra.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.960
 "The creature is four foot and a half high

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.760
 "and they're frequently ridden

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.000
 "by two of the lustiest men of the area," he said.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.680
 And he's almost certainly talking about llamas, we think.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.240
 So he's one of the first people to see llamas from the West.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.640
 - Cool, what a life.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.200
 - It's very difficult when you read about him

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.160
 because he was in many ways quite a bad guy.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.000
 - Okay.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.160
 - Oh, he is a Spanish person.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.720
 (laughing)

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.720
 - I've been talking to some of my friends in Madrid

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.000
 and they do not go down well there.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.240
 As anyone in that period, it was nuanced

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.840
 to say the least relationship with the natives

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.520
 that he met at various places and wrote some pretty awful things

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.240
 for instance about Australian Aboriginals.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.440
 As a leader as well, he was pretty widely disliked.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.520
 So we should say that the thing maybe he's most famous

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.720
 for today is that he was also responsible

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.720
 for Robinson Crusoe, essentially,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.800
 because Alexander Selkirk,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.200
 who we think Robinson Crusoe was based on,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.760
 was on his ship and hated him so much

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.200
 or thought that he was very bad at maintaining the ship

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.920
 and said, "I think this ship's gonna sink.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.960
 "I'm not gonna get on it until we fix it."

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.280
 And I think it was Dampier who said, "No, the ship's fine.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.880
 "We can sail this ship."

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.680
 - So was this halfway through a voyage, do you mean?

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.000
 - Halfway through a voyage.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.240
 - So basically they were going around Cape Horn

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.400
 and this guy, Selkirk, said, "Don't go around Cape Horn.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.840
 "It's a terrible place to go around.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.520
 "It's always stormed, it's high winds.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.680
 "It's like the middle of hurricane season or whatever.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.880
 "We can't do that."

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.600
 And then they went, "Well, we're gonna do it anyway."

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.120
 And so by the time they got through,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.920
 all of the ships were a little bit bashed

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.520
 and he was like, "These are gonna sink on the way home.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.560
 "Get me off here.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.200
 "Get me to wherever the nearest island is.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.960
 "I wanna go to the nearest island."

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.840
 And so they sent him to the nearest island

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.840
 and as he got there, the other ship started to go away

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.760
 and he's like, "I've changed my mind, I've changed my mind."

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.520
 And they were like pretending they couldn't hear him

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.560
 and saying, "What, what, sorry, we love it."

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.400
 And I read Robinson Crusoe a year or two ago

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.960
 and there's no mention at the beginning of it

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.040
 that he was a really annoying backseat driver

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.800
 after the voyage and it's very sympathetically presented

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.640
 into Facebook.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.240
 - Well, to be fair, he had a very good point

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.240
 because the ship sank shortly afterwards

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.480
 and most of the crew died and the rest ended up in prison.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.560
 - It was more annoying when the backseat driver

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.400
 turns out to be right.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.720
 That's really frustrating.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.440
 - Didn't Selkirk then get picked up four years later

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.880
 on another ship that had dampier honors?

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.720
 - Yeah, he did.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.600
 - Imagine that, he's like, "Finally, someone's coming to us."

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.840
 - But then when he got back on that ship, he realized

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.000
 and he was like, "No, I want to be marooned again."

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.960
 And they eventually talked him round.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.280
 - As in he genuinely was, yeah.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.280
 That sounds like a joke, but yeah, he genuinely did say.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.200
 Set me off.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.960
 - As they picked up Selkirk, they managed to find

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.240
 a Spanish fleet, didn't they?

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.960
 And they managed to get a load of treasure

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.360
 from them, a load of booty,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.960
 which meant Selkirk got a load of money

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.400
 and he could retire when he got back to Britain.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.280
 So he came home, he was very rich,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.040
 but he couldn't quite readjust to society

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.840
 'cause he'd been on this island for however long,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.600
 being a Robinson Crusoe guy.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.120
 And so he went to Scotland

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.280
 and spent 15 years living in a cave.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.440
 - Oh my God.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.160
 - Which feels to me like a missed sequel

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.680
 to Robinson Crusoe, doesn't it?

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.000
 - Yeah.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.800
 - Robinson Crusoe lives in a cave.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.200
 - I think it's got all the promise

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.240
 of a disappointing second series, I have to say.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.200
 - I got like Robinson too, so.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.040
 - Yeah.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.960
 - With what I would call it.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.880
 - Nice.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.720
 - I like it.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.560
 - Will you write books now?

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.400
 - Thank you.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.800
 - So Dampier, the first person in the OED

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.920
 to mention the word avocado, as we say it today.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.520
 But before that, they had different ways

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.680
 of saying the word.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.760
 So we kind of get it from the Spanish word.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.120
 People would say Aguacarta or Aguacardo

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.520
 and stuff like that.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.000
 You can see online a big list of all the early times

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.800
 when people mentioned this fruit.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.480
 They started in 1562, going to the 17th century.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.920
 And in 1660, they talk about this poem

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.600
 that was written by Abraham Cowley,

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.400
 which mentions avocados.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.920
 But they don't say what the poem is.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.000
 None of the places say what the poem is.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.160
 And that really intrigued me.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.600
 I'm like, why are they glossing over this?

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.740
 So I found this poem.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.720
 "A fragrant leaf, the Aguacarta bears,

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.640
 "her fruit in fashion of an egg appears,

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.800
 "with such a white and sperm-y juice itself

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:55.160
 "as represents moist life's first principles."

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.000
 I said that as a completely flawed description.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.720
 Are we sure they don't want the avocado?

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.440
 I've never got white juice swelling out of my avocados.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.080
 No, sperm-y juice in your avocado.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.000
 No, am I not leaving it long enough to ripen?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.840
 They had different types of avocados.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.840
 The one that we eat now is a Hass avocado most of the time.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.360
 And this was an old kind of one that you would get.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.040
 Some of them were white and egg-shaped.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.600
 I think the main crime there is rhyming

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.840
 swells with principles, which is not...

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.280
 That's what offends me the most,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.840
 apart from the sperm-y juice.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.680
 Do you know there's a Hass avocado board

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.440
 with the official authorities on Hass avocados,

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.800
 which is the ones that almost everyone eats today.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.160
 And they have huge amounts of data on their website

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.160
 about avocado consumption, US-based, mainly.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.680
 So is that why that guy was following me

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.760
 when I went to my local organic shop to buy some avocados?

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.040
 Yeah, that's right, yeah, yeah.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.200
 Would you say it's very sperm-y, sir?

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.000
 It's quite sperm-y, very sperm-y.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 Two sperm-y. They released a bit of research recently

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.640
 that they found that avocado shoppers

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.800
 divided into several distinct tranches.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.400
 There are people who buy no avocados, first of all.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.080
 They're not really interested in those people.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.840
 No, quite. They're moderate shoppers.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.280
 Then they have mega shoppers who buy a lot of avocados.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.400
 But above them, there's a top tier, ultra shoppers.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.400
 Wow. How many do you have to be going through

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.000
 to get to an ultra shopper level?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.600
 I think it's achievable. I go through six a week.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.840
 Stop it. Yeah.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.440
 We do about the same in our house, yeah.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.600
 I think you guys might be a new category.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.080
 No. So, ultra shoppers in America

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.680
 spend $100 a year on avocados.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.160
 Oh, I spend way more than that.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.680
 Well, there we go.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.040
 The ultra shoppers go to the shop 183 times a year

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.720
 and one trip in seven, they buy an avocado.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.640
 OK, well, I have a avocado, so I don't go to the shop.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.800
 Oh, my God. Is a avocado named after avocados?

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.840
 I don't know.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.800
 Avocado. All these others are avocados, isn't it?

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.640
 Why does everyone use this?

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.440
 Let's avocado.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.600
 It's all replacement products, isn't it?

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.280
 We didn't have your pint of milk as an avocado.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.400
 We didn't have a pint of milk.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.720
 What you've got is a bit sperm-y.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:06.040
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.880
 My fact this week is that there's a Puerto Rican island

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.520
 where monkeys roam free,

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.240
 but the humans have to eat their meals in cages.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.640
 It's like Planet of the Apes.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.920
 It's like a reverse zoo.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.760
 Is it like Planet of the Apes?

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.200
 It's like both the things we just said.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.640
 Yeah, it is like Planet of the Apes.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.120
 The apes keep the humans in cages in Planet of the Apes.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.080
 God, I always come visit with 2001 a space odyssey.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.400
 Sorry, I haven't seen Planet of the Apes.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.560
 Sorry, we're getting sidetracked.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.600
 Yeah, so this is, it is like a reverse zoo,

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.160
 sort of, in that it's an island called Decaio Santiago

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.560
 off the coast of Puerto Rico, and it's a research centre.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.400
 It was started in the 1930s.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.800
 Basically, it's full of monkeys,

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.840
 and humans are not allowed to go there

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.720
 unless they are researchers.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.400
 And it's part of the discipline of it.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.760
 You really can't disturb the monkeys.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.760
 It has to be like they're living completely wildly.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.080
 They're resus macaques.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.040
 And so, if you're going to go and eat a meal,

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.640
 you can't just do it out in the open

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.520
 where you could get in their way if they want to, you know,

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.440
 cross your path.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.120
 So they sit in a cage and eat their meal.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.000
 Yeah, and the reason for it as well

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.920
 is because this is such a deadly island to humans

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.800
 if you go there.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.200
 The reason it's a deadly island

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.840
 is because the monkeys there have herpes, a kind of herpes.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.720
 Sorry, it's a deadly island,

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.840
 because the monkeys are not herpes.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.920
 Darling, I'm about to tell you there's good news and bad news.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.120
 Like, what's the good news?

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.200
 The good news is I didn't catch it from a person.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.560
 Does it count as cheating?

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.600
 Catch what from a person?

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.440
 Well, there, that brings me on to the bad news.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.320
 So, I have a question.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:40.840
 Yeah.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.000
 How am I going to catch herpes from a monkey?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.200
 Do I have to use the same toilet seat as them or what?

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:46.800
 Well, no.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.600
 Why is it dangerous?

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.720
 It's dangerous because they might use you as a toilet.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.640
 So that's the problem.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.320
 They can transfer herpes via their urine.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.680
 So if it makes contact with you,

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.760
 they can transfer it by their feces.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.200
 And, you know, Reese's macaques love to throw feces at people.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.120
 So, you know.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.600
 So if you do happen to catch herpes

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.000
 and you need to go to your partner and say that you've got it,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 you can say I caught it off a monkey throwing poo at me.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.320
 Exactly. There's a legit reason.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.440
 Someone right now, I bet, is dealing with this dilemma

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.560
 on the way home.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.680
 You better hope you just film holiday to India

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.040
 because like me and you, Andy,

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.160
 once both held a koala, didn't we?

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:23.480
 Yes.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.120
 And they're riddled with chlamydia.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:25.680
 Yeah.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.200
 So that would be a reasonable excuse for that as well.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.640
 You could come home with all the STIs after a tour.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.000
 Blame it on the local animals.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.480
 And the gonorrhea is from a millipede

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.920
 that I met in San Diego.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.840
 Really nice legs.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.920
 Really nice legs.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.080
 Just to wrap up, the reason that the cages are in place

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.760
 is because for that reason, if you're eating your food,

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.120
 the monkeys will desperately want to try and get it off of you.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.360
 And so the cages are to protect you from getting herpes

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.600
 while you're eating your meal.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.080
 OK.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.960
 The story of how they got there is amazing.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.800
 It's really cool.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.400
 So they were brought over from India in 1938.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.640
 And it was for scientific purposes, wasn't it?

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.840
 There was a scientist called Clarence Carpenter,

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.000
 which is a great name, who was responsible for bringing that,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.680
 wanted to study their social groups and such like.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.480
 But the second war was about to break out.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.200
 So this ship with 500 monkeys on it, this must have been.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.760
 I want to see a movie about the journey.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.960
 Because they wanted to go through the Suez Canal,

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.240
 but they couldn't because tensions were high

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.920
 and the war was close to breaking out.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.400
 So they had to go around the southern tip of Africa instead.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.560
 And it turned into a much longer journey.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.320
 The voyage lasted way longer than it was meant to.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.160
 It lasted nearly 50 days.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.120
 And he was on board with them all the time.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:40.520
 He was.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.240
 And have you seen the one photo of him on board?

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.000
 No.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.440
 It's so he's wearing a bathing suit.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.200
 It's quite odd.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.440
 I don't know if he was going for swims in the Pacific

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.320
 on the way over.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.920
 But yeah, Clarence Carpenter.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.760
 Begging for herpes in that kind of outfit.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.960
 I love that was a movie.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.680
 I'd love to see it as sort of like a William Dampier pirate

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.160
 sort of trying to take over the ship.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.080
 That just turns out to have 500 monkeys on it.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.600
 So you've got the two staries kind of weaving in and out

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.120
 of each other.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.720
 And it ends with a pirate attacking the monkeys

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.760
 and catching herpes with the most

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.360
 ambitious crossover in movie history.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.680
 Gandhi was very much against them, wasn't he?

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.800
 What against them taking the monkeys?

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.360
 Against them taking the monkeys.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.440
 Life magazine did some articles when it was established.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.480
 And in one of them, they talked about Gandhi

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.360
 preaching against the exploitation of India's sacred

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.040
 rhesus monkeys.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.480
 And eventually they banned it, but not for quite a few years

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.600
 after Gandhi had died.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.520
 They used to have people living on there.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.160
 So the first caretakers of the monkeys

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.000
 were this couple called the Tomolins.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.640
 And they kept one of them as a pet called Pijita.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.560
 And yet the rest of them-- well, I

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.360
 don't know what's better, being a pet of two humans

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.560
 and stroked constantly and fussed over by them

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.320
 or just being led to live your life.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:51.800
 I don't know.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.960
 Left to live your life.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.680
 But anyway, they--

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.760
 That's a really philosophical question, isn't it?

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.120
 Isn't it one of the more amazing--

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.280
 Are you happy with servitude or would you like freedom?

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.680
 When you put it like that, it's actually quite easy.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.160
 Look at the bars of the cage are made of gold.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.600
 And there's a nice bed in the cage.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.920
 And then put them on the other side.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.640
 Freedom.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.400
 Yeah.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.480
 Who of us can say what bars surround us?

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.920
 Well, Tate.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.560
 You know, what compromises--

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.800
 I can say what bars surrounds me most not.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.680
 So I think the monkeys all had this conference, this chat,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.280
 and they nominated Pijita.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.000
 But Michael Tomlin sounded quite fun.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.400
 He would apparently regularly swim the one kilometer channel

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.440
 back to the mainland.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.560
 Would drink a fifth of vodka.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.240
 I actually don't know what was a fifth of.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.120
 Well, that's what Eminem says in that stand.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.360
 He goes, I just drank a fifth of vodka.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.200
 Dare me to drive?

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.160
 I think he says that.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.080
 Who says that?

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:45.800
 Eminem.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.600
 Does he?

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.080
 I think so.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.680
 So it's obviously enough that you're going to be drunk.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.280
 I can't believe this guy, Michael Tomlin,

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.000
 is cooler than we are in that he gets Eminem slang.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.280
 Well, that's on a monkey island.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.920
 He's way cooler than we are.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.800
 What are you talking about?

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.800
 I think American listeners will be writing in droves

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.560
 very shortly for explaining exactly how much for this.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.640
 Just so we're clear, in the UK, we don't use that scheme.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.120
 We don't.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.640
 And this was in the 1930s.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.960
 Anyway, apparently it wasn't even vodka.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.360
 People just said that because he was Russian.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.960
 He actually preferred rum and coke.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.240
 So anyway, he'd swim over and then swim back, presumably

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.160
 hammered to the island where his wife was looking

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.880
 after the pet monkey.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.600
 These days, there are 2,000 Reese's macaques

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.960
 on Kyo's Santiago.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.240
 But also, I find this so creepy, almost all of them

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.320
 have tattoos.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.560
 Sorry, that's not the creepy bit.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.240
 It's a bit creepy.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:27.840
 It's a bit strange.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.600
 They haven't chosen to get a tattoo.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.080
 That's even creepier, arguably.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:32.560
 Is it?

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.560
 I don't know what's creepier.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.520
 What are they tattoos of?

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:34.760
 They're not--

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.720
 Scientific stuff.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.680
 The eye, heart, lung.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.680
 No, sorry.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.320
 Scientific stuff.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.600
 Yeah, like an equals MC squared.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.440
 That's being like a vacuum is.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.520
 That kind of stuff.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.040
 No, sorry, that's not the creepy bit.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.520
 The creepy bit is that the island is also

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.320
 home to a collection of 3,300 monkey skeletons.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:56.840
 Oh, OK.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.920
 You mean the dead monkeys?

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.200
 The dead monkeys.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.960
 Well, yeah, obviously, they're the dead monkeys.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.040
 But what they didn't do is bring in the monkeys

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.520
 and say, what would they like around them?

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.960
 What kind of furnishings can we add?

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.240
 Like in a fish tank, you know, on a skull, off to the skull.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.920
 You never have a dead fish in a fish tank.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.480
 You never have a giant dead fish swimming in an bathtub.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.440
 But it is creepy.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.360
 OK, so the question is, why did they not

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.960
 take away the skeletons or bury them or whatever?

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.920
 And I guess, well, they still need them to study them

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.200
 as in such a long-running research center now

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.160
 that you can study generations going back,

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.160
 and you can obviously study the bones of the monkeys

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.280
 that lived there before.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.800
 But I think it would be creepy if they had a cool mausoleum

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.120
 full of all the monkey skeletons.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.360
 But they don't have that.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.840
 No, it depends.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.320
 I don't think mausoleum makers are allowed on the island.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.840
 I don't think that research project's going to get funding.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.920
 But that's a good scene for the "Dampier Monkey" movie,

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.200
 where that's where the treasure's buried.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.800
 It's like at the Goonies, you know, the cave.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.240
 Wow.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.840
 So anyway, some food for thought.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.440
 Yeah.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.200
 Yeah.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.200
 Obviously, these sick tattoos that the monkeys have,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.360
 Einstein with his tongue out on his bicep.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.600
 They do-- I mean, it is a really important island,

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.160
 because they do discover stuff.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.360
 We haven't just done monkeys there and sort of forgotten

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.040
 about it.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.080
 And I think it's sort of like a rite of passage

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.560
 if you're a monkey researcher.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.480
 I reckon if you said to your monkey researcher mates,

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.240
 hey, I'm doing a Chiosantiago research project,

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.800
 you'd be the coolest kid in town.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.760
 So some stuff they've discovered recently

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.600
 is that after any kind of trauma,

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.200
 scientists now think that we probably

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.160
 age by, apparently, up to eight years.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.520
 And this is based on--

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.160
 Oh, my god.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.360
 It's a spurious link.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.600
 But that's what scientists do.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.840
 This is based on Hurricane Maria, that awful hurricane

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.000
 in 2017.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.160
 It killed a lot of people in Puerto Rico.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.520
 Didn't kill any of the monkeys, but totally

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.680
 destroyed the island.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.360
 So all the trees were blown down.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.280
 There's no shade.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.600
 The average temperature on the island

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.560
 rose by eight degrees.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.640
 Oh, wow.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.480
 Rough.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.480
 Because they take blood from the monkeys all the time

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.200
 for scientific reasons.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.040
 They had the samples before that they

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.840
 could compare to the samples afterwards.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.840
 And they looked at, like, lots of markers in the blood,

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.600
 and the immune system, and the proteins.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.480
 And they found they showed signs of aging by about two years

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.880
 just from that hurricane.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.480
 Wow.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.160
 Because there was a stress about it.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.720
 What in humans live much longer?

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.560
 So they've sort of extrapolated.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.920
 Inhuman years, apparently.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.680
 OK.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.280
 Yeah.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.400
 There's another monkey island, which is in Liberia,

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.920
 which is a bit sad, because it was a monkey island that

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.400
 didn't have any natural resources.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.680
 So the monkeys there had to be fed daily

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.120
 by the researchers.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.440
 So they would bring bananas over every single day.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.240
 But then in the 1990s, there was the war.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.120
 And as a result, the research unit fled.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.800
 And these monkeys were just left on their own.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.880
 And so they had no one to feed them except one guy called

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.840
 Joseph Thomas, who, for the last 40 years,

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.720
 has been going twice a day to this island with bananas

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:50.120
 and feeding these beautiful monkeys who come into the water

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:50.520
 to him.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.320
 And he knows them by names, like Mabel and so on.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.520
 Mabel, Edith, Prudence, Aggie, you know, and all the life.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.480
 Very funny.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.160
 Did you hear how Joseph Thomas was recruited for the job?

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.160
 I don't think so.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.480
 So this was in the '70s.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.040
 And this was another research island.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.200
 It was set up by a woman called Betsy Brotman.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.720
 And she was trying to find a vaccine for Hep B.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.000
 And she actually did come away with a vaccine for Hep B,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.960
 although she's since said it's a vaccine for Hep B.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.760
 And she actually did come away with a vaccine for Hep B.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.560
 Although she's since said it's actually

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.160
 a bad idea to test on animals.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.720
 But at the time, she set this research

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.960
 island up in the '70s.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.400
 And I think it was her who recruited Joseph Thomas,

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.000
 because she went to him and said,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.360
 I really want to learn to play tennis.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.600
 You're good at tennis.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.760
 I also need someone to help me on my monkey research.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.520
 And they made a deal where if he taught her tennis,

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.040
 he would work on her monkey research.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.520
 Now, I know that now.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.200
 He's on the very one-sided exchange.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.640
 I tell you what, we'll do a deal.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.520
 If you do all this work, I'll also

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.120
 let you do all this work.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.320
 It was basically that.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.720
 You know, there is an island where

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.520
 you've got lots of potential tennis partners you can go to.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.720
 Monkey tennis, anyone?

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:09.360
 I've been to a monkey temple in, what was it, in Nepal.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.800
 And that's another place where there's just monkeys everywhere.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.560
 They're just kind of running around and stuff.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.880
 And when I was there, you have to keep hold of your stuff

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.040
 all the time, because I saw a monkey stealing someone's

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.400
 mobile phone and their bag.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.080
 And then running to the top of a huge building.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.080
 And then the guys who were kind of in charge

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.080
 had to come with a big stick and prop him.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.680
 And then someone climbed up to get the mobile phone and stuff.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.400
 Do you know, this is something Ethan, our fellow researcher,

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.640
 told me yesterday that they know that mobile phones are

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.800
 more valuable than, let's say, something less valuable.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.400
 I don't know if they know an iPhone is more valuable than a Nokia.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.880
 But they did a study at another monkey temple.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.200
 Do you think you'd be completely safe if you went there, Anna?

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.360
 Because your phone was made in 1983.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.040
 I've got nothing desirable for the monkeys.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.600
 You actually wouldn't recognize your phone as a phone.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.480
 They did this amazing study over-- so they

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.080
 filmed monkeys for 270 days in Bali at this one temple.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.680
 And they realized that when monkeys take something off you,

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.040
 they negotiate with you for food in exchange for it.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.400
 So they take your phone, and then if you give them two bananas,

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.720
 they give it back, whatever.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.560
 And by watching them, they realized

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.080
 that the higher the value of the item, if they're still

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.920
 on a phone rather than a camera case,

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.680
 then they'll barter for more bananas.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.160
 Wow.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.080
 That's really clever.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.000
 It's really good, isn't it?

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.120
 That's incredible.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.120
 Terrifying.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.440
 Have you guys heard of Snake Island?

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:29.920
 Where is that?

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.400
 It's off the coast of Brazil.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.320
 And it's called Ilha da Queimada Grande.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.640
 And it's completely dominated by a special kind of snake,

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.600
 a special kind of snake, a particular kind of snake.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.800
 They're golden lancehead pit vipers.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.480
 Oh, gosh.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.600
 They sound scary and dangerous, maybe.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.760
 They are dangerous.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.280
 They're venomous.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.440
 Their venom melts the flesh that they bite into.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.600
 And they evolved venom to incapacitate and kill

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.400
 the seabirds that land on the island.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.920
 They are not nice snakes.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.880
 They can climb trees, which helps them

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.960
 to eat the birds that they love to feed on.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.280
 And on this island, there is about one snake per square meter.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:05.780
 Wow.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:06.280
 What?

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.480
 So you--

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:07.880
 Yeah.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.560
 Oh, my god.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.800
 A lot of them will be in the same square meter, though,

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.280
 right?

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:11.720
 Yeah.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.680
 Yeah, yeah, that's true.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.200
 Even so.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.360
 It's not one every square meter, but nonetheless.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.600
 They're not perfectly arranged like on a chess board.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.560
 They're playing with huge island wide gamers, snakes,

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.040
 and ladders.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.600
 Yeah, yeah, it's very hard to win.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.200
 It just sounds completely terrifying.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.600
 Why would you stay there if you were a bird?

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.000
 Mike, Mike Wright, what are you doing?

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.120
 I don't think they're reading TripAdvisor.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.720
 I think, you know, I'll risk it.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.920
 Like, they're just flying and they end up there.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.480
 Yeah, but get back.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.480
 Tell the others.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.040
 I've been to a rabbit island.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:39.720
 Have you?

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.080
 Near Hiroshima, it's like just an island full of rabbits.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:44.840
 Wow.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.040
 It's not a research island.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.600
 There's just loads of rabbits there.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.240
 In Sydney, where I live, we used to have a rabbit problem

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.000
 down in the northern reaches Palm Beach

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.920
 and used to drive down at night.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.000
 And you'd put the headlights on of the car at high beam

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.040
 and you would just see what were in the daytime empty fields

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.960
 just packed like they're at Glastonbury watching.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.800
 It's really, honestly, it's quite scary

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.000
 because you walk down the street in this Japanese island

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.200
 and the rabbits just follow you because they

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.720
 used to be in fed by tourists.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.400
 Oh, no.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.400
 And so you sort of turn around and there's 20 rabbits behind you

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.120
 and you kind of walk a bit faster

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.280
 and you turn around and there's 30 rabbits behind you.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.680
 That's really scary.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.600
 That is a good horror film.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.920
 What STI did you get up there?

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:31.160
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.920
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.480
 OK, my fact this week is that in 14th century Italy,

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.120
 if you wanted to insult a nearby city,

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.960
 you would send all your prostitutes

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.640
 to take part in a running race around their walls.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.840
 I didn't have any prostitutes.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.120
 Well, you've just been in a war, probably, with that city.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.600
 You probably picked up a few on the way, is the truth.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.520
 You didn't know I was into that.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.720
 So I saw this in a book called Running Through the Ages

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.960
 by Edward Sears, and we're talking so Middle Ages Italy.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.640
 You've got loads of different areas

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.640
 owned by different peoples.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.280
 You've got Papal States, you've got Sicily,

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.360
 but then you've got places like Florence, Pisa, Siena, Luca,

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.120
 Milan, Genoa, all those kind of city states, you would say.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.880
 And from around the 13th century, for about 400 years,

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.120
 we seem to have this really odd tradition

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.360
 of whenever you're battling with another city,

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.400
 or you've beaten them and you want to celebrate that,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.120
 or you just want to stick it to them,

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.600
 you would have a running race around their town.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.880
 And it's so weird.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.600
 And there were lots of different versions of this,

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.400
 but one of the biggest insults was

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.480
 you would get a load of mules or donkeys,

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.400
 and then you would get all your sex workers,

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.560
 either from your city or ones that you picked up

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.640
 through the war, and you would just get them to race around.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.120
 - Yeah, it did sound a bit like, 'cause armies,

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.320
 as you say, they would gather the sex workers

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.120
 and they would bring them along for the battles even.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.880
 You know, if the armies were facing off,

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.600
 they would have them do races sort of in the front.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.520
 And they said, that's why they're here, darling.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.080
 - That's why we brought them for the racing.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.400
 - Do you think this is all fake news?

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.440
 - I do. - This isn't happening at all.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.880
 The wives turned up to surprise their husbands one day.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.800
 - We came for the races.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.640
 - Shit.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.840
 - The point of it, as far as I can tell,

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.560
 is that it was a big collective screw you

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.880
 to the other city that you're--

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.720
 - That's it.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.800
 And so they would do loads of different things.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.640
 So one of the things they did,

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.920
 they would gather outside the city,

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.880
 so you gathered outside the opposing city state,

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.360
 then you would find the oldest tree in the area,

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.880
 and you cut it down, which is a symbolic castration,

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.280
 apparently, I know.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.280
 And then they put the tree on a wagon

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.840
 and wheel it up to the city,

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.520
 like just really up close, like look,

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.360
 that was your tree.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.200
 - Look, this is your penis.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.480
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.560
 And then they would go to the stump of the tree,

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.800
 and they would start minting coins on the stump.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.640
 - What?

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.480
 - I know, this is completely--

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.160
 - But the base of your castrated penis.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.000
 - We're gonna make coins.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.560
 And then basically, what they were saying was,

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.840
 we're gonna change the currency that you operate in.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.680
 We're minting coins.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.240
 Some of the coins would, I think, depict

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.840
 a picture of someone minting a coin on your tree.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.640
 Yeah, but it was this whole--

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.720
 - I think they'd show them being vanquished, wouldn't they?

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.120
 Or they'd show humiliating scenes

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.480
 for the enemy, these coins.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.000
 But the tree thing does imply

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.200
 that there's a lot of explaining to do

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.400
 when you show them the tree in the city.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.400
 There you have to say, "This is your oldest tree, guys."

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.240
 They go, "Oh, is it? Okay."

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.800
 - We couldn't tell which was your oldest tree.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.160
 We counted the rings.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.840
 We think it's pretty old.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.800
 It's, I mean, it was your tallest tree,

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.160
 but that might have been a different breed.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.160
 Actually, that was, "Shut up, shut up!"

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.800
 - And then one of them says, "Okay, so."

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.200
 And then you have to say, "No, but metaphorically,

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.920
 "it represents us castracing you."

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.760
 I don't know how upset you're gonna be.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.600
 This is starving.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.960
 - Also, are you yelling to the top of the guys on the wall?

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.400
 It's a hell of a complicated conversation.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.200
 - We're sending messages on paper aeroplanes over the wall.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.160
 - Look, forget the penis thing.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.920
 We're talking about the coins now.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.440
 It doesn't matter about the penis thing, all right?

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.400
 Move on.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.520
 - All right, raise the prostitutes.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.160
 - Yeah, release the prostitute.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.400
 - Well, the thing with the prostitutes

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.720
 is it was slightly more literal

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.960
 in that they would often race around land in the city even,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.880
 and so that you're basically saying,

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.680
 "We can do what we want around here."

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.720
 You know what, you think that you own this place,

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.640
 we can run our prostitutes through, yeah.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.800
 - I read an account of the prostitute races

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.120
 not being just for when you're sieging and at battle.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:27.880
 You would do it in generally around town.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.680
 So like, there would be kings who would use them

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.920
 to do it as a display,

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.880
 just to show a sort of minority of society

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.880
 doing something a bit derogatory.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.720
 - Humiliating.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.680
 - Yeah, just to sort of push the point of like,

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.480
 "I'm the king and I'm running this place."

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.720
 And what's interesting about it is,

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.680
 so there was one that was done

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.520
 where the race would end up at St. Peter's Square.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.360
 - Well, Rome.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.040
 - Yeah, and so it was done there.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.080
 This is in the 1500s.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.400
 - You don't get that these days.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.480
 I don't know if you've been to St. Peter's Square, but.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.760
 - The Pope is not gonna like that.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.960
 - So this is 1503 and it wasn't just prostitutes

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.080
 who were part of the race.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.280
 It was, you know, elderly people were in it,

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.720
 children were in it as well.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.840
 They would all be naked,

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.680
 but the prostitutes would be wearing underwear.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.520
 It's very odd.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.880
 - Underwear, very racy in those days,

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.520
 wasn't it, underwear, I think.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.520
 - More racy than having your genitals hanging out.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.360
 - I believe because a lot of people

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.840
 didn't really wear underwear.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.680
 I'm going off memory here,

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.960
 but a lot of people didn't wear underwear.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.560
 But prostitutes would wear them

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.600
 because it's, you know, a nice bit of,

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.600
 ooh, look what might be in there.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.280
 - Scantily cladded saucier than nude, you know.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.120
 - Yeah.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.440
 - It depends on context.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.000
 - It does, but you know, Adam and Eve,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.760
 just innocent, pure, first people alive.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.800
 Adam and Eve wearing a kind of,

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.120
 it's kind of thongs made of leaves.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:39.960
 - Suddenly sexy.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.800
 - Yeah.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.640
 - And that was the problem.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.480
 - Yeah.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.320
 - Yeah.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.160
 - Using the snake as a garser.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.000
 - Yeah.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.840
 - That's a sexy thing now.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.320
 - Well, it depends if it's one of those pit vipers.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.160
 (laughing)

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.000
 - Yeah, Adam and Eve.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:49.840
 - Fiction melty.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.080
 (laughing)

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.480
 - So they weren't even hot.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.560
 They were just naked.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.520
 Or even half-naked.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.360
 'Cause they were,

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.080
 people do seem to be described as half-naked a lot.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.040
 - Yeah.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:00.880
 - Doing it.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.720
 - Sometimes.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.880
 - And it's all too,

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.040
 it's all just about insulting and humiliating, isn't it?

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.800
 And I would quite an interesting description

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.840
 of why this was so common in Italy,

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.760
 these taunting.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.080
 And it's because obviously Italy wasn't Italy,

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.680
 the country until extremely recently.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.840
 It was just loads of city-states.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.120
 And so warfare was quite different to a lot of other places

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.200
 because it was just city-states against each other.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.000
 So it wouldn't be there's like lots of action

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.360
 on these big battlefields and seizing lots of territory.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.880
 It was pretty much just sitting there besieging a city.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.160
 So you just start doing nothing for months on end.

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.080
 So you had to think of other things to do

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.200
 to make them feel bad.

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.400
 - Like a sports day.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.240
 - It's a sports day.

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.080
 (laughing)

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:39.920
 - Egg and a spin race.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.920
 Bring out the prostitutes.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.360
 - They should do a sack race.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.360
 'Cause you're trying to sack the city.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.200
 - Yeah, nice.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.040
 - That's where it comes from.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.640
 - That feels like a trick you play as a besieged city.

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.360
 Persuade them all to climb into sacks.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.200
 - Oh right.

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.200
 Was that the original Trojan horse?

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.040
 - That's the Trojan sack.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.880
 - It's 5,000 sacks.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.800
 - Then left out the front.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.040
 (laughing)

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.440
 The other really interesting thing in the source

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.840
 that you sent around, James, was about the ripples.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.680
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.880
 - So I didn't know if you get,

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.800
 like the word rippled that we used today.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.160
 So rippled is in, you know, like rude and raunchy.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.440
 A bit of a rippled joke.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.360
 Rippleds back then were people in,

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.720
 like low people in the army, seems like.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.560
 And they would do these races with the prostitutes.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.000
 Or I think they were sort of pimps as well sometimes.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.800
 So they were, I guess, tasked

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.120
 with sourcing the prostitutes sometimes.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.960
 And they seemed to do kind of all the low stuff

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.360
 that other people, like the knights, wouldn't want to do.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.800
 So they would have to drop their pants in front of the enemy

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.880
 and shout swear words.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.840
 - Well, it's very hard to drop a suit of armor.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.560
 (laughing)

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.960
 - It's like Dongarees, you have to do it all over the shoulders.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.720
 It's so annoying going to a loo.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.640
 - So they'd shout swear words at the enemy

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.480
 and they would, they'd scale up the walls.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.000
 The responsibility was scaling up the walls

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 because they didn't really get given many good weapons.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.480
 And the pillaging, a lot of the pillaging,

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.040
 which is a bit un-gentlemanly,

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:00.880
 the rippleds would do that.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.160
 - They were kind of like your first,

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.920
 they were like cannon fodder slash first line of attack,

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.200
 right? - Yeah, yeah.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.520
 - But yeah, really interesting.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.840
 I did find it really interesting

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.080
 that they would be the pillaging

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.680
 because the knights couldn't really pillage

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.520
 'cause you were a knight.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.000
 So you couldn't really do any of that stuff

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.800
 or they could go in and they'd grab a load of stuff

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.560
 and then just gamble it away, wouldn't they?

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.240
 - Yeah, which I'm surprised

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.840
 because I think what it smoothed over,

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.720
 'cause I know that knights returned from warfare

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.400
 with a lot of stuff that they'd stolen,

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.600
 I reckon they had a sharp word with the rippleds

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.760
 after they'd done the pillaging and said,

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.000
 "All right, hand some of that over."

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 - Right? - I'm sure you're right.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:32.840
 - Surely. - Yeah.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.720
 - The rippleds were nicknamed the Knights of Shit.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.080
 (all laugh)

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:40.520
 They were just, yeah, they're just absolute base grunts

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.360
 in the army, yeah.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.120
 - Knights of Shit. - Darling, I've got a job.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.480
 I'm a knight, is it?

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.160
 (all laugh)

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.000
 I'm a knight.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.200
 - You definitely put the end of that in your business card.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.880
 The word knight will be very big.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.520
 (all laugh)

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.800
 The Yipang Palace is in China,

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.280
 and there would be people, soldiers in armor,

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.560
 who would kind of besieging the palace,

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.960
 and the people inside the palace would taunt them.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.560
 Why do you think they might do that?

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.080
 To come towards the gates?

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.560
 - Is it because they're taunting them

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.400
 to get to the point

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.480
 where they pour the boiling oil on their heads?

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.160
 - It's close to that, actually.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.000
 - Okay. - It's quite close.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.960
 - So the people inside are taunting the besieging

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.560
 forces of the palace. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.120
 - But it is getting them close, right?

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.800
 Okay, so it's either gonna be like spikes

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.600
 come up through the ground,

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.560
 or they're gonna then say, "Ha ha,

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.120
 the tree's actually that way.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.560
 You've got miles to run."

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.400
 (all laugh)

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.240
 - That's good.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.920
 - They're wearing iron armor.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.960
 Oh, it's a magnet.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.600
 - It's a magnet. - What?

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.440
 - The gate. - What?

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.280
 - I kind of thought that was a joke.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.240
 - The gate. - What?

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.920
 - Is a magnet. - Oh, no!

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.280
 - No, not strong enough to what, suck the meat.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.440
 (all laugh)

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.520
 - This is what the stories of the times say,

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.720
 that their gates were made of lodestone,

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.960
 which attracted iron,

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.960
 and so whenever the soldiers came near it,

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.680
 they would kind of be all over the place.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.440
 They couldn't move properly and stuff like that.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.840
 And so the people in the palace would go,

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.240
 "Ah, fuck you.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.960
 You can't even come close, can you?"

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.080
 - God, so could you wake up in the morning one day,

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.680
 go outside your castle? - You just stuck on there.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.800
 - Yeah, and a nighttime commando army

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.640
 who tried to take over and just plastered around the corner.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.200
 - Every morning you just scraped the nights off the door.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.520
 - Yeah.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.720
 - It's not sticking them directly to it,

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.680
 which was actually your comedic version of that.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.200
 Actually, it just makes it more difficult

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.600
 for them to run around.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.560
 - Oh, wow, would it feel a bit soupy?

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.680
 - That's a suggestion.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.600
 I mean, this actually happened.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.960
 - Well, no, not here when you put two pencil rubbers

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.960
 and you face them as like a weird force in between.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.680
 - But there's no way this Chinese propagandist

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.920
 who was making this up about a thousand years ago or whatever,

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.760
 there's no way they actually had magnets strong enough

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.840
 that an entire army starts crumbling.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.640
 - I gotta say, I didn't think

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.720
 that the loadstone was a real thing.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.640
 - Well, you can get magnetic magnetites, for instance.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.600
 What Chinese people would call loadstone

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.320
 in these accounts, we think probably was magnetite.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.160
 - Okay.

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.440
 - But it's interesting, then, if that came out

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.120
 as a rumor of being truth,

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.120
 because then if you were approaching the castle

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.240
 and you had your armor on, you might take it off,

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.560
 thinking I don't want to get sucked up all the walls.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.520
 - You'd start just feeling a bit awkward

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.720
 about whatever you were doing.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.640
 You know, when you can't move anything right,

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.160
 you know, just 'cause you're feeling embarrassed.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.680
 You'd start thinking, oh, well, this is probably

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.680
 the magnetite making me move awkwardly.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.240
 - Like placebo. - And then move more awkwardly.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.080
 - What?

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.440
 - Like a placebo effect. - Like a no-cebo.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.200
 - Yeah, like a no-cebo. - Like a no-cebo.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.920
 - Although I do like Dan's version better,

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.600
 which is you're worried about it,

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.880
 you take your armor off and then you just get attached.

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:32.720
 That's clever.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:36.240
 - Oh, you must have read that story,

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.280
 but if anyone didn't read that story

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.000
 a few weeks ago at Hadrian's Wall,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.480
 it was one of my favorite news stories in years.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.240
 Please look it up, 'cause you need to see the visuals,

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.280
 but basically, archeologists were digging around

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.680
 at Hadrian's Wall recently,

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.480
 and they found this volunteer, actually,

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.720
 volunteer-retired biochemist called Dylan Herbert

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:58.920
 found a 40-centimeter-wide sort of block of stone

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.440
 with an engraving on it, which is a flawless cock and balls.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.320
 Like, it looks stunning.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.920
 The best a 12-year-old boy could master.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.400
 And underneath it, it has the word secondenous cacor,

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.100
 which is like slang, secondenous the shitter,

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:18.080
 just perfectly written there, 1700 years old.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.960
 And that's there, secondenous, that's how he's remembered.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.240
 And the BBC article reported that the experts

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.480
 who uncovered this believe the phallic image

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.120
 alongside the quote adds to the force

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.480
 of the written insults.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.240
 - Undoubtedly, imagine that secondenous,

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.080
 like, we don't know anything about this person, right?

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.200
 - We know one thing.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:41.360
 - That is the most successful bit of insulting in history.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.700
 - That's the dream of when you insult someone.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.040
 - That's great.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.420
 - Poor guy.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.860
 The guy, actually, the guy who found it,

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.740
 sorry, it sounds so fun finding it as well.

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.020
 This old guy said, "Only when I removed the mud

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.100
 "did I realize the full extent of what I'd uncovered."

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.300
 And I was absolutely delighted.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.620
 (all laughing)

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.200
 (upbeat music)

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:06.260
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.460
 And that is my fact.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.180
 My fact this week is that a member

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:13.680
 of the Romanov royal family, Prince Rostislav Romanov,

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.360
 lives in Hastings as a painter.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.320
 His friend and wife refer to him

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.380
 as the artist formerly known as Prince.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.120
 - Brilliant.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:23.960
 - That's very funny.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.120
 - It's a wonderful little gag.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.020
 - It doesn't work, does it?

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:27.200
 'Cause he's not been a prince.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.040
 - Well, he--

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.560
 - The Romanovs were gone a long time

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.160
 before he was born, I'm guessing.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.160
 - Yeah, but they were, absolutely.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.120
 But he and they still are trying to sort of suggest

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.440
 that maybe one day they can return

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.940
 to their keeping the titles and they keep it alive.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.900
 - Okay, so is he technically a prince?

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.660
 Does he call himself, does he style himself as a prince?

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:45.500
 - Yeah, he does.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.580
 I think he does interviews as a prince.

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.820
 He talks about the royal family in exile.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:53.660
 They have as part of the Romanov surviving family ahead

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.100
 who would be the heir apparent to any return

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.260
 that would be made of the family.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.940
 So yeah, I would say he is a prince.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.980
 So he was born overseas from Russia.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.380
 All of the Romanov family had to leave.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.540
 And as a result, none of them have ever lived within Russia.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.560
 Apart from the ones who were brutally murdered

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.200
 by the Bolsheviks, of course.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.040
 - Yeah, they're still there.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.220
 - It's still leaving, isn't it?

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.280
 (all laughing)

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.720
 - Nowadays, he finds himself living in Hastings

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.640
 where he is an artist.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.400
 You can go on his Instagram account.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.000
 I like his art actually, it's pretty fun.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:23.840
 - Oh yeah.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.040
 - And yeah, and he does interviews occasionally

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.280
 to talk about his relationship with the family

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.440
 and what's gonna happen one day

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.720
 and how they might return and so on.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.880
 - Is he plotting a comeback?

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.320
 It's worth a try.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.000
 - I would say it's actually not worth a try.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.020
 - I have to say, I would not be wanting

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.620
 to invade Russia right now, I don't think.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:44.340
 As an artist living in Hastings, I wouldn't back my chances.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.420
 - Well, here's the thing.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:46.740
 There are attempts occasionally

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:47.920
 to bring them back into power.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.860
 So we were just talking about monkey islands.

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:53.220
 Someone actually tried to set up a Romanov island.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.940
 And this was the Pacific Island of Kiribati.

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.940
 And the idea was that they wanted to take over this island,

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.300
 turn it into a sort of a resort.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:05.580
 But they said, could we revitalize the royal family

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.740
 and have them rule over here?

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.320
 - So they tried to have monkey island.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.600
 - It was a Russian MP.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.800
 Yeah, he was called Anton Bakov.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.360
 And he, it was quite critical of the Putin government.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.920
 - And Putin said, "Bakov."

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.400
 (all laughing)

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.360
 - Yeah, and he wanted three islands.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.200
 They were uninhabited.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.160
 So they would have been a great place

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.320
 to kickstart the whole Romanov dynasty again.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.560
 And the islands were called Molden,

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.120
 Starbucks and Millennium.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:29.960
 - Starbucks.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.040
 - I know.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.040
 I don't know why.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:32.880
 - I mean--

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.520
 - No big thing or the restaurant chain.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.320
 - You would think Moby Dick thing.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.860
 - And also, can we just pick up on Anna

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.620
 calling Starbucks a restaurant chain?

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:40.780
 (all laughing)

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.280
 Says a lot about your standards.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.420
 Oh, Anna's taken me to a restaurant tonight.

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.180
 Oh, great, I wonder which one.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.620
 - Just seven coffees for dinner.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:50.460
 - Yeah.

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.300
 - Do they have?

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.620
 - No, he wanted to make kind of a micro nation.

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.540
 But I think the Kiribati government refused.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.220
 They said, "Our sovereignty is not for sale."

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.420
 - Well, he was also talking to the Gambia

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.660
 and apparently had support of Yaya Jame,

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.780
 who was in charge of Gambia at the time.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.420
 And that was to construct some artificial islands

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.420
 off the coast of the Gambia.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:09.540
 - Do we know what his plan is after?

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.820
 I see that that bit is easy enough.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.040
 You go to a tiny island where no one lives

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.380
 and you declare yourself a czar.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.720
 How are you gonna then go from there--

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.560
 - It's a stepping stone.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.400
 - To ruling Russia.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.240
 - It's a stepping stone.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.080
 You've gotta have a base.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.800
 I would argue that perhaps his long-term,

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.600
 might not even be to take over Russia,

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.720
 is just to have the Romanov Empire back.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.560
 - Oh, it's a bit sad.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.080
 I imagine if you called back the Romanos

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.440
 and showed them some crappy little rock in the Pacific

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.160
 and said, "This is what your empire is."

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.220
 - He also bought some land

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:38.860
 beside the Vatican in Montenegro.

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.340
 So he's trying it in loads of different countries.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.180
 - Nice.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.020
 I like that.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:43.860
 It's like risk, you know?

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.420
 You just plot yourself and it looks like

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.980
 nothing's going on and then suddenly

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.340
 a couple of moves and you've taken over the world.

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:51.260
 - I don't believe you ever won a game of risk.

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.500
 (all laughing)

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.580
 - Dan is playing risk control and negotiating

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:58.940
 for three uninhabited islands in Kyrgyzstan.

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:01.520
 (all laughing)

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.020
 - Yeah, Prince Philip, linked to the Romanovs.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:06.860
 - Yeah.

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:07.700
 - In fact, so linked to the Romanovs

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.000
 because when his parents got married,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.120
 Tsar Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia,

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.200
 was at the wedding and his great aunt Ella became a nun.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.040
 Prince Philip's great aunt Ella became a nun

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.880
 and after her death, became a saint.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.080
 And they were always rather proud

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.480
 that they had a saint in the family.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.320
 I think it's fair enough.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.680
 - Yeah, do we know what were her miracles?

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.520
 - Saintly moves.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.520
 I don't know what her miracles were.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.360
 No, no, no.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.180
 That's all I know.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:31.440
 - But Philip was used recently, wasn't he?

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.200
 Just before his death for a blood sample

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.620
 to confirm the identity of what was it?

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:40.060
 - Yes, it was, bones of the Romanovs were contested

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.420
 and the scientists were trying to work out

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:43.420
 whether they really were the Romanovs family.

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.220
 - So they were in Katerinburg

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.300
 and they were attacked by the Bolsheviks

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.740
 and they killed all of this family,

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.780
 but there was two of them who were supposedly breathing

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.700
 when they took the bodies away

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.620
 and there's a suggestion that those two had escaped.

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.300
 Now, when they found the bodies,

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.620
 they found all of them apart from these two bodies

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:03.960
 and they tested them and they realized

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:04.800
 they were the Romanovs,

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.900
 so that kind of gave fire to the conspiracy theory,

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.080
 but then they found another two bodies nearby

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.720
 and that's the recent test that they did

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.520
 and they found that they were related to the Romanovs.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.360
 - 'Cause one of the supposed princesses lived

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.960
 for many decades, didn't she?

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.760
 And always insisted that she was the surviving daughter.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.600
 - Oh, there was a home.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.440
 - Anastasia.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.000
 - Yeah, you don't want the kids' film.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.360
 - I actually didn't know about that film,

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.760
 but Anastasia was one of these two people

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.660
 and there was a hugs of someone called Anna Anderson

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.460
 who claimed to be her.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.780
 - Yeah, that's who I'm thinking.

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.120
 - And she got really famous, I think.

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.220
 - Yeah, but it turned out she wasn't.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.060
 - No.

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:41.900
 - Right.

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.300
 - It is strange being descended from defunct royalty,

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.140
 isn't it?

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.400
 It's a very, very strange life.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.020
 I was, there was an Oscar in Newsweek

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.080
 saying that London is actually the hot destination

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.620
 for most, as heaving is all worth.

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:53.820
 - Throw a brick.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.100
 - Well, I guess it's because they're like,

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.620
 we haven't retained a royal family.

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.960
 - Most of the other countries sort of haven't.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.120
 - And it's also one of the really flashy royal families.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.480
 I think British people don't appreciate

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:09.240
 how high investment the British royal family is compared

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.580
 with the other European royal families.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:13.040
 - Oh my God, they're so humble, yeah.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.040
 They've got a little cottage.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.280
 - But there are only about half a dozen monarchies

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.300
 left in Europe, I think.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.120
 And the British one is the sort of biggest ticket one.

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:19.960
 - It's a biggie.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.800
 - Yeah, it's a biggie.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:21.720
 - And people have been coming here

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.840
 since people started opposing royal families.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.000
 Obviously, it became very trendy

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.640
 from like pre-Second World War

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.320
 and then under communism, of course,

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.980
 in Eastern Europe, they didn't love having the kings

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.920
 and queens there.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.660
 I think King Zog of Albania was stationed at the Ritz

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.340
 for a long time after he was forced into exile.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:40.340
 - Speaking of Zog, there is a crown prince

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:42.420
 of the Albanians today.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:47.420
 That is Lika Anwar, Zog Reza Badawin, Mziziwe Zogu.

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:53.100
 And this is the person that should the Albanian royal family

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.700
 ever come back, he will take over.

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.020
 It's quite a good name, isn't it?

00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:59.600
 - Obviously, him turning up at customs, basically,

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.440
 and opening his passport and then opening

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.200
 the next wing of his passport.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.940
 (all laughing)

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:08.400
 - Do you think he has a concertina thing that folds up?

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.240
 - He has to wind it all.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.080
 - A tiny little trumpet.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.880
 (all laughing)

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.200
 - But it's really interesting because Anwar,

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.040
 part of his name, is named after Anwar Sabat.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:17.880
 - Egypt.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:21.440
 - Yeah, and Reza is named after Muhammad Reza Pahlavi,

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.920
 who was the last Shah of Iran.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:23.760
 - In Iran, yeah.

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.360
 - And so he's basically taken all of these names

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.420
 from all the different deposed people

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:29.460
 and then put them into his name.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.460
 - Wow, like he has to be his parents have.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.500
 He basically lives in Tehran or anyway,

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.860
 capital of Albania, and he has a little royal residence.

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.900
 It's quite a nice house, but it's not a mansion,

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.180
 it's not a palace.

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:44.500
 And when he opens his gate, he has a little yard there,

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:48.020
 and inside the yard, it's all the unwanted statues

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.020
 from the last, you know, 100 years

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.820
 that they got rid of when communism fell.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.700
 So there's like a statue of Hodja

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.660
 and a statue of Lenin and Stalin

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:56.960
 and stuff like that.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.760
 It's funny that he's got them as the King Monkei.

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.120
 - Well, they're like, who's gonna want these?

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.320
 And they look at his name and they're like,

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.160
 oh, he'll want them.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.800
 - But it's kind of, that's kind of sad, isn't it?

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:06.800
 'Cause in a way, he's the final statue.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.160
 You know, he's sort of purposeless.

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.200
 - One day he'll just walk through the garden and freeze,

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.040
 won't he?

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:12.880
 - Oh my God.

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:13.720
 - Oh my God.

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.540
 - That's a nice fairy tale.

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:15.380
 - That's really good.

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.640
 - Yeah, I really like, do you know

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.800
 of Princess Kamatari of Burundi?

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:23.280
 So she moved to France in the 1970s,

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.080
 and she did this because her father

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.820
 was assassinated and then the King of Burundi

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.500
 was assassinated in 1972.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.180
 So she fled, she went to France,

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:34.740
 where she became the first ever black supermodel in France.

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.580
 - Oh, really?

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.420
 - And there might have been others,

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:37.660
 but she was really the first one

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:38.980
 who was going on the front of magazines.

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:39.820
 - Super famous, yeah.

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:40.660
 - Yeah, and so on.

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.780
 And she says that obviously it was her connection

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:44.740
 to the royal family that got her the gig,

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.100
 because the magazines at the time

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.300
 were basically only putting on blonde hair,

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.180
 blue eye models, but she was brought on as a princess.

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.820
 So she said, you know, I could have been black or blue

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.560
 or a crocodile, they would have put me on

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:56.960
 because I was a princess.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.700
 And then people thought she was so beautiful

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.320
 that she became an actual model.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.200
 So she did that for years and years and years,

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.560
 but then she moved back to Burundi

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.500
 because she thought, you know what,

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.360
 I'm gonna run for president.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.040
 So she set up a big campaign

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.240
 where she was gonna try and become

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.600
 president of the country.

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.960
 And I love that one of her priorities

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.640
 as the presidential candidate was

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.080
 to bring back the monarchy.

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.400
 (laughing)

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.240
 - That was like a pretty bit.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.840
 - Well, that's good if you're open about it, I think.

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:21.680
 - Yeah.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.020
 - Yeah, so if you're obviously campaigning for it.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:27.120
 - I was just wondering what the weirdest fate

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.320
 of a descendant was.

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.240
 And I was reading about the daughter

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.040
 of Romanian King Michael I,

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.120
 who had to abdicate in 1947.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.900
 She's called Irina Walker.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:41.900
 And in 2014, she was done for staging cockfights.

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:43.080
 - Really?

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.800
 - That's her life now, yeah.

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.280
 - Oh my God.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.120
 - So when you say staging, you've just been putting them on.

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.240
 You don't mean like fixing them.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.880
 - No, but I think they're very often fixed.

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.720
 - Yeah, but that's another level of illegality.

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.960
 It's not only when you do the cock fight.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.000
 (laughing)

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.460
 - It wasn't even fair.

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:04.160
 - She's very successful at it, it sounded like.

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:06.400
 She used to charge spectators $20 each.

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.240
 She lives in Oregon.

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.120
 She lives in Irrigan, in Oregon.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:09.960
 - Brilliant, stop it.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.800
 - Good stuff.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.640
 - And what's her name, Irina?

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.840
 - Irina, Irina in Irrigan, in Oregon.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.680
 (laughing)

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.600
 And yeah, she charges people to watch Rooster's fight

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.320
 with knives attached to their legs.

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:21.160
 - Oh my goodness.

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:23.160
 - And the winners would get up to 18 grand.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:26.600
 - The Greek royal family, they were abolished in 1974.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.240
 So they were exiled overseas.

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.040
 And one of the princes, Prince Nicolaus of Greece,

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.200
 was discovered in 1995,

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.440
 working under a pseudonym as a production assistant

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.800
 for Fox News.

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:38.920
 - Really?

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.160
 - The channel.

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.640
 And yeah, so he'd been working there

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:42.640
 as this production assistant.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.920
 And the only reason he was outed is because they were doing

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.800
 a story about his brother, Prince Nicolaus' brother,

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.040
 getting married, and they saw their standing

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.480
 as one of the groomsmen, their production assistant.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.320
 - That's amazing.

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.640
 - They were like, "What are you doing here?"

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:55.840
 - Oh my God, that's incredible.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.160
 - Yeah.

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.760
 - I was reading about Crown Prince Otto,

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.160
 of the Austro-Hungarian emperor.

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.160
 He would've been the Crown Prince of it.

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.040
 - Okay, is he current, is he alive?

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.120
 - No, he died in 2011.

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.600
 At the edge of it, I think about '99.

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.680
 It was really at old when he died.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.280
 So the Austro-Hungarian emperor was dissolved

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.200
 when he was, I think, about seven years old.

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.480
 But he was officially the King of Hungary in Bohemia,

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.680
 Grand Prince of Transylvania.

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:21.520
 - That's a good one.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.360
 - It is a pretty good one.

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.600
 His name was Franz Josef Otto Robert,

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.800
 Maria Anton Karl Max, Heinrich Sixtus Xavier,

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:33.040
 Felix Renatis Ludwig, Guy N. Pius Ignatius.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.640
 - Was his dad Jacob Riesemann?

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:38.280
 Can I just say Maria in there is a weird one, isn't it?

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.360
 - This is, I noticed that.

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.160
 I think I didn't read the full thing when I was,

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.120
 I just can't be pasted in, when you're reading it out.

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:44.960
 It's like, what? - It gives me a surprise

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:45.800
 to me.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.880
 There's their excuse as well.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.960
 - Also, I didn't fully read this one, were you?

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.880
 - But also he had Karl Max in his name.

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:51.720
 - Karl Max?

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.540
 - Really?

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:53.380
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:54.200
 But he, so he was, you know, seven years old,

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.280
 the empire is dissolved,

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.040
 which he's the crown prince of technically.

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.200
 So, and he had to kind of rebuild his life.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.240
 And he, you know, he learned seven languages.

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:04.040
 He became an MEP, which I find interesting.

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:04.880
 - Really?

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:05.880
 - God, that was a fool from grace, isn't it?

00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.720
 You're gonna be prince of an MEP.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.360
 - That's a big ballot as well, isn't it?

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.200
 - Yeah.

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.720
 - When you've got all of his name on.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.560
 (laughing)

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.400
 - He actually got the votes

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.880
 of about 17 different candidates.

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.000
 They thought they were very different people.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.320
 - I'm gonna vote for Maria.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.480
 (laughing)

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.120
 - And I love this bit of his history and his life.

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.320
 So he had really interesting life.

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:27.120
 He helped organize the Pan-European Picnic of 1989,

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.720
 which is a little-known bit of the end of the Cold War.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.720
 And it was on the border between Austria and Hungary.

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:33.500
 So you've got, you know,

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:34.760
 Free Market West on one side

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.920
 and Communists on the other in the East.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:40.280
 And thousands of people came and sort of gathered there

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:43.400
 to have a kind of cross-border picnic, as it were.

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.240
 And then actually 600 East Germans just moved into Austria.

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.760
 They just sort of fled across the boundary.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.360
 - Like during the picnic kind of thing.

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.600
 Like can I borrow your ketchup?

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.880

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.120

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:57.960
 Yeah, yeah, they're coming.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.540
