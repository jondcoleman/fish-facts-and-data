00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:15,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:15,00:00:17,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:17,00:00:19,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:19,00:00:21,from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:21,00:00:22,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:22,00:00:25,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:25,00:00:27,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.
00:00:27,00:00:29,"And once again, we have gathered"
00:00:29,00:00:31,around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:00:31,00:00:33,from the last seven days.
00:00:33,00:00:36,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:40,"Starting with fact number one, that is Andy."
00:00:40,00:00:43,- My fact is that the first man to use the word avocado
00:00:43,00:00:45,in English was a pirate.
00:00:45,00:00:46,- Oh.
00:00:46,00:00:47,- Arvacado.
00:00:47,00:00:50,- Arvacado.
00:00:50,00:00:54,"- That just sounds like you saying it normally, Dan."
00:00:54,00:00:57,(laughing)
00:00:57,00:00:58,"- Wow, okay."
00:00:58,00:01:00,- This is a guy called William Dampier
00:01:00,00:01:02,and he was an explorer.
00:01:02,00:01:04,He lived from 1651 to 1715.
00:01:04,00:01:07,"And he was lots of things, actually."
00:01:07,00:01:08,He was a hydrographer.
00:01:08,00:01:10,"He was a scientist, a writer, a naturalist,"
00:01:10,00:01:11,Royal Navy captain.
00:01:11,00:01:13,And we have a picture of him.
00:01:13,00:01:14,It's in the National Gallery.
00:01:14,00:01:18,It's the only 100% genuine portrait of a British pirate.
00:01:18,00:01:19,- Ooh.
00:01:19,00:01:20,- So he's quite--
00:01:20,00:01:21,- Does he have a pirate on his shoulder?
00:01:21,00:01:23,"- Yeah, I patch."
00:01:23,00:01:25,He's biting a gold doubloon.
00:01:25,00:01:27,(laughing)
00:01:27,00:01:29,"- So it's sort of making someone walk the plank, yeah."
00:01:29,00:01:31,"No, I don't think he is."
00:01:31,00:01:32,I think he looks like a normal man.
00:01:32,00:01:36,"But he was a pirate, among lots of other things."
00:01:36,00:01:39,And he wrote this account of the avocado pear tree.
00:01:39,00:01:40,And that's in the OED.
00:01:40,00:01:43,"When you look under avocado, his entry is the first one."
00:01:43,00:01:45,He gave a little report about the avocado
00:01:45,00:01:46,and said how nice it was.
00:01:46,00:01:47,- How many entries are there for avocado
00:01:47,00:01:48,then after his one?
00:01:48,00:01:50,"- Well, loads, 'cause the OED sort of gives,"
00:01:50,00:01:51,they give a load of different--
00:01:51,00:01:52,- When it's an exciter and stuff.
00:01:52,00:01:54,"- Yeah, it's about five or six."
00:01:54,00:01:56,"- Well, I think there's only one definition."
00:01:56,00:01:58,I'm not sure you've got like the verb avocado.
00:01:58,00:01:59,(laughing)
00:01:59,00:02:00,- This isn't the definition.
00:02:00,00:02:02,This is the citation.
00:02:02,00:02:03,"- Yes, yeah."
00:02:03,00:02:06,- He actually has over a thousand entries in the OED.
00:02:06,00:02:09,"- Of all the things that he has in the OED,"
00:02:09,00:02:12,I looked at them all where he's the first citation.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"So the first example we have,"
00:02:14,00:02:17,he was the first person to use the word thunder cloud.
00:02:17,00:02:17,- Wow.
00:02:17,00:02:19,- Which is quite good.
00:02:19,00:02:21,To frape the verb.
00:02:21,00:02:22,- Facebook.
00:02:22,00:02:25,(laughing)
00:02:25,00:02:26,- Is it a frape?
00:02:26,00:02:30,- He used the word meaning to bind tightly.
00:02:30,00:02:31,- Soy sauce as well.
00:02:31,00:02:33,"Soy sauce, which is my favorite."
00:02:33,00:02:34,- Chopsticks.
00:02:34,00:02:36,"- Chopsticks, which are my favorite utensils."
00:02:36,00:02:38,- And a lot of this is 'cause I guess he was travelling
00:02:38,00:02:41,"so much, and he was writing reports on his travels"
00:02:41,00:02:43,and so he was coming into contact around the world
00:02:43,00:02:45,with a lot of words not previously known to English.
00:02:45,00:02:46,So that's part of the reason why.
00:02:46,00:02:48,"- Well, I think that maybe even more amazing thing"
00:02:48,00:02:50,"about him is that he had a great recipe for avocado,"
00:02:50,00:02:52,which involves smashing it to pieces
00:02:52,00:02:56,and adding sugar and lime juice by making guacamole.
00:02:56,00:02:57,- Such a hipster.
00:02:57,00:02:58,- He gave us guac.
00:02:58,00:02:59,- Although the tragic thing about him is
00:02:59,00:03:01,he wrote so much about guacamole
00:03:01,00:03:04,that he was never actually able to afford his own pirate ship
00:03:04,00:03:06,'cause he just spent so much money on the...
00:03:06,00:03:08,- On frat pays as well.
00:03:08,00:03:09,(laughing)
00:03:09,00:03:11,"- So he always stopped renting those ships,"
00:03:11,00:03:12,wasn't he?
00:03:12,00:03:14,He couldn't burn anything on the walls.
00:03:14,00:03:16,"- So these words, he wrote quite a few books,"
00:03:16,00:03:19,"but he had a very, very famous one,"
00:03:19,00:03:21,"which was A New Voyage Around the World,"
00:03:21,00:03:23,which was a book that was so influential
00:03:23,00:03:26,that Darwin took a copy of it onto the Beagle with him.
00:03:26,00:03:28,"And, you know, is it this one book"
00:03:28,00:03:30,where we get a lot of these?
00:03:30,00:03:31,- Most of them are from that.
00:03:31,00:03:32,"I mean, that's pretty crazy."
00:03:32,00:03:34,- I think that was his main book.
00:03:34,00:03:35,"I think he wrote lots of other random stuff,"
00:03:35,00:03:37,"but yeah, that was his big one, wasn't it?"
00:03:37,00:03:39,"And it was really popular, 1697."
00:03:39,00:03:40,And it was when he'd gone around the world
00:03:40,00:03:41,"for the first time, was it?"
00:03:41,00:03:44,And then he went around another two times.
00:03:44,00:03:46,And it was full of food recipes.
00:03:46,00:03:47,He was a foodie.
00:03:47,00:03:50,He was a big old hipster foodie.
00:03:50,00:03:53,"Barbecue, kumquat, tortilla,"
00:03:53,00:03:54,and he included recipes
00:03:54,00:03:56,of what was the best thing to do with them.
00:03:56,00:03:58,"So he really recommended Flamingo Tongue,"
00:03:58,00:04:00,if you're ever in the market.
00:04:00,00:04:03,"He said it's very good, it's lean and black,"
00:04:03,00:04:05,and it's neither fishy nor unsavory.
00:04:05,00:04:06,- Yummy.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"- He also had armadillo,"
00:04:07,00:04:10,"which he said tastes a bit like lan turtle,"
00:04:10,00:04:11,if you're not sure.
00:04:11,00:04:14,"- Oh, like lan turtle, no, I can picture it, yeah, yummy."
00:04:14,00:04:16,"- Prickly pears, right?"
00:04:16,00:04:18,Which is a type of cactus.
00:04:18,00:04:20,And he said that it turned his urine so red
00:04:20,00:04:22,that it looked like blood.
00:04:22,00:04:23,- Yeah.
00:04:23,00:04:27,"- Okay, but I actually have some prickly pear candy at home."
00:04:27,00:04:28,So I tried some yesterday
00:04:28,00:04:32,and I'm yet to experience any red urine.
00:04:32,00:04:33,But I thought I'd bring you all some.
00:04:33,00:04:35,"- Oh, no, a bit of urine?"
00:04:35,00:04:38,Or it's just a small vial James is getting at.
00:04:38,00:04:40,- I've got some prickly pear candies
00:04:40,00:04:42,that I thought you might want to munch on
00:04:42,00:04:42,"if you feel like it. - Oh, lovely."
00:04:42,00:04:44,"Oh my God, they're delicious."
00:04:44,00:04:45,- And they're very red.
00:04:45,00:04:47,"They look a bit like Turkish delight, don't they?"
00:04:47,00:04:49,- I'm a huge fan of the show and tell element
00:04:49,00:04:50,of the podcast now.
00:04:50,00:04:54,I really like James' experience corner.
00:04:54,00:04:55,- That's good for the listeners.
00:04:55,00:04:56,- What do you really enjoy about it?
00:04:56,00:04:57,- It's so yummy.
00:04:57,00:04:59,"- They taste a bit like fruit pastels, don't they?"
00:04:59,00:05:01,"- Yes, exactly like that."
00:05:01,00:05:03,- I'm really excited because I got these at Christmas
00:05:03,00:05:04,and they've just been sat there
00:05:04,00:05:05,'cause I didn't really want to eat them
00:05:05,00:05:06,'cause they're made of cactus.
00:05:06,00:05:08,I finally got an excuse to.
00:05:08,00:05:09,- They're so good.
00:05:09,00:05:11,"He also used to eat sea turtles,"
00:05:11,00:05:14,but he had a preference for the ones that were grass fed.
00:05:14,00:05:16,- Grass fed sea turtles. - Was that an ethical preference
00:05:16,00:05:18,or you don't want the ones that are grain fed
00:05:18,00:05:19,and kept in cages?
00:05:19,00:05:20,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:05:20,00:05:22,"No, he just said that they're the best of that sort,"
00:05:22,00:05:24,both in largeness and in sweetness.
00:05:24,00:05:26,So quantity and taste.
00:05:26,00:05:29,And it's just quite amazing to imagine that this guy
00:05:29,00:05:30,"who was a pirate, let's remember him,"
00:05:30,00:05:33,"yeah, was going around."
00:05:33,00:05:36,"It's like, can I get grass fed turtles please?"
00:05:36,00:05:37,- I don't know.
00:05:37,00:05:38,"- True, yeah, yeah."
00:05:38,00:05:40,He wasn't a very good pirate at first.
00:05:40,00:05:42,His first act of piracy was an absolute disaster.
00:05:42,00:05:44,So it was like the British government was given
00:05:44,00:05:47,"in permission to take over Spanish ships, wasn't it?"
00:05:47,00:05:49,"- He was a bit more of a privateer,"
00:05:49,00:05:51,a sort of licensed pirate than a Blackbeard figure.
00:05:51,00:05:53,- The Spanish would call him a pirate for sure.
00:05:53,00:05:55,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:05:55,00:05:55,From their perspective.
00:05:55,00:05:58,"- The Spanish would call him a lot of things, wouldn't they?"
00:05:58,00:05:59,"- Well, he and his fellow Buccaneers,"
00:05:59,00:06:01,they attacked a Spanish fort.
00:06:01,00:06:02,It was very exciting.
00:06:02,00:06:03,"They managed to take it over,"
00:06:03,00:06:04,but the townspeople had left
00:06:04,00:06:06,with absolutely everything valuable.
00:06:06,00:06:07,So it was a complete disaster.
00:06:07,00:06:09,"And lots of his voyages were failures actually financially,"
00:06:09,00:06:11,"but he was always making observations,"
00:06:11,00:06:13,"writing down recipes,"
00:06:13,00:06:15,and it was basically long-distance book research
00:06:15,00:06:17,that he was doing.
00:06:17,00:06:18,"- It's not what you've sent him for, is it?"
00:06:18,00:06:19,"I haven't got you any gold,"
00:06:19,00:06:23,but I've come back with a Delia Smith-esque tone.
00:06:23,00:06:27,"- So, well, Delia Smith actually used to be a pirate."
00:06:27,00:06:28,It was a mercenary.
00:06:28,00:06:30,"She was a soldier of fortune in the 80s,"
00:06:30,00:06:32,"but a lot of that was recipe collected, yeah."
00:06:32,00:06:34,- Another thing that William Dampier did
00:06:34,00:06:37,was he was the first British sailor to reach Australia.
00:06:37,00:06:40,He got there way before the first fleets got over there.
00:06:40,00:06:42,"And weirdly, he has a few moments"
00:06:42,00:06:45,that we don't really give him the sort of acknowledgement for.
00:06:45,00:06:46,There's this weird passage in his book
00:06:46,00:06:47,where he's in the Galapagos
00:06:47,00:06:49,"and he's looking at the turtles there,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,"and he's saying, ""Oh, they look a different breed."""
00:06:51,00:06:53,And I wonder if that's helping towards their mating
00:06:53,00:06:56,"and so on, just writes a few random lines,"
00:06:56,00:06:59,just sort of suggesting that there's sort of evolutionary
00:06:59,00:07:01,benefit to the way that they're shaped
00:07:01,00:07:03,without naming that specifically.
00:07:03,00:07:05,"- Oh, so he says these suit their environment"
00:07:05,00:07:05,because they look like this.
00:07:05,00:07:07,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:07:07,00:07:10,Which is just so Darwinian.
00:07:10,00:07:11,- And Darwin had the book.
00:07:11,00:07:12,- Nice.
00:07:12,00:07:13,"- He became very famous,"
00:07:13,00:07:16,which is once his voyaging days were over.
00:07:16,00:07:17,He went to dinner with Samuel Peeps.
00:07:17,00:07:19,He lectured at the Royal Society.
00:07:19,00:07:21,And the last bit of Galapagos travels
00:07:21,00:07:23,is based on his journeys in part.
00:07:23,00:07:26,- Did he meet like a tribe of giants and all that stuff?
00:07:26,00:07:29,"- That's the second book of Galapagos travels,"
00:07:29,00:07:31,"not the final one, it's a bit more normal."
00:07:31,00:07:33,It just contains talking horses.
00:07:33,00:07:35,"- Well, he was in South America"
00:07:35,00:07:38,and he did see some horses there.
00:07:38,00:07:40,"He said, ""Here they have several horses,"
00:07:40,00:07:42,"""but what is most worthy of note"
00:07:42,00:07:44,"""is a sort of sheep they have,"
00:07:44,00:07:46,"""which inhabitants call conera de terra."
00:07:46,00:07:48,"""The creature is four foot and a half high"
00:07:48,00:07:50,"""and they're frequently ridden"
00:07:50,00:07:55,"""by two of the lustiest men of the area,"" he said."
00:07:55,00:07:57,"And he's almost certainly talking about llamas, we think."
00:07:57,00:08:00,So he's one of the first people to see llamas from the West.
00:08:00,00:08:01,"- Cool, what a life."
00:08:01,00:08:03,- It's very difficult when you read about him
00:08:03,00:08:05,because he was in many ways quite a bad guy.
00:08:05,00:08:06,- Okay.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"- Oh, he is a Spanish person."
00:08:08,00:08:09,(laughing)
00:08:09,00:08:11,- I've been talking to some of my friends in Madrid
00:08:11,00:08:14,and they do not go down well there.
00:08:14,00:08:18,"As anyone in that period, it was nuanced"
00:08:18,00:08:20,to say the least relationship with the natives
00:08:20,00:08:23,that he met at various places and wrote some pretty awful things
00:08:23,00:08:25,for instance about Australian Aboriginals.
00:08:25,00:08:28,"As a leader as well, he was pretty widely disliked."
00:08:28,00:08:30,So we should say that the thing maybe he's most famous
00:08:30,00:08:32,for today is that he was also responsible
00:08:32,00:08:34,"for Robinson Crusoe, essentially,"
00:08:34,00:08:36,"because Alexander Selkirk,"
00:08:36,00:08:39,"who we think Robinson Crusoe was based on,"
00:08:39,00:08:42,was on his ship and hated him so much
00:08:42,00:08:45,or thought that he was very bad at maintaining the ship
00:08:45,00:08:46,"and said, ""I think this ship's gonna sink."
00:08:46,00:08:48,"""I'm not gonna get on it until we fix it."""
00:08:48,00:08:52,"And I think it was Dampier who said, ""No, the ship's fine."
00:08:52,00:08:53,"""We can sail this ship."""
00:08:53,00:08:55,"- So was this halfway through a voyage, do you mean?"
00:08:55,00:08:57,- Halfway through a voyage.
00:08:57,00:08:59,- So basically they were going around Cape Horn
00:08:59,00:09:02,"and this guy, Selkirk, said, ""Don't go around Cape Horn."
00:09:02,00:09:03,"""It's a terrible place to go around."
00:09:03,00:09:05,"""It's always stormed, it's high winds."
00:09:05,00:09:07,"""It's like the middle of hurricane season or whatever."
00:09:07,00:09:08,"""We can't do that."""
00:09:08,00:09:10,"And then they went, ""Well, we're gonna do it anyway."""
00:09:10,00:09:12,"And so by the time they got through,"
00:09:12,00:09:13,all of the ships were a little bit bashed
00:09:13,00:09:16,"and he was like, ""These are gonna sink on the way home."
00:09:16,00:09:17,"""Get me off here."
00:09:17,00:09:19,"""Get me to wherever the nearest island is."
00:09:19,00:09:20,"""I wanna go to the nearest island."""
00:09:20,00:09:22,And so they sent him to the nearest island
00:09:22,00:09:26,"and as he got there, the other ship started to go away"
00:09:26,00:09:29,"and he's like, ""I've changed my mind, I've changed my mind."""
00:09:29,00:09:31,And they were like pretending they couldn't hear him
00:09:31,00:09:35,"and saying, ""What, what, sorry, we love it."""
00:09:35,00:09:37,And I read Robinson Crusoe a year or two ago
00:09:37,00:09:38,and there's no mention at the beginning of it
00:09:38,00:09:41,that he was a really annoying backseat driver
00:09:41,00:09:43,after the voyage and it's very sympathetically presented
00:09:43,00:09:44,into Facebook.
00:09:44,00:09:46,"- Well, to be fair, he had a very good point"
00:09:46,00:09:48,because the ship sank shortly afterwards
00:09:48,00:09:50,and most of the crew died and the rest ended up in prison.
00:09:50,00:09:51,- It was more annoying when the backseat driver
00:09:51,00:09:52,turns out to be right.
00:09:52,00:09:53,That's really frustrating.
00:09:53,00:09:56,- Didn't Selkirk then get picked up four years later
00:09:56,00:09:58,on another ship that had dampier honors?
00:09:58,00:09:59,"- Yeah, he did."
00:09:59,00:10:03,"- Imagine that, he's like, ""Finally, someone's coming to us."""
00:10:03,00:10:05,"- But then when he got back on that ship, he realized"
00:10:05,00:10:08,"and he was like, ""No, I want to be marooned again."""
00:10:08,00:10:09,And they eventually talked him round.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"- As in he genuinely was, yeah."
00:10:11,00:10:14,"That sounds like a joke, but yeah, he genuinely did say."
00:10:14,00:10:15,Set me off.
00:10:15,00:10:17,"- As they picked up Selkirk, they managed to find"
00:10:17,00:10:20,"a Spanish fleet, didn't they?"
00:10:20,00:10:21,And they managed to get a load of treasure
00:10:21,00:10:23,"from them, a load of booty,"
00:10:23,00:10:24,which meant Selkirk got a load of money
00:10:24,00:10:27,and he could retire when he got back to Britain.
00:10:27,00:10:29,"So he came home, he was very rich,"
00:10:29,00:10:31,but he couldn't quite readjust to society
00:10:31,00:10:32,"'cause he'd been on this island for however long,"
00:10:32,00:10:34,being a Robinson Crusoe guy.
00:10:34,00:10:36,And so he went to Scotland
00:10:36,00:10:38,and spent 15 years living in a cave.
00:10:38,00:10:39,- Oh my God.
00:10:39,00:10:42,- Which feels to me like a missed sequel
00:10:42,00:10:43,"to Robinson Crusoe, doesn't it?"
00:10:43,00:10:45,- Yeah.
00:10:45,00:10:46,- Robinson Crusoe lives in a cave.
00:10:46,00:10:48,- I think it's got all the promise
00:10:48,00:10:51,"of a disappointing second series, I have to say."
00:10:51,00:10:53,"- I got like Robinson too, so."
00:10:53,00:10:54,- Yeah.
00:10:54,00:10:54,- With what I would call it.
00:10:54,00:10:55,- Nice.
00:10:55,00:10:56,- I like it.
00:10:56,00:10:57,- Will you write books now?
00:10:57,00:10:58,- Thank you.
00:10:58,00:11:02,"- So Dampier, the first person in the OED"
00:11:02,00:11:05,"to mention the word avocado, as we say it today."
00:11:05,00:11:08,"But before that, they had different ways"
00:11:08,00:11:09,of saying the word.
00:11:09,00:11:12,So we kind of get it from the Spanish word.
00:11:12,00:11:16,People would say Aguacarta or Aguacardo
00:11:16,00:11:17,and stuff like that.
00:11:17,00:11:20,You can see online a big list of all the early times
00:11:20,00:11:21,when people mentioned this fruit.
00:11:21,00:11:25,"They started in 1562, going to the 17th century."
00:11:25,00:11:27,"And in 1660, they talk about this poem"
00:11:27,00:11:29,"that was written by Abraham Cowley,"
00:11:29,00:11:31,which mentions avocados.
00:11:31,00:11:33,But they don't say what the poem is.
00:11:33,00:11:36,None of the places say what the poem is.
00:11:36,00:11:37,And that really intrigued me.
00:11:37,00:11:38,"I'm like, why are they glossing over this?"
00:11:38,00:11:39,So I found this poem.
00:11:39,00:11:43,"""A fragrant leaf, the Aguacarta bears,"
00:11:43,00:11:46,"""her fruit in fashion of an egg appears,"
00:11:46,00:11:49,"""with such a white and sperm-y juice itself"
00:11:49,00:11:55,"""as represents moist life's first principles."""
00:11:55,00:11:57,I said that as a completely flawed description.
00:11:57,00:11:59,Are we sure they don't want the avocado?
00:11:59,00:12:02,I've never got white juice swelling out of my avocados.
00:12:02,00:12:04,"No, sperm-y juice in your avocado."
00:12:04,00:12:06,"No, am I not leaving it long enough to ripen?"
00:12:06,00:12:07,They had different types of avocados.
00:12:07,00:12:10,The one that we eat now is a Hass avocado most of the time.
00:12:10,00:12:13,And this was an old kind of one that you would get.
00:12:13,00:12:15,Some of them were white and egg-shaped.
00:12:15,00:12:16,I think the main crime there is rhyming
00:12:16,00:12:21,"swells with principles, which is not..."
00:12:21,00:12:23,"That's what offends me the most,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,apart from the sperm-y juice.
00:12:25,00:12:28,Do you know there's a Hass avocado board
00:12:28,00:12:31,"with the official authorities on Hass avocados,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,which is the ones that almost everyone eats today.
00:12:33,00:12:36,And they have huge amounts of data on their website
00:12:36,00:12:40,"about avocado consumption, US-based, mainly."
00:12:40,00:12:41,So is that why that guy was following me
00:12:41,00:12:44,when I went to my local organic shop to buy some avocados?
00:12:44,00:12:46,"Yeah, that's right, yeah, yeah."
00:12:46,00:12:48,"Would you say it's very sperm-y, sir?"
00:12:48,00:12:51,"It's quite sperm-y, very sperm-y."
00:12:51,00:12:54,Two sperm-y. They released a bit of research recently
00:12:54,00:12:55,that they found that avocado shoppers
00:12:55,00:12:57,divided into several distinct tranches.
00:12:57,00:12:59,"There are people who buy no avocados, first of all."
00:12:59,00:13:01,They're not really interested in those people.
00:13:01,00:13:02,"No, quite. They're moderate shoppers."
00:13:02,00:13:06,Then they have mega shoppers who buy a lot of avocados.
00:13:06,00:13:09,"But above them, there's a top tier, ultra shoppers."
00:13:09,00:13:11,Wow. How many do you have to be going through
00:13:11,00:13:13,to get to an ultra shopper level?
00:13:13,00:13:15,I think it's achievable. I go through six a week.
00:13:15,00:13:16,Stop it. Yeah.
00:13:16,00:13:18,"We do about the same in our house, yeah."
00:13:18,00:13:20,I think you guys might be a new category.
00:13:21,00:13:25,"No. So, ultra shoppers in America"
00:13:25,00:13:26,spend $100 a year on avocados.
00:13:26,00:13:28,"Oh, I spend way more than that."
00:13:28,00:13:29,"Well, there we go."
00:13:29,00:13:33,The ultra shoppers go to the shop 183 times a year
00:13:33,00:13:35,"and one trip in seven, they buy an avocado."
00:13:35,00:13:39,"OK, well, I have a avocado, so I don't go to the shop."
00:13:39,00:13:41,"Oh, my God. Is a avocado named after avocados?"
00:13:41,00:13:42,I don't know.
00:13:42,00:13:45,"Avocado. All these others are avocados, isn't it?"
00:13:45,00:13:46,Why does everyone use this?
00:13:46,00:13:48,Let's avocado.
00:13:48,00:13:50,"It's all replacement products, isn't it?"
00:13:50,00:13:53,We didn't have your pint of milk as an avocado.
00:13:53,00:13:54,We didn't have a pint of milk.
00:13:54,00:13:55,What you've got is a bit sperm-y.
00:13:55,00:14:06,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:14:06,00:14:08,My fact this week is that there's a Puerto Rican island
00:14:08,00:14:10,"where monkeys roam free,"
00:14:10,00:14:13,but the humans have to eat their meals in cages.
00:14:13,00:14:16,It's like Planet of the Apes.
00:14:16,00:14:17,It's like a reverse zoo.
00:14:17,00:14:19,Is it like Planet of the Apes?
00:14:19,00:14:21,It's like both the things we just said.
00:14:21,00:14:22,"Yeah, it is like Planet of the Apes."
00:14:22,00:14:25,The apes keep the humans in cages in Planet of the Apes.
00:14:25,00:14:27,"God, I always come visit with 2001 a space odyssey."
00:14:27,00:14:30,"Sorry, I haven't seen Planet of the Apes."
00:14:30,00:14:33,"Sorry, we're getting sidetracked."
00:14:33,00:14:36,"Yeah, so this is, it is like a reverse zoo,"
00:14:36,00:14:41,"sort of, in that it's an island called Decaio Santiago"
00:14:41,00:14:44,"off the coast of Puerto Rico, and it's a research centre."
00:14:44,00:14:46,It was started in the 1930s.
00:14:46,00:14:48,"Basically, it's full of monkeys,"
00:14:48,00:14:50,and humans are not allowed to go there
00:14:50,00:14:52,unless they are researchers.
00:14:52,00:14:54,And it's part of the discipline of it.
00:14:54,00:14:55,You really can't disturb the monkeys.
00:14:55,00:14:57,It has to be like they're living completely wildly.
00:14:57,00:14:59,They're resus macaques.
00:14:59,00:15:02,"And so, if you're going to go and eat a meal,"
00:15:02,00:15:03,you can't just do it out in the open
00:15:03,00:15:05,"where you could get in their way if they want to, you know,"
00:15:05,00:15:06,cross your path.
00:15:06,00:15:09,So they sit in a cage and eat their meal.
00:15:09,00:15:11,"Yeah, and the reason for it as well"
00:15:11,00:15:13,is because this is such a deadly island to humans
00:15:13,00:15:14,if you go there.
00:15:14,00:15:16,The reason it's a deadly island
00:15:16,00:15:19,"is because the monkeys there have herpes, a kind of herpes."
00:15:19,00:15:21,"Sorry, it's a deadly island,"
00:15:21,00:15:24,because the monkeys are not herpes.
00:15:24,00:15:29,"Darling, I'm about to tell you there's good news and bad news."
00:15:29,00:15:31,"Like, what's the good news?"
00:15:31,00:15:35,The good news is I didn't catch it from a person.
00:15:35,00:15:36,Does it count as cheating?
00:15:36,00:15:37,Catch what from a person?
00:15:37,00:15:39,"Well, there, that brings me on to the bad news."
00:15:39,00:15:40,"So, I have a question."
00:15:40,00:15:40,Yeah.
00:15:40,00:15:43,How am I going to catch herpes from a monkey?
00:15:43,00:15:46,Do I have to use the same toilet seat as them or what?
00:15:46,00:15:46,"Well, no."
00:15:46,00:15:47,Why is it dangerous?
00:15:47,00:15:49,It's dangerous because they might use you as a toilet.
00:15:49,00:15:52,So that's the problem.
00:15:52,00:15:55,They can transfer herpes via their urine.
00:15:55,00:15:56,"So if it makes contact with you,"
00:15:56,00:15:58,they can transfer it by their feces.
00:15:58,00:16:02,"And, you know, Reese's macaques love to throw feces at people."
00:16:02,00:16:03,"So, you know."
00:16:03,00:16:05,So if you do happen to catch herpes
00:16:05,00:16:08,"and you need to go to your partner and say that you've got it,"
00:16:08,00:16:11,you can say I caught it off a monkey throwing poo at me.
00:16:11,00:16:13,Exactly. There's a legit reason.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"Someone right now, I bet, is dealing with this dilemma"
00:16:15,00:16:16,on the way home.
00:16:16,00:16:18,You better hope you just film holiday to India
00:16:18,00:16:20,"because like me and you, Andy,"
00:16:20,00:16:23,"once both held a koala, didn't we?"
00:16:23,00:16:23,Yes.
00:16:23,00:16:25,And they're riddled with chlamydia.
00:16:25,00:16:25,Yeah.
00:16:25,00:16:28,So that would be a reasonable excuse for that as well.
00:16:28,00:16:30,You could come home with all the STIs after a tour.
00:16:30,00:16:33,Blame it on the local animals.
00:16:33,00:16:38,And the gonorrhea is from a millipede
00:16:38,00:16:40,that I met in San Diego.
00:16:40,00:16:41,Really nice legs.
00:16:41,00:16:43,Really nice legs.
00:16:43,00:16:47,"Just to wrap up, the reason that the cages are in place"
00:16:47,00:16:49,"is because for that reason, if you're eating your food,"
00:16:49,00:16:52,the monkeys will desperately want to try and get it off of you.
00:16:52,00:16:55,And so the cages are to protect you from getting herpes
00:16:55,00:16:56,while you're eating your meal.
00:16:56,00:16:58,OK.
00:16:58,00:16:59,The story of how they got there is amazing.
00:16:59,00:17:00,It's really cool.
00:17:00,00:17:04,So they were brought over from India in 1938.
00:17:04,00:17:06,"And it was for scientific purposes, wasn't it?"
00:17:06,00:17:08,"There was a scientist called Clarence Carpenter,"
00:17:08,00:17:12,"which is a great name, who was responsible for bringing that,"
00:17:12,00:17:15,wanted to study their social groups and such like.
00:17:15,00:17:17,But the second war was about to break out.
00:17:17,00:17:22,"So this ship with 500 monkeys on it, this must have been."
00:17:22,00:17:23,I want to see a movie about the journey.
00:17:23,00:17:24,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:24,00:17:25,"Because they wanted to go through the Suez Canal,"
00:17:25,00:17:28,but they couldn't because tensions were high
00:17:28,00:17:29,and the war was close to breaking out.
00:17:29,00:17:32,So they had to go around the southern tip of Africa instead.
00:17:32,00:17:34,And it turned into a much longer journey.
00:17:34,00:17:36,The voyage lasted way longer than it was meant to.
00:17:36,00:17:38,It lasted nearly 50 days.
00:17:38,00:17:40,And he was on board with them all the time.
00:17:40,00:17:40,He was.
00:17:40,00:17:42,And have you seen the one photo of him on board?
00:17:42,00:17:43,No.
00:17:43,00:17:45,It's so he's wearing a bathing suit.
00:17:45,00:17:46,It's quite odd.
00:17:46,00:17:48,I don't know if he was going for swims in the Pacific
00:17:48,00:17:49,on the way over.
00:17:49,00:17:50,"But yeah, Clarence Carpenter."
00:17:50,00:17:53,Begging for herpes in that kind of outfit.
00:17:53,00:17:54,I love that was a movie.
00:17:54,00:17:57,I'd love to see it as sort of like a William Dampier pirate
00:17:57,00:17:59,sort of trying to take over the ship.
00:17:59,00:18:02,That just turns out to have 500 monkeys on it.
00:18:02,00:18:05,So you've got the two staries kind of weaving in and out
00:18:05,00:18:06,of each other.
00:18:06,00:18:08,And it ends with a pirate attacking the monkeys
00:18:08,00:18:10,and catching herpes with the most
00:18:10,00:18:14,ambitious crossover in movie history.
00:18:14,00:18:16,"Gandhi was very much against them, wasn't he?"
00:18:16,00:18:17,What against them taking the monkeys?
00:18:17,00:18:19,Against them taking the monkeys.
00:18:19,00:18:22,Life magazine did some articles when it was established.
00:18:22,00:18:24,"And in one of them, they talked about Gandhi"
00:18:24,00:18:27,preaching against the exploitation of India's sacred
00:18:27,00:18:29,rhesus monkeys.
00:18:29,00:18:32,"And eventually they banned it, but not for quite a few years"
00:18:32,00:18:34,after Gandhi had died.
00:18:34,00:18:36,They used to have people living on there.
00:18:36,00:18:38,So the first caretakers of the monkeys
00:18:38,00:18:40,were this couple called the Tomolins.
00:18:40,00:18:43,And they kept one of them as a pet called Pijita.
00:18:43,00:18:45,"And yet the rest of them-- well, I"
00:18:45,00:18:47,"don't know what's better, being a pet of two humans"
00:18:47,00:18:49,and stroked constantly and fussed over by them
00:18:49,00:18:51,or just being led to live your life.
00:18:51,00:18:51,I don't know.
00:18:51,00:18:52,Left to live your life.
00:18:52,00:18:53,"But anyway, they--"
00:18:53,00:18:55,"That's a really philosophical question, isn't it?"
00:18:55,00:18:57,Isn't it one of the more amazing--
00:18:57,00:19:00,Are you happy with servitude or would you like freedom?
00:19:00,00:19:01,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:01,00:19:03,"When you put it like that, it's actually quite easy."
00:19:03,00:19:06,Look at the bars of the cage are made of gold.
00:19:06,00:19:08,And there's a nice bed in the cage.
00:19:08,00:19:10,And then put them on the other side.
00:19:10,00:19:11,Freedom.
00:19:11,00:19:12,Yeah.
00:19:12,00:19:15,Who of us can say what bars surround us?
00:19:15,00:19:16,"Well, Tate."
00:19:16,00:19:18,"You know, what compromises--"
00:19:18,00:19:21,I can say what bars surrounds me most not.
00:19:21,00:19:24,"So I think the monkeys all had this conference, this chat,"
00:19:24,00:19:26,and they nominated Pijita.
00:19:26,00:19:28,But Michael Tomlin sounded quite fun.
00:19:28,00:19:31,He would apparently regularly swim the one kilometer channel
00:19:31,00:19:32,back to the mainland.
00:19:32,00:19:34,Would drink a fifth of vodka.
00:19:34,00:19:36,I actually don't know what was a fifth of.
00:19:36,00:19:40,"Well, that's what Eminem says in that stand."
00:19:40,00:19:42,"He goes, I just drank a fifth of vodka."
00:19:42,00:19:43,Dare me to drive?
00:19:43,00:19:44,I think he says that.
00:19:44,00:19:45,Who says that?
00:19:45,00:19:45,Eminem.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Does he?
00:19:46,00:19:47,I think so.
00:19:47,00:19:49,So it's obviously enough that you're going to be drunk.
00:19:49,00:19:51,"I can't believe this guy, Michael Tomlin,"
00:19:51,00:19:54,is cooler than we are in that he gets Eminem slang.
00:19:54,00:19:55,"Well, that's on a monkey island."
00:19:55,00:19:56,He's way cooler than we are.
00:19:56,00:19:57,What are you talking about?
00:19:57,00:19:59,I think American listeners will be writing in droves
00:19:59,00:20:01,very shortly for explaining exactly how much for this.
00:20:01,00:20:03,"Just so we're clear, in the UK, we don't use that scheme."
00:20:03,00:20:04,We don't.
00:20:04,00:20:05,And this was in the 1930s.
00:20:05,00:20:06,"Anyway, apparently it wasn't even vodka."
00:20:06,00:20:08,People just said that because he was Russian.
00:20:08,00:20:09,He actually preferred rum and coke.
00:20:09,00:20:13,"So anyway, he'd swim over and then swim back, presumably"
00:20:13,00:20:15,hammered to the island where his wife was looking
00:20:15,00:20:16,after the pet monkey.
00:20:16,00:20:19,"These days, there are 2,000 Reese's macaques"
00:20:19,00:20:20,on Kyo's Santiago.
00:20:20,00:20:24,"But also, I find this so creepy, almost all of them"
00:20:24,00:20:25,have tattoos.
00:20:25,00:20:26,"Sorry, that's not the creepy bit."
00:20:26,00:20:27,It's a bit creepy.
00:20:27,00:20:27,It's a bit strange.
00:20:27,00:20:29,They haven't chosen to get a tattoo.
00:20:29,00:20:32,"That's even creepier, arguably."
00:20:32,00:20:32,Is it?
00:20:32,00:20:33,I don't know what's creepier.
00:20:33,00:20:34,What are they tattoos of?
00:20:34,00:20:34,They're not--
00:20:34,00:20:35,Scientific stuff.
00:20:35,00:20:37,"The eye, heart, lung."
00:20:37,00:20:38,"No, sorry."
00:20:38,00:20:40,Scientific stuff.
00:20:40,00:20:44,"Yeah, like an equals MC squared."
00:20:44,00:20:47,That's being like a vacuum is.
00:20:47,00:20:48,That kind of stuff.
00:20:48,00:20:50,"No, sorry, that's not the creepy bit."
00:20:50,00:20:51,The creepy bit is that the island is also
00:20:51,00:20:56,"home to a collection of 3,300 monkey skeletons."
00:20:56,00:20:56,"Oh, OK."
00:20:56,00:20:57,You mean the dead monkeys?
00:20:57,00:20:59,The dead monkeys.
00:20:59,00:21:00,"Well, yeah, obviously, they're the dead monkeys."
00:21:00,00:21:03,But what they didn't do is bring in the monkeys
00:21:03,00:21:05,"and say, what would they like around them?"
00:21:05,00:21:06,What kind of furnishings can we add?
00:21:06,00:21:10,"Like in a fish tank, you know, on a skull, off to the skull."
00:21:10,00:21:11,You never have a dead fish in a fish tank.
00:21:11,00:21:14,You never have a giant dead fish swimming in an bathtub.
00:21:14,00:21:15,But it is creepy.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"OK, so the question is, why did they not"
00:21:17,00:21:20,take away the skeletons or bury them or whatever?
00:21:20,00:21:22,"And I guess, well, they still need them to study them"
00:21:22,00:21:25,as in such a long-running research center now
00:21:25,00:21:27,"that you can study generations going back,"
00:21:27,00:21:29,and you can obviously study the bones of the monkeys
00:21:29,00:21:30,that lived there before.
00:21:30,00:21:33,But I think it would be creepy if they had a cool mausoleum
00:21:33,00:21:35,full of all the monkey skeletons.
00:21:35,00:21:36,But they don't have that.
00:21:36,00:21:37,"No, it depends."
00:21:37,00:21:40,I don't think mausoleum makers are allowed on the island.
00:21:40,00:21:42,I don't think that research project's going to get funding.
00:21:42,00:21:44,"But that's a good scene for the ""Dampier Monkey"" movie,"
00:21:44,00:21:47,where that's where the treasure's buried.
00:21:47,00:21:48,"It's like at the Goonies, you know, the cave."
00:21:48,00:21:50,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:50,00:21:51,Wow.
00:21:51,00:21:52,"So anyway, some food for thought."
00:21:52,00:21:53,Yeah.
00:21:53,00:21:55,Yeah.
00:21:55,00:21:58,"Obviously, these sick tattoos that the monkeys have,"
00:21:58,00:22:00,Einstein with his tongue out on his bicep.
00:22:00,00:22:04,"They do-- I mean, it is a really important island,"
00:22:04,00:22:06,because they do discover stuff.
00:22:06,00:22:08,We haven't just done monkeys there and sort of forgotten
00:22:08,00:22:09,about it.
00:22:09,00:22:11,And I think it's sort of like a rite of passage
00:22:11,00:22:12,if you're a monkey researcher.
00:22:12,00:22:14,"I reckon if you said to your monkey researcher mates,"
00:22:14,00:22:17,"hey, I'm doing a Chiosantiago research project,"
00:22:17,00:22:18,you'd be the coolest kid in town.
00:22:18,00:22:20,So some stuff they've discovered recently
00:22:20,00:22:23,"is that after any kind of trauma,"
00:22:23,00:22:25,scientists now think that we probably
00:22:25,00:22:29,"age by, apparently, up to eight years."
00:22:29,00:22:30,And this is based on--
00:22:30,00:22:31,"Oh, my god."
00:22:31,00:22:32,It's a spurious link.
00:22:32,00:22:34,But that's what scientists do.
00:22:34,00:22:37,"This is based on Hurricane Maria, that awful hurricane"
00:22:37,00:22:39,in 2017.
00:22:39,00:22:41,It killed a lot of people in Puerto Rico.
00:22:41,00:22:43,"Didn't kill any of the monkeys, but totally"
00:22:43,00:22:44,destroyed the island.
00:22:44,00:22:46,So all the trees were blown down.
00:22:46,00:22:47,There's no shade.
00:22:47,00:22:48,The average temperature on the island
00:22:48,00:22:50,rose by eight degrees.
00:22:50,00:22:51,"Oh, wow."
00:22:51,00:22:52,Rough.
00:22:52,00:22:54,Because they take blood from the monkeys all the time
00:22:54,00:22:56,for scientific reasons.
00:22:56,00:22:58,They had the samples before that they
00:22:58,00:22:59,could compare to the samples afterwards.
00:22:59,00:23:01,"And they looked at, like, lots of markers in the blood,"
00:23:01,00:23:03,"and the immune system, and the proteins."
00:23:03,00:23:06,And they found they showed signs of aging by about two years
00:23:06,00:23:07,just from that hurricane.
00:23:07,00:23:08,Wow.
00:23:08,00:23:10,Because there was a stress about it.
00:23:10,00:23:11,What in humans live much longer?
00:23:11,00:23:12,So they've sort of extrapolated.
00:23:12,00:23:13,"Inhuman years, apparently."
00:23:13,00:23:14,OK.
00:23:14,00:23:15,Yeah.
00:23:15,00:23:17,"There's another monkey island, which is in Liberia,"
00:23:17,00:23:19,"which is a bit sad, because it was a monkey island that"
00:23:19,00:23:21,didn't have any natural resources.
00:23:21,00:23:23,So the monkeys there had to be fed daily
00:23:23,00:23:25,by the researchers.
00:23:25,00:23:28,So they would bring bananas over every single day.
00:23:28,00:23:31,"But then in the 1990s, there was the war."
00:23:31,00:23:34,"And as a result, the research unit fled."
00:23:34,00:23:36,And these monkeys were just left on their own.
00:23:36,00:23:39,And so they had no one to feed them except one guy called
00:23:39,00:23:42,"Joseph Thomas, who, for the last 40 years,"
00:23:42,00:23:45,has been going twice a day to this island with bananas
00:23:45,00:23:50,and feeding these beautiful monkeys who come into the water
00:23:50,00:23:50,to him.
00:23:50,00:23:53,"And he knows them by names, like Mabel and so on."
00:23:53,00:23:57,"Mabel, Edith, Prudence, Aggie, you know, and all the life."
00:23:57,00:23:59,Very funny.
00:23:59,00:24:02,Did you hear how Joseph Thomas was recruited for the job?
00:24:02,00:24:03,I don't think so.
00:24:03,00:24:04,So this was in the '70s.
00:24:04,00:24:06,And this was another research island.
00:24:06,00:24:08,It was set up by a woman called Betsy Brotman.
00:24:08,00:24:11,And she was trying to find a vaccine for Hep B.
00:24:11,00:24:15,"And she actually did come away with a vaccine for Hep B,"
00:24:15,00:24:17,although she's since said it's a vaccine for Hep B.
00:24:17,00:24:21,And she actually did come away with a vaccine for Hep B.
00:24:21,00:24:23,Although she's since said it's actually
00:24:23,00:24:25,a bad idea to test on animals.
00:24:25,00:24:26,"But at the time, she set this research"
00:24:26,00:24:27,island up in the '70s.
00:24:27,00:24:30,"And I think it was her who recruited Joseph Thomas,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"because she went to him and said,"
00:24:32,00:24:33,I really want to learn to play tennis.
00:24:33,00:24:34,You're good at tennis.
00:24:34,00:24:37,I also need someone to help me on my monkey research.
00:24:37,00:24:40,"And they made a deal where if he taught her tennis,"
00:24:40,00:24:42,he would work on her monkey research.
00:24:42,00:24:44,"Now, I know that now."
00:24:44,00:24:47,He's on the very one-sided exchange.
00:24:47,00:24:48,"I tell you what, we'll do a deal."
00:24:48,00:24:50,"If you do all this work, I'll also"
00:24:50,00:24:52,let you do all this work.
00:24:52,00:24:54,It was basically that.
00:24:54,00:24:56,"You know, there is an island where"
00:24:56,00:25:00,you've got lots of potential tennis partners you can go to.
00:25:00,00:25:01,"Monkey tennis, anyone?"
00:25:01,00:25:09,"I've been to a monkey temple in, what was it, in Nepal."
00:25:09,00:25:11,And that's another place where there's just monkeys everywhere.
00:25:11,00:25:14,They're just kind of running around and stuff.
00:25:14,00:25:17,"And when I was there, you have to keep hold of your stuff"
00:25:17,00:25:20,"all the time, because I saw a monkey stealing someone's"
00:25:20,00:25:21,mobile phone and their bag.
00:25:21,00:25:24,And then running to the top of a huge building.
00:25:24,00:25:27,And then the guys who were kind of in charge
00:25:27,00:25:29,had to come with a big stick and prop him.
00:25:29,00:25:31,And then someone climbed up to get the mobile phone and stuff.
00:25:31,00:25:34,"Do you know, this is something Ethan, our fellow researcher,"
00:25:34,00:25:37,told me yesterday that they know that mobile phones are
00:25:37,00:25:40,"more valuable than, let's say, something less valuable."
00:25:40,00:25:43,I don't know if they know an iPhone is more valuable than a Nokia.
00:25:43,00:25:45,But they did a study at another monkey temple.
00:25:45,00:25:48,"Do you think you'd be completely safe if you went there, Anna?"
00:25:48,00:25:50,Because your phone was made in 1983.
00:25:50,00:25:52,I've got nothing desirable for the monkeys.
00:25:52,00:25:56,You actually wouldn't recognize your phone as a phone.
00:25:56,00:25:59,They did this amazing study over-- so they
00:25:59,00:26:03,filmed monkeys for 270 days in Bali at this one temple.
00:26:03,00:26:06,"And they realized that when monkeys take something off you,"
00:26:06,00:26:09,they negotiate with you for food in exchange for it.
00:26:09,00:26:11,"So they take your phone, and then if you give them two bananas,"
00:26:11,00:26:12,"they give it back, whatever."
00:26:12,00:26:14,"And by watching them, they realized"
00:26:14,00:26:17,"that the higher the value of the item, if they're still"
00:26:17,00:26:18,"on a phone rather than a camera case,"
00:26:18,00:26:21,then they'll barter for more bananas.
00:26:21,00:26:22,Wow.
00:26:22,00:26:23,That's really clever.
00:26:23,00:26:24,"It's really good, isn't it?"
00:26:24,00:26:25,That's incredible.
00:26:25,00:26:26,Terrifying.
00:26:26,00:26:28,Have you guys heard of Snake Island?
00:26:28,00:26:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:29,00:26:29,Where is that?
00:26:29,00:26:31,It's off the coast of Brazil.
00:26:31,00:26:35,And it's called Ilha da Queimada Grande.
00:26:35,00:26:38,"And it's completely dominated by a special kind of snake,"
00:26:38,00:26:40,"a special kind of snake, a particular kind of snake."
00:26:40,00:26:42,They're golden lancehead pit vipers.
00:26:42,00:26:43,"Oh, gosh."
00:26:43,00:26:45,"They sound scary and dangerous, maybe."
00:26:45,00:26:46,They are dangerous.
00:26:46,00:26:48,They're venomous.
00:26:48,00:26:51,Their venom melts the flesh that they bite into.
00:26:51,00:26:53,And they evolved venom to incapacitate and kill
00:26:53,00:26:55,the seabirds that land on the island.
00:26:55,00:26:57,They are not nice snakes.
00:26:57,00:26:59,"They can climb trees, which helps them"
00:26:59,00:27:01,to eat the birds that they love to feed on.
00:27:01,00:27:05,"And on this island, there is about one snake per square meter."
00:27:05,00:27:05,Wow.
00:27:05,00:27:06,What?
00:27:06,00:27:07,So you--
00:27:07,00:27:07,Yeah.
00:27:07,00:27:08,"Oh, my god."
00:27:08,00:27:10,"A lot of them will be in the same square meter, though,"
00:27:10,00:27:11,right?
00:27:11,00:27:11,Yeah.
00:27:11,00:27:12,"Yeah, yeah, that's true."
00:27:12,00:27:13,Even so.
00:27:13,00:27:15,"It's not one every square meter, but nonetheless."
00:27:15,00:27:18,They're not perfectly arranged like on a chess board.
00:27:18,00:27:20,"They're playing with huge island wide gamers, snakes,"
00:27:20,00:27:21,and ladders.
00:27:21,00:27:22,"Yeah, yeah, it's very hard to win."
00:27:22,00:27:25,It just sounds completely terrifying.
00:27:25,00:27:27,Why would you stay there if you were a bird?
00:27:27,00:27:29,"Mike, Mike Wright, what are you doing?"
00:27:29,00:27:31,I don't think they're reading TripAdvisor.
00:27:31,00:27:32,"I think, you know, I'll risk it."
00:27:32,00:27:34,"Like, they're just flying and they end up there."
00:27:34,00:27:36,"Yeah, but get back."
00:27:36,00:27:37,Tell the others.
00:27:37,00:27:39,I've been to a rabbit island.
00:27:39,00:27:39,Have you?
00:27:39,00:27:41,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:41,00:27:44,"Near Hiroshima, it's like just an island full of rabbits."
00:27:44,00:27:44,Wow.
00:27:44,00:27:46,It's not a research island.
00:27:46,00:27:47,There's just loads of rabbits there.
00:27:47,00:27:51,"In Sydney, where I live, we used to have a rabbit problem"
00:27:51,00:27:53,down in the northern reaches Palm Beach
00:27:53,00:27:54,and used to drive down at night.
00:27:54,00:27:57,And you'd put the headlights on of the car at high beam
00:27:57,00:28:00,and you would just see what were in the daytime empty fields
00:28:00,00:28:02,just packed like they're at Glastonbury watching.
00:28:02,00:28:04,"It's really, honestly, it's quite scary"
00:28:04,00:28:08,because you walk down the street in this Japanese island
00:28:08,00:28:10,and the rabbits just follow you because they
00:28:10,00:28:11,used to be in fed by tourists.
00:28:11,00:28:12,"Oh, no."
00:28:12,00:28:15,And so you sort of turn around and there's 20 rabbits behind you
00:28:15,00:28:17,and you kind of walk a bit faster
00:28:17,00:28:19,and you turn around and there's 30 rabbits behind you.
00:28:19,00:28:20,That's really scary.
00:28:20,00:28:21,That is a good horror film.
00:28:21,00:28:22,What STI did you get up there?
00:28:22,00:28:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:26,00:28:31,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:28:31,00:28:34,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:28:34,00:28:38,"OK, my fact this week is that in 14th century Italy,"
00:28:38,00:28:41,"if you wanted to insult a nearby city,"
00:28:41,00:28:42,you would send all your prostitutes
00:28:42,00:28:47,to take part in a running race around their walls.
00:28:47,00:28:49,I didn't have any prostitutes.
00:28:49,00:28:53,"Well, you've just been in a war, probably, with that city."
00:28:53,00:28:56,"You probably picked up a few on the way, is the truth."
00:28:56,00:29:00,You didn't know I was into that.
00:29:00,00:29:03,So I saw this in a book called Running Through the Ages
00:29:03,00:29:07,"by Edward Sears, and we're talking so Middle Ages Italy."
00:29:07,00:29:10,You've got loads of different areas
00:29:10,00:29:11,owned by different peoples.
00:29:11,00:29:14,"You've got Papal States, you've got Sicily,"
00:29:14,00:29:17,"but then you've got places like Florence, Pisa, Siena, Luca,"
00:29:17,00:29:21,"Milan, Genoa, all those kind of city states, you would say."
00:29:21,00:29:24,"And from around the 13th century, for about 400 years,"
00:29:24,00:29:27,we seem to have this really odd tradition
00:29:27,00:29:30,"of whenever you're battling with another city,"
00:29:30,00:29:32,"or you've beaten them and you want to celebrate that,"
00:29:32,00:29:35,"or you just want to stick it to them,"
00:29:35,00:29:37,you would have a running race around their town.
00:29:37,00:29:38,And it's so weird.
00:29:38,00:29:40,"And there were lots of different versions of this,"
00:29:40,00:29:42,but one of the biggest insults was
00:29:42,00:29:45,"you would get a load of mules or donkeys,"
00:29:45,00:29:47,"and then you would get all your sex workers,"
00:29:47,00:29:49,either from your city or ones that you picked up
00:29:49,00:29:52,"through the war, and you would just get them to race around."
00:29:52,00:29:56,"- Yeah, it did sound a bit like, 'cause armies,"
00:29:56,00:29:58,"as you say, they would gather the sex workers"
00:29:58,00:30:01,and they would bring them along for the battles even.
00:30:01,00:30:02,"You know, if the armies were facing off,"
00:30:02,00:30:05,they would have them do races sort of in the front.
00:30:05,00:30:08,"And they said, that's why they're here, darling."
00:30:08,00:30:11,- That's why we brought them for the racing.
00:30:11,00:30:12,- Do you think this is all fake news?
00:30:12,00:30:14,- I do. - This isn't happening at all.
00:30:14,00:30:16,The wives turned up to surprise their husbands one day.
00:30:16,00:30:18,- We came for the races.
00:30:18,00:30:19,- Shit.
00:30:19,00:30:20,"- The point of it, as far as I can tell,"
00:30:20,00:30:22,is that it was a big collective screw you
00:30:22,00:30:23,to the other city that you're--
00:30:23,00:30:24,- That's it.
00:30:24,00:30:25,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:30:25,00:30:28,And so they would do loads of different things.
00:30:28,00:30:29,"So one of the things they did,"
00:30:29,00:30:30,"they would gather outside the city,"
00:30:30,00:30:32,"so you gathered outside the opposing city state,"
00:30:32,00:30:35,"then you would find the oldest tree in the area,"
00:30:35,00:30:38,"and you cut it down, which is a symbolic castration,"
00:30:38,00:30:40,"apparently, I know."
00:30:40,00:30:42,And then they put the tree on a wagon
00:30:42,00:30:43,"and wheel it up to the city,"
00:30:43,00:30:45,"like just really up close, like look,"
00:30:45,00:30:46,that was your tree.
00:30:46,00:30:47,"- Look, this is your penis."
00:30:47,00:30:48,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:30:48,00:30:50,"And then they would go to the stump of the tree,"
00:30:50,00:30:53,and they would start minting coins on the stump.
00:30:53,00:30:54,- What?
00:30:54,00:30:55,"- I know, this is completely--"
00:30:55,00:30:57,- But the base of your castrated penis.
00:30:57,00:30:58,- We're gonna make coins.
00:30:58,00:30:59,"And then basically, what they were saying was,"
00:30:59,00:31:01,we're gonna change the currency that you operate in.
00:31:01,00:31:02,We're minting coins.
00:31:02,00:31:05,"Some of the coins would, I think, depict"
00:31:05,00:31:08,a picture of someone minting a coin on your tree.
00:31:08,00:31:11,"Yeah, but it was this whole--"
00:31:11,00:31:13,"- I think they'd show them being vanquished, wouldn't they?"
00:31:13,00:31:15,Or they'd show humiliating scenes
00:31:15,00:31:16,"for the enemy, these coins."
00:31:16,00:31:18,But the tree thing does imply
00:31:18,00:31:19,that there's a lot of explaining to do
00:31:19,00:31:21,when you show them the tree in the city.
00:31:21,00:31:24,"There you have to say, ""This is your oldest tree, guys."""
00:31:24,00:31:25,"They go, ""Oh, is it? Okay."""
00:31:25,00:31:26,- We couldn't tell which was your oldest tree.
00:31:26,00:31:28,We counted the rings.
00:31:28,00:31:29,We think it's pretty old.
00:31:29,00:31:31,"It's, I mean, it was your tallest tree,"
00:31:31,00:31:34,but that might have been a different breed.
00:31:34,00:31:36,"Actually, that was, ""Shut up, shut up!"""
00:31:36,00:31:38,"- And then one of them says, ""Okay, so."""
00:31:38,00:31:41,"And then you have to say, ""No, but metaphorically,"
00:31:41,00:31:43,"""it represents us castracing you."""
00:31:43,00:31:45,I don't know how upset you're gonna be.
00:31:45,00:31:46,This is starving.
00:31:46,00:31:49,"- Also, are you yelling to the top of the guys on the wall?"
00:31:49,00:31:51,It's a hell of a complicated conversation.
00:31:51,00:31:54,- We're sending messages on paper aeroplanes over the wall.
00:31:54,00:31:56,"- Look, forget the penis thing."
00:31:56,00:31:57,We're talking about the coins now.
00:31:57,00:32:00,"It doesn't matter about the penis thing, all right?"
00:32:00,00:32:01,Move on.
00:32:01,00:32:02,"- All right, raise the prostitutes."
00:32:02,00:32:05,"- Yeah, release the prostitute."
00:32:05,00:32:06,"- Well, the thing with the prostitutes"
00:32:06,00:32:07,is it was slightly more literal
00:32:07,00:32:11,"in that they would often race around land in the city even,"
00:32:11,00:32:13,"and so that you're basically saying,"
00:32:13,00:32:15,"""We can do what we want around here."""
00:32:15,00:32:17,"You know what, you think that you own this place,"
00:32:17,00:32:19,"we can run our prostitutes through, yeah."
00:32:19,00:32:21,- I read an account of the prostitute races
00:32:21,00:32:25,not being just for when you're sieging and at battle.
00:32:25,00:32:27,You would do it in generally around town.
00:32:27,00:32:30,"So like, there would be kings who would use them"
00:32:30,00:32:31,"to do it as a display,"
00:32:31,00:32:34,just to show a sort of minority of society
00:32:34,00:32:36,doing something a bit derogatory.
00:32:36,00:32:37,- Humiliating.
00:32:37,00:32:39,"- Yeah, just to sort of push the point of like,"
00:32:39,00:32:41,"""I'm the king and I'm running this place."""
00:32:41,00:32:43,"And what's interesting about it is,"
00:32:43,00:32:44,so there was one that was done
00:32:44,00:32:47,where the race would end up at St. Peter's Square.
00:32:47,00:32:48,"- Well, Rome."
00:32:48,00:32:50,"- Yeah, and so it was done there."
00:32:50,00:32:51,This is in the 1500s.
00:32:51,00:32:52,- You don't get that these days.
00:32:52,00:32:54,"I don't know if you've been to St. Peter's Square, but."
00:32:54,00:32:56,- The Pope is not gonna like that.
00:32:56,00:32:59,- So this is 1503 and it wasn't just prostitutes
00:32:59,00:33:01,who were part of the race.
00:33:01,00:33:03,"It was, you know, elderly people were in it,"
00:33:03,00:33:04,children were in it as well.
00:33:04,00:33:05,"They would all be naked,"
00:33:05,00:33:08,but the prostitutes would be wearing underwear.
00:33:08,00:33:09,It's very odd.
00:33:09,00:33:10,"- Underwear, very racy in those days,"
00:33:10,00:33:12,"wasn't it, underwear, I think."
00:33:12,00:33:15,- More racy than having your genitals hanging out.
00:33:15,00:33:17,- I believe because a lot of people
00:33:17,00:33:18,didn't really wear underwear.
00:33:18,00:33:19,"I'm going off memory here,"
00:33:19,00:33:20,but a lot of people didn't wear underwear.
00:33:20,00:33:22,But prostitutes would wear them
00:33:22,00:33:24,"because it's, you know, a nice bit of,"
00:33:24,00:33:25,"ooh, look what might be in there."
00:33:25,00:33:28,"- Scantily cladded saucier than nude, you know."
00:33:28,00:33:29,- Yeah.
00:33:29,00:33:30,- It depends on context.
00:33:30,00:33:32,"- It does, but you know, Adam and Eve,"
00:33:32,00:33:34,"just innocent, pure, first people alive."
00:33:34,00:33:36,"Adam and Eve wearing a kind of,"
00:33:36,00:33:39,it's kind of thongs made of leaves.
00:33:39,00:33:39,- Suddenly sexy.
00:33:39,00:33:40,- Yeah.
00:33:40,00:33:41,- And that was the problem.
00:33:41,00:33:42,- Yeah.
00:33:42,00:33:43,- Yeah.
00:33:43,00:33:44,- Using the snake as a garser.
00:33:44,00:33:45,- Yeah.
00:33:45,00:33:45,- That's a sexy thing now.
00:33:45,00:33:47,"- Well, it depends if it's one of those pit vipers."
00:33:47,00:33:48,(laughing)
00:33:48,00:33:49,"- Yeah, Adam and Eve."
00:33:49,00:33:49,- Fiction melty.
00:33:49,00:33:52,(laughing)
00:33:52,00:33:54,- So they weren't even hot.
00:33:54,00:33:55,They were just naked.
00:33:55,00:33:56,Or even half-naked.
00:33:56,00:33:57,"'Cause they were,"
00:33:57,00:33:59,people do seem to be described as half-naked a lot.
00:33:59,00:34:00,- Yeah.
00:34:00,00:34:00,- Doing it.
00:34:00,00:34:01,- Sometimes.
00:34:01,00:34:02,"- And it's all too,"
00:34:02,00:34:06,"it's all just about insulting and humiliating, isn't it?"
00:34:06,00:34:07,And I would quite an interesting description
00:34:07,00:34:09,"of why this was so common in Italy,"
00:34:09,00:34:11,these taunting.
00:34:11,00:34:14,"And it's because obviously Italy wasn't Italy,"
00:34:14,00:34:16,the country until extremely recently.
00:34:16,00:34:17,It was just loads of city-states.
00:34:17,00:34:20,And so warfare was quite different to a lot of other places
00:34:20,00:34:22,because it was just city-states against each other.
00:34:22,00:34:24,So it wouldn't be there's like lots of action
00:34:24,00:34:26,on these big battlefields and seizing lots of territory.
00:34:26,00:34:28,It was pretty much just sitting there besieging a city.
00:34:28,00:34:32,So you just start doing nothing for months on end.
00:34:32,00:34:34,So you had to think of other things to do
00:34:34,00:34:35,to make them feel bad.
00:34:35,00:34:36,- Like a sports day.
00:34:36,00:34:37,- It's a sports day.
00:34:37,00:34:39,(laughing)
00:34:39,00:34:39,- Egg and a spin race.
00:34:39,00:34:41,Bring out the prostitutes.
00:34:41,00:34:43,- They should do a sack race.
00:34:43,00:34:44,'Cause you're trying to sack the city.
00:34:44,00:34:45,"- Yeah, nice."
00:34:45,00:34:46,- That's where it comes from.
00:34:46,00:34:49,- That feels like a trick you play as a besieged city.
00:34:49,00:34:51,Persuade them all to climb into sacks.
00:34:51,00:34:52,- Oh right.
00:34:52,00:34:53,Was that the original Trojan horse?
00:34:53,00:34:54,- That's the Trojan sack.
00:34:54,00:34:55,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:34:55,00:34:56,"- It's 5,000 sacks."
00:34:56,00:34:57,- Then left out the front.
00:34:57,00:35:00,(laughing)
00:35:00,00:35:03,The other really interesting thing in the source
00:35:03,00:35:06,"that you sent around, James, was about the ripples."
00:35:06,00:35:07,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:35:07,00:35:08,"- So I didn't know if you get,"
00:35:08,00:35:10,like the word rippled that we used today.
00:35:10,00:35:14,"So rippled is in, you know, like rude and raunchy."
00:35:14,00:35:15,A bit of a rippled joke.
00:35:15,00:35:19,"Rippleds back then were people in,"
00:35:19,00:35:21,"like low people in the army, seems like."
00:35:21,00:35:23,And they would do these races with the prostitutes.
00:35:23,00:35:26,Or I think they were sort of pimps as well sometimes.
00:35:26,00:35:27,"So they were, I guess, tasked"
00:35:27,00:35:30,with sourcing the prostitutes sometimes.
00:35:30,00:35:32,And they seemed to do kind of all the low stuff
00:35:32,00:35:35,"that other people, like the knights, wouldn't want to do."
00:35:35,00:35:37,So they would have to drop their pants in front of the enemy
00:35:37,00:35:38,and shout swear words.
00:35:38,00:35:40,"- Well, it's very hard to drop a suit of armor."
00:35:40,00:35:42,(laughing)
00:35:42,00:35:45,"- It's like Dongarees, you have to do it all over the shoulders."
00:35:45,00:35:47,It's so annoying going to a loo.
00:35:47,00:35:50,- So they'd shout swear words at the enemy
00:35:50,00:35:53,"and they would, they'd scale up the walls."
00:35:53,00:35:55,The responsibility was scaling up the walls
00:35:55,00:35:57,because they didn't really get given many good weapons.
00:35:57,00:35:58,"And the pillaging, a lot of the pillaging,"
00:35:58,00:36:00,"which is a bit un-gentlemanly,"
00:36:00,00:36:00,the rippleds would do that.
00:36:00,00:36:02,"- They were kind of like your first,"
00:36:02,00:36:05,"they were like cannon fodder slash first line of attack,"
00:36:05,00:36:07,"right? - Yeah, yeah."
00:36:07,00:36:08,"- But yeah, really interesting."
00:36:08,00:36:09,I did find it really interesting
00:36:09,00:36:11,that they would be the pillaging
00:36:11,00:36:12,because the knights couldn't really pillage
00:36:12,00:36:13,'cause you were a knight.
00:36:13,00:36:15,So you couldn't really do any of that stuff
00:36:15,00:36:16,or they could go in and they'd grab a load of stuff
00:36:16,00:36:18,"and then just gamble it away, wouldn't they?"
00:36:18,00:36:20,"- Yeah, which I'm surprised"
00:36:20,00:36:22,"because I think what it smoothed over,"
00:36:22,00:36:24,'cause I know that knights returned from warfare
00:36:24,00:36:26,"with a lot of stuff that they'd stolen,"
00:36:26,00:36:28,I reckon they had a sharp word with the rippleds
00:36:28,00:36:29,"after they'd done the pillaging and said,"
00:36:29,00:36:31,"""All right, hand some of that over."""
00:36:31,00:36:32,- Right? - I'm sure you're right.
00:36:32,00:36:32,- Surely. - Yeah.
00:36:32,00:36:35,- The rippleds were nicknamed the Knights of Shit.
00:36:35,00:36:37,(all laugh)
00:36:37,00:36:40,"They were just, yeah, they're just absolute base grunts"
00:36:40,00:36:41,"in the army, yeah."
00:36:41,00:36:43,"- Knights of Shit. - Darling, I've got a job."
00:36:43,00:36:44,"I'm a knight, is it?"
00:36:44,00:36:46,(all laugh)
00:36:46,00:36:47,I'm a knight.
00:36:47,00:36:50,- You definitely put the end of that in your business card.
00:36:50,00:36:51,The word knight will be very big.
00:36:51,00:36:55,(all laugh)
00:36:55,00:36:58,"The Yipang Palace is in China,"
00:36:58,00:37:02,"and there would be people, soldiers in armor,"
00:37:02,00:37:04,"who would kind of besieging the palace,"
00:37:04,00:37:07,and the people inside the palace would taunt them.
00:37:07,00:37:09,Why do you think they might do that?
00:37:09,00:37:12,To come towards the gates?
00:37:12,00:37:13,- Is it because they're taunting them
00:37:13,00:37:14,to get to the point
00:37:14,00:37:16,where they pour the boiling oil on their heads?
00:37:16,00:37:18,"- It's close to that, actually."
00:37:18,00:37:20,- Okay. - It's quite close.
00:37:20,00:37:21,- So the people inside are taunting the besieging
00:37:21,00:37:23,"forces of the palace. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:37:23,00:37:25,"- But it is getting them close, right?"
00:37:25,00:37:26,"Okay, so it's either gonna be like spikes"
00:37:26,00:37:28,"come up through the ground,"
00:37:28,00:37:31,"or they're gonna then say, ""Ha ha,"
00:37:31,00:37:33,the tree's actually that way.
00:37:33,00:37:34,"You've got miles to run."""
00:37:34,00:37:35,(all laugh)
00:37:35,00:37:36,- That's good.
00:37:36,00:37:39,- They're wearing iron armor.
00:37:39,00:37:40,"Oh, it's a magnet."
00:37:40,00:37:42,- It's a magnet. - What?
00:37:42,00:37:43,- The gate. - What?
00:37:43,00:37:44,- I kind of thought that was a joke.
00:37:44,00:37:45,- The gate. - What?
00:37:45,00:37:46,"- Is a magnet. - Oh, no!"
00:37:46,00:37:49,"- No, not strong enough to what, suck the meat."
00:37:49,00:37:50,(all laugh)
00:37:50,00:37:53,"- This is what the stories of the times say,"
00:37:53,00:37:55,"that their gates were made of lodestone,"
00:37:55,00:37:56,"which attracted iron,"
00:37:56,00:37:58,"and so whenever the soldiers came near it,"
00:37:58,00:38:00,they would kind of be all over the place.
00:38:00,00:38:02,They couldn't move properly and stuff like that.
00:38:02,00:38:03,"And so the people in the palace would go,"
00:38:03,00:38:05,"""Ah, fuck you."
00:38:05,00:38:06,"You can't even come close, can you?"""
00:38:06,00:38:09,"- God, so could you wake up in the morning one day,"
00:38:09,00:38:10,go outside your castle? - You just stuck on there.
00:38:10,00:38:13,"- Yeah, and a nighttime commando army"
00:38:13,00:38:16,who tried to take over and just plastered around the corner.
00:38:16,00:38:19,- Every morning you just scraped the nights off the door.
00:38:19,00:38:20,- Yeah.
00:38:20,00:38:22,"- It's not sticking them directly to it,"
00:38:22,00:38:25,which was actually your comedic version of that.
00:38:25,00:38:27,"Actually, it just makes it more difficult"
00:38:27,00:38:28,for them to run around.
00:38:28,00:38:30,"- Oh, wow, would it feel a bit soupy?"
00:38:30,00:38:31,- That's a suggestion.
00:38:31,00:38:33,"I mean, this actually happened."
00:38:33,00:38:35,"- Well, no, not here when you put two pencil rubbers"
00:38:35,00:38:37,and you face them as like a weird force in between.
00:38:37,00:38:40,- But there's no way this Chinese propagandist
00:38:40,00:38:42,"who was making this up about a thousand years ago or whatever,"
00:38:42,00:38:45,there's no way they actually had magnets strong enough
00:38:45,00:38:47,that an entire army starts crumbling.
00:38:47,00:38:48,"- I gotta say, I didn't think"
00:38:48,00:38:50,that the loadstone was a real thing.
00:38:50,00:38:53,"- Well, you can get magnetic magnetites, for instance."
00:38:53,00:38:55,What Chinese people would call loadstone
00:38:55,00:38:59,"in these accounts, we think probably was magnetite."
00:38:59,00:39:00,- Okay.
00:39:00,00:39:01,"- But it's interesting, then, if that came out"
00:39:01,00:39:03,"as a rumor of being truth,"
00:39:03,00:39:05,because then if you were approaching the castle
00:39:05,00:39:07,"and you had your armor on, you might take it off,"
00:39:07,00:39:09,thinking I don't want to get sucked up all the walls.
00:39:09,00:39:11,- You'd start just feeling a bit awkward
00:39:11,00:39:12,about whatever you were doing.
00:39:12,00:39:14,"You know, when you can't move anything right,"
00:39:14,00:39:17,"you know, just 'cause you're feeling embarrassed."
00:39:17,00:39:18,"You'd start thinking, oh, well, this is probably"
00:39:18,00:39:20,the magnetite making me move awkwardly.
00:39:20,00:39:22,- Like placebo. - And then move more awkwardly.
00:39:22,00:39:23,- What?
00:39:23,00:39:24,- Like a placebo effect. - Like a no-cebo.
00:39:24,00:39:26,"- Yeah, like a no-cebo. - Like a no-cebo."
00:39:26,00:39:27,"- Although I do like Dan's version better,"
00:39:27,00:39:29,"which is you're worried about it,"
00:39:29,00:39:31,you take your armor off and then you just get attached.
00:39:31,00:39:32,That's clever.
00:39:32,00:39:36,"- Oh, you must have read that story,"
00:39:36,00:39:37,but if anyone didn't read that story
00:39:37,00:39:39,"a few weeks ago at Hadrian's Wall,"
00:39:39,00:39:43,it was one of my favorite news stories in years.
00:39:43,00:39:45,"Please look it up, 'cause you need to see the visuals,"
00:39:45,00:39:47,"but basically, archeologists were digging around"
00:39:47,00:39:48,"at Hadrian's Wall recently,"
00:39:48,00:39:51,"and they found this volunteer, actually,"
00:39:51,00:39:54,volunteer-retired biochemist called Dylan Herbert
00:39:54,00:39:58,found a 40-centimeter-wide sort of block of stone
00:39:58,00:40:02,"with an engraving on it, which is a flawless cock and balls."
00:40:02,00:40:04,"Like, it looks stunning."
00:40:04,00:40:06,The best a 12-year-old boy could master.
00:40:06,00:40:11,"And underneath it, it has the word secondenous cacor,"
00:40:11,00:40:14,"which is like slang, secondenous the shitter,"
00:40:14,00:40:18,"just perfectly written there, 1700 years old."
00:40:18,00:40:20,"And that's there, secondenous, that's how he's remembered."
00:40:20,00:40:24,And the BBC article reported that the experts
00:40:24,00:40:26,who uncovered this believe the phallic image
00:40:26,00:40:29,alongside the quote adds to the force
00:40:29,00:40:30,of the written insults.
00:40:30,00:40:33,"- Undoubtedly, imagine that secondenous,"
00:40:33,00:40:35,"like, we don't know anything about this person, right?"
00:40:35,00:40:36,- We know one thing.
00:40:36,00:40:41,- That is the most successful bit of insulting in history.
00:40:41,00:40:44,- That's the dream of when you insult someone.
00:40:44,00:40:46,- That's great.
00:40:46,00:40:47,- Poor guy.
00:40:47,00:40:48,"The guy, actually, the guy who found it,"
00:40:48,00:40:50,"sorry, it sounds so fun finding it as well."
00:40:50,00:40:53,"This old guy said, ""Only when I removed the mud"
00:40:53,00:40:55,"""did I realize the full extent of what I'd uncovered."""
00:40:55,00:40:57,And I was absolutely delighted.
00:40:57,00:40:58,(all laughing)
00:40:58,00:41:01,(upbeat music)
00:41:01,00:41:06,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:41:06,00:41:07,And that is my fact.
00:41:07,00:41:09,My fact this week is that a member
00:41:09,00:41:13,"of the Romanov royal family, Prince Rostislav Romanov,"
00:41:13,00:41:16,lives in Hastings as a painter.
00:41:16,00:41:18,His friend and wife refer to him
00:41:18,00:41:21,as the artist formerly known as Prince.
00:41:21,00:41:23,- Brilliant.
00:41:23,00:41:23,- That's very funny.
00:41:23,00:41:25,- It's a wonderful little gag.
00:41:25,00:41:26,"- It doesn't work, does it?"
00:41:26,00:41:27,'Cause he's not been a prince.
00:41:27,00:41:28,"- Well, he--"
00:41:28,00:41:29,- The Romanovs were gone a long time
00:41:29,00:41:31,"before he was born, I'm guessing."
00:41:31,00:41:33,"- Yeah, but they were, absolutely."
00:41:33,00:41:37,But he and they still are trying to sort of suggest
00:41:37,00:41:38,that maybe one day they can return
00:41:38,00:41:40,to their keeping the titles and they keep it alive.
00:41:40,00:41:42,"- Okay, so is he technically a prince?"
00:41:42,00:41:44,"Does he call himself, does he style himself as a prince?"
00:41:44,00:41:45,"- Yeah, he does."
00:41:45,00:41:46,I think he does interviews as a prince.
00:41:46,00:41:48,He talks about the royal family in exile.
00:41:48,00:41:53,They have as part of the Romanov surviving family ahead
00:41:53,00:41:56,who would be the heir apparent to any return
00:41:56,00:41:57,that would be made of the family.
00:41:57,00:41:59,"So yeah, I would say he is a prince."
00:41:59,00:42:01,So he was born overseas from Russia.
00:42:01,00:42:04,All of the Romanov family had to leave.
00:42:04,00:42:07,"And as a result, none of them have ever lived within Russia."
00:42:07,00:42:09,Apart from the ones who were brutally murdered
00:42:09,00:42:11,"by the Bolsheviks, of course."
00:42:11,00:42:12,"- Yeah, they're still there."
00:42:12,00:42:13,"- It's still leaving, isn't it?"
00:42:13,00:42:16,(all laughing)
00:42:16,00:42:18,"- Nowadays, he finds himself living in Hastings"
00:42:18,00:42:19,where he is an artist.
00:42:19,00:42:21,You can go on his Instagram account.
00:42:21,00:42:23,"I like his art actually, it's pretty fun."
00:42:23,00:42:23,- Oh yeah.
00:42:23,00:42:26,"- And yeah, and he does interviews occasionally"
00:42:26,00:42:28,to talk about his relationship with the family
00:42:28,00:42:29,and what's gonna happen one day
00:42:29,00:42:31,and how they might return and so on.
00:42:31,00:42:33,- Is he plotting a comeback?
00:42:33,00:42:35,It's worth a try.
00:42:35,00:42:37,- I would say it's actually not worth a try.
00:42:37,00:42:39,"- I have to say, I would not be wanting"
00:42:39,00:42:40,"to invade Russia right now, I don't think."
00:42:40,00:42:44,"As an artist living in Hastings, I wouldn't back my chances."
00:42:44,00:42:45,"- Well, here's the thing."
00:42:45,00:42:46,There are attempts occasionally
00:42:46,00:42:47,to bring them back into power.
00:42:47,00:42:49,So we were just talking about monkey islands.
00:42:49,00:42:53,Someone actually tried to set up a Romanov island.
00:42:53,00:42:56,And this was the Pacific Island of Kiribati.
00:42:56,00:42:59,"And the idea was that they wanted to take over this island,"
00:42:59,00:43:01,turn it into a sort of a resort.
00:43:01,00:43:05,"But they said, could we revitalize the royal family"
00:43:05,00:43:06,and have them rule over here?
00:43:06,00:43:08,- So they tried to have monkey island.
00:43:08,00:43:09,- It was a Russian MP.
00:43:09,00:43:11,"Yeah, he was called Anton Bakov."
00:43:11,00:43:15,"And he, it was quite critical of the Putin government."
00:43:15,00:43:16,"- And Putin said, ""Bakov."""
00:43:16,00:43:20,(all laughing)
00:43:20,00:43:22,"- Yeah, and he wanted three islands."
00:43:22,00:43:23,They were uninhabited.
00:43:23,00:43:24,So they would have been a great place
00:43:24,00:43:26,to kickstart the whole Romanov dynasty again.
00:43:26,00:43:27,"And the islands were called Molden,"
00:43:27,00:43:29,Starbucks and Millennium.
00:43:29,00:43:29,- Starbucks.
00:43:29,00:43:31,- I know.
00:43:31,00:43:32,I don't know why.
00:43:32,00:43:32,- I mean--
00:43:32,00:43:34,- No big thing or the restaurant chain.
00:43:34,00:43:36,- You would think Moby Dick thing.
00:43:36,00:43:37,"- And also, can we just pick up on Anna"
00:43:37,00:43:39,calling Starbucks a restaurant chain?
00:43:39,00:43:40,(all laughing)
00:43:40,00:43:42,Says a lot about your standards.
00:43:42,00:43:45,"Oh, Anna's taken me to a restaurant tonight."
00:43:45,00:43:47,"Oh, great, I wonder which one."
00:43:47,00:43:49,- Just seven coffees for dinner.
00:43:49,00:43:50,- Yeah.
00:43:50,00:43:51,- Do they have?
00:43:51,00:43:52,"- No, he wanted to make kind of a micro nation."
00:43:52,00:43:54,But I think the Kiribati government refused.
00:43:54,00:43:56,"They said, ""Our sovereignty is not for sale."""
00:43:56,00:43:58,"- Well, he was also talking to the Gambia"
00:43:58,00:44:00,"and apparently had support of Yaya Jame,"
00:44:00,00:44:02,who was in charge of Gambia at the time.
00:44:02,00:44:05,And that was to construct some artificial islands
00:44:05,00:44:07,off the coast of the Gambia.
00:44:07,00:44:09,- Do we know what his plan is after?
00:44:09,00:44:11,I see that that bit is easy enough.
00:44:11,00:44:14,You go to a tiny island where no one lives
00:44:14,00:44:16,and you declare yourself a czar.
00:44:16,00:44:17,How are you gonna then go from there--
00:44:17,00:44:18,- It's a stepping stone.
00:44:18,00:44:19,- To ruling Russia.
00:44:19,00:44:20,- It's a stepping stone.
00:44:20,00:44:21,You've gotta have a base.
00:44:21,00:44:23,"I would argue that perhaps his long-term,"
00:44:23,00:44:25,"might not even be to take over Russia,"
00:44:25,00:44:28,is just to have the Romanov Empire back.
00:44:28,00:44:29,"- Oh, it's a bit sad."
00:44:29,00:44:31,I imagine if you called back the Romanos
00:44:31,00:44:33,and showed them some crappy little rock in the Pacific
00:44:33,00:44:35,"and said, ""This is what your empire is."""
00:44:35,00:44:36,- He also bought some land
00:44:36,00:44:38,beside the Vatican in Montenegro.
00:44:38,00:44:41,So he's trying it in loads of different countries.
00:44:41,00:44:42,- Nice.
00:44:42,00:44:43,I like that.
00:44:43,00:44:43,"It's like risk, you know?"
00:44:43,00:44:45,You just plot yourself and it looks like
00:44:45,00:44:46,nothing's going on and then suddenly
00:44:46,00:44:49,a couple of moves and you've taken over the world.
00:44:49,00:44:51,- I don't believe you ever won a game of risk.
00:44:51,00:44:53,(all laughing)
00:44:53,00:44:55,- Dan is playing risk control and negotiating
00:44:55,00:44:58,for three uninhabited islands in Kyrgyzstan.
00:44:58,00:45:01,(all laughing)
00:45:03,00:45:06,"- Yeah, Prince Philip, linked to the Romanovs."
00:45:06,00:45:06,- Yeah.
00:45:06,00:45:07,"- In fact, so linked to the Romanovs"
00:45:07,00:45:09,"because when his parents got married,"
00:45:09,00:45:11,"Tsar Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia,"
00:45:11,00:45:15,was at the wedding and his great aunt Ella became a nun.
00:45:15,00:45:17,Prince Philip's great aunt Ella became a nun
00:45:17,00:45:19,"and after her death, became a saint."
00:45:19,00:45:21,And they were always rather proud
00:45:21,00:45:22,that they had a saint in the family.
00:45:22,00:45:23,I think it's fair enough.
00:45:23,00:45:25,"- Yeah, do we know what were her miracles?"
00:45:25,00:45:26,- Saintly moves.
00:45:26,00:45:27,I don't know what her miracles were.
00:45:27,00:45:28,"No, no, no."
00:45:28,00:45:29,That's all I know.
00:45:29,00:45:31,"- But Philip was used recently, wasn't he?"
00:45:31,00:45:33,Just before his death for a blood sample
00:45:33,00:45:36,to confirm the identity of what was it?
00:45:36,00:45:40,"- Yes, it was, bones of the Romanovs were contested"
00:45:40,00:45:41,and the scientists were trying to work out
00:45:41,00:45:43,whether they really were the Romanovs family.
00:45:43,00:45:45,- So they were in Katerinburg
00:45:45,00:45:47,and they were attacked by the Bolsheviks
00:45:47,00:45:50,"and they killed all of this family,"
00:45:50,00:45:53,but there was two of them who were supposedly breathing
00:45:53,00:45:55,when they took the bodies away
00:45:55,00:45:58,and there's a suggestion that those two had escaped.
00:45:58,00:46:00,"Now, when they found the bodies,"
00:46:00,00:46:02,they found all of them apart from these two bodies
00:46:02,00:46:03,and they tested them and they realized
00:46:03,00:46:04,"they were the Romanovs,"
00:46:04,00:46:07,"so that kind of gave fire to the conspiracy theory,"
00:46:07,00:46:10,but then they found another two bodies nearby
00:46:10,00:46:11,and that's the recent test that they did
00:46:11,00:46:14,and they found that they were related to the Romanovs.
00:46:14,00:46:17,- 'Cause one of the supposed princesses lived
00:46:17,00:46:18,"for many decades, didn't she?"
00:46:18,00:46:22,And always insisted that she was the surviving daughter.
00:46:22,00:46:23,"- Oh, there was a home."
00:46:23,00:46:24,- Anastasia.
00:46:24,00:46:26,"- Yeah, you don't want the kids' film."
00:46:26,00:46:27,"- I actually didn't know about that film,"
00:46:27,00:46:29,but Anastasia was one of these two people
00:46:29,00:46:32,and there was a hugs of someone called Anna Anderson
00:46:32,00:46:34,who claimed to be her.
00:46:34,00:46:35,"- Yeah, that's who I'm thinking."
00:46:35,00:46:37,"- And she got really famous, I think."
00:46:37,00:46:40,"- Yeah, but it turned out she wasn't."
00:46:40,00:46:41,- No.
00:46:41,00:46:41,- Right.
00:46:41,00:46:44,"- It is strange being descended from defunct royalty,"
00:46:44,00:46:45,isn't it?
00:46:45,00:46:46,"It's a very, very strange life."
00:46:46,00:46:48,"I was, there was an Oscar in Newsweek"
00:46:48,00:46:50,saying that London is actually the hot destination
00:46:50,00:46:52,"for most, as heaving is all worth."
00:46:52,00:46:53,- Throw a brick.
00:46:53,00:46:56,"- Well, I guess it's because they're like,"
00:46:56,00:46:58,we haven't retained a royal family.
00:46:58,00:47:00,- Most of the other countries sort of haven't.
00:47:00,00:47:03,- And it's also one of the really flashy royal families.
00:47:03,00:47:04,I think British people don't appreciate
00:47:04,00:47:09,how high investment the British royal family is compared
00:47:09,00:47:10,with the other European royal families.
00:47:10,00:47:13,"- Oh my God, they're so humble, yeah."
00:47:13,00:47:14,They've got a little cottage.
00:47:14,00:47:15,- But there are only about half a dozen monarchies
00:47:15,00:47:16,"left in Europe, I think."
00:47:16,00:47:19,And the British one is the sort of biggest ticket one.
00:47:19,00:47:19,- It's a biggie.
00:47:19,00:47:20,"- Yeah, it's a biggie."
00:47:20,00:47:21,- And people have been coming here
00:47:21,00:47:23,since people started opposing royal families.
00:47:23,00:47:25,"Obviously, it became very trendy"
00:47:25,00:47:26,from like pre-Second World War
00:47:26,00:47:28,"and then under communism, of course,"
00:47:28,00:47:29,"in Eastern Europe, they didn't love having the kings"
00:47:29,00:47:30,and queens there.
00:47:30,00:47:34,I think King Zog of Albania was stationed at the Ritz
00:47:34,00:47:37,for a long time after he was forced into exile.
00:47:37,00:47:40,"- Speaking of Zog, there is a crown prince"
00:47:40,00:47:42,of the Albanians today.
00:47:42,00:47:47,"That is Lika Anwar, Zog Reza Badawin, Mziziwe Zogu."
00:47:47,00:47:53,And this is the person that should the Albanian royal family
00:47:53,00:47:55,"ever come back, he will take over."
00:47:55,00:47:57,"It's quite a good name, isn't it?"
00:47:57,00:47:59,"- Obviously, him turning up at customs, basically,"
00:47:59,00:48:01,and opening his passport and then opening
00:48:01,00:48:03,the next wing of his passport.
00:48:03,00:48:04,(all laughing)
00:48:04,00:48:08,- Do you think he has a concertina thing that folds up?
00:48:08,00:48:09,- He has to wind it all.
00:48:09,00:48:10,- A tiny little trumpet.
00:48:10,00:48:11,(all laughing)
00:48:11,00:48:14,"- But it's really interesting because Anwar,"
00:48:14,00:48:17,"part of his name, is named after Anwar Sabat."
00:48:17,00:48:17,- Egypt.
00:48:17,00:48:21,"- Yeah, and Reza is named after Muhammad Reza Pahlavi,"
00:48:21,00:48:22,who was the last Shah of Iran.
00:48:22,00:48:23,"- In Iran, yeah."
00:48:23,00:48:26,- And so he's basically taken all of these names
00:48:26,00:48:28,from all the different deposed people
00:48:28,00:48:29,and then put them into his name.
00:48:29,00:48:31,"- Wow, like he has to be his parents have."
00:48:31,00:48:33,"He basically lives in Tehran or anyway,"
00:48:33,00:48:36,"capital of Albania, and he has a little royal residence."
00:48:36,00:48:39,"It's quite a nice house, but it's not a mansion,"
00:48:39,00:48:41,it's not a palace.
00:48:41,00:48:44,"And when he opens his gate, he has a little yard there,"
00:48:44,00:48:48,"and inside the yard, it's all the unwanted statues"
00:48:48,00:48:50,"from the last, you know, 100 years"
00:48:50,00:48:51,that they got rid of when communism fell.
00:48:51,00:48:53,So there's like a statue of Hodja
00:48:53,00:48:55,and a statue of Lenin and Stalin
00:48:55,00:48:56,and stuff like that.
00:48:56,00:48:59,It's funny that he's got them as the King Monkei.
00:48:59,00:49:01,"- Well, they're like, who's gonna want these?"
00:49:01,00:49:02,"And they look at his name and they're like,"
00:49:02,00:49:03,"oh, he'll want them."
00:49:03,00:49:04,"- But it's kind of, that's kind of sad, isn't it?"
00:49:04,00:49:06,"'Cause in a way, he's the final statue."
00:49:06,00:49:09,"You know, he's sort of purposeless."
00:49:09,00:49:11,"- One day he'll just walk through the garden and freeze,"
00:49:11,00:49:12,won't he?
00:49:12,00:49:12,- Oh my God.
00:49:12,00:49:13,- Oh my God.
00:49:13,00:49:14,- That's a nice fairy tale.
00:49:14,00:49:15,- That's really good.
00:49:15,00:49:16,"- Yeah, I really like, do you know"
00:49:16,00:49:19,of Princess Kamatari of Burundi?
00:49:19,00:49:23,"So she moved to France in the 1970s,"
00:49:23,00:49:25,and she did this because her father
00:49:25,00:49:26,was assassinated and then the King of Burundi
00:49:26,00:49:28,was assassinated in 1972.
00:49:28,00:49:31,"So she fled, she went to France,"
00:49:31,00:49:34,where she became the first ever black supermodel in France.
00:49:34,00:49:35,"- Oh, really?"
00:49:35,00:49:36,"- And there might have been others,"
00:49:36,00:49:37,but she was really the first one
00:49:37,00:49:38,who was going on the front of magazines.
00:49:38,00:49:39,"- Super famous, yeah."
00:49:39,00:49:40,"- Yeah, and so on."
00:49:40,00:49:42,And she says that obviously it was her connection
00:49:42,00:49:44,"to the royal family that got her the gig,"
00:49:44,00:49:46,because the magazines at the time
00:49:46,00:49:48,"were basically only putting on blonde hair,"
00:49:48,00:49:52,"blue eye models, but she was brought on as a princess."
00:49:52,00:49:53,"So she said, you know, I could have been black or blue"
00:49:53,00:49:55,"or a crocodile, they would have put me on"
00:49:55,00:49:56,because I was a princess.
00:49:56,00:49:58,And then people thought she was so beautiful
00:49:58,00:50:00,that she became an actual model.
00:50:00,00:50:02,"So she did that for years and years and years,"
00:50:02,00:50:04,but then she moved back to Burundi
00:50:04,00:50:05,"because she thought, you know what,"
00:50:05,00:50:07,I'm gonna run for president.
00:50:07,00:50:09,So she set up a big campaign
00:50:09,00:50:10,where she was gonna try and become
00:50:10,00:50:11,president of the country.
00:50:11,00:50:13,And I love that one of her priorities
00:50:13,00:50:15,as the presidential candidate was
00:50:15,00:50:17,to bring back the monarchy.
00:50:17,00:50:18,(laughing)
00:50:18,00:50:19,- That was like a pretty bit.
00:50:19,00:50:20,"- Well, that's good if you're open about it, I think."
00:50:20,00:50:21,- Yeah.
00:50:21,00:50:24,"- Yeah, so if you're obviously campaigning for it."
00:50:24,00:50:27,- I was just wondering what the weirdest fate
00:50:27,00:50:28,of a descendant was.
00:50:28,00:50:31,And I was reading about the daughter
00:50:31,00:50:33,"of Romanian King Michael I,"
00:50:33,00:50:35,who had to abdicate in 1947.
00:50:35,00:50:36,She's called Irina Walker.
00:50:36,00:50:41,"And in 2014, she was done for staging cockfights."
00:50:41,00:50:43,- Really?
00:50:43,00:50:44,"- That's her life now, yeah."
00:50:44,00:50:46,- Oh my God.
00:50:46,00:50:48,"- So when you say staging, you've just been putting them on."
00:50:48,00:50:50,You don't mean like fixing them.
00:50:50,00:50:52,"- No, but I think they're very often fixed."
00:50:52,00:50:55,"- Yeah, but that's another level of illegality."
00:50:55,00:50:57,It's not only when you do the cock fight.
00:50:57,00:50:59,(laughing)
00:50:59,00:51:00,- It wasn't even fair.
00:51:00,00:51:04,"- She's very successful at it, it sounded like."
00:51:04,00:51:06,She used to charge spectators $20 each.
00:51:06,00:51:07,She lives in Oregon.
00:51:07,00:51:09,"She lives in Irrigan, in Oregon."
00:51:09,00:51:09,"- Brilliant, stop it."
00:51:09,00:51:10,- Good stuff.
00:51:10,00:51:11,"- And what's her name, Irina?"
00:51:11,00:51:13,"- Irina, Irina in Irrigan, in Oregon."
00:51:13,00:51:15,(laughing)
00:51:15,00:51:18,"And yeah, she charges people to watch Rooster's fight"
00:51:18,00:51:20,with knives attached to their legs.
00:51:20,00:51:21,- Oh my goodness.
00:51:21,00:51:23,- And the winners would get up to 18 grand.
00:51:23,00:51:26,"- The Greek royal family, they were abolished in 1974."
00:51:26,00:51:28,So they were exiled overseas.
00:51:28,00:51:31,"And one of the princes, Prince Nicolaus of Greece,"
00:51:31,00:51:34,"was discovered in 1995,"
00:51:34,00:51:36,working under a pseudonym as a production assistant
00:51:36,00:51:37,for Fox News.
00:51:37,00:51:38,- Really?
00:51:38,00:51:40,- The channel.
00:51:40,00:51:41,"And yeah, so he'd been working there"
00:51:41,00:51:42,as this production assistant.
00:51:42,00:51:44,And the only reason he was outed is because they were doing
00:51:44,00:51:47,"a story about his brother, Prince Nicolaus' brother,"
00:51:47,00:51:50,"getting married, and they saw their standing"
00:51:50,00:51:52,"as one of the groomsmen, their production assistant."
00:51:52,00:51:53,- That's amazing.
00:51:53,00:51:54,"- They were like, ""What are you doing here?"""
00:51:54,00:51:55,"- Oh my God, that's incredible."
00:51:55,00:51:57,- Yeah.
00:51:57,00:51:59,"- I was reading about Crown Prince Otto,"
00:51:59,00:52:02,of the Austro-Hungarian emperor.
00:52:02,00:52:04,He would've been the Crown Prince of it.
00:52:04,00:52:06,"- Okay, is he current, is he alive?"
00:52:06,00:52:08,"- No, he died in 2011."
00:52:08,00:52:09,"At the edge of it, I think about '99."
00:52:09,00:52:11,It was really at old when he died.
00:52:11,00:52:13,So the Austro-Hungarian emperor was dissolved
00:52:13,00:52:16,"when he was, I think, about seven years old."
00:52:16,00:52:18,"But he was officially the King of Hungary in Bohemia,"
00:52:18,00:52:20,Grand Prince of Transylvania.
00:52:20,00:52:21,- That's a good one.
00:52:21,00:52:22,- It is a pretty good one.
00:52:22,00:52:24,"His name was Franz Josef Otto Robert,"
00:52:24,00:52:28,"Maria Anton Karl Max, Heinrich Sixtus Xavier,"
00:52:28,00:52:33,"Felix Renatis Ludwig, Guy N. Pius Ignatius."
00:52:33,00:52:34,- Was his dad Jacob Riesemann?
00:52:34,00:52:38,"Can I just say Maria in there is a weird one, isn't it?"
00:52:38,00:52:39,"- This is, I noticed that."
00:52:39,00:52:42,"I think I didn't read the full thing when I was,"
00:52:42,00:52:44,"I just can't be pasted in, when you're reading it out."
00:52:44,00:52:44,"It's like, what? - It gives me a surprise"
00:52:44,00:52:45,to me.
00:52:45,00:52:46,There's their excuse as well.
00:52:46,00:52:48,"- Also, I didn't fully read this one, were you?"
00:52:48,00:52:50,- But also he had Karl Max in his name.
00:52:50,00:52:51,- Karl Max?
00:52:51,00:52:52,- Really?
00:52:52,00:52:53,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:52:53,00:52:54,"But he, so he was, you know, seven years old,"
00:52:54,00:52:55,"the empire is dissolved,"
00:52:55,00:52:57,which he's the crown prince of technically.
00:52:57,00:52:59,"So, and he had to kind of rebuild his life."
00:52:59,00:53:01,"And he, you know, he learned seven languages."
00:53:01,00:53:04,"He became an MEP, which I find interesting."
00:53:04,00:53:04,- Really?
00:53:04,00:53:05,"- God, that was a fool from grace, isn't it?"
00:53:05,00:53:06,You're gonna be prince of an MEP.
00:53:06,00:53:08,"- That's a big ballot as well, isn't it?"
00:53:08,00:53:09,- Yeah.
00:53:09,00:53:10,- When you've got all of his name on.
00:53:10,00:53:11,(laughing)
00:53:11,00:53:12,- He actually got the votes
00:53:12,00:53:13,of about 17 different candidates.
00:53:13,00:53:15,They thought they were very different people.
00:53:15,00:53:16,- I'm gonna vote for Maria.
00:53:16,00:53:17,(laughing)
00:53:17,00:53:20,- And I love this bit of his history and his life.
00:53:20,00:53:22,So he had really interesting life.
00:53:22,00:53:27,"He helped organize the Pan-European Picnic of 1989,"
00:53:27,00:53:29,which is a little-known bit of the end of the Cold War.
00:53:29,00:53:32,And it was on the border between Austria and Hungary.
00:53:32,00:53:33,"So you've got, you know,"
00:53:33,00:53:34,Free Market West on one side
00:53:34,00:53:36,and Communists on the other in the East.
00:53:36,00:53:40,And thousands of people came and sort of gathered there
00:53:40,00:53:43,"to have a kind of cross-border picnic, as it were."
00:53:43,00:53:46,And then actually 600 East Germans just moved into Austria.
