00:00:02,00:00:04,"- Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode"
00:00:04,00:00:07,"of No Such Things A Fish, where we were joined by the legend."
00:00:07,00:00:10,"The national treasure already, I think,"
00:00:10,00:00:13,"but definitely future national treasure, Tom Allen."
00:00:13,00:00:15,"- That's right, Tom is absolutely fantastic"
00:00:15,00:00:15,as you're about to hear.
00:00:15,00:00:17,"He's a flanner, he's a man of out town."
00:00:17,00:00:19,"Among many other things, you might not think it"
00:00:19,00:00:21,"'cause he's so dapper, but he's also a gardener."
00:00:21,00:00:23,"- You might not think it 'cause he speaks so nicely,"
00:00:23,00:00:25,but he's also a podcaster.
00:00:25,00:00:25,(laughing)
00:00:25,00:00:30,"- And he has a new podcast out, it's called ""Pottering"" with Tom Allen,"
00:00:30,00:00:33,"and he gets a celebrity to his garden,"
00:00:33,00:00:37,"be it Nish Kumar, be it James A. Castor, be it Natalie Cassidy,"
00:00:37,00:00:39,and they talk about gardening.
00:00:39,00:00:42,"- It's lovely, and I think they do some gardening as well, actually."
00:00:42,00:00:46,"- He probably has some Natalie Cassidy Bagonias,"
00:00:46,00:00:49,"get some Nish Kumar, Asperd Distras."
00:00:49,00:00:51,"- Lovely, can James name a third plunge?"
00:00:51,00:00:54,"- Absolutely not, but if you want to hear Tom's podcast,"
00:00:54,00:00:56,"then go to wherever you get your podcast,"
00:00:56,00:00:58,"it's called ""Pottering"" with Tom Allen,"
00:00:58,00:00:59,"and it's absolutely fantastic,"
00:00:59,00:01:01,"but Andy, we have some more news."
00:01:01,00:01:03,"- That's right, the other thing to say is that,"
00:01:03,00:01:05,"in a week's time, we're gonna be doing the first"
00:01:05,00:01:07,ever Club Fish Quiz.
00:01:07,00:01:10,"Now, this is for people who've joined Club Fish"
00:01:10,00:01:12,"at the top tier, the friend of the podcast tier,"
00:01:12,00:01:16,"we are gonna be doing a quiz globally, I imagine."
00:01:16,00:01:18,"We suspect hundreds of thousands may be attending,"
00:01:18,00:01:21,"and you can be one of them, it's gonna be on Zoom,"
00:01:21,00:01:23,or an equivalent streaming platform.
00:01:23,00:01:24,"We've all been writing our questions,"
00:01:24,00:01:26,"we've been showing them to each other,"
00:01:26,00:01:27,"we've been coming up with silly games,"
00:01:27,00:01:29,it's gonna be so much fun.
00:01:29,00:01:32,So mark your diaries or your calendars
00:01:32,00:01:37,"for Friday, the 23rd of January, 7pm British time,"
00:01:37,00:01:38,"but if you're around the world,"
00:01:38,00:01:39,we'd love to see you there as well.
00:01:39,00:01:41,"- Gonna be so much fun, we can't wait to do it."
00:01:41,00:01:44,"But anyway, please enjoy this week's episode"
00:01:44,00:01:47,"of ""No Six Things A Fish"" with the incredible Tom Allen,"
00:01:47,00:01:48,on with the podcast.
00:01:48,00:01:49,- On with the show.
00:01:51,00:01:53,(upbeat music)
00:01:53,00:02:05,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:02:05,00:02:08,"of ""No Such Thing"" as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:02:08,00:02:11,coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.
00:02:11,00:02:13,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:02:13,00:02:16,"with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Tom Allen."
00:02:16,00:02:18,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:18,00:02:21,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:02:21,00:02:24,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:02:24,00:02:27,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Tom."
00:02:27,00:02:31,"- In September 1945, a small booklet was discovered"
00:02:31,00:02:34,"in the main offices of the third Reich in Berlin,"
00:02:34,00:02:37,"or Reich, if you're from southern Germany."
00:02:37,00:02:41,"In Berlin, it was a secret list of 2,820 British individuals"
00:02:41,00:02:42,who'd be rounded up in the event
00:02:42,00:02:46,"of a successful invasion, and Noel Coward found his name"
00:02:46,00:02:47,on page 34.
00:02:47,00:02:51,"- Oh, okay, why were they going after him?"
00:02:51,00:02:55,"- Well, firstly, I think anybody in an entertainment"
00:02:55,00:02:57,would be annoyed that they had to go so far.
00:02:57,00:02:58,(laughing)
00:02:58,00:02:59,- Mind your own name.
00:02:59,00:03:02,"- There's only one thing worse than being on the Nazis,"
00:03:02,00:03:03,deathless.
00:03:03,00:03:04,(laughing)
00:03:04,00:03:07,"- And that's not being on the, I can't believe"
00:03:07,00:03:10,you're quoting Oscar Wilde in a Noel Coward section.
00:03:10,00:03:12,"- Oh yeah, we'll get onto that."
00:03:12,00:03:15,"- Well, they just kind of crossed over"
00:03:15,00:03:20,"in a sort of Dalai Lama way, yeah, yeah."
00:03:20,00:03:20,- Is that what was he?
00:03:20,00:03:22,- Very Dalai Lama way.
00:03:22,00:03:26,- Have you ever looked at who died just before you were born?
00:03:26,00:03:27,"- No, I never had."
00:03:27,00:03:28,"- Oh, that's a funny question."
00:03:28,00:03:30,"- There was one of the popes, the one that was before"
00:03:30,00:03:34,"John Paul II, so I think it was, just before I was born,"
00:03:34,00:03:37,"you died, so I'm not saying anything else,"
00:03:37,00:03:39,"but I am Catholic, so."
00:03:39,00:03:41,- I think you could still do it as well.
00:03:41,00:03:42,- I can.
00:03:42,00:03:44,"- Well, no, I've been excommunicated, as we've said,"
00:03:44,00:03:44,but.
00:03:44,00:03:46,- But what a comeback story that would be for you.
00:03:46,00:03:48,"- Yeah, and actually the Pope."
00:03:48,00:03:49,- I can change the rules if I'm the Pope.
00:03:49,00:03:52,"- Yes, yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah."
00:03:52,00:03:54,- Let's get back to Noel Coward.
00:03:54,00:03:55,"- I know, I like that."
00:03:55,00:03:57,I was suddenly panicking about who died in 1983.
00:03:57,00:03:59,"- Yeah, lots."
00:03:59,00:04:03,"- Mount Batson, no, that was '70, late '70s."
00:04:03,00:04:05,"- Yes, Mount Batson was, I went straight through."
00:04:05,00:04:06,- I just got to see what this is.
00:04:06,00:04:08,(laughing)
00:04:08,00:04:10,- We should quickly say who Noel Coward is.
00:04:10,00:04:11,"Noel Coward, very famous way around."
00:04:11,00:04:13,"- Yes, I didn't bother to say that."
00:04:13,00:04:15,I just assumed all your listeners would know who he was.
00:04:15,00:04:17,"- Yeah, but you know better than anyone,"
00:04:17,00:04:19,"'cause you're part of the Noel Coward Society, so."
00:04:19,00:04:22,"- Well, I have been involved, but I, the, the,"
00:04:22,00:04:25,"Noel Coward, yeah, usually seen as a playwright"
00:04:25,00:04:29,"and a writer of songs, particularly Mad Dogs and Englishman."
00:04:29,00:04:33,"He was also an actor, musician, and an author,"
00:04:33,00:04:35,"as well, he wrote a novel."
00:04:35,00:04:39,"Well, he was wanted by the sinister Amst grubber,"
00:04:39,00:04:42,"V1, V1, G1, I don't know what,"
00:04:42,00:04:43,I don't know what that looked like.
00:04:43,00:04:44,- I was like a music channel in Germany.
00:04:44,00:04:48,"- Amst grubber, V1, G1, real common."
00:04:48,00:04:49,"A department, it was a department"
00:04:49,00:04:51,that evaluated intelligence material.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"Well, he was a, it turned out, a British spy,"
00:04:54,00:04:56,"and his cover had apparently been blown,"
00:04:56,00:04:57,"and if the war had gone differently,"
00:04:57,00:04:59,"well, the man known the world over further,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,"the song ""Don't Let's Be Be See to the Germans"""
00:05:01,00:05:04,could have ended his days in front of a firing squad.
00:05:04,00:05:05,- Wow.
00:05:05,00:05:08,"- So, yeah, and when the list was discovered,"
00:05:08,00:05:11,"amongst other people who the Nazis didn't like,"
00:05:11,00:05:12,"for various reasons,"
00:05:12,00:05:15,"and the author, Rebecca West, sent him a telegram"
00:05:15,00:05:19,"to say, ""My dear, the people who were to be seen dead with."""
00:05:19,00:05:22,"- Which I thought was very cool, that's very good."
00:05:22,00:05:23,"- This song, interestingly,"
00:05:23,00:05:26,"got him in a bit of trouble back home, didn't it?"
00:05:26,00:05:27,- Yeah.
00:05:27,00:05:27,- What was it called again?
00:05:27,00:05:29,"- It was called, ""Don't Let's Be Be See to the Germans."""
00:05:29,00:05:32,"- Yeah, so, came out during World War II."
00:05:32,00:05:33,It was a satire.
00:05:33,00:05:34,It was--
00:05:34,00:05:35,- It was signed by the BBC.
00:05:35,00:05:37,"- Exactly, because the satire didn't quite cross,"
00:05:37,00:05:38,as well as he hoped it would.
00:05:38,00:05:42,They thought that he was actually genuinely saying that.
00:05:42,00:05:44,"- I was excited about it, because I think it's the only thing"
00:05:44,00:05:47,that Noel Coward has in common with the prodigy
00:05:47,00:05:49,"I found there, songs ""Smack My Bitschup"","
00:05:49,00:05:52,which was also banned by the BBC.
00:05:52,00:05:54,"- Can you imagine him reading ""Smack My Bitschup"","
00:05:54,00:05:56,"Noel Coward, in his accent?"
00:05:56,00:05:57,- He'd have--
00:05:57,00:05:59,I think he'd have gustyed up the lyrics a bit.
00:05:59,00:06:00,He'd have made them cleverer.
00:06:00,00:06:02,(laughing)
00:06:02,00:06:05,"- But I always wondered how he got away with being a spy,"
00:06:05,00:06:07,"'cause he was so flamboyant, right?"
00:06:07,00:06:10,"It seems like, as a spy, you have to hide away a little bit."
00:06:10,00:06:15,"- Well, Radio 4 did a dramatized version of what he was like."
00:06:15,00:06:17,"I think a lot of it, as well, was propaganda work"
00:06:17,00:06:20,"in North America, obviously, the US."
00:06:20,00:06:24,"I think to Ghana support for getting on board with the war effort,"
00:06:24,00:06:26,which I know wasn't the case at the beginning.
00:06:26,00:06:30,"So I think he was seen as sort of a special envoy,"
00:06:30,00:06:31,"I suppose, as much as anything."
00:06:31,00:06:33,I don't think he was going behind enemy lines.
00:06:33,00:06:34,"- No, but I'm--"
00:06:34,00:06:35,- Hamburg.
00:06:35,00:06:38,- He'd been recruited even before the war started.
00:06:38,00:06:40,"I think there was someone called Sir Robin Vancetart,"
00:06:40,00:06:41,who was running--
00:06:41,00:06:42,"- Sounds German, actually."
00:06:42,00:06:43,"- Yes, but he was at the foreign office"
00:06:43,00:06:45,and he was recruiting various people
00:06:45,00:06:49,"to go about their business in Europe, quite successful people,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,"and then report back on the national mood,"
00:06:51,00:06:55,"what people were saying, just sort of soft intelligence,"
00:06:55,00:06:56,"as it were, not, you know."
00:06:56,00:06:58,You don't need to observe this tank column
00:06:58,00:07:01,"where it's going, this ball bearings factory."
00:07:01,00:07:03,It was just like what you're hearing in social conversations.
00:07:03,00:07:06,And I think Howard was sacked partly
00:07:06,00:07:09,"because he was too public in his maneuverings,"
00:07:09,00:07:11,"and also because everyone looked at him,"
00:07:11,00:07:12,"and this is after the war started,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,and they just thought we've just got to a load of parties
00:07:14,00:07:17,"and man, happening, you're really letting the side down."
00:07:17,00:07:19,"And actually he was doing the war work, like he was doing."
00:07:19,00:07:22,"- He was, he was really completely shamed about it, I think."
00:07:22,00:07:23,- Yeah.
00:07:23,00:07:24,- I think the Daily Mail covered about it.
00:07:24,00:07:25,- Oh.
00:07:25,00:07:27,"- And said like, they said outrage, going over there,"
00:07:27,00:07:30,"spitting all this money, with public money, going to parties."
00:07:30,00:07:32,"- The Daily Mail, who's departed,"
00:07:32,00:07:33,"and all of that, so he's just before the war."
00:07:33,00:07:34,- Ooh.
00:07:34,00:07:35,"- Well, it might be, yeah, I mean."
00:07:35,00:07:36,- Yeah.
00:07:36,00:07:37,"- But I should check, I should check,"
00:07:37,00:07:39,it was the Daily Mail that it's out there and I'm lovely.
00:07:39,00:07:42,"- Well, he used to, again, trouble with the daily express."
00:07:42,00:07:44,"- Yeah, and actually this is another war connection."
00:07:44,00:07:47,So he wrote the screenplay and started a movie
00:07:47,00:07:51,"called In Which We Serve, which was a really good movie,"
00:07:51,00:07:53,often got used to get them morale up
00:07:53,00:07:55,and show how the war was going.
00:07:55,00:07:59,And he kind of based the character on your past life.
00:07:59,00:08:00,- Not that.
00:08:00,00:08:03,"- Yeah, so he consulted with him and that was largely part of it."
00:08:03,00:08:04,Can we say who Matt Baffin was again?
00:08:04,00:08:05,"- Sorry, yeah."
00:08:05,00:08:09,"- He was, oh, oh, Matt Baffin, I think."
00:08:09,00:08:10,"- Oh, Matt Baffin."
00:08:10,00:08:12,"- Lord, Matt Baffin, wasn't he?"
00:08:12,00:08:13,"- Oh, yeah."
00:08:13,00:08:18,"- And he was, he was Prince Philip's uncle by loose connection."
00:08:18,00:08:21,I haven't researched it.
00:08:21,00:08:22,"- By big, the brother of his mother?"
00:08:22,00:08:25,"Or, yeah, so it's kind of like loosely unclear to him."
00:08:25,00:08:28,"- Is it like one of those uncles who's like,"
00:08:28,00:08:29,just friends with your parents?
00:08:29,00:08:31,"- I have a feeling if we're, yeah, exactly."
00:08:31,00:08:35,- And you were shocked at some point to find out
00:08:35,00:08:36,that wasn't your uncle.
00:08:36,00:08:37,I remember this when I was five.
00:08:37,00:08:39,I found out Uncle Joe wasn't my uncle.
00:08:39,00:08:40,And I was a bit outraged.
00:08:40,00:08:41,- Uncle Joe.
00:08:41,00:08:42,- Yeah.
00:08:42,00:08:43,- It was a cup of coffee.
00:08:43,00:08:46,"- Yeah, so anyway, Matt Baffin was part of this thing"
00:08:46,00:08:47,with Noel Coward.
00:08:47,00:08:50,"And the daily express started ridiculing the production,"
00:08:50,00:08:53,saying that how could you have Noel Coward play
00:08:53,00:08:56,a high ranking general in the army?
00:08:56,00:08:57,- He's a captain.
00:08:57,00:08:59,"- A captain, right?"
00:08:59,00:09:00,- In the Navy.
00:09:00,00:09:02,"- Yeah, yeah, he didn't come across."
00:09:02,00:09:03,"- Not above that, don't carry on."
00:09:03,00:09:05,(laughing)
00:09:05,00:09:07,- I feel like I'm going quite lost in it.
00:09:07,00:09:09,"- Sorry, no, I'm barely tripping it up."
00:09:09,00:09:12,"Well, I mean, I'm pretty sure he's a captain."
00:09:12,00:09:13,I haven't watched it before.
00:09:13,00:09:15,- I haven't seen the movie and you're a part of the system.
00:09:15,00:09:16,- You're being absolutely pancake
00:09:16,00:09:18,between Tom's love of Noel Coward
00:09:18,00:09:19,and my love of military rank.
00:09:19,00:09:20,(laughing)
00:09:20,00:09:21,- Sorry.
00:09:21,00:09:23,- Just bring a bit of golf into it.
00:09:23,00:09:24,- Absolutely.
00:09:24,00:09:26,(laughing)
00:09:26,00:09:27,- Yeah.
00:09:27,00:09:29,"- That sounds quite out of time to me, Noel Coward."
00:09:29,00:09:31,"- I know his name and I know he's part of the plays,"
00:09:31,00:09:32,"but I do, you mentioned Oscar Wilde before."
00:09:32,00:09:34,"I do play some as part of that era,"
00:09:34,00:09:36,but he was in things like the Italian job.
00:09:36,00:09:37,- Yes.
00:09:37,00:09:39,"- He was, you know, in the '60s."
00:09:39,00:09:40,- Yeah.
00:09:40,00:09:42,"- That was his, I think, his last acting role."
00:09:42,00:09:43,- Right.
00:09:43,00:09:44,- He was born in 1899.
00:09:44,00:09:46,"And he served briefly in the First World War,"
00:09:46,00:09:47,which I didn't know.
00:09:47,00:09:48,"'Cause again, I think of him as like,"
00:09:48,00:09:51,"he's wearing his pajamas, maybe dressed in gown,"
00:09:51,00:09:53,"he's smoking a pipe through a long holder,"
00:09:53,00:09:55,"he's writing brilliant dialogue,"
00:09:55,00:09:59,"he's writing plays like blindspirit and hay fever, you know."
00:09:59,00:10:00,- Yeah.
00:10:00,00:10:00,- Witt.
00:10:00,00:10:04,"- But he served in this company called the ""Artists Rifles."""
00:10:04,00:10:08,"- Just sounds awful, doesn't it?"
00:10:08,00:10:11,"I think it was so, yeah, I think it was a place where"
00:10:11,00:10:13,"maybe I don't want to be unkind,"
00:10:13,00:10:18,maybe slightly less useful fighters were replaced.
00:10:18,00:10:21,And I think he wasn't ever put in any sort of position
00:10:21,00:10:23,where he'd have to do anything to practical.
00:10:23,00:10:25,"- Well, he got himself out of it quite fast."
00:10:25,00:10:27,"- And this was only in, I mean, he was born in 1899."
00:10:27,00:10:29,"So I think he was signed up aged 18,"
00:10:29,00:10:30,"or maybe conscripted, I'm not sure."
00:10:30,00:10:33,"He was discharged for Neurosthenia,"
00:10:33,00:10:36,which was very much a catchal you've got nerves.
00:10:36,00:10:39,- Sort of tying a piece of string around his finger.
00:10:39,00:10:39,- Why?
00:10:39,00:10:40,- I guess it's sort of stress.
00:10:40,00:10:41,- I stress it.
00:10:41,00:10:43,"- A stressful situation, definitely."
00:10:43,00:10:45,- It'd be a tick talk about it now.
00:10:45,00:10:47,- But I think part of the reason he got so involved
00:10:47,00:10:49,"in World War II as a spy or whatever,"
00:10:49,00:10:51,is 'cause he was a bit embarrassed by the fact
00:10:51,00:10:54,that he'd gone into World War I quite young
00:10:54,00:10:56,and then had to leave quite quickly.
00:10:56,00:10:58,"- Yeah, his company suffered lots of casualties"
00:10:58,00:10:59,in the last two months of the war.
00:10:59,00:11:00,"I mean, hundreds, you know?"
00:11:00,00:11:02,"So I think, and that was after he'd been"
00:11:02,00:11:03,invalidated out as it were.
00:11:03,00:11:04,So yeah.
00:11:04,00:11:05,- Yeah.
00:11:05,00:11:07,- I love the main thing about him outside of his plays
00:11:07,00:11:10,and his acting and his songs is the gossip.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"He was Mr. Annicdote, basically."
00:11:13,00:11:15,He's like the Charles Brandrath of his day.
00:11:15,00:11:16,(laughing)
00:11:16,00:11:17,- Charles will be very happy.
00:11:17,00:11:19,- Charles Brandrath was absolutely in love with that.
00:11:19,00:11:20,(laughing)
00:11:20,00:11:21,- Oh my goodness.
00:11:21,00:11:24,What a Christmas breath of joy.
00:11:24,00:11:25,"- Well, we'll clip this out inside of him."
00:11:25,00:11:26,- Yes.
00:11:26,00:11:29,"- Oh, and so there's one great war Annicdote from him,"
00:11:29,00:11:31,"which is he said, he never forgot the sight"
00:11:31,00:11:34,of Coco Chanel entering a Paris air raid shelter
00:11:34,00:11:36,followed by a maid who carried a gas mask
00:11:36,00:11:38,on a velvet cushion.
00:11:38,00:11:39,(laughing)
00:11:39,00:11:40,- That's wonderful stories.
00:11:40,00:11:42,"- It was a time when people did,"
00:11:42,00:11:44,"well, I know there was a structure of class,"
00:11:44,00:11:47,"but I think if you did transcend those structure,"
00:11:47,00:11:50,you would just end up being at parties with these people.
00:11:50,00:11:51,- Yeah.
00:11:51,00:11:51,"- I don't know, maybe it would be the same now,"
00:11:51,00:11:52,"but I mean, just like--"
00:11:52,00:11:57,"- 'Cause his mother, I think, had some vague sort of connection"
00:11:57,00:11:58,to the aristocracy.
00:11:58,00:11:59,"- Oh, is that really?"
00:11:59,00:12:01,- Maybe like an uncle or something.
00:12:01,00:12:02,(laughing)
00:12:02,00:12:05,"- Yeah, she, like, feel martial hague"
00:12:05,00:12:08,"was a distant cousin of hers,"
00:12:08,00:12:11,"and her sister married the nephew of Sir Henry Ponsonby,"
00:12:11,00:12:14,who was private secretary to Pequim Victoria.
00:12:14,00:12:15,- Oh.
00:12:15,00:12:18,"- So there were kind of, like, close to high society,"
00:12:18,00:12:20,but not quite in there until he became very famous
00:12:20,00:12:22,and really hot-knobbed with the--
00:12:22,00:12:24,"- Yeah, 'cause I thought they were kind of,"
00:12:24,00:12:25,"like, pretty lower middle class,"
00:12:25,00:12:27,"grew up in Southwest London,"
00:12:27,00:12:29,"and very suburban, reasonably poor,"
00:12:29,00:12:32,and his mum was a real stage mum.
00:12:32,00:12:34,"- Yeah, she was the Mrs. Worthington, I think."
00:12:34,00:12:35,- Perhaps she was the real Mrs. Worthington.
00:12:35,00:12:36,- She pushed it.
00:12:36,00:12:38,- Mrs. Worthington is--
00:12:38,00:12:41,"- Oh, is a song, don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs. Worthington."
00:12:41,00:12:44,"It's kind of a song told from the position of a producer,"
00:12:44,00:12:45,"I think, in an audition, but essentially,"
00:12:45,00:12:48,"kind of saying to this very pushy stage mum,"
00:12:48,00:12:49,"she's talentless, please stop moving in."
00:12:49,00:12:51,(laughing)
00:12:51,00:12:53,But Noel Carrot's career happened partly
00:12:53,00:12:56,because of a medium spiritual guidance.
00:12:56,00:12:59,"So his mum went to a show at the Coliseum,"
00:12:59,00:13:03,"an American celebrity medium, Anna Eva Fey,"
00:13:03,00:13:06,"and his mum asked, ""Should Noel, young Noel here,"
00:13:06,00:13:10,"""go back to school, or should he stay as a child actor?"""
00:13:10,00:13:12,And from beneath this big sheet that she was--
00:13:12,00:13:14,(laughing)
00:13:14,00:13:17,"- A medium, Anna Fey said, ""Keep acting!"""
00:13:17,00:13:18,"- Oh, wow, I didn't know that."
00:13:18,00:13:21,"- So that was a, I think, I suspect they probably would have kept him acting,"
00:13:21,00:13:25,"even if the medium had said, ""Go back to school!"""
00:13:25,00:13:26,(laughing)
00:13:26,00:13:27,And I suspect the ambition was strong.
00:13:27,00:13:29,"- Still though, I haven't seen Blife's spirit,"
00:13:29,00:13:32,but I think it's a very satirical about the spiritualism movement.
00:13:32,00:13:33,- Is that right?
00:13:33,00:13:35,Is that sort of parodying it?
00:13:35,00:13:37,- It was a big drive towards it.
00:13:37,00:13:38,"It wasn't in the 20s and 30s, I think."
00:13:38,00:13:39,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:13:39,00:13:40,- Where people would have--
00:13:40,00:13:43,"- Yeah, I guess, I mean, that probably makes sense, doesn't it?"
00:13:43,00:13:50,But my dad even remembers his grandmother having her friends around for like a say-on.
00:13:50,00:13:51,- Really?
00:13:51,00:13:52,"- Which, isn't it?"
00:13:52,00:13:54,"- Like they'd go into the back room or something, yeah."
00:13:54,00:13:57,And all these women would come in and try and contact with dad.
00:13:57,00:13:58,- Yeah.
00:13:58,00:14:01,- But it was kind of seen as his thing that people do quite socially.
00:14:01,00:14:02,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:02,00:14:04,- It was like a book club of its day.
00:14:04,00:14:06,"- The book club of its day, exactly."
00:14:06,00:14:07,- Exactly.
00:14:07,00:14:11,"His writing was extraordinary, the speed at which he wrote,"
00:14:11,00:14:16,"because there were so many knoll-coward plays, there was a story that in 1935,"
00:14:16,00:14:19,"in the summer of that year alone, he wrote nine plays."
00:14:19,00:14:22,"That's how quick he knocked out a song called ""I'll See You Again,"""
00:14:22,00:14:26,"which Frank Sinatra recorded while he was stuck in a taxi, in a traffic jam."
00:14:26,00:14:30,"- It's similar to, I think, Elton John, in the way that he,"
00:14:30,00:14:32,apparently writes his songs in five minutes.
00:14:32,00:14:34,- That's the tangents and tiaras.
00:14:34,00:14:36,It's something about that creativity.
00:14:36,00:14:39,It's something quite useful about actually not allowing lots of time.
00:14:39,00:14:40,- Yes.
00:14:40,00:14:45,"- He also says the songs slightly come to him, he doesn't claim to have written."
00:14:45,00:14:46,- Is that Elton John now?
00:14:46,00:14:47,- Yeah.
00:14:47,00:14:49,"- Yeah, Elton John will say that the songs sort of arrived to him."
00:14:49,00:14:54,"- After the war, just to go back to his sort of post-war life."
00:14:54,00:14:57,He spent a lot of time with the Navy.
00:14:57,00:15:00,"- And in fact, I bet he did."
00:15:00,00:15:02,- During the war as well.
00:15:02,00:15:06,He frequently would just hitch a lift on royal Navy ships.
00:15:06,00:15:07,- Really?
00:15:07,00:15:08,"- Yeah, he would just..."
00:15:08,00:15:10,- So he had to get on that.
00:15:10,00:15:12,"- Well, how did he get off?"
00:15:12,00:15:19,"- He said, he spent a lot of his life as a tax exile because he was so financially successful"
00:15:19,00:15:23,"in the first half of his life that a lot of his life was just moving around to different,"
00:15:23,00:15:25,low tax jurisdictions.
00:15:25,00:15:30,"And he once joined a ship in Bermuda called HM Dragon, or HMS Dragon, maybe."
00:15:30,00:15:34,"And the captain said, ""What the hell are you doing on board this ship?"""
00:15:34,00:15:38,"And Coward replied that he was, quote, ""exhausted overworked on the verge of a nervous breakdown"
00:15:38,00:15:42,and had joined the ship in order to be nurse back to health and strength and waited on hand
00:15:42,00:15:43,"and foot."""
00:15:43,00:15:48,"And the captain not only gave him a lift to Trinidad, he gave him loads more lifts later on."
00:15:48,00:15:49,- That's so nice.
00:15:49,00:15:50,- I became friends.
00:15:50,00:15:51,- This was just like...
00:15:51,00:15:55,"- As well as a naval captain, you might be quite pleased that if somebody so witchy and"
00:15:55,00:15:57,famous was suddenly on board.
00:15:57,00:15:58,"- Oh, yeah, great."
00:15:58,00:15:59,- That's the entertainment.
00:15:59,00:16:00,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:16:00,00:16:03,"- Yeah, better than the inser or whatever."
00:16:03,00:16:04,- You say he was rich.
00:16:04,00:16:05,He was so rich.
00:16:05,00:16:07,"He was making £50,000 a year."
00:16:07,00:16:11,The equivalent of which today that would be £15 million per year that he was making.
00:16:11,00:16:12,- In the late 20s.
00:16:12,00:16:13,- In the late 20s.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"And he was really burning through it, though."
00:16:15,00:16:20,"So he had a lot of financial problems, hence moving to tax havens like Jamaica, where he"
00:16:20,00:16:23,moved right next door to Ian Fleming.
00:16:23,00:16:24,"- Oh, yes."
00:16:24,00:16:25,- Yeah.
00:16:25,00:16:26,- I love this spy.
00:16:26,00:16:27,- Yeah.
00:16:27,00:16:29,"- And there are stories that he turned down the role of Doctor No, that that was actually"
00:16:29,00:16:31,offered to him for the first bond.
00:16:31,00:16:33,- He was just called Doctor before they offered it to him.
00:16:33,00:16:44,"- So Doctor No, Coward, that's the original name of the character."
00:16:44,00:16:49,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:16:49,00:16:54,"My fact this week is that there is a Marvel superhero called The Gardener, whose superpower"
00:16:54,00:16:59,is that he is insanely good at gardening.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"So is it that he can grow things very, very fast?"
00:17:01,00:17:08,"- No, it's more that he is obsessed with gardening, and he is almost an immortal."
00:17:08,00:17:12,"- Gardening is supposed to be good for you if you're getting older, like it helps you live"
00:17:12,00:17:13,"longer, doesn't it?"
00:17:13,00:17:14,- Exactly.
00:17:14,00:17:16,"- Well, yeah, and potentially forever."
00:17:16,00:17:17,"- It is, it is."
00:17:17,00:17:18,- It is forever.
00:17:18,00:17:20,- You give enough time to it.
00:17:20,00:17:24,"So he's part of this group called The Elders of the Universe, and basically the other"
00:17:24,00:17:28,one who is really good at bowls.
00:17:28,00:17:34,- There's another one who is just really good at being racist.
00:17:34,00:17:37,"- It's a really ruins Christmas, yeah."
00:17:37,00:17:40,"- Captain Crossword, come and say."
00:17:40,00:17:44,"- Yeah, okay, these are each of them with the last survivors of their own race, and these"
00:17:44,00:17:48,were racers that evolved just after the Big Bang.
00:17:48,00:17:53,"And the idea is that they have extended life spans, but not because they're immortal,"
00:17:53,00:17:57,but because of a single-minded obsession with a hobby.
00:17:57,00:17:58,- Oh.
00:17:58,00:18:01,"- That can be, I'll back that, there you go."
00:18:01,00:18:05,"So his hobby was Gardening and Horticulture, and the idea is that he would go from planet to"
00:18:05,00:18:11,"planet, and he would spend sort of up to a year sort of terraforming it, making it greener"
00:18:11,00:18:12,guys.
00:18:12,00:18:15,"- Yeah, that seems like very, might come into his own actually, you know, environmentally"
00:18:15,00:18:16,conscious age.
00:18:16,00:18:17,- There you go.
00:18:17,00:18:19,"Well, he should be a bigger character, because actually in the original-"
00:18:19,00:18:22,- I think I should blame him.
00:18:22,00:18:26,"- In the original stories, he and the other elders all had the Infinity Gems, which is"
00:18:26,00:18:32,what Thanos collects as part of the main Avenger storyline in order to wipe out all of-
00:18:32,00:18:34,"- Oh, so he's one of the original holders of one of these?"
00:18:34,00:18:39,"- Yeah, because some reason when it came to the movie adaptation, the Gardner didn't quite"
00:18:39,00:18:40,get.
00:18:40,00:18:41,- Pretty cool.
00:18:41,00:18:42,That's what I'm thinking.
00:18:42,00:18:43,"- Yeah, I'm talking about that."
00:18:43,00:18:44,"- Yeah, I love that."
00:18:44,00:18:45,- Yeah.
00:18:45,00:18:49,"- The other thing with like a big wide-brimmed hat, you know, the sort of thing that old ladies"
00:18:49,00:18:50,used to have.
00:18:50,00:18:51,"- Oh, yes."
00:18:51,00:18:52,- Yeah.
00:18:52,00:18:53,- Gloves on-
00:18:53,00:18:54,"- Obviously, floral gloves in one of those kneeling pads."
00:18:54,00:18:55,- I've got one.
00:18:55,00:18:57,They are very useful.
00:18:57,00:19:00,The best ones are when you've got a handle at the side to push yourself up.
00:19:00,00:19:01,- Ooh.
00:19:01,00:19:02,"- Yeah, they give you those."
00:19:02,00:19:04,"- It's like an upside-down piano stool, really."
00:19:04,00:19:05,That's really helpful.
00:19:05,00:19:06,- That's really helpful.
00:19:06,00:19:08,"- And then you've got to just have a couple of beats to be like, ""Oh, with my knees."""
00:19:08,00:19:09,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:19:09,00:19:12,"- We're talking to a seasoned Gardner here, I'm guessing."
00:19:12,00:19:16,"- Well, I salty, maybe, if it's just about seasoned."
00:19:16,00:19:19,"- You do have a Gardner, though, that you love to test."
00:19:19,00:19:21,- I've got an into Gardening.
00:19:21,00:19:24,I like to use the past tense of God.
00:19:24,00:19:28,And I've gotten into Gardening in the last sort of four years since having my own place.
00:19:28,00:19:33,"For a long time, I lived with my parents, and I didn't have my own space then."
00:19:33,00:19:37,"So now I do, and it's quite nice just to, well, just mess around, really."
00:19:37,00:19:40,"I'm proud and obvious with it, but I find it really interesting."
00:19:40,00:19:44,"- So on Famous Gardners, who's the most famous Gardner in the UK?"
00:19:44,00:19:45,- Alan Titchfars.
00:19:45,00:19:46,- Correct.
00:19:46,00:19:50,- What has Alan Titchfars got in common with Elvis Presley?
00:19:50,00:19:51,- Ooh.
00:19:51,00:19:52,- Ooh.
00:19:52,00:19:53,Okay.
00:19:53,00:19:54,- That's obvious.
00:19:54,00:19:58,- Both sex gods.
00:19:58,00:19:59,"- Okay, I'll give you that."
00:19:59,00:20:00,It's slightly related to that.
00:20:00,00:20:01,- Poets?
00:20:01,00:20:03,"- He writes poetry, Titchmush."
00:20:03,00:20:04,- It's not that.
00:20:04,00:20:05,- Okay.
00:20:05,00:20:06,- Very vintage ale.
00:20:06,00:20:08,"- Well, Elvis had a song about it."
00:20:08,00:20:10,"Titchmush was done up for years, wasn't he?"
00:20:10,00:20:11,"- Yes, yeah."
00:20:11,00:20:13,- That's why he has on his tattoos.
00:20:13,00:20:14,- Yeah.
00:20:14,00:20:17,- Come us them up for the show across.
00:20:17,00:20:21,- One for everybody.
00:20:21,00:20:22,- And he killed him.
00:20:22,00:20:25,"- It's how he got into gardening, was burying the bodies."
00:20:25,00:20:33,- The answer is that the lower halves have been censored on television.
00:20:33,00:20:34,- Really?
00:20:34,00:20:39,"- So Elvis, obviously, when he became big, they would only show him from the waist up so"
00:20:39,00:20:41,that people didn't get too excited.
00:20:41,00:20:43,But Alan Titchfars has been...
00:20:43,00:20:46,- They were sent over the waist out.
00:20:49,00:20:54,- They have censored his trousers because he wears jeans.
00:20:54,00:20:59,"And in North Korea, they don't like jeans being shown because it's a symbol of America."
00:20:59,00:21:00,- Oh.
00:21:00,00:21:03,"- So they show his programs, but they blur out his trousers."
00:21:03,00:21:04,- Wow.
00:21:04,00:21:07,- But that means he's free to broadcast Winnie the Pooh style.
00:21:07,00:21:08,- Yes.
00:21:08,00:21:09,- Yes.
00:21:09,00:21:11,- So the North Korean networks.
00:21:11,00:21:12,- He's there.
00:21:12,00:21:14,- We have to paint his legs blue.
00:21:14,00:21:18,- I've seen Titchmush do karaoke.
00:21:18,00:21:20,"- Have you, in person?"
00:21:20,00:21:21,- In person.
00:21:21,00:21:22,- Wow.
00:21:22,00:21:23,- I don't mean to cling.
00:21:23,00:21:24,- What did he say?
00:21:24,00:21:25,- Something green-green grass.
00:21:25,00:21:27,- It was...
00:21:27,00:21:29,"Oh, what's the one I killed the man in Reno?"
00:21:29,00:21:34,- Gangsters paradise as well.
00:21:34,00:21:41,"- Yeah, I don't remember the song, but it was, yeah."
00:21:41,00:21:42,"- Wow, that's very cool."
00:21:42,00:21:45,"Well, there's other reasons that Alan Titchmush is a sex god."
00:21:45,00:21:50,"- Yeah, by the way, which is that as well as writing over something like 70 gardening books,"
00:21:50,00:21:51,he's written a series of novels.
00:21:51,00:21:52,- Yes.
00:21:52,00:21:53,"- Yes, they are."
00:21:53,00:21:54,- Are they seen?
00:21:54,00:21:55,- Are they?
00:21:55,00:21:56,"- Yeah, in fact."
00:21:56,00:21:57,- Absolutely.
00:21:57,00:22:02,"- I don't know if you remember, but we had Los Andres read Morrissey's contribution to the world of sex scenes."
00:22:02,00:22:03,"- Tom, do you mind?"
00:22:03,00:22:05,- I feel a little extra.
00:22:05,00:22:06,"- Oh, here we go."
00:22:06,00:22:12,"- Well, I think I have met Alan a few times and he's always very charming, as you imagine."
00:22:12,00:22:17,"And he did say to me, because I was talking to him about audiobooks."
00:22:17,00:22:18,"- Oh, yeah."
00:22:18,00:22:24,- And he did say he was very aware of his more intimate scenes when he had to sit in a booze.
00:22:24,00:22:25,- Oh my God.
00:22:25,00:22:26,- And read them out.
00:22:26,00:22:27,- To an engineer.
00:22:27,00:22:32,"So as an example of what he might have been reading, there is a little bit here."
00:22:32,00:22:36,She planted moist hot kisses all over his body.
00:22:36,00:22:40,Beads of sweat began to appear on Guy's forehead for it.
00:22:40,00:22:47,As it became more entangled in the lissum limbs of this human bower constrictor.
00:22:47,00:22:57,"For fully 15 minutes, their mutual passion heightened with groans, size, and liquid noises."
00:22:57,00:22:58,- Oh my God.
00:22:58,00:22:59,"- Wow, I can't believe it."
00:22:59,00:23:05,"- Can I just say, when you're describing lens, why'd go for the one out of all that doesn't have any lens?"
00:23:05,00:23:06,"- Oh, lissum."
00:23:06,00:23:07,- Lissum limb.
00:23:07,00:23:08,- I don't know what lissum means.
00:23:08,00:23:09,- What l'd say?
00:23:09,00:23:10,- I've never heard that word before.
00:23:10,00:23:13,"- Lissum is kind of young and firm and strong, isn't it?"
00:23:13,00:23:14,- Is it?
00:23:14,00:23:15,"- Oh, sorry."
00:23:15,00:23:16,- I love that.
00:23:16,00:23:17,- Titch marshes.
00:23:17,00:23:18,- Too high brow for us.
00:23:18,00:23:19,- We don't know the vocabulary.
00:23:19,00:23:20,- I know.
00:23:20,00:23:21,I bet he learned.
00:23:21,00:23:22,- He's a very educated man.
00:23:22,00:23:25,- I like the way it begins with she planted kisses.
00:23:25,00:23:26,- Yeah.
00:23:26,00:23:28,- Like because obviously he's a gardener.
00:23:28,00:23:29,- Absolutely.
00:23:29,00:23:30,"- Oh, every."
00:23:30,00:23:31,"- Well, he."
00:23:31,00:23:32,- Yeah.
00:23:32,00:23:36,- So he was runner up in the 1998 Literary Review Bad Sex Awards.
00:23:36,00:23:37,And you're right.
00:23:37,00:23:39,He felt very uncomfortable reading them.
00:23:39,00:23:45,He said particularly with the sheet of glass between you and a very large bearded man twiddling
00:23:45,00:23:47,knobs as you say the words.
00:23:47,00:23:48,- Gosh.
00:23:48,00:23:49,- He found it uncomfortable.
00:23:49,00:23:53,"- I think it's a bit unfair that bad sex thing because they go for slabs, don't they?"
00:23:53,00:23:56,There must be loads of like not famous people who are writing worse.
00:23:56,00:23:57,- Absolutely.
00:23:57,00:23:58,- What?
00:23:58,00:24:00,"- To be fair, the winner that year was Sebastian Forks."
00:24:00,00:24:01,- I was going to say bird song.
00:24:01,00:24:02,- Yeah.
00:24:02,00:24:03,- It's got lots of that.
00:24:03,00:24:04,That's very interesting.
00:24:04,00:24:05,"- Bird song is very fruity, doesn't it?"
00:24:05,00:24:06,- Very fruity.
00:24:06,00:24:10,"- I remember reading that when I was about 17 and thinking, ""Oh gosh, that seems like a lot"
00:24:10,00:24:11,"of effort."""
00:24:11,00:24:12,(laughs)
00:24:12,00:24:16,"- Can I ask you about a couple of things you might or might not use in your garden, Tom?"
00:24:16,00:24:17,"- Oh, yeah."
00:24:17,00:24:18,- Absolutely.
00:24:18,00:24:19,- Should we give it a go?
00:24:19,00:24:20,Right.
00:24:20,00:24:24,Do you ever use worm poo tea bags?
00:24:24,00:24:26,"- No, I think I have heard of this sort of thing."
00:24:26,00:24:27,- So cool.
00:24:27,00:24:28,"- Worms are very important, aren't they?"
00:24:28,00:24:29,- Worms are vital.
00:24:29,00:24:30,- And obviously they eat soil.
00:24:30,00:24:31,They poo it out.
00:24:31,00:24:32,"You know, they help."
00:24:32,00:24:33,- So do I.
00:24:33,00:24:34,- They do their aerate.
00:24:34,00:24:35,- They have all sorts of stuff.
00:24:35,00:24:40,"You can get tea bags with worm castings, aerate worm poo, where you literally make a cup of tea"
00:24:40,00:24:41,out of it for your plant.
00:24:41,00:24:43,And it really helps your plant.
00:24:43,00:24:44,- Really?
00:24:44,00:24:45,- Yeah.
00:24:45,00:24:46,Lion urine?
00:24:46,00:24:49,"- Well, that's the thing, isn't it, because people say to keep away foxes or other animals"
00:24:49,00:24:50,if you want them out of your garden.
00:24:50,00:24:51,- You need an apex predator.
00:24:51,00:24:52,- You need an apex.
00:24:52,00:24:53,You can't.
00:24:53,00:24:54,"The people say, ""Oh, just go and weigh in the garden."""
00:24:54,00:24:56,"And they're like, ""No, they need men to weigh in the garden."
00:24:56,00:24:57,"It's male urine,"" they respond to."
00:24:57,00:24:58,"And apparently, that's not..."
00:24:58,00:24:59,That's not going to do it.
00:24:59,00:25:02,"Apparently, you need to go to the zoo and ask, ""Yeah, I'm going to get a lion to"
00:25:02,00:25:03,"weigh into a cup."""
00:25:03,00:25:08,"Oh, you could get the piss off plant, have you heard of that?"
00:25:08,00:25:09,- What's that?
00:25:09,00:25:14,- Piss off plant is a plant that's native to Southern and Eastern Africa.
00:25:14,00:25:19,And it is a plant that supposedly repels dogs and cats from coming near it because of the
00:25:19,00:25:21,eroma that it emits.
00:25:21,00:25:25,"So if you had that in your garden, most likely, they would smell it and never come back"
00:25:25,00:25:26,again.
00:25:26,00:25:27,"- Well, I'll get one of those."
00:25:27,00:25:28,That's pretty good.
00:25:28,00:25:29,- That's a great idea.
00:25:29,00:25:31,- Do you have an ornamental hermit in your garden?
00:25:31,00:25:36,"- No, I don't have anything like that was like a sort of a little house, wasn't it word"
00:25:36,00:25:37,a little.
00:25:37,00:25:40,"- Well, back in the 18th century, this was a real life human that you would bring into your"
00:25:40,00:25:41,garden.
00:25:41,00:25:42,Yeah.
00:25:42,00:25:46,They would dress like a druid and they would just be sat and they would have a contract
00:25:46,00:25:52,to live there and negotiations for roaches and negotiations every autumn as the reproaches.
00:25:52,00:25:53,- Yeah.
00:25:53,00:25:57,"Well, look, I'm not going to do this for another year unless you revise my terms."
00:25:57,00:26:03,"- Yeah, it's been in 1797, there was a thing, the hermit is never to leave the place or hold"
00:26:03,00:26:07,conversation with anyone for seven years during which he is neither to wash himself or cleanse
00:26:07,00:26:09,himself in any way whatsoever.
00:26:09,00:26:12,"- Yeah, my agent's got a problem with his claws, right?"
00:26:12,00:26:16,"- Yeah, it lives a bit further down the garden, another little folly."
00:26:16,00:26:17,- Yeah.
00:26:17,00:26:20,- Do we know why people did that?
00:26:20,00:26:25,"- Well, I think it's a kind of, it would be like landed gentry would have this person."
00:26:25,00:26:28,"You wouldn't have it in your garden in that knee, would you?"
00:26:28,00:26:34,"- No, exactly, I think what it is is the hermit is a symbol of a wild and ancient way of living"
00:26:34,00:26:41,and it's kind of they are reflecting on history and on humanity and on progress and the countryside
00:26:41,00:26:45,and the wilderness and I think that's why it's cool to have a hermit because they kind of
00:26:45,00:26:46,hark back to that.
00:26:46,00:26:47,- Yeah.
00:26:47,00:26:51,It's been that kind of sentimentality isn't it around that kind of pastoral?
00:26:51,00:26:52,- Yeah.
00:26:52,00:26:56,"- There was one place which had a hermit which turned out to be a mechanical hermit, genuinely,"
00:26:56,00:27:02,"I think it was the 18th century aristocrat, quite clearly it was just a hermit."
00:27:02,00:27:07,"It was like a very, very, very crude model robo hermit that they had in there with those things."
00:27:07,00:27:09,- Here's another famous gardener.
00:27:09,00:27:17,So this is a king called Error Imiti who was in ancient Samar and what would happen in
00:27:17,00:27:21,ancient Samar is you would get people who would tell the future and if they saw a bad
00:27:21,00:27:26,"omen, like maybe the king's going to die, you would put someone else on the throne for"
00:27:26,00:27:29,100 days and then you take over again.
00:27:29,00:27:34,"So this guy, Error Imiti decided to put his gardener on the throne for 100 days because"
00:27:34,00:27:39,there'd been a bad omen and then he died after eating some hot porridge and his gardener
00:27:39,00:27:42,then reigned ancient Sumer for 24 years.
00:27:42,00:27:43,- Wow.
00:27:43,00:27:44,- Wow.
00:27:44,00:27:45,- Just because he didn't blow on it.
00:27:45,00:27:46,- I guess so.
00:27:46,00:27:48,- It's a good holy porridge.
00:27:48,00:27:49,- Yeah.
00:27:49,00:27:50,- That's incredible.
00:27:50,00:27:51,- I know.
00:27:51,00:27:54,- I guess it wasn't a successor in place who would not have taken over.
00:27:54,00:27:56,"- Well, he's the king now, right?"
00:27:56,00:27:57,"- Yeah, you're right."
00:27:57,00:27:59,- So what are you going to do?
00:27:59,00:28:00,- That's so funny.
00:28:00,00:28:01,- That's so funny.
00:28:01,00:28:10,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy."
00:28:10,00:28:15,"- My fact is, in 1920, the king of Greece died after trying to break up a fight between"
00:28:15,00:28:17,a dog and a monkey.
00:28:17,00:28:24,"This is the only royal death I've found which involved a monkey at all, actually, little"
00:28:24,00:28:26,end of fight between a dog and a monkey.
00:28:26,00:28:32,"This was King Alexander of Greece and he had a dog, he had a German shepherd and one"
00:28:32,00:28:41,"day he was having a walk in the palace grounds and I think a barberry ape, quite an aggressive,"
00:28:41,00:28:44,"yeah, not a titler of a monkey, you know, this isn't like bubbles."
00:28:44,00:28:46,"- No, no, no, no, this is, this is proper-"
00:28:46,00:28:52,"- They're very naughty barberry apes, I can say, they only, yeah, it's naughty."
00:28:52,00:28:54,- They'll kill your dog.
00:28:54,00:28:57,- Like slaughtering your dog in front of you.
00:28:57,00:28:58,- Or your king.
00:28:58,00:29:03,"- They have the man to brawl to them, they, and I went up there with a pusher, with my"
00:29:03,00:29:07,daughter who is very young and basically they will just steal everything.
00:29:07,00:29:09,"Everything that's not held down, they'll steal it."
00:29:09,00:29:10,- You got her back though.
00:29:10,00:29:12,"- No, she still lives there."
00:29:12,00:29:17,- She is the egg queen now.
00:29:17,00:29:21,"- That's why I'm about to put Brexit, I don't want it to be Spanish."
00:29:21,00:29:26,"- Yeah, so anyway, this ape and this dog were in a fight, he was trying to separate them"
00:29:26,00:29:31,at which point the apes wife turned up and sunk fangs into King Alexander's leg.
00:29:31,00:29:32,- Oh no.
00:29:32,00:29:37,"- And I think some days later he died, he'd become ill and they had swithered over what"
00:29:37,00:29:39,to do the doctors and so.
00:29:39,00:29:44,"- So he died and this produced huge geopolitical consequences with Churchill later wrote, ""It"
00:29:44,00:29:48,is perhaps no exaggeration to remark that a quarter of a million persons died of this
00:29:48,00:29:49,"monkey's bite."""
00:29:49,00:29:50,- Really?
00:29:50,00:29:51,- Yeah.
00:29:51,00:29:52,- Wow.
00:29:52,00:29:53,- Because they've spent the Greek Civil War.
00:29:53,00:29:58,"- Well, it all led to a lot of unhappiness and conflict inside Greece."
00:29:58,00:30:00,They got back the previous king.
00:30:00,00:30:01,- Because what had happened?
00:30:01,00:30:06,"The previous king was very pro-German and his son was pro-German, his eldest son."
00:30:06,00:30:11,So Britain and Russia and probably France got rid of those guys and brought in this guy who
00:30:11,00:30:13,wasn't expecting to be King.
00:30:13,00:30:18,He was just thought he was going to spend his days gardening or just having a lovely life.
00:30:18,00:30:19,- Having a lovely life.
00:30:19,00:30:20,- Yeah.
00:30:20,00:30:24,"- And then suddenly he's King and then, okay, well now we've got our puppet who's in charge"
00:30:24,00:30:28,but then he dies and then they bring the old people back and it all goes to shit.
00:30:28,00:30:29,"- That's basically what happened, yeah."
00:30:29,00:30:34,"He fought this war against the Turks which went disastrously wrong, hundreds of thousands"
00:30:34,00:30:35,of deaths.
00:30:35,00:30:39,We've kicked out and then the European great powers just started picking the Greek royal family
00:30:39,00:30:45,and then eventually things got a bit more democratic and the Greeks in 1862 had this vote for
00:30:45,00:30:52,"a new king, a kind of national referendum and they almost universally, they chose Prince"
00:30:52,00:30:55,Alfred of England who I believe was one of Victoria's sons.
00:30:55,00:31:00,He won 95% of the votes cast against the Turks.
00:31:00,00:31:01,"He said no, no thank you."
00:31:01,00:31:02,I don't want to do it.
00:31:02,00:31:07,"- You used for the throne of Greece, yeah but imagine if we have a nice house somewhere"
00:31:07,00:31:08,wouldn't it?
00:31:08,00:31:09,- I'm sure he's already got a nice house.
00:31:09,00:31:10,- You're right.
00:31:10,00:31:11,Well yeah was that?
00:31:11,00:31:12,- That was 1862.
00:31:12,00:31:14,"- So this is not happening in the 1860s, wasn't it?"
00:31:14,00:31:15,- Oh.
00:31:15,00:31:16,- Going on.
00:31:16,00:31:17,- Bucket.
00:31:17,00:31:18,- Was that unification of Germany around then?
00:31:18,00:31:19,- Yes.
00:31:19,00:31:20,- And then formation of Italy.
00:31:20,00:31:21,- Yes.
00:31:21,00:31:22,- Also my house was built.
00:31:22,00:31:23,- Really?
00:31:23,00:31:24,- So some major events.
00:31:24,00:31:25,"- Major, major things."
00:31:25,00:31:26,- So your garden.
00:31:26,00:31:27,- That was laid out.
00:31:27,00:31:28,"- The garden was created, yeah."
00:31:28,00:31:29,- By Prince Alfred.
00:31:29,00:31:32,- And the corner from me and Napoleon III came to live.
00:31:32,00:31:33,- Is that so?
00:31:33,00:31:34,- Really?
00:31:34,00:31:35,- Wow.
00:31:35,00:31:36,- So we've asked Tate a huge decade.
00:31:36,00:31:37,- Huge decade.
00:31:37,00:31:41,"- But basically Alfred was pressured into saying no, because Britain, France and Russia had"
00:31:41,00:31:42,all to creed.
00:31:42,00:31:43,Nobody's going to accept this throne.
00:31:43,00:31:44,- Yeah.
00:31:44,00:31:45,"- Nobody wants it, get over it."
00:31:45,00:31:49,And every candidate said no until they got to Prince Wilhelm of Denmark of the Blocksburg
00:31:49,00:31:54,house and he had received six votes from the entire population of Greece and he was
00:31:54,00:31:56,then chosen to be the king.
00:31:56,00:31:57,- That is unfortunate.
00:31:57,00:31:58,- I know.
00:31:58,00:32:01,- The 18th highest voted person in that list.
00:32:01,00:32:02,- You came 18th.
00:32:02,00:32:03,- Yeah.
00:32:03,00:32:06,"- But various people had just written a Russian king, please, or whatever they just selected,"
00:32:06,00:32:07,like they just listed it.
00:32:07,00:32:09,So he came almost dead last.
00:32:09,00:32:11,"And yet, he then was king for 50 years."
00:32:11,00:32:12,- King Elet kingface was there.
00:32:12,00:32:13,- Is it?
00:32:13,00:32:14,- Who they really wanted.
00:32:14,00:32:15,- Yeah.
00:32:15,00:32:18,"- And then he lost it until 1913, he lost it 50 years."
00:32:18,00:32:19,- 1930.
00:32:19,00:32:20,- 1913.
00:32:20,00:32:21,- 1913.
00:32:21,00:32:25,"- He was assassinated by either a socialist or a lunatic, and it's not clear which apparently."
00:32:25,00:32:26,- Oh yeah.
00:32:26,00:32:27,- Not necessarily.
00:32:27,00:32:28,- Not to get political.
00:32:28,00:32:29,- Yeah.
00:32:29,00:32:34,"- A lot of assassinations happening around that sort of area, wasn't there that time?"
00:32:34,00:32:35,- Oh yeah.
00:32:35,00:32:36,- Yes.
00:32:36,00:32:37,- He loved it.
00:32:37,00:32:38,"- A vexed, a vexed period."
00:32:38,00:32:39,- A vexed period in the south-east of Europe.
00:32:39,00:32:40,- Yeah.
00:32:40,00:32:43,- I found another monkey bite death.
00:32:43,00:32:44,- Oh.
00:32:44,00:32:45,- Did you?
00:32:45,00:32:48,"- It's an expect-to-find one, but I tried hard and I got there."
00:32:48,00:32:50,- Do you know the character Grizzly Adams?
00:32:50,00:32:51,- Grizzly Adams.
00:32:51,00:32:52,- He was.
00:32:52,00:32:53,- I wasn't like a vampire.
00:32:53,00:32:54,"- No, no."
00:32:54,00:32:57,"- So Grizzly Adams in America, I think he's quite a well-known."
00:32:57,00:32:59,Historical character.
00:32:59,00:33:01,So he was a Californian mountain man.
00:33:01,00:33:04,He was a trainer of Grizzly bears.
00:33:04,00:33:09,"And he used to just do acts, you know, kind of like a Petey Barnum kind of thing."
00:33:09,00:33:13,So he made pets with quite a few of these bears that he thought were friendly.
00:33:13,00:33:14,- I can't see this going.
00:33:14,00:33:15,- Yeah.
00:33:15,00:33:16,- Can't see where this is going to go.
00:33:16,00:33:17,- And he was killed by a monkey.
00:33:17,00:33:18,- Yeah.
00:33:18,00:33:19,- Yeah.
00:33:19,00:33:20,- So.
00:33:20,00:33:21,Okay.
00:33:21,00:33:23,Don't take your eyes off the threat of the monkeys.
00:33:23,00:33:24,- Yeah.
00:33:24,00:33:30,"- So he got attacked by Grizzly in Sierra Nevada, in the monkey was one who set the Grizzly"
00:33:30,00:33:31,on him.
00:33:31,00:33:33,"- No, monkey comes in later."
00:33:33,00:33:38,So his scalp was dislodged in this attack and it left a silver dollar size impression in
00:33:38,00:33:41,his skull just above his forehead.
00:33:41,00:33:44,Then he had all these other Grizzlies that he made friends with.
00:33:44,00:33:50,"Anyway, he was re-insured several times in the head and it opened up the wound which meant"
00:33:50,00:33:57,"a bit of brain tissue where it's exposed and then, as he's still going with the bears,"
00:33:57,00:33:58,stick.
00:33:58,00:33:59,- He's still going with the bear stick.
00:33:59,00:34:00,- Okay.
00:34:00,00:34:04,- And then Grizzly added this on tour with a circus when a monkey that he was trying to train
00:34:04,00:34:10,"jumped up and beat him in the brain, not in the head in the brain."
00:34:10,00:34:13,"- Well, you don't have any nerves in your brain so you wouldn't even feel it."
00:34:13,00:34:14,- Yep.
00:34:14,00:34:15,- So anyway.
00:34:15,00:34:16,"- No, it was happening."
00:34:16,00:34:17,I think.
00:34:17,00:34:20,"- Okay, from behind is possible."
00:34:20,00:34:21,- And so he died.
00:34:21,00:34:22,October 25th.
00:34:22,00:34:23,"- Oh, no."
00:34:23,00:34:24,- 1860.
00:34:24,00:34:25,- 1860.
00:34:25,00:34:26,- 1860.
00:34:26,00:34:27,- Yeah.
00:34:27,00:34:28,- It was another thing.
00:34:28,00:34:29,- It does.
00:34:29,00:34:30,- Another thing.
00:34:30,00:34:31,- How extraordinary does.
00:34:31,00:34:34,"- If you hadn't said it was a monkey, I wouldn't have seen that coming at all."
00:34:34,00:34:35,"- Yeah, I know, right."
00:34:35,00:34:36,It's a real plot twist at the end there.
00:34:36,00:34:37,- It really is.
00:34:37,00:34:38,- Wow.
00:34:38,00:34:39,Horrifying end.
00:34:39,00:34:40,Here's some people.
00:34:40,00:34:44,"William III of England, Alexander III of Scotland, Prince Alfonso Portugal, Frederick"
00:34:44,00:34:46,Augustus II of Saxony.
00:34:46,00:34:51,"Matthew Jeffrey of Brittany is a Beller of Aragon, Leopold V of Austria, Louis IV of France,"
00:34:51,00:34:52,William the Conqueror.
00:34:52,00:34:53,They all died the same way.
00:34:53,00:34:54,- Monkeys.
00:34:54,00:34:55,- Not monkeys.
00:34:55,00:34:56,- Yeah.
00:34:56,00:34:57,(laughing)
00:34:57,00:35:00,- At what point do we start suspecting the monkeys?
00:35:00,00:35:04,- Araratus of the day.
00:35:04,00:35:07,- This is something that does away with lots of royalties.
00:35:07,00:35:08,- And it's very guessable.
00:35:08,00:35:09,- Oh.
00:35:09,00:35:10,- Or is it gouged or something?
00:35:10,00:35:11,"- Yeah, gouged."
00:35:11,00:35:12,- Gouged.
00:35:12,00:35:13,- But that's a bit of a hog.
00:35:13,00:35:14,- Yeah.
00:35:14,00:35:18,"- It's sort of explosion or some sort of, 'cause William the Conqueror did explode."
00:35:18,00:35:19,- He did explode his death.
00:35:19,00:35:20,- Yeah.
00:35:20,00:35:22,"- He got rather a beef, I think, to me."
00:35:22,00:35:23,- Right.
00:35:23,00:35:25,They couldn't bury him straight away.
00:35:25,00:35:29,"And so when the monks came to bury him in his concrete tomb, they sort of shoved him"
00:35:29,00:35:30,in it.
00:35:30,00:35:31,- Oh.
00:35:31,00:35:32,- And then he exploded.
00:35:32,00:35:33,- Wow.
00:35:33,00:35:34,- And the Conqueror.
00:35:34,00:35:35,"- I'm pretty sure, yeah."
00:35:35,00:35:36,"- William the Conqueror, yeah."
00:35:36,00:35:37,He definitely exploded in the--
00:35:37,00:35:38,- Conqueror.
00:35:38,00:35:39,- Oh.
00:35:39,00:35:40,"- It wouldn't be Conqueror, no stone, sorry."
00:35:40,00:35:41,"- Oh yeah, okay."
00:35:41,00:35:42,- That's a bit of the story you wanted to pick up.
00:35:42,00:35:43,- The Romans had Conqueror.
00:35:43,00:35:46,"- I know the Romans had Conqueror, but I wasn't aware that--"
00:35:46,00:35:47,"- Yeah, it was a brutalist--"
00:35:47,00:35:49,- It was a brutalist coffin.
00:35:49,00:35:51,- I just went with something really silly.
00:35:51,00:35:56,"- Anyway, the answer is, falling off a horse."
00:35:56,00:35:57,- Oh.
00:35:57,00:35:58,- Oh.
00:35:58,00:36:00,- That is a big old way that people died in the past.
00:36:00,00:36:01,- Yes.
00:36:01,00:36:06,"- Alexander III probably was riding along a high treacherous coastal path, having drank"
00:36:06,00:36:11,"a lot of bodo wine, and just went straight off it."
00:36:11,00:36:12,- Right.
00:36:12,00:36:15,"- I just jumped straight off it, yeah."
00:36:15,00:36:17,"You would think the horse would stop, but yeah."
00:36:17,00:36:22,"The problem is that quite often when these people die, there's a big sort of something happens"
00:36:22,00:36:25,"afterwards, like happened with this Greek guy."
00:36:25,00:36:31,"So when Alexander III died, that started the first war of Scottish independence, essentially."
00:36:31,00:36:32,- Right.
00:36:32,00:36:35,"- So you know, it's quite a big deal when these kings die, even though they're just people."
00:36:35,00:36:39,- But what point is anyone suggesting a helmet for horse riding?
00:36:39,00:36:40,- Oh.
00:36:40,00:36:41,- I just--
00:36:41,00:36:45,"- You don't see that, I mean, apart from knights, you don't see people with like cycle helmets"
00:36:45,00:36:46,"in the past, do you?"
00:36:46,00:36:48,"- Yeah, but knights do have protection."
00:36:48,00:36:53,"You just think that I get how many regal deaths do they have to have before they say, I think"
00:36:53,00:36:57,"we should say, if you're the king or queen, you have to wear a helmet on your horse."
00:36:57,00:36:58,- Yeah.
00:36:58,00:36:59,- Or how about seat belts?
00:36:59,00:37:00,- Horse seat belts?
00:37:00,00:37:01,- Yeah.
00:37:01,00:37:02,- Horse belts.
00:37:02,00:37:03,- Is that safer?
00:37:03,00:37:06,- You're not going to fall if you're really tied tight.
00:37:06,00:37:09,"- If your horse falls over though, and your seat belt is on, I just wonder if there's five"
00:37:09,00:37:11,reggae to come along.
00:37:11,00:37:14,- I feel like there might be a reason why the horse seat belt hasn't been invented.
00:37:14,00:37:15,Or maybe it has.
00:37:15,00:37:19,"- Stirrups is effectively the horse seat belt, because it really helps you hold yourself in"
00:37:19,00:37:20,place when you're in the stirrups.
00:37:20,00:37:23,"- Look at you, you've been riding the horse recently."
00:37:23,00:37:24,- I've ridden one half.
00:37:24,00:37:25,- I've ridden one half.
00:37:25,00:37:26,- You've ridden one half.
00:37:26,00:37:27,- You're wearing it as Mr. equestrian.
00:37:27,00:37:31,"- All I'm going to say is that go off any clefts, so, you know, despite how much border"
00:37:31,00:37:32,wine you--
00:37:32,00:37:33,- Yeah.
00:37:33,00:37:40,"- That's true, isn't it, how do people-- maybe this is a very graphic question, but how do"
00:37:40,00:37:41,people die when they fall off a horse?
00:37:41,00:37:43,Do they get trampled in the legs?
00:37:43,00:37:45,- I think it's banged on my head.
00:37:45,00:37:46,- Banged on my head.
00:37:46,00:37:47,"- Yeah, because actually you're quite--"
00:37:47,00:37:51,"- Someone who's ridden a horse, I would say, but you would know, that's why I asked."
00:37:51,00:37:53,- You're quite high up.
00:37:53,00:37:54,- Oh yeah.
00:37:54,00:38:01,"- And they do, like, my horse, at once they saw a lady horse, and so I started galloping"
00:38:01,00:38:02,towards them.
00:38:02,00:38:03,- Oh no.
00:38:03,00:38:06,- I'm going to tell you a little bit more shit in my angle.
00:38:06,00:38:11,"- One advantage for a horse ride, if it mounted the feet up, and you just have to sit there"
00:38:11,00:38:13,like a horse passenger.
00:38:13,00:38:14,- That's amazing.
00:38:14,00:38:15,You're riding two horses at once.
00:38:15,00:38:17,That's absolutely incredible.
00:38:17,00:38:28,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:38:28,00:38:33,"- Okay, my fact this week is that one of the most popular celebrity tailors of the 1950s"
00:38:33,00:38:36,"was, ironically, called Newdy."
00:38:36,00:38:40,- This guy's a character.
00:38:40,00:38:44,"- I reckon quite a few people might have heard of him, but I'd never heard of him before."
00:38:44,00:38:48,He was the first person to spot rhinestones on clothing.
00:38:48,00:38:55,"So if you've ever seen one of those rhinestone cowboy suits that they wore in America, in"
00:38:55,00:38:59,"what, this 50, 60, 70s, he will have made it."
00:38:59,00:39:01,So he made suits for Elvis.
00:39:01,00:39:02,He made them four ships.
00:39:02,00:39:03,"- Well, in Titch Marsh."
00:39:03,00:39:11,"- Elton John, who we've mentioned before, Hank Williams, John Lennon, this is the who's"
00:39:11,00:39:12,who.
00:39:12,00:39:13,- It's everybody.
00:39:13,00:39:14,- Yeah.
00:39:14,00:39:15,- Staggered.
00:39:15,00:39:16,"- Liver Archie, I imagine."
00:39:16,00:39:17,"- Oh, yeah."
00:39:17,00:39:18,- They never too much sure.
00:39:18,00:39:19,- It was sort of everyone.
00:39:19,00:39:24,"In fact, I was thinking, because I, you know, the term rhinestone cowboy, Glen Campbell,"
00:39:24,00:39:29,"that was originally written by a man called Larry Weiss, and it was, it was in tribute"
00:39:29,00:39:30,to Newdy.
00:39:30,00:39:31,- Really?
00:39:31,00:39:34,- That was a thing that all of these country music stars kept asking for.
00:39:34,00:39:38,"They were like, ""Newdy, more rhinestone, more rhinestone,"" when they were asking for their"
00:39:38,00:39:39,suits to be tailored.
00:39:39,00:39:42,"So that song was put in more of a sentence, though."
00:39:42,00:39:43,"They just went, ""More rhinestone."""
00:39:43,00:39:44,"""More rhinestone."""
00:39:44,00:39:45,"""More rhinestone."""
00:39:45,00:39:46,"""More rhinestone."""
00:39:46,00:39:47,"""More rhinestone."""
00:39:47,00:39:48,"""More rhinestone."""
00:39:48,00:39:49,"""Newdy."""
00:39:49,00:39:55,"- That was, it was a guy called Lefty Frizzle, who was more rhinestone."
00:39:55,00:39:58,"But a few more rhinestone, ""Newdy, put more rhinestone."""
00:39:58,00:40:01,"- The rhinestones are stones from the Rhine, by the way, just in case you didn't know what a"
00:40:01,00:40:02,rhinestone was.
00:40:02,00:40:03,- I never knew what they were.
00:40:03,00:40:04,- I don't know about this.
00:40:04,00:40:09,"- It's now just a piece of coloured glass, basically, but they were kind of proper rock"
00:40:09,00:40:10,crystals.
00:40:10,00:40:13,"- Apparently you just get these little colourful pebbles on the banks of the Rhine, and people"
00:40:13,00:40:15,used to put them on stuff as decoration.
00:40:15,00:40:18,"- Yeah, at these days, you melt them on to clothes with heat."
00:40:18,00:40:19,- Do you?
00:40:19,00:40:22,"- So you have a little, you have a little glue layer, and then you just heat them up and"
00:40:22,00:40:23,you just shove them on.
00:40:23,00:40:32,"- But yeah, ""Newdy,"" he was born, ""Newter Cop Clierenko"" in Kiev in 1902, and he moved to"
00:40:32,00:40:37,"America, but he was really into his tailoring, and then when he was processed, supposedly"
00:40:37,00:40:41,"according to the story, when he was processed through Ellis Island, they changed his name to"
00:40:41,00:40:46,"""Newdy,"" which I'm not sure how often that actually happened, and usually it was people"
00:40:46,00:40:48,just changing their name to sell more American themselves.
00:40:48,00:40:49,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:49,00:40:56,"- And then he came to America, opened an underwear shop selling G-strings and pasties to strippers."
00:40:56,00:40:57,- Very poor brainies.
00:40:57,00:40:58,- West Cornwall wasn't it?
00:40:58,00:40:59,- Yeah.
00:40:59,00:41:00,- But they're called pasties.
00:41:00,00:41:01,- They are called pasties.
00:41:01,00:41:02,- They are called pasties.
00:41:02,00:41:03,- They are called pasties.
00:41:03,00:41:04,"- Oh, okay."
00:41:04,00:41:05,"- I just thought, okay."
00:41:05,00:41:09,"He's going to get hungry, and they are quite handy, because that whole meal running through"
00:41:09,00:41:10,them.
00:41:10,00:41:14,"- If you've got one hand on the pole, and the other one is hold onto the cross."
00:41:14,00:41:19,"- I think the strippers in Bolton do put pasties on their nipples, but."
00:41:19,00:41:24,"- So they're all the more popular for it as well, people love pasties, they love pasties."
00:41:24,00:41:28,"He then had surgery when he was in his 40s and lost all of his money, because he had to"
00:41:28,00:41:29,pay for the surgery.
00:41:29,00:41:31,- And America.
00:41:31,00:41:32,"- And then he thought, what am I going to do?"
00:41:32,00:41:35,I'm going to make suits for celebrities.
00:41:35,00:41:39,And he got in touch with a guy called Tex Williams.
00:41:39,00:41:43,"Tex Williams auctioned off his horse, and used the money to buy Newdy a sewing machine,"
00:41:43,00:41:45,and they went into business together.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"- Well, you wouldn't have got on with Tex."
00:41:47,00:41:48,- Yeah.
00:41:48,00:41:49,- Both love horses.
00:41:49,00:41:50,- Yeah.
00:41:50,00:41:54,- I'm going to start coming to the ride stunts.
00:41:54,00:41:55,- Yeah.
00:41:55,00:42:01,"- But yeah, I'd never heard this guy, and he was pretty big deal."
00:42:01,00:42:02,- Quite the guy.
00:42:02,00:42:05,"Apparently, at the early stage when he was selling the pasties to strippers, he sold also"
00:42:05,00:42:09,"Taylor Mae's G-strings, which you don't, you don't them to not fit."
00:42:09,00:42:10,- Right.
00:42:10,00:42:14,- If you got round your knees.
00:42:14,00:42:18,"- Oh, was that happened again?"
00:42:18,00:42:23,I was just eating a pasty.
00:42:23,00:42:28,"And the name Newdy became sort of synonymous with these amazing suits, and actually the Newdy"
00:42:28,00:42:34,"name is still alive thanks to his granddaughter, Jamie Newdy, who seems to have taken his first"
00:42:34,00:42:38,"name as her surname now, not quite sure how."
00:42:38,00:42:43,"So now they do still exist, but they mostly make t-shirts and coffee mugs with the name"
00:42:43,00:42:44,Newdy on it.
00:42:44,00:42:46,They don't really make so many clothes anymore.
00:42:46,00:42:51,"- His cars were absolutely bananas, and I only say this, because I've seen one of them,"
00:42:51,00:42:57,"I think in the flesh, in the Nashville country music hall of fame."
00:42:57,00:42:58,"- Oh, wow."
00:42:58,00:42:59,- And it's...
00:42:59,00:43:00,- When did you know that?
00:43:00,00:43:01,- I don't even know.
00:43:01,00:43:02,"- I mean, just 15 years ago."
00:43:02,00:43:04,- I thought I'd heard every one of your anecdotes.
00:43:04,00:43:05,"- No, no, no."
00:43:05,00:43:06,This is...
00:43:06,00:43:08,- Why do you keep telling us the same three then?
00:43:08,00:43:16,- I feel like we're having distracted from my fourth anecdotes on these facts anyway.
00:43:16,00:43:20,"- Yeah, it's an insane car."
00:43:20,00:43:25,"It's got 18 pistols distributed around it, and kind of built into the doors and things"
00:43:25,00:43:27,like that on the inside.
00:43:27,00:43:31,"It's got 1,200 silver dollars glued on at various points all over it."
00:43:31,00:43:33,My memory might be tricking me.
00:43:33,00:43:35,I feel like it's got a bison's horns on the front.
00:43:35,00:43:36,"- Oh, wow."
00:43:36,00:43:39,- You'd have the Mercedes sign or whatever.
00:43:39,00:43:40,It's got one of those.
00:43:40,00:43:42,"I mean, it's an absolutely loopy car."
00:43:42,00:43:44,"- Well, you would plug in your electric vehicle."
00:43:44,00:43:45,- That's right.
00:43:45,00:43:46,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:46,00:43:47,- Yes.
00:43:47,00:43:48,- Yeah.
00:43:48,00:43:51,- He was very obsessed with fashion as a lot of celebrities are.
00:43:51,00:43:54,"Tom, you are one of the best-addressed comedians."
00:43:54,00:43:57,"- Well, that's very generous to say fashion."
00:43:57,00:44:00,I've always liked shooting and tailoring.
00:44:00,00:44:01,I don't know.
00:44:01,00:44:04,"I think it makes me feel a certain way, sort of stand in a certain way."
00:44:04,00:44:07,And I guess that's part of what tailoring has always done for people.
00:44:07,00:44:10,"But yes, I do like to wear a suit."
00:44:10,00:44:13,"- Yeah, I used to wear ties a lot."
00:44:13,00:44:16,And I've stopped in recent years and I feel less good as a human as a result.
00:44:16,00:44:18,So I think I might get back into it.
00:44:18,00:44:20,"- Well, they're a flash of color, really, I suppose,"
00:44:20,00:44:22,or a variation in the...
00:44:22,00:44:25,"- Well, you always wore a black one then you'd have."
00:44:25,00:44:26,- Just black.
00:44:26,00:44:27,- With a white shirt.
00:44:27,00:44:28,- With a white shirt.
00:44:28,00:44:29,"- Yeah, so remember those days."
00:44:29,00:44:30,- Yes.
00:44:30,00:44:31,- Very Mormon.
00:44:31,00:44:31,- That was you.
00:44:31,00:44:33,(laughing)
00:44:33,00:44:34,"- Safe time, doesn't it?"
00:44:34,00:44:35,- Yeah.
00:44:35,00:44:36,- So you don't have to change your clothes at the end of the gig.
00:44:36,00:44:39,You can just get out and fly the audio somewhere out and yeah.
00:44:39,00:44:40,- Pop the old badge on.
00:44:40,00:44:42,(laughing)
00:44:42,00:44:44,- I don't know those books.
00:44:44,00:44:47,"- I do, whoa, what's interesting is I read a study recently."
00:44:47,00:44:53,"Is apparently when you wear a tie, it stops your blood flow by 7.5%."
00:44:53,00:44:54,"- Well, that gets me high."
00:44:54,00:44:56,So I like that.
00:44:56,00:44:57,- That's what I'm missing.
00:44:57,00:44:58,- That's what happened there.
00:44:58,00:45:00,- To your brain.
00:45:00,00:45:02,"- Yeah, so you've been operating with constricted blood flow to your brain."
00:45:02,00:45:03,- For some years.
00:45:03,00:45:07,- They did MRI scans on 15 men who were wearing ties and 15 men who weren't.
00:45:07,00:45:09,- I'm actually going with the MRI machine.
00:45:09,00:45:10,(laughing)
00:45:10,00:45:11,- Very smart clothes.
00:45:11,00:45:12,(laughing)
00:45:12,00:45:14,- Should I pop my umbrella but I haven't.
00:45:14,00:45:15,(laughing)
00:45:15,00:45:18,"- Yeah, and that's what they concluded."
00:45:18,00:45:22,"So it is letting less, and it will give you headaches and dizziness and nausea if you wear"
00:45:22,00:45:23,a tie more.
00:45:23,00:45:24,- Wow.
00:45:24,00:45:25,- And if you wear it to me.
00:45:25,00:45:26,"- Right, yeah."
00:45:26,00:45:32,- I find now it's evolved into the work where if men going to work is rather
00:45:32,00:45:40,"than suits, it is some skinny chinos, a quarter-zip jumper with a shirt underneath open neck,"
00:45:40,00:45:42,and then a lanyard instead of a tie.
00:45:42,00:45:46,"So people don't wear a tie because they're lanyards, which I think will evolve maybe one day"
00:45:46,00:45:47,into something else.
00:45:47,00:45:51,"But we've all become quite utilitarian, I think, in our clothing, I think we've all become"
00:45:51,00:45:52,quite practical.
00:45:52,00:45:55,"I think for a long time there was an air of flamboyance, about a lot of men's clothing,"
00:45:55,00:45:57,which isn't afforded so much now.
00:45:57,00:46:00,"I think if you went out, even me wearing a tie, people were like, ""Oh, all right."""
00:46:00,00:46:01,"- Oh, yeah."
00:46:01,00:46:04,"- Well, I don't know if you're having a wedding today."
00:46:04,00:46:09,"- I'm literally just wearing the same thing as my dad might have worn, but you can't seem"
00:46:09,00:46:10,like.
00:46:10,00:46:11,- Yeah.
00:46:11,00:46:14,"- I was thinking to tight clothes or snug clothes and clothing innovations, because it's"
00:46:14,00:46:19,really fun if you look in someone like new scientist for all the clothing inventions.
00:46:19,00:46:21,"It's all like, ""This is the clothing of tomorrow."""
00:46:21,00:46:27,"And so in 2007, Philips, the electronics people, they invented auto snug clothing, right?"
00:46:27,00:46:28,Which is where?
00:46:28,00:46:34,"The clothes with muscle wires woven through the fabric, you'd put it up to the power, and"
00:46:34,00:46:38,it adjusts until your trousers are the exact right size for you.
00:46:38,00:46:39,- That's good.
00:46:39,00:46:41,- And then you know exactly what trousers you need from now on.
00:46:41,00:46:42,"- Oh, yeah, I think that's good."
00:46:42,00:46:43,- I think that's useful.
00:46:43,00:46:44,"I can imagine it going wrong, though."
00:46:44,00:46:45,"- Oh, absolutely."
00:46:45,00:46:46,Yeah.
00:46:46,00:46:51,"- To hundreds of people who were electrocuted very badly, very badly scorched during this."
00:46:51,00:46:53,"But it's also, we have a tape measure."
00:46:53,00:46:55,We have the technology to find out what size trousers someone needs.
00:46:55,00:47:02,"- It's not like until 2007 people were like, ""This is like trousers, that's why I'm out."""
00:47:02,00:47:05,"- The other thing is, it's different in different countries, right?"
00:47:05,00:47:12,"So I bought a pair of large underpants in America and a pair in Japan, and I could tell you,"
00:47:12,00:47:17,"one of those, way too big for me, and the other one, I can't even squeeze them too."
00:47:17,00:47:24,- This is why James has his G-strings tailor in here.
00:47:24,00:47:27,"- Look, you know of putting metal inside clothes."
00:47:27,00:47:28,That's what Lame is.
00:47:28,00:47:30,I didn't know this.
00:47:30,00:47:38,"So Newdy in 1957 made Elvis Presley a $10,000 gold Lame suit."
00:47:38,00:47:43,"And Lame is where you get your fabric, but then you put metallic fibers into it."
00:47:43,00:47:44,- Oh.
00:47:44,00:47:46,- I didn't know what that was.
00:47:46,00:47:49,Where else is Lame used in the sporting world?
00:47:49,00:47:55,"- Gold being woven through-- - Or any metal woven through fabric, not horse-raining."
00:47:55,00:47:57,"- Aerodynamics, stuff."
00:47:57,00:47:58,- Nope.
00:47:58,00:47:59,- I've got a wild theory.
00:47:59,00:48:00,- Go on.
00:48:00,00:48:01,- Is it tennis rackets?
00:48:01,00:48:03,"- I thought you were going to get it, but no."
00:48:03,00:48:05,"- For me, a one?"
00:48:05,00:48:06,"- No, it's not that."
00:48:06,00:48:12,"It's used in fencing, because you need to, when someone stabs you with the sword, they"
00:48:12,00:48:15,"need to connect it, and so it's the threads inside."
00:48:15,00:48:20,So all fences use Lame suits in the same way that Elvis did.
00:48:20,00:48:23,- That suit of Elvis is amazing.
00:48:23,00:48:27,"- Did you see that in your-- - I don't remember if I saw it, because they've got a pair"
00:48:27,00:48:32,"of the blue-sweight shoes, you know, they've got a load of costumes and outfits."
00:48:32,00:48:35,"But that is, if you're listening to this and you want to know what that gold Lame suit"
00:48:35,00:48:39,"is, it's on the front cover of an album which gets referred to as 50 million Elvis fans"
00:48:39,00:48:40,can't be wrong.
00:48:40,00:48:45,"It's a very, very funny album title, and it's this mad gold suit."
00:48:45,00:48:47,- It's very loose.
00:48:47,00:48:52,"It doesn't fit in with all well by a modern standard, but it's, yeah, I think about it."
00:48:52,00:48:53,I can't remember if I saw it there.
00:48:53,00:48:56,"- If there was a lightning storm, wouldn't it?"
00:48:56,00:48:57,"- Oh, yeah."
00:48:57,00:48:58,"- It'd be like, ""Absolutely."""
00:48:58,00:48:59,- Absolutely.
00:48:59,00:49:00,- At the road.
00:49:00,00:49:08,"- I found a comedy play from the 1805 called The Taylors, which was shown at Covent Garden."
00:49:08,00:49:14,"And it was kind of taken a piss out of young dandies at the time, and they were so annoyed"
00:49:14,00:49:19,with it that they all turned up and started booing the actors and stuff.
00:49:19,00:49:25,"And not only that, they decided to throw, not rot 'em tomatoes, but scissors and cutting"
00:49:25,00:49:26,shears.
00:49:26,00:49:27,- Whoa!
00:49:27,00:49:30,"- At the actors throughout the road, they roped 'em at night."
00:49:30,00:49:31,- Wow.
00:49:31,00:49:37,"- Grizzly Adams is on stage too, and he has a terrible night."
00:49:37,00:49:39,- Isn't that mad?
00:49:39,00:49:40,- That's crazy.
00:49:40,00:49:46,- But how interesting to think of people who want to associate with sort of foppishness and
00:49:46,00:49:48,not being particularly agitated.
00:49:48,00:49:49,- Yeah.
00:49:49,00:49:52,"- But young dandies is like, you know, muds, rockers, that kind of--"
00:49:52,00:49:53,- Yeah.
00:49:53,00:49:54,- But isn't it?
00:49:54,00:49:55,Yeah.
00:49:55,00:49:59,"I know it's an obvious thing to say, but one realises that the things we see today have"
00:49:59,00:50:00,all happened before.
00:50:00,00:50:01,- Yeah.
00:50:01,00:50:05,"- Kind of protest all those kind of groups of people being, you know, people being outrageous"
00:50:05,00:50:09,"in their dress sense as a protest, or as an expression, and--"
00:50:09,00:50:10,- Yeah.
00:50:10,00:50:11,- I've got a riddle for you guys.
00:50:11,00:50:12,"- Oh, give it."
00:50:12,00:50:13,- Okay.
00:50:13,00:50:15,Carol Spencer was a fashion designer.
00:50:15,00:50:21,"She spent 30 years working for the same client design encodes, but her clothes have never"
00:50:21,00:50:23,been worn by a human.
00:50:23,00:50:24,- Riddle.
00:50:24,00:50:25,- Riddle means.
00:50:25,00:50:26,It's like a lacy.
00:50:26,00:50:27,"- Well, it's up there."
00:50:27,00:50:28,- It wasn't a lacy.
00:50:28,00:50:29,- So it's nice.
00:50:29,00:50:30,- A horse saddle.
00:50:30,00:50:32,It wasn't a horse related.
00:50:32,00:50:34,- James would have got it in the bin.
00:50:34,00:50:35,- James would have got it in the bin.
00:50:35,00:50:37,- I think I've got it.
00:50:37,00:50:38,- God.
00:50:38,00:50:39,- I know my hit rate with the tennis racket.
00:50:39,00:50:40,- Yeah.
00:50:40,00:50:41,- Back and that up.
00:50:41,00:50:44,I think it's a living Madame Tussaud's wax work.
00:50:44,00:50:46,And with the fashion changing of the first--
00:50:46,00:50:47,- Like the sauna.
00:50:47,00:50:48,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:50:48,00:50:49,- Exactly.
00:50:49,00:50:50,"- They keep the wax work, but they don't."
00:50:50,00:50:51,"- Oh, that's--"
00:50:51,00:50:52,- And they change that.
00:50:52,00:50:53,- You're so close.
00:50:53,00:50:54,- Oh.
00:50:54,00:50:55,- You're so close.
00:50:55,00:50:58,"It's a model of a person, but it's not Madame Tussaud."
00:50:58,00:50:59,"- Oh, is it the--"
00:50:59,00:51:00,- Is it Lenin?
00:51:00,00:51:01,He's kept in the cabinet.
00:51:01,00:51:02,- It's not.
00:51:02,00:51:03,- Lenin's fashion.
00:51:03,00:51:04,- Yeah.
00:51:04,00:51:05,- It's a--
00:51:05,00:51:06,- Lenin's fashion.
00:51:06,00:51:07,- Yeah.
00:51:07,00:51:08,- Lenin's fashion.
00:51:08,00:51:09,- Yeah.
00:51:09,00:51:10,- Okay.
00:51:10,00:51:11,- Mr. February revolution.
00:51:11,00:51:12,- It's Lenin again.
00:51:12,00:51:16,"- It's like the fashion show, where they're all healed out."
00:51:16,00:51:17,- Sherman L. Summer.
00:51:17,00:51:18,Look.
00:51:18,00:51:21,- Isn't the mannequin piece.
00:51:21,00:51:23,- It's not the mannequin piece.
00:51:23,00:51:24,- Right.
00:51:24,00:51:25,Shall I tell you all?
00:51:25,00:51:26,"- Oh, I feel it."
00:51:26,00:51:27,We are close.
00:51:27,00:51:28,I'll tell you this one more clue.
00:51:28,00:51:29,- Okay.
00:51:29,00:51:32,- A client was only 11 1/2 inches high.
00:51:32,00:51:33,- Oh.
00:51:33,00:51:34,- She's fashionable.
00:51:34,00:51:36,She's got a lot of outfit changed.
00:51:36,00:51:37,- Bobby.
00:51:37,00:51:38,- Oh.
00:51:38,00:51:39,- Oh.
00:51:39,00:51:40,- Bobby.

00:51:43,00:51:44,"- No, no, no, no."
00:51:44,00:51:45,- To play the game.
00:51:45,00:51:46,- That was a bit longer.
00:51:46,00:51:49,- I'm so sorry for truncating in Brooklyn.
00:51:49,00:51:50,"- No, no, no, no."
00:51:50,00:51:51,- I'm sure.
00:51:51,00:51:53,- We've all got homes to go too.
00:51:53,00:51:54,"- For other people listening, we're like,"
