1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,000
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,840
 of No Such Things A Fish, where we were joined by the legend.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,200
 The national treasure already, I think,

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,040
 but definitely future national treasure, Tom Allen.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,000
 - That's right, Tom is absolutely fantastic

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,960
 as you're about to hear.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,760
 He's a flanner, he's a man of out town.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,680
 Among many other things, you might not think it

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,960
 'cause he's so dapper, but he's also a gardener.

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,680
 - You might not think it 'cause he speaks so nicely,

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,120
 but he's also a podcaster.

13
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,960
 (laughing)

14
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,160
 - And he has a new podcast out, it's called "Pottering" with Tom Allen,

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,720
 and he gets a celebrity to his garden,

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,640
 be it Nish Kumar, be it James A. Castor, be it Natalie Cassidy,

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,600
 and they talk about gardening.

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,240
 - It's lovely, and I think they do some gardening as well, actually.

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,040
 - He probably has some Natalie Cassidy Bagonias,

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,760
 get some Nish Kumar, Asperd Distras.

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,840
 - Lovely, can James name a third plunge?

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,520
 - Absolutely not, but if you want to hear Tom's podcast,

23
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,240
 then go to wherever you get your podcast,

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,320
 it's called "Pottering" with Tom Allen,

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,600
 and it's absolutely fantastic,

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,360
 but Andy, we have some more news.

27
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,840
 - That's right, the other thing to say is that,

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,720
 in a week's time, we're gonna be doing the first

29
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,560
 ever Club Fish Quiz.

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,200
 Now, this is for people who've joined Club Fish

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,760
 at the top tier, the friend of the podcast tier,

32
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,160
 we are gonna be doing a quiz globally, I imagine.

33
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,200
 We suspect hundreds of thousands may be attending,

34
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,320
 and you can be one of them, it's gonna be on Zoom,

35
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,360
 or an equivalent streaming platform.

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,600
 We've all been writing our questions,

37
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,120
 we've been showing them to each other,

38
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,840
 we've been coming up with silly games,

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,160
 it's gonna be so much fun.

40
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,000
 So mark your diaries or your calendars

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,080
 for Friday, the 23rd of January, 7pm British time,

42
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,320
 but if you're around the world,

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,440
 we'd love to see you there as well.

44
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,480
 - Gonna be so much fun, we can't wait to do it.

45
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,320
 But anyway, please enjoy this week's episode

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,040
 of "No Six Things A Fish" with the incredible Tom Allen,

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
 on with the podcast.

48
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,120
 - On with the show.

49
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,980
 (upbeat music)

50
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:05,720
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

51
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,400
 of "No Such Thing" as a Fish, a weekly podcast

52
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,040
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.

53
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,080
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,600
 with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Tom Allen.

55
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,880
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

56
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,680
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,840
 and in a particular order, here we go.

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,680
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Tom.

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,200
 - In September 1945, a small booklet was discovered

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,840
 in the main offices of the third Reich in Berlin,

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,240
 or Reich, if you're from southern Germany.

62
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,640
 In Berlin, it was a secret list of 2,820 British individuals

63
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,600
 who'd be rounded up in the event

64
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,040
 of a successful invasion, and Noel Coward found his name

65
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,680
 on page 34.

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,800
 - Oh, okay, why were they going after him?

67
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,240
 - Well, firstly, I think anybody in an entertainment

68
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,760
 would be annoyed that they had to go so far.

69
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,600
 (laughing)

70
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,440
 - Mind your own name.

71
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,240
 - There's only one thing worse than being on the Nazis,

72
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
 deathless.

73
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,720
 (laughing)

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,080
 - And that's not being on the, I can't believe

75
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,320
 you're quoting Oscar Wilde in a Noel Coward section.

76
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,600
 - Oh yeah, we'll get onto that.

77
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,200
 - Well, they just kind of crossed over

78
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,040
 in a sort of Dalai Lama way, yeah, yeah.

79
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,880
 - Is that what was he?

80
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,520
 - Very Dalai Lama way.

81
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,280
 - Have you ever looked at who died just before you were born?

82
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,520
 - No, I never had.

83
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,360
 - Oh, that's a funny question.

84
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,200
 - There was one of the popes, the one that was before

85
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,240
 John Paul II, so I think it was, just before I was born,

86
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,440
 you died, so I'm not saying anything else,

87
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,360
 but I am Catholic, so.

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,320
 - I think you could still do it as well.

89
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
 - I can.

90
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,040
 - Well, no, I've been excommunicated, as we've said,

91
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,880
 but.

92
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,320
 - But what a comeback story that would be for you.

93
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,280
 - Yeah, and actually the Pope.

94
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,880
 - I can change the rules if I'm the Pope.

95
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,440
 - Yes, yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

96
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,240
 - Let's get back to Noel Coward.

97
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
 - I know, I like that.

98
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,960
 I was suddenly panicking about who died in 1983.

99
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,840
 - Yeah, lots.

100
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,320
 - Mount Batson, no, that was '70, late '70s.

101
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,600
 - Yes, Mount Batson was, I went straight through.

102
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,880
 - I just got to see what this is.

103
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,880
 (laughing)

104
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,480
 - We should quickly say who Noel Coward is.

105
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,840
 Noel Coward, very famous way around.

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,240
 - Yes, I didn't bother to say that.

107
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,840
 I just assumed all your listeners would know who he was.

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,240
 - Yeah, but you know better than anyone,

109
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,120
 'cause you're part of the Noel Coward Society, so.

110
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,840
 - Well, I have been involved, but I, the, the,

111
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,240
 Noel Coward, yeah, usually seen as a playwright

112
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,640
 and a writer of songs, particularly Mad Dogs and Englishman.

113
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,920
 He was also an actor, musician, and an author,

114
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,320
 as well, he wrote a novel.

115
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,000
 Well, he was wanted by the sinister Amst grubber,

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 V1, V1, G1, I don't know what,

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,240
 I don't know what that looked like.

118
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,880
 - I was like a music channel in Germany.

119
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,160
 - Amst grubber, V1, G1, real common.

120
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,480
 A department, it was a department

121
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
 that evaluated intelligence material.

122
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,480
 Well, he was a, it turned out, a British spy,

123
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,520
 and his cover had apparently been blown,

124
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,480
 and if the war had gone differently,

125
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,520
 well, the man known the world over further,

126
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,480
 the song "Don't Let's Be Be See to the Germans"

127
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,080
 could have ended his days in front of a firing squad.

128
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,200
 - Wow.

129
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,440
 - So, yeah, and when the list was discovered,

130
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,200
 amongst other people who the Nazis didn't like,

131
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,560
 for various reasons,

132
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,760
 and the author, Rebecca West, sent him a telegram

133
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,680
 to say, "My dear, the people who were to be seen dead with."

134
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,000
 - Which I thought was very cool, that's very good.

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,520
 - This song, interestingly,

136
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,160
 got him in a bit of trouble back home, didn't it?

137
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,000
 - Yeah.

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,840
 - What was it called again?

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,160
 - It was called, "Don't Let's Be Be See to the Germans."

140
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,040
 - Yeah, so, came out during World War II.

141
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,440
 It was a satire.

142
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,280
 It was--

143
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,120
 - It was signed by the BBC.

144
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,200
 - Exactly, because the satire didn't quite cross,

145
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,560
 as well as he hoped it would.

146
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,160
 They thought that he was actually genuinely saying that.

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,920
 - I was excited about it, because I think it's the only thing

148
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,720
 that Noel Coward has in common with the prodigy

149
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,440
 I found there, songs "Smack My Bitschup",

150
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,160
 which was also banned by the BBC.

151
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,720
 - Can you imagine him reading "Smack My Bitschup",

152
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,600
 Noel Coward, in his accent?

153
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
 - He'd have--

154
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
 I think he'd have gustyed up the lyrics a bit.

155
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,680
 He'd have made them cleverer.

156
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,960
 (laughing)

157
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,440
 - But I always wondered how he got away with being a spy,

158
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,880
 'cause he was so flamboyant, right?

159
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,960
 It seems like, as a spy, you have to hide away a little bit.

160
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,120
 - Well, Radio 4 did a dramatized version of what he was like.

161
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,560
 I think a lot of it, as well, was propaganda work

162
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,240
 in North America, obviously, the US.

163
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,000
 I think to Ghana support for getting on board with the war effort,

164
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,480
 which I know wasn't the case at the beginning.

165
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,520
 So I think he was seen as sort of a special envoy,

166
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,680
 I suppose, as much as anything.

167
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,280
 I don't think he was going behind enemy lines.

168
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,120
 - No, but I'm--

169
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,280
 - Hamburg.

170
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,200
 - He'd been recruited even before the war started.

171
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
 I think there was someone called Sir Robin Vancetart,

172
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
 who was running--

173
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,400
 - Sounds German, actually.

174
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,760
 - Yes, but he was at the foreign office

175
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,600
 and he was recruiting various people

176
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,080
 to go about their business in Europe, quite successful people,

177
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,320
 and then report back on the national mood,

178
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,080
 what people were saying, just sort of soft intelligence,

179
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,920
 as it were, not, you know.

180
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,800
 You don't need to observe this tank column

181
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,400
 where it's going, this ball bearings factory.

182
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,760
 It was just like what you're hearing in social conversations.

183
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,560
 And I think Howard was sacked partly

184
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,440
 because he was too public in his maneuverings,

185
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,640
 and also because everyone looked at him,

186
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,960
 and this is after the war started,

187
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,600
 and they just thought we've just got to a load of parties

188
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,280
 and man, happening, you're really letting the side down.

189
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,920
 And actually he was doing the war work, like he was doing.

190
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,280
 - He was, he was really completely shamed about it, I think.

191
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,120
 - Yeah.

192
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,320
 - I think the Daily Mail covered about it.

193
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,160
 - Oh.

194
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,720
 - And said like, they said outrage, going over there,

195
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,680
 spitting all this money, with public money, going to parties.

196
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,280
 - The Daily Mail, who's departed,

197
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,960
 and all of that, so he's just before the war.

198
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,800
 - Ooh.

199
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
 - Well, it might be, yeah, I mean.

200
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,640
 - Yeah.

201
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,480
 - But I should check, I should check,

202
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,200
 it was the Daily Mail that it's out there and I'm lovely.

203
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,000
 - Well, he used to, again, trouble with the daily express.

204
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,280
 - Yeah, and actually this is another war connection.

205
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,160
 So he wrote the screenplay and started a movie

206
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,440
 called In Which We Serve, which was a really good movie,

207
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,480
 often got used to get them morale up

208
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,800
 and show how the war was going.

209
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,320
 And he kind of based the character on your past life.

210
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,160
 - Not that.

211
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,880
 - Yeah, so he consulted with him and that was largely part of it.

212
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,960
 Can we say who Matt Baffin was again?

213
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,800
 - Sorry, yeah.

214
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,960
 - He was, oh, oh, Matt Baffin, I think.

215
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
 - Oh, Matt Baffin.

216
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,240
 - Lord, Matt Baffin, wasn't he?

217
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,080
 - Oh, yeah.

218
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,080
 - And he was, he was Prince Philip's uncle by loose connection.

219
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,000
 I haven't researched it.

220
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,600
 - By big, the brother of his mother?

221
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,840
 Or, yeah, so it's kind of like loosely unclear to him.

222
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,600
 - Is it like one of those uncles who's like,

223
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
 just friends with your parents?

224
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,680
 - I have a feeling if we're, yeah, exactly.

225
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
 - And you were shocked at some point to find out

226
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,280
 that wasn't your uncle.

227
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,680
 I remember this when I was five.

228
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,600
 I found out Uncle Joe wasn't my uncle.

229
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,800
 And I was a bit outraged.

230
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,960
 - Uncle Joe.

231
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,800
 - Yeah.

232
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
 - It was a cup of coffee.

233
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,480
 - Yeah, so anyway, Matt Baffin was part of this thing

234
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,680
 with Noel Coward.

235
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,360
 And the daily express started ridiculing the production,

236
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,560
 saying that how could you have Noel Coward play

237
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,480
 a high ranking general in the army?

238
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,880
 - He's a captain.

239
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,000
 - A captain, right?

240
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,160
 - In the Navy.

241
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,360
 - Yeah, yeah, he didn't come across.

242
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,960
 - Not above that, don't carry on.

243
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,720
 (laughing)

244
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,560
 - I feel like I'm going quite lost in it.

245
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,920
 - Sorry, no, I'm barely tripping it up.

246
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,320
 Well, I mean, I'm pretty sure he's a captain.

247
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,160
 I haven't watched it before.

248
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,520
 - I haven't seen the movie and you're a part of the system.

249
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,680
 - You're being absolutely pancake

250
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,120
 between Tom's love of Noel Coward

251
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,480
 and my love of military rank.

252
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
 (laughing)

253
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,320
 - Sorry.

254
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,880
 - Just bring a bit of golf into it.

255
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,720
 - Absolutely.

256
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,160
 (laughing)

257
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
 - Yeah.

258
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,520
 - That sounds quite out of time to me, Noel Coward.

259
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,040
 - I know his name and I know he's part of the plays,

260
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,840
 but I do, you mentioned Oscar Wilde before.

261
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,400
 I do play some as part of that era,

262
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,520
 but he was in things like the Italian job.

263
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,360
 - Yes.

264
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,600
 - He was, you know, in the '60s.

265
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,440
 - Yeah.

266
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,360
 - That was his, I think, his last acting role.

267
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,200
 - Right.

268
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,600
 - He was born in 1899.

269
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,320
 And he served briefly in the First World War,

270
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,280
 which I didn't know.

271
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,880
 'Cause again, I think of him as like,

272
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,920
 he's wearing his pajamas, maybe dressed in gown,

273
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,880
 he's smoking a pipe through a long holder,

274
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,640
 he's writing brilliant dialogue,

275
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,280
 he's writing plays like blindspirit and hay fever, you know.

276
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,120
 - Yeah.

277
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,960
 - Witt.

278
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,720
 - But he served in this company called the "Artists Rifles."

279
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,080
 - Just sounds awful, doesn't it?

280
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,000
 I think it was so, yeah, I think it was a place where

281
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,160
 maybe I don't want to be unkind,

282
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,160
 maybe slightly less useful fighters were replaced.

283
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,640
 And I think he wasn't ever put in any sort of position

284
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,240
 where he'd have to do anything to practical.

285
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,120
 - Well, he got himself out of it quite fast.

286
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,080
 - And this was only in, I mean, he was born in 1899.

287
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
 So I think he was signed up aged 18,

288
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,640
 or maybe conscripted, I'm not sure.

289
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,440
 He was discharged for Neurosthenia,

290
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,200
 which was very much a catchal you've got nerves.

291
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,040
 - Sort of tying a piece of string around his finger.

292
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,880
 - Why?

293
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,960
 - I guess it's sort of stress.

294
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,800
 - I stress it.

295
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,160
 - A stressful situation, definitely.

296
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,400
 - It'd be a tick talk about it now.

297
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
 - But I think part of the reason he got so involved

298
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,480
 in World War II as a spy or whatever,

299
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,400
 is 'cause he was a bit embarrassed by the fact

300
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,680
 that he'd gone into World War I quite young

301
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,240
 and then had to leave quite quickly.

302
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,280
 - Yeah, his company suffered lots of casualties

303
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,560
 in the last two months of the war.

304
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
 I mean, hundreds, you know?

305
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,320
 So I think, and that was after he'd been

306
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,600
 invalidated out as it were.

307
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
 So yeah.

308
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,440
 - Yeah.

309
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,720
 - I love the main thing about him outside of his plays

310
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,640
 and his acting and his songs is the gossip.

311
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,000
 He was Mr. Annicdote, basically.

312
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,320
 He's like the Charles Brandrath of his day.

313
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
 (laughing)

314
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,160
 - Charles will be very happy.

315
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,800
 - Charles Brandrath was absolutely in love with that.

316
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,640
 (laughing)

317
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,960
 - Oh my goodness.

318
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,000
 What a Christmas breath of joy.

319
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,680
 - Well, we'll clip this out inside of him.

320
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,520
 - Yes.

321
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,480
 - Oh, and so there's one great war Annicdote from him,

322
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,640
 which is he said, he never forgot the sight

323
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,320
 of Coco Chanel entering a Paris air raid shelter

324
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,840
 followed by a maid who carried a gas mask

325
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,240
 on a velvet cushion.

326
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,080
 (laughing)

327
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,640
 - That's wonderful stories.

328
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,600
 - It was a time when people did,

329
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,440
 well, I know there was a structure of class,

330
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,560
 but I think if you did transcend those structure,

331
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,160
 you would just end up being at parties with these people.

332
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,000
 - Yeah.

333
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,840
 - I don't know, maybe it would be the same now,

334
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
 but I mean, just like--

335
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,680
 - 'Cause his mother, I think, had some vague sort of connection

336
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,880
 to the aristocracy.

337
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,720
 - Oh, is that really?

338
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,840
 - Maybe like an uncle or something.

339
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,680
 (laughing)

340
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,840
 - Yeah, she, like, feel martial hague

341
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,280
 was a distant cousin of hers,

342
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,840
 and her sister married the nephew of Sir Henry Ponsonby,

343
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,800
 who was private secretary to Pequim Victoria.

344
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,640
 - Oh.

345
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,040
 - So there were kind of, like, close to high society,

346
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,680
 but not quite in there until he became very famous

347
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,360
 and really hot-knobbed with the--

348
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,000
 - Yeah, 'cause I thought they were kind of,

349
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,680
 like, pretty lower middle class,

350
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,040
 grew up in Southwest London,

351
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,720
 and very suburban, reasonably poor,

352
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,480
 and his mum was a real stage mum.

353
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,560
 - Yeah, she was the Mrs. Worthington, I think.

354
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
 - Perhaps she was the real Mrs. Worthington.

355
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,480
 - She pushed it.

356
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,240
 - Mrs. Worthington is--

357
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,440
 - Oh, is a song, don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs. Worthington.

358
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,240
 It's kind of a song told from the position of a producer,

359
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,880
 I think, in an audition, but essentially,

360
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,280
 kind of saying to this very pushy stage mum,

361
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,880
 she's talentless, please stop moving in.

362
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,400
 (laughing)

363
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,360
 But Noel Carrot's career happened partly

364
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,920
 because of a medium spiritual guidance.

365
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,640
 So his mum went to a show at the Coliseum,

366
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,240
 an American celebrity medium, Anna Eva Fey,

367
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,640
 and his mum asked, "Should Noel, young Noel here,

368
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,400
 "go back to school, or should he stay as a child actor?"

369
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,680
 And from beneath this big sheet that she was--

370
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,200
 (laughing)

371
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,040
 - A medium, Anna Fey said, "Keep acting!"

372
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,960
 - Oh, wow, I didn't know that.

373
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,960
 - So that was a, I think, I suspect they probably would have kept him acting,

374
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,360
 even if the medium had said, "Go back to school!"

375
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
 (laughing)

376
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,680
 And I suspect the ambition was strong.

377
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,400
 - Still though, I haven't seen Blife's spirit,

378
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,680
 but I think it's a very satirical about the spiritualism movement.

379
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,720
 - Is that right?

380
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,680
 Is that sort of parodying it?

381
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,200
 - It was a big drive towards it.

382
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,440
 It wasn't in the 20s and 30s, I think.

383
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
 - Yeah, yeah.

384
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,600
 - Where people would have--

385
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,680
 - Yeah, I guess, I mean, that probably makes sense, doesn't it?

386
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,400
 But my dad even remembers his grandmother having her friends around for like a say-on.

387
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
 - Really?

388
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
 - Which, isn't it?

389
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,680
 - Like they'd go into the back room or something, yeah.

390
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,440
 And all these women would come in and try and contact with dad.

391
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
 - Yeah.

392
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,960
 - But it was kind of seen as his thing that people do quite socially.

393
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

394
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,280
 - It was like a book club of its day.

395
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,440
 - The book club of its day, exactly.

396
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,280
 - Exactly.

397
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,160
 His writing was extraordinary, the speed at which he wrote,

398
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,040
 because there were so many knoll-coward plays, there was a story that in 1935,

399
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,880
 in the summer of that year alone, he wrote nine plays.

400
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,520
 That's how quick he knocked out a song called "I'll See You Again,"

401
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,920
 which Frank Sinatra recorded while he was stuck in a taxi, in a traffic jam.

402
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,840
 - It's similar to, I think, Elton John, in the way that he,

403
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,920
 apparently writes his songs in five minutes.

404
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
 - That's the tangents and tiaras.

405
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,760
 It's something about that creativity.

406
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,960
 It's something quite useful about actually not allowing lots of time.

407
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
 - Yes.

408
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,120
 - He also says the songs slightly come to him, he doesn't claim to have written.

409
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,120
 - Is that Elton John now?

410
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
 - Yeah.

411
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,160
 - Yeah, Elton John will say that the songs sort of arrived to him.

412
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,680
 - After the war, just to go back to his sort of post-war life.

413
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,600
 He spent a lot of time with the Navy.

414
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,000
 - And in fact, I bet he did.

415
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,960
 - During the war as well.

416
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,200
 He frequently would just hitch a lift on royal Navy ships.

417
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
 - Really?

418
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
 - Yeah, he would just...

419
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,240
 - So he had to get on that.

420
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
 - Well, how did he get off?

421
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,440
 - He said, he spent a lot of his life as a tax exile because he was so financially successful

422
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,200
 in the first half of his life that a lot of his life was just moving around to different,

423
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,120
 low tax jurisdictions.

424
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,640
 And he once joined a ship in Bermuda called HM Dragon, or HMS Dragon, maybe.

425
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,000
 And the captain said, "What the hell are you doing on board this ship?"

426
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,640
 And Coward replied that he was, quote, "exhausted overworked on the verge of a nervous breakdown

427
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,040
 and had joined the ship in order to be nurse back to health and strength and waited on hand

428
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
 and foot."

429
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,440
 And the captain not only gave him a lift to Trinidad, he gave him loads more lifts later on.

430
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
 - That's so nice.

431
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
 - I became friends.

432
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
 - This was just like...

433
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,600
 - As well as a naval captain, you might be quite pleased that if somebody so witchy and

434
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,400
 famous was suddenly on board.

435
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
 - Oh, yeah, great.

436
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
 - That's the entertainment.

437
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
 - Yeah, absolutely.

438
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,400
 - Yeah, better than the inser or whatever.

439
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
 - You say he was rich.

440
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
 He was so rich.

441
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,160
 He was making £50,000 a year.

442
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,520
 The equivalent of which today that would be £15 million per year that he was making.

443
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
 - In the late 20s.

444
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
 - In the late 20s.

445
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,200
 And he was really burning through it, though.

446
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,400
 So he had a lot of financial problems, hence moving to tax havens like Jamaica, where he

447
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,040
 moved right next door to Ian Fleming.

448
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
 - Oh, yes.

449
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
 - Yeah.

450
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
 - I love this spy.

451
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
 - Yeah.

452
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,720
 - And there are stories that he turned down the role of Doctor No, that that was actually

453
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,240
 offered to him for the first bond.

454
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,640
 - He was just called Doctor before they offered it to him.

455
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:44,120
 - So Doctor No, Coward, that's the original name of the character.

456
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,320
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

457
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,680
 My fact this week is that there is a Marvel superhero called The Gardener, whose superpower

458
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,000
 is that he is insanely good at gardening.

459
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,640
 So is it that he can grow things very, very fast?

460
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:08,920
 - No, it's more that he is obsessed with gardening, and he is almost an immortal.

461
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,920
 - Gardening is supposed to be good for you if you're getting older, like it helps you live

462
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
 longer, doesn't it?

463
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
 - Exactly.

464
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,960
 - Well, yeah, and potentially forever.

465
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
 - It is, it is.

466
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
 - It is forever.

467
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
 - You give enough time to it.

468
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,240
 So he's part of this group called The Elders of the Universe, and basically the other

469
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,040
 one who is really good at bowls.

470
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:34,840
 - There's another one who is just really good at being racist.

471
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,960
 - It's a really ruins Christmas, yeah.

472
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,600
 - Captain Crossword, come and say.

473
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,920
 - Yeah, okay, these are each of them with the last survivors of their own race, and these

474
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,040
 were racers that evolved just after the Big Bang.

475
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,400
 And the idea is that they have extended life spans, but not because they're immortal,

476
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,320
 but because of a single-minded obsession with a hobby.

477
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
 - Oh.

478
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,240
 - That can be, I'll back that, there you go.

479
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,880
 So his hobby was Gardening and Horticulture, and the idea is that he would go from planet to

480
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,080
 planet, and he would spend sort of up to a year sort of terraforming it, making it greener

481
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,080
 guys.

482
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,280
 - Yeah, that seems like very, might come into his own actually, you know, environmentally

483
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
 conscious age.

484
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
 - There you go.

485
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
 Well, he should be a bigger character, because actually in the original-

486
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,360
 - I think I should blame him.

487
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,640
 - In the original stories, he and the other elders all had the Infinity Gems, which is

488
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,360
 what Thanos collects as part of the main Avenger storyline in order to wipe out all of-

489
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,720
 - Oh, so he's one of the original holders of one of these?

490
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,000
 - Yeah, because some reason when it came to the movie adaptation, the Gardner didn't quite

491
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 get.

492
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 - Pretty cool.

493
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 That's what I'm thinking.

494
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 - Yeah, I'm talking about that.

495
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 - Yeah, I love that.

496
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 - Yeah.

497
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,160
 - The other thing with like a big wide-brimmed hat, you know, the sort of thing that old ladies

498
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
 used to have.

499
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
 - Oh, yes.

500
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,160
 - Yeah.

501
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
 - Gloves on-

502
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,960
 - Obviously, floral gloves in one of those kneeling pads.

503
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
 - I've got one.

504
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,640
 They are very useful.

505
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,160
 The best ones are when you've got a handle at the side to push yourself up.

506
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
 - Ooh.

507
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
 - Yeah, they give you those.

508
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,320
 - It's like an upside-down piano stool, really.

509
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
 That's really helpful.

510
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
 - That's really helpful.

511
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,520
 - And then you've got to just have a couple of beats to be like, "Oh, with my knees."

512
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
 - Yeah, absolutely.

513
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,240
 - We're talking to a seasoned Gardner here, I'm guessing.

514
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,000
 - Well, I salty, maybe, if it's just about seasoned.

515
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,280
 - You do have a Gardner, though, that you love to test.

516
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
 - I've got an into Gardening.

517
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,000
 I like to use the past tense of God.

518
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 And I've gotten into Gardening in the last sort of four years since having my own place.

519
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,240
 For a long time, I lived with my parents, and I didn't have my own space then.

520
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,840
 So now I do, and it's quite nice just to, well, just mess around, really.

521
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,400
 I'm proud and obvious with it, but I find it really interesting.

522
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,360
 - So on Famous Gardners, who's the most famous Gardner in the UK?

523
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,360
 - Alan Titchfars.

524
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,360
 - Correct.

525
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,320
 - What has Alan Titchfars got in common with Elvis Presley?

526
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
 - Ooh.

527
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
 - Ooh.

528
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
 Okay.

529
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
 - That's obvious.

530
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,320
 - Both sex gods.

531
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
 - Okay, I'll give you that.

532
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,720
 It's slightly related to that.

533
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,720
 - Poets?

534
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,320
 - He writes poetry, Titchmush.

535
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,320
 - It's not that.

536
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
 - Okay.

537
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
 - Very vintage ale.

538
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
 - Well, Elvis had a song about it.

539
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
 Titchmush was done up for years, wasn't he?

540
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
 - Yes, yeah.

541
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
 - That's why he has on his tattoos.

542
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
 - Yeah.

543
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,320
 - Come us them up for the show across.

544
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,320
 - One for everybody.

545
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
 - And he killed him.

546
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,320
 - It's how he got into gardening, was burying the bodies.

547
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:33,320
 - The answer is that the lower halves have been censored on television.

548
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,320
 - Really?

549
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,320
 - So Elvis, obviously, when he became big, they would only show him from the waist up so

550
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
 that people didn't get too excited.

551
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
 But Alan Titchfars has been...

552
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,320
 - They were sent over the waist out.

553
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,320
 - They have censored his trousers because he wears jeans.

554
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,320
 And in North Korea, they don't like jeans being shown because it's a symbol of America.

555
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
 - Oh.

556
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,320
 - So they show his programs, but they blur out his trousers.

557
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 - Wow.

558
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,320
 - But that means he's free to broadcast Winnie the Pooh style.

559
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,320
 - Yes.

560
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
 - Yes.

561
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
 - So the North Korean networks.

562
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
 - He's there.

563
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
 - We have to paint his legs blue.

564
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,320
 - I've seen Titchmush do karaoke.

565
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
 - Have you, in person?

566
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
 - In person.

567
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
 - Wow.

568
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
 - I don't mean to cling.

569
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
 - What did he say?

570
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,320
 - Something green-green grass.

571
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
 - It was...

572
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,320
 Oh, what's the one I killed the man in Reno?

573
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,320
 - Gangsters paradise as well.

574
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:41,320
 - Yeah, I don't remember the song, but it was, yeah.

575
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
 - Wow, that's very cool.

576
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,320
 Well, there's other reasons that Alan Titchmush is a sex god.

577
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,320
 - Yeah, by the way, which is that as well as writing over something like 70 gardening books,

578
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
 he's written a series of novels.

579
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
 - Yes.

580
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
 - Yes, they are.

581
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
 - Are they seen?

582
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
 - Are they?

583
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
 - Yeah, in fact.

584
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
 - Absolutely.

585
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,320
 - I don't know if you remember, but we had Los Andres read Morrissey's contribution to the world of sex scenes.

586
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
 - Tom, do you mind?

587
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,320
 - I feel a little extra.

588
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
 - Oh, here we go.

589
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,320
 - Well, I think I have met Alan a few times and he's always very charming, as you imagine.

590
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,320
 And he did say to me, because I was talking to him about audiobooks.

591
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
 - Oh, yeah.

592
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,320
 - And he did say he was very aware of his more intimate scenes when he had to sit in a booze.

593
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
 - Oh my God.

594
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
 - And read them out.

595
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
 - To an engineer.

596
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,320
 So as an example of what he might have been reading, there is a little bit here.

597
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,320
 She planted moist hot kisses all over his body.

598
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,320
 Beads of sweat began to appear on Guy's forehead for it.

599
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:47,320
 As it became more entangled in the lissum limbs of this human bower constrictor.

600
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:57,320
 For fully 15 minutes, their mutual passion heightened with groans, size, and liquid noises.

601
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
 - Oh my God.

602
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
 - Wow, I can't believe it.

603
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,320
 - Can I just say, when you're describing lens, why'd go for the one out of all that doesn't have any lens?

604
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
 - Oh, lissum.

605
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
 - Lissum limb.

606
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
 - I don't know what lissum means.

607
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
 - What l'd say?

608
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
 - I've never heard that word before.

609
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,320
 - Lissum is kind of young and firm and strong, isn't it?

610
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
 - Is it?

611
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
 - Oh, sorry.

612
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
 - I love that.

613
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
 - Titch marshes.

614
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
 - Too high brow for us.

615
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
 - We don't know the vocabulary.

616
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
 - I know.

617
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
 I bet he learned.

618
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
 - He's a very educated man.

619
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,320
 - I like the way it begins with she planted kisses.

620
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
 - Yeah.

621
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
 - Like because obviously he's a gardener.

622
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
 - Absolutely.

623
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
 - Oh, every.

624
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
 - Well, he.

625
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
 - Yeah.

626
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,320
 - So he was runner up in the 1998 Literary Review Bad Sex Awards.

627
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,320
 And you're right.

628
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
 He felt very uncomfortable reading them.

629
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:45,320
 He said particularly with the sheet of glass between you and a very large bearded man twiddling

630
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
 knobs as you say the words.

631
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
 - Gosh.

632
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
 - He found it uncomfortable.

633
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,320
 - I think it's a bit unfair that bad sex thing because they go for slabs, don't they?

634
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,320
 There must be loads of like not famous people who are writing worse.

635
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
 - Absolutely.

636
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
 - What?

637
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
 - To be fair, the winner that year was Sebastian Forks.

638
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
 - I was going to say bird song.

639
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
 - Yeah.

640
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
 - It's got lots of that.

641
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
 That's very interesting.

642
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
 - Bird song is very fruity, doesn't it?

643
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
 - Very fruity.

644
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,320
 - I remember reading that when I was about 17 and thinking, "Oh gosh, that seems like a lot

645
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
 of effort."

646
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
 (laughs)

647
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,320
 - Can I ask you about a couple of things you might or might not use in your garden, Tom?

648
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,320
 - Oh, yeah.

649
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,320
 - Absolutely.

650
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
 - Should we give it a go?

651
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
 Right.

652
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,320
 Do you ever use worm poo tea bags?

653
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
 - No, I think I have heard of this sort of thing.

654
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
 - So cool.

655
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
 - Worms are very important, aren't they?

656
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,320
 - Worms are vital.

657
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
 - And obviously they eat soil.

658
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
 They poo it out.

659
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
 You know, they help.

660
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
 - So do I.

661
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,320
 - They do their aerate.

662
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
 - They have all sorts of stuff.

663
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,320
 You can get tea bags with worm castings, aerate worm poo, where you literally make a cup of tea

664
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
 out of it for your plant.

665
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
 And it really helps your plant.

666
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
 - Really?

667
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
 - Yeah.

668
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,320
 Lion urine?

669
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,880
 - Well, that's the thing, isn't it, because people say to keep away foxes or other animals

670
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
 if you want them out of your garden.

671
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
 - You need an apex predator.

672
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,880
 - You need an apex.

673
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
 You can't.

674
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
 The people say, "Oh, just go and weigh in the garden."

675
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,360
 And they're like, "No, they need men to weigh in the garden.

676
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,680
 It's male urine," they respond to.

677
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
 And apparently, that's not...

678
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
 That's not going to do it.

679
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,980
 Apparently, you need to go to the zoo and ask, "Yeah, I'm going to get a lion to

680
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,980
 weigh into a cup."

681
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,980
 Oh, you could get the piss off plant, have you heard of that?

682
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,980
 - What's that?

683
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,260
 - Piss off plant is a plant that's native to Southern and Eastern Africa.

684
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,480
 And it is a plant that supposedly repels dogs and cats from coming near it because of the

685
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,300
 eroma that it emits.

686
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,420
 So if you had that in your garden, most likely, they would smell it and never come back

687
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,420
 again.

688
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,420
 - Well, I'll get one of those.

689
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,420
 That's pretty good.

690
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,420
 - That's a great idea.

691
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,420
 - Do you have an ornamental hermit in your garden?

692
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:36,260
 - No, I don't have anything like that was like a sort of a little house, wasn't it word

693
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,260
 a little.

694
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,700
 - Well, back in the 18th century, this was a real life human that you would bring into your

695
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
 garden.

696
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,700
 Yeah.

697
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,100
 They would dress like a druid and they would just be sat and they would have a contract

698
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:52,620
 to live there and negotiations for roaches and negotiations every autumn as the reproaches.

699
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,620
 - Yeah.

700
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,980
 Well, look, I'm not going to do this for another year unless you revise my terms.

701
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:03,380
 - Yeah, it's been in 1797, there was a thing, the hermit is never to leave the place or hold

702
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,980
 conversation with anyone for seven years during which he is neither to wash himself or cleanse

703
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,700
 himself in any way whatsoever.

704
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,100
 - Yeah, my agent's got a problem with his claws, right?

705
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,500
 - Yeah, it lives a bit further down the garden, another little folly.

706
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
 - Yeah.

707
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,380
 - Do we know why people did that?

708
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,140
 - Well, I think it's a kind of, it would be like landed gentry would have this person.

709
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,140
 You wouldn't have it in your garden in that knee, would you?

710
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:34,220
 - No, exactly, I think what it is is the hermit is a symbol of a wild and ancient way of living

711
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:41,220
 and it's kind of they are reflecting on history and on humanity and on progress and the countryside

712
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,300
 and the wilderness and I think that's why it's cool to have a hermit because they kind of

713
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,300
 hark back to that.

714
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,300
 - Yeah.

715
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,260
 It's been that kind of sentimentality isn't it around that kind of pastoral?

716
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,260
 - Yeah.

717
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,620
 - There was one place which had a hermit which turned out to be a mechanical hermit, genuinely,

718
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:02,420
 I think it was the 18th century aristocrat, quite clearly it was just a hermit.

719
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:07,740
 It was like a very, very, very crude model robo hermit that they had in there with those things.

720
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,820
 - Here's another famous gardener.

721
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:17,420
 So this is a king called Error Imiti who was in ancient Samar and what would happen in

722
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,580
 ancient Samar is you would get people who would tell the future and if they saw a bad

723
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,580
 omen, like maybe the king's going to die, you would put someone else on the throne for

724
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,300
 100 days and then you take over again.

725
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,420
 So this guy, Error Imiti decided to put his gardener on the throne for 100 days because

726
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:39,500
 there'd been a bad omen and then he died after eating some hot porridge and his gardener

727
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,420
 then reigned ancient Sumer for 24 years.

728
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,420
 - Wow.

729
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
 - Wow.

730
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,660
 - Just because he didn't blow on it.

731
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,660
 - I guess so.

732
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
 - It's a good holy porridge.

733
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,660
 - Yeah.

734
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,660
 - That's incredible.

735
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,660
 - I know.

736
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,780
 - I guess it wasn't a successor in place who would not have taken over.

737
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,540
 - Well, he's the king now, right?

738
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
 - Yeah, you're right.

739
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,020
 - So what are you going to do?

740
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,020
 - That's so funny.

741
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,020
 - That's so funny.

742
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:10,860
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

743
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,980
 - My fact is, in 1920, the king of Greece died after trying to break up a fight between

744
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,700
 a dog and a monkey.

745
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:24,540
 This is the only royal death I've found which involved a monkey at all, actually, little

746
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,460
 end of fight between a dog and a monkey.

747
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:32,980
 This was King Alexander of Greece and he had a dog, he had a German shepherd and one

748
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:41,020
 day he was having a walk in the palace grounds and I think a barberry ape, quite an aggressive,

749
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,460
 yeah, not a titler of a monkey, you know, this isn't like bubbles.

750
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,460
 - No, no, no, no, this is, this is proper-

751
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:52,060
 - They're very naughty barberry apes, I can say, they only, yeah, it's naughty.

752
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,780
 - They'll kill your dog.

753
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,180
 - Like slaughtering your dog in front of you.

754
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,180
 - Or your king.

755
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,140
 - They have the man to brawl to them, they, and I went up there with a pusher, with my

756
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,140
 daughter who is very young and basically they will just steal everything.

757
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,260
 Everything that's not held down, they'll steal it.

758
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,260
 - You got her back though.

759
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,100
 - No, she still lives there.

760
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:17,020
 - She is the egg queen now.

761
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,220
 - That's why I'm about to put Brexit, I don't want it to be Spanish.

762
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:26,900
 - Yeah, so anyway, this ape and this dog were in a fight, he was trying to separate them

763
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,780
 at which point the apes wife turned up and sunk fangs into King Alexander's leg.

764
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
 - Oh no.

765
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,300
 - And I think some days later he died, he'd become ill and they had swithered over what

766
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,500
 to do the doctors and so.

767
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:44,220
 - So he died and this produced huge geopolitical consequences with Churchill later wrote, "It

768
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,420
 is perhaps no exaggeration to remark that a quarter of a million persons died of this

769
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
 monkey's bite."

770
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
 - Really?

771
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,420
 - Yeah.

772
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,420
 - Wow.

773
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,620
 - Because they've spent the Greek Civil War.

774
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,980
 - Well, it all led to a lot of unhappiness and conflict inside Greece.

775
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,780
 They got back the previous king.

776
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,780
 - Because what had happened?

777
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,580
 The previous king was very pro-German and his son was pro-German, his eldest son.

778
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:11,620
 So Britain and Russia and probably France got rid of those guys and brought in this guy who

779
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,500
 wasn't expecting to be King.

780
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,300
 He was just thought he was going to spend his days gardening or just having a lovely life.

781
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,300
 - Having a lovely life.

782
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,300
 - Yeah.

783
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,020
 - And then suddenly he's King and then, okay, well now we've got our puppet who's in charge

784
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,020
 but then he dies and then they bring the old people back and it all goes to shit.

785
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,860
 - That's basically what happened, yeah.

786
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,340
 He fought this war against the Turks which went disastrously wrong, hundreds of thousands

787
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
 of deaths.

788
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,900
 We've kicked out and then the European great powers just started picking the Greek royal family

789
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:45,940
 and then eventually things got a bit more democratic and the Greeks in 1862 had this vote for

790
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:52,740
 a new king, a kind of national referendum and they almost universally, they chose Prince

791
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,940
 Alfred of England who I believe was one of Victoria's sons.

792
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,460
 He won 95% of the votes cast against the Turks.

793
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,460
 He said no, no thank you.

794
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,460
 I don't want to do it.

795
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,100
 - You used for the throne of Greece, yeah but imagine if we have a nice house somewhere

796
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,100
 wouldn't it?

797
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,100
 - I'm sure he's already got a nice house.

798
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,100
 - You're right.

799
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
 Well yeah was that?

800
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
 - That was 1862.

801
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,780
 - So this is not happening in the 1860s, wasn't it?

802
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,780
 - Oh.

803
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,780
 - Going on.

804
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,780
 - Bucket.

805
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,780
 - Was that unification of Germany around then?

806
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,780
 - Yes.

807
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,780
 - And then formation of Italy.

808
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,780
 - Yes.

809
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,780
 - Also my house was built.

810
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,780
 - Really?

811
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,780
 - So some major events.

812
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,780
 - Major, major things.

813
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,780
 - So your garden.

814
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,780
 - That was laid out.

815
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,780
 - The garden was created, yeah.

816
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,780
 - By Prince Alfred.

817
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,780
 - And the corner from me and Napoleon III came to live.

818
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,780
 - Is that so?

819
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,780
 - Really?

820
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,780
 - Wow.

821
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,780
 - So we've asked Tate a huge decade.

822
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,780
 - Huge decade.

823
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,180
 - But basically Alfred was pressured into saying no, because Britain, France and Russia had

824
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,180
 all to creed.

825
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,180
 Nobody's going to accept this throne.

826
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,180
 - Yeah.

827
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,180
 - Nobody wants it, get over it.

828
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,900
 And every candidate said no until they got to Prince Wilhelm of Denmark of the Blocksburg

829
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,780
 house and he had received six votes from the entire population of Greece and he was

830
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,100
 then chosen to be the king.

831
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,100
 - That is unfortunate.

832
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
 - I know.

833
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,460
 - The 18th highest voted person in that list.

834
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,460
 - You came 18th.

835
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,460
 - Yeah.

836
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,900
 - But various people had just written a Russian king, please, or whatever they just selected,

837
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,900
 like they just listed it.

838
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,300
 So he came almost dead last.

839
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,580
 And yet, he then was king for 50 years.

840
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,780
 - King Elet kingface was there.

841
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,780
 - Is it?

842
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,780
 - Who they really wanted.

843
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,780
 - Yeah.

844
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,260
 - And then he lost it until 1913, he lost it 50 years.

845
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
 - 1930.

846
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
 - 1913.

847
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
 - 1913.

848
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,740
 - He was assassinated by either a socialist or a lunatic, and it's not clear which apparently.

849
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,740
 - Oh yeah.

850
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,740
 - Not necessarily.

851
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
 - Not to get political.

852
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,740
 - Yeah.

853
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,460
 - A lot of assassinations happening around that sort of area, wasn't there that time?

854
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,460
 - Oh yeah.

855
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,460
 - Yes.

856
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,460
 - He loved it.

857
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,460
 - A vexed, a vexed period.

858
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
 - A vexed period in the south-east of Europe.

859
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,460
 - Yeah.

860
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,740
 - I found another monkey bite death.

861
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,740
 - Oh.

862
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,740
 - Did you?

863
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,380
 - It's an expect-to-find one, but I tried hard and I got there.

864
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,980
 - Do you know the character Grizzly Adams?

865
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,980
 - Grizzly Adams.

866
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,980
 - He was.

867
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,980
 - I wasn't like a vampire.

868
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,980
 - No, no.

869
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,700
 - So Grizzly Adams in America, I think he's quite a well-known.

870
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,460
 Historical character.

871
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,900
 So he was a Californian mountain man.

872
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,340
 He was a trainer of Grizzly bears.

873
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,100
 And he used to just do acts, you know, kind of like a Petey Barnum kind of thing.

874
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,380
 So he made pets with quite a few of these bears that he thought were friendly.

875
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,380
 - I can't see this going.

876
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,380
 - Yeah.

877
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,380
 - Can't see where this is going to go.

878
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,380
 - And he was killed by a monkey.

879
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,380
 - Yeah.

880
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,380
 - Yeah.

881
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,380
 - So.

882
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,380
 Okay.

883
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,780
 Don't take your eyes off the threat of the monkeys.

884
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,780
 - Yeah.

885
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:30,780
 - So he got attacked by Grizzly in Sierra Nevada, in the monkey was one who set the Grizzly

886
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,780
 on him.

887
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,300
 - No, monkey comes in later.

888
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:38,980
 So his scalp was dislodged in this attack and it left a silver dollar size impression in

889
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,380
 his skull just above his forehead.

890
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,900
 Then he had all these other Grizzlies that he made friends with.

891
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:50,000
 Anyway, he was re-insured several times in the head and it opened up the wound which meant

892
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 a bit of brain tissue where it's exposed and then, as he's still going with the bears,

893
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 stick.

894
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,200
 - He's still going with the bear stick.

895
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
 - Okay.

896
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,800
 - And then Grizzly added this on tour with a circus when a monkey that he was trying to train

897
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,800
 jumped up and beat him in the brain, not in the head in the brain.

898
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,440
 - Well, you don't have any nerves in your brain so you wouldn't even feel it.

899
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,440
 - Yep.

900
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
 - So anyway.

901
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,440
 - No, it was happening.

902
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
 I think.

903
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,200
 - Okay, from behind is possible.

904
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
 - And so he died.

905
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
 October 25th.

906
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
 - Oh, no.

907
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
 - 1860.

908
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
 - 1860.

909
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
 - 1860.

910
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
 - Yeah.

911
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
 - It was another thing.

912
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
 - It does.

913
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
 - Another thing.

914
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,680
 - How extraordinary does.

915
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,120
 - If you hadn't said it was a monkey, I wouldn't have seen that coming at all.

916
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
 - Yeah, I know, right.

917
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,200
 It's a real plot twist at the end there.

918
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,200
 - It really is.

919
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
 - Wow.

920
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
 Horrifying end.

921
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
 Here's some people.

922
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,120
 William III of England, Alexander III of Scotland, Prince Alfonso Portugal, Frederick

923
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,080
 Augustus II of Saxony.

924
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,100
 Matthew Jeffrey of Brittany is a Beller of Aragon, Leopold V of Austria, Louis IV of France,

925
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
 William the Conqueror.

926
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,880
 They all died the same way.

927
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
 - Monkeys.

928
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
 - Not monkeys.

929
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,880
 - Yeah.

930
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
 (laughing)

931
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,560
 - At what point do we start suspecting the monkeys?

932
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,360
 - Araratus of the day.

933
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,320
 - This is something that does away with lots of royalties.

934
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
 - And it's very guessable.

935
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
 - Oh.

936
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
 - Or is it gouged or something?

937
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,320
 - Yeah, gouged.

938
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,320
 - Gouged.

939
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
 - But that's a bit of a hog.

940
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
 - Yeah.

941
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,200
 - It's sort of explosion or some sort of, 'cause William the Conqueror did explode.

942
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,600
 - He did explode his death.

943
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
 - Yeah.

944
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,840
 - He got rather a beef, I think, to me.

945
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
 - Right.

946
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,720
 They couldn't bury him straight away.

947
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,120
 And so when the monks came to bury him in his concrete tomb, they sort of shoved him

948
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
 in it.

949
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
 - Oh.

950
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
 - And then he exploded.

951
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
 - Wow.

952
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
 - And the Conqueror.

953
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,120
 - I'm pretty sure, yeah.

954
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
 - William the Conqueror, yeah.

955
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
 He definitely exploded in the--

956
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,120
 - Conqueror.

957
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,120
 - Oh.

958
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
 - It wouldn't be Conqueror, no stone, sorry.

959
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
 - Oh yeah, okay.

960
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
 - That's a bit of the story you wanted to pick up.

961
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
 - The Romans had Conqueror.

962
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,280
 - I know the Romans had Conqueror, but I wasn't aware that--

963
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,440
 - Yeah, it was a brutalist--

964
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
 - It was a brutalist coffin.

965
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,720
 - I just went with something really silly.

966
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,560
 - Anyway, the answer is, falling off a horse.

967
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
 - Oh.

968
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
 - Oh.

969
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,800
 - That is a big old way that people died in the past.

970
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
 - Yes.

971
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,900
 - Alexander III probably was riding along a high treacherous coastal path, having drank

972
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,000
 a lot of bodo wine, and just went straight off it.

973
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 - Right.

974
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,040
 - I just jumped straight off it, yeah.

975
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,720
 You would think the horse would stop, but yeah.

976
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,680
 The problem is that quite often when these people die, there's a big sort of something happens

977
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,360
 afterwards, like happened with this Greek guy.

978
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:31,280
 So when Alexander III died, that started the first war of Scottish independence, essentially.

979
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
 - Right.

980
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,680
 - So you know, it's quite a big deal when these kings die, even though they're just people.

981
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,000
 - But what point is anyone suggesting a helmet for horse riding?

982
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 - Oh.

983
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 - I just--

984
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,240
 - You don't see that, I mean, apart from knights, you don't see people with like cycle helmets

985
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
 in the past, do you?

986
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,560
 - Yeah, but knights do have protection.

987
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,080
 You just think that I get how many regal deaths do they have to have before they say, I think

988
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,560
 we should say, if you're the king or queen, you have to wear a helmet on your horse.

989
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,560
 - Yeah.

990
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,560
 - Or how about seat belts?

991
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,560
 - Horse seat belts?

992
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
 - Yeah.

993
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
 - Horse belts.

994
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
 - Is that safer?

995
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,000
 - You're not going to fall if you're really tied tight.

996
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,760
 - If your horse falls over though, and your seat belt is on, I just wonder if there's five

997
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,440
 reggae to come along.

998
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,240
 - I feel like there might be a reason why the horse seat belt hasn't been invented.

999
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
 Or maybe it has.

1000
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,120
 - Stirrups is effectively the horse seat belt, because it really helps you hold yourself in

1001
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,600
 place when you're in the stirrups.

1002
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,000
 - Look at you, you've been riding the horse recently.

1003
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 - I've ridden one half.

1004
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 - I've ridden one half.

1005
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 - You've ridden one half.

1006
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,480
 - You're wearing it as Mr. equestrian.

1007
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,920
 - All I'm going to say is that go off any clefts, so, you know, despite how much border

1008
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
 wine you--

1009
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
 - Yeah.

1010
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,240
 - That's true, isn't it, how do people-- maybe this is a very graphic question, but how do

1011
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,440
 people die when they fall off a horse?

1012
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,400
 Do they get trampled in the legs?

1013
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,000
 - I think it's banged on my head.

1014
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 - Banged on my head.

1015
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,800
 - Yeah, because actually you're quite--

1016
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,960
 - Someone who's ridden a horse, I would say, but you would know, that's why I asked.

1017
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,720
 - You're quite high up.

1018
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
 - Oh yeah.

1019
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:01,720
 - And they do, like, my horse, at once they saw a lady horse, and so I started galloping

1020
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
 towards them.

1021
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
 - Oh no.

1022
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,280
 - I'm going to tell you a little bit more shit in my angle.

1023
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,560
 - One advantage for a horse ride, if it mounted the feet up, and you just have to sit there

1024
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
 like a horse passenger.

1025
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
 - That's amazing.

1026
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
 You're riding two horses at once.

1027
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,560
 That's absolutely incredible.

1028
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:28,400
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

1029
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,600
 - Okay, my fact this week is that one of the most popular celebrity tailors of the 1950s

1030
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,720
 was, ironically, called Newdy.

1031
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,760
 - This guy's a character.

1032
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,480
 - I reckon quite a few people might have heard of him, but I'd never heard of him before.

1033
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,800
 He was the first person to spot rhinestones on clothing.

1034
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,360
 So if you've ever seen one of those rhinestone cowboy suits that they wore in America, in

1035
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,080
 what, this 50, 60, 70s, he will have made it.

1036
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,680
 So he made suits for Elvis.

1037
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,680
 He made them four ships.

1038
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,680
 - Well, in Titch Marsh.

1039
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:11,240
 - Elton John, who we've mentioned before, Hank Williams, John Lennon, this is the who's

1040
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
 who.

1041
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
 - It's everybody.

1042
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
 - Yeah.

1043
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,240
 - Staggered.

1044
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,240
 - Liver Archie, I imagine.

1045
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,240
 - Oh, yeah.

1046
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,240
 - They never too much sure.

1047
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,240
 - It was sort of everyone.

1048
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:24,280
 In fact, I was thinking, because I, you know, the term rhinestone cowboy, Glen Campbell,

1049
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,600
 that was originally written by a man called Larry Weiss, and it was, it was in tribute

1050
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
 to Newdy.

1051
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
 - Really?

1052
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,680
 - That was a thing that all of these country music stars kept asking for.

1053
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,440
 They were like, "Newdy, more rhinestone, more rhinestone," when they were asking for their

1054
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,920
 suits to be tailored.

1055
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,800
 So that song was put in more of a sentence, though.

1056
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
 They just went, "More rhinestone."

1057
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
 "More rhinestone."

1058
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
 "More rhinestone."

1059
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
 "More rhinestone."

1060
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
 "More rhinestone."

1061
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
 "More rhinestone."

1062
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
 "Newdy."

1063
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,600
 - That was, it was a guy called Lefty Frizzle, who was more rhinestone.

1064
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,280
 But a few more rhinestone, "Newdy, put more rhinestone."

1065
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,800
 - The rhinestones are stones from the Rhine, by the way, just in case you didn't know what a

1066
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,800
 rhinestone was.

1067
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
 - I never knew what they were.

1068
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
 - I don't know about this.

1069
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,000
 - It's now just a piece of coloured glass, basically, but they were kind of proper rock

1070
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 crystals.

1071
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,440
 - Apparently you just get these little colourful pebbles on the banks of the Rhine, and people

1072
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,480
 used to put them on stuff as decoration.

1073
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,920
 - Yeah, at these days, you melt them on to clothes with heat.

1074
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,920
 - Do you?

1075
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,120
 - So you have a little, you have a little glue layer, and then you just heat them up and

1076
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,520
 you just shove them on.

1077
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:32,160
 - But yeah, "Newdy," he was born, "Newter Cop Clierenko" in Kiev in 1902, and he moved to

1078
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,800
 America, but he was really into his tailoring, and then when he was processed, supposedly

1079
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,800
 according to the story, when he was processed through Ellis Island, they changed his name to

1080
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,040
 "Newdy," which I'm not sure how often that actually happened, and usually it was people

1081
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,840
 just changing their name to sell more American themselves.

1082
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1083
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:56,480
 - And then he came to America, opened an underwear shop selling G-strings and pasties to strippers.

1084
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
 - Very poor brainies.

1085
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,480
 - West Cornwall wasn't it?

1086
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,480
 - Yeah.

1087
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,480
 - But they're called pasties.

1088
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,480
 - They are called pasties.

1089
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,480
 - They are called pasties.

1090
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
 - They are called pasties.

1091
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
 - Oh, okay.

1092
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
 - I just thought, okay.

1093
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,800
 He's going to get hungry, and they are quite handy, because that whole meal running through

1094
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
 them.

1095
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,680
 - If you've got one hand on the pole, and the other one is hold onto the cross.

1096
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,000
 - I think the strippers in Bolton do put pasties on their nipples, but.

1097
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,440
 - So they're all the more popular for it as well, people love pasties, they love pasties.

1098
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,800
 He then had surgery when he was in his 40s and lost all of his money, because he had to

1099
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
 pay for the surgery.

1100
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,280
 - And America.

1101
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,920
 - And then he thought, what am I going to do?

1102
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,920
 I'm going to make suits for celebrities.

1103
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,000
 And he got in touch with a guy called Tex Williams.

1104
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,840
 Tex Williams auctioned off his horse, and used the money to buy Newdy a sewing machine,

1105
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,280
 and they went into business together.

1106
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,120
 - Well, you wouldn't have got on with Tex.

1107
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,120
 - Yeah.

1108
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,680
 - Both love horses.

1109
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
 - Yeah.

1110
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,280
 - I'm going to start coming to the ride stunts.

1111
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
 - Yeah.

1112
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,080
 - But yeah, I'd never heard this guy, and he was pretty big deal.

1113
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
 - Quite the guy.

1114
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,400
 Apparently, at the early stage when he was selling the pasties to strippers, he sold also

1115
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,440
 Taylor Mae's G-strings, which you don't, you don't them to not fit.

1116
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
 - Right.

1117
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,200
 - If you got round your knees.

1118
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,640
 - Oh, was that happened again?

1119
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,320
 I was just eating a pasty.

1120
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:28,560
 And the name Newdy became sort of synonymous with these amazing suits, and actually the Newdy

1121
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,200
 name is still alive thanks to his granddaughter, Jamie Newdy, who seems to have taken his first

1122
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,440
 name as her surname now, not quite sure how.

1123
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:43,120
 So now they do still exist, but they mostly make t-shirts and coffee mugs with the name

1124
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,120
 Newdy on it.

1125
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,680
 They don't really make so many clothes anymore.

1126
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:51,920
 - His cars were absolutely bananas, and I only say this, because I've seen one of them,

1127
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,440
 I think in the flesh, in the Nashville country music hall of fame.

1128
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
 - Oh, wow.

1129
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,440
 - And it's...

1130
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,440
 - When did you know that?

1131
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,440
 - I don't even know.

1132
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,440
 - I mean, just 15 years ago.

1133
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,600
 - I thought I'd heard every one of your anecdotes.

1134
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
 - No, no, no.

1135
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,600
 This is...

1136
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,280
 - Why do you keep telling us the same three then?

1137
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:16,480
 - I feel like we're having distracted from my fourth anecdotes on these facts anyway.

1138
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,360
 - Yeah, it's an insane car.

1139
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:25,720
 It's got 18 pistols distributed around it, and kind of built into the doors and things

1140
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,080
 like that on the inside.

1141
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,760
 It's got 1,200 silver dollars glued on at various points all over it.

1142
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,200
 My memory might be tricking me.

1143
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,280
 I feel like it's got a bison's horns on the front.

1144
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,280
 - Oh, wow.

1145
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,400
 - You'd have the Mercedes sign or whatever.

1146
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,400
 It's got one of those.

1147
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,520
 I mean, it's an absolutely loopy car.

1148
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,640
 - Well, you would plug in your electric vehicle.

1149
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,640
 - That's right.

1150
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1151
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,640
 - Yes.

1152
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,640
 - Yeah.

1153
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,040
 - He was very obsessed with fashion as a lot of celebrities are.

1154
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,320
 Tom, you are one of the best-addressed comedians.

1155
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,880
 - Well, that's very generous to say fashion.

1156
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,800
 I've always liked shooting and tailoring.

1157
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
 I don't know.

1158
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,920
 I think it makes me feel a certain way, sort of stand in a certain way.

1159
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,760
 And I guess that's part of what tailoring has always done for people.

1160
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,200
 But yes, I do like to wear a suit.

1161
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,320
 - Yeah, I used to wear ties a lot.

1162
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,920
 And I've stopped in recent years and I feel less good as a human as a result.

1163
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,320
 So I think I might get back into it.

1164
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,760
 - Well, they're a flash of color, really, I suppose,

1165
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,800
 or a variation in the...

1166
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,160
 - Well, you always wore a black one then you'd have.

1167
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
 - Just black.

1168
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,160
 - With a white shirt.

1169
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,000
 - With a white shirt.

1170
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,160
 - Yeah, so remember those days.

1171
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,160
 - Yes.

1172
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,000
 - Very Mormon.

1173
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,840
 - That was you.

1174
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,320
 (laughing)

1175
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,320
 - Safe time, doesn't it?

1176
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,320
 - Yeah.

1177
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,320
 - So you don't have to change your clothes at the end of the gig.

1178
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,000
 You can just get out and fly the audio somewhere out and yeah.

1179
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,600
 - Pop the old badge on.

1180
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,760
 (laughing)

1181
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,960
 - I don't know those books.

1182
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,560
 - I do, whoa, what's interesting is I read a study recently.

1183
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:53,280
 Is apparently when you wear a tie, it stops your blood flow by 7.5%.

1184
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,880
 - Well, that gets me high.

1185
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,320
 So I like that.

1186
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,160
 - That's what I'm missing.

1187
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,640
 - That's what happened there.

1188
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,160
 - To your brain.

1189
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,880
 - Yeah, so you've been operating with constricted blood flow to your brain.

1190
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,880
 - For some years.

1191
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,800
 - They did MRI scans on 15 men who were wearing ties and 15 men who weren't.

1192
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
 - I'm actually going with the MRI machine.

1193
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,800
 (laughing)

1194
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,800
 - Very smart clothes.

1195
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,800
 (laughing)

1196
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,960
 - Should I pop my umbrella but I haven't.

1197
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,960
 (laughing)

1198
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,000
 - Yeah, and that's what they concluded.

1199
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,880
 So it is letting less, and it will give you headaches and dizziness and nausea if you wear

1200
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,880
 a tie more.

1201
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,880
 - Wow.

1202
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,880
 - And if you wear it to me.

1203
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,880
 - Right, yeah.

1204
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,660
 - I find now it's evolved into the work where if men going to work is rather

1205
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:40,660
 than suits, it is some skinny chinos, a quarter-zip jumper with a shirt underneath open neck,

1206
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,580
 and then a lanyard instead of a tie.

1207
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,600
 So people don't wear a tie because they're lanyards, which I think will evolve maybe one day

1208
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,600
 into something else.

1209
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,000
 But we've all become quite utilitarian, I think, in our clothing, I think we've all become

1210
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 quite practical.

1211
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,680
 I think for a long time there was an air of flamboyance, about a lot of men's clothing,

1212
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,340
 which isn't afforded so much now.

1213
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,500
 I think if you went out, even me wearing a tie, people were like, "Oh, all right."

1214
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,500
 - Oh, yeah.

1215
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,580
 - Well, I don't know if you're having a wedding today.

1216
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:09,400
 - I'm literally just wearing the same thing as my dad might have worn, but you can't seem

1217
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
 like.

1218
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
 - Yeah.

1219
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,900
 - I was thinking to tight clothes or snug clothes and clothing innovations, because it's

1220
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,380
 really fun if you look in someone like new scientist for all the clothing inventions.

1221
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,680
 It's all like, "This is the clothing of tomorrow."

1222
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:27,380
 And so in 2007, Philips, the electronics people, they invented auto snug clothing, right?

1223
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,860
 Which is where?

1224
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:34,200
 The clothes with muscle wires woven through the fabric, you'd put it up to the power, and

1225
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,340
 it adjusts until your trousers are the exact right size for you.

1226
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,340
 - That's good.

1227
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,340
 - And then you know exactly what trousers you need from now on.

1228
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,340
 - Oh, yeah, I think that's good.

1229
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,340
 - I think that's useful.

1230
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,740
 I can imagine it going wrong, though.

1231
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:45,740
 - Oh, absolutely.

1232
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,740
 Yeah.

1233
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:51,300
 - To hundreds of people who were electrocuted very badly, very badly scorched during this.

1234
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,140
 But it's also, we have a tape measure.

1235
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,780
 We have the technology to find out what size trousers someone needs.

1236
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:02,780
 - It's not like until 2007 people were like, "This is like trousers, that's why I'm out."

1237
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,100
 - The other thing is, it's different in different countries, right?

1238
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:12,980
 So I bought a pair of large underpants in America and a pair in Japan, and I could tell you,

1239
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,740
 one of those, way too big for me, and the other one, I can't even squeeze them too.

1240
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:24,500
 - This is why James has his G-strings tailor in here.

1241
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,660
 - Look, you know of putting metal inside clothes.

1242
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,660
 That's what Lame is.

1243
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,180
 I didn't know this.

1244
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:38,500
 So Newdy in 1957 made Elvis Presley a $10,000 gold Lame suit.

1245
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,460
 And Lame is where you get your fabric, but then you put metallic fibers into it.

1246
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,460
 - Oh.

1247
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,100
 - I didn't know what that was.

1248
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,940
 Where else is Lame used in the sporting world?

1249
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:55,900
 - Gold being woven through-- - Or any metal woven through fabric, not horse-raining.

1250
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,700
 - Aerodynamics, stuff.

1251
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,700
 - Nope.

1252
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,700
 - I've got a wild theory.

1253
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,700
 - Go on.

1254
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,700
 - Is it tennis rackets?

1255
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,500
 - I thought you were going to get it, but no.

1256
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,060
 - For me, a one?

1257
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,300
 - No, it's not that.

1258
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:12,780
 It's used in fencing, because you need to, when someone stabs you with the sword, they

1259
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,980
 need to connect it, and so it's the threads inside.

1260
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:20,620
 So all fences use Lame suits in the same way that Elvis did.

1261
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,100
 - That suit of Elvis is amazing.

1262
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,780
 - Did you see that in your-- - I don't remember if I saw it, because they've got a pair

1263
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,100
 of the blue-sweight shoes, you know, they've got a load of costumes and outfits.

1264
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,220
 But that is, if you're listening to this and you want to know what that gold Lame suit

1265
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:39,220
 is, it's on the front cover of an album which gets referred to as 50 million Elvis fans

1266
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,220
 can't be wrong.

1267
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:45,780
 It's a very, very funny album title, and it's this mad gold suit.

1268
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,220
 - It's very loose.

1269
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:52,180
 It doesn't fit in with all well by a modern standard, but it's, yeah, I think about it.

1270
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,700
 I can't remember if I saw it there.

1271
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,100
 - If there was a lightning storm, wouldn't it?

1272
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,100
 - Oh, yeah.

1273
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,300
 - It'd be like, "Absolutely."

1274
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,300
 - Absolutely.

1275
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,300
 - At the road.

1276
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:08,740
 - I found a comedy play from the 1805 called The Taylors, which was shown at Covent Garden.

1277
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:14,420
 And it was kind of taken a piss out of young dandies at the time, and they were so annoyed

1278
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:19,420
 with it that they all turned up and started booing the actors and stuff.

1279
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:25,700
 And not only that, they decided to throw, not rot 'em tomatoes, but scissors and cutting

1280
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,700
 shears.

1281
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,700
 - Whoa!

1282
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,820
 - At the actors throughout the road, they roped 'em at night.

1283
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,820
 - Wow.

1284
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:37,660
 - Grizzly Adams is on stage too, and he has a terrible night.

1285
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,420
 - Isn't that mad?

1286
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,420
 - That's crazy.

1287
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:46,340
 - But how interesting to think of people who want to associate with sort of foppishness and

1288
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,740
 not being particularly agitated.

1289
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,740
 - Yeah.

1290
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,900
 - But young dandies is like, you know, muds, rockers, that kind of--

1291
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,900
 - Yeah.

1292
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,900
 - But isn't it?

1293
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,900
 Yeah.

1294
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,260
 I know it's an obvious thing to say, but one realises that the things we see today have

1295
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,260
 all happened before.

1296
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,260
 - Yeah.

1297
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,460
 - Kind of protest all those kind of groups of people being, you know, people being outrageous

1298
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,180
 in their dress sense as a protest, or as an expression, and--

1299
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,180
 - Yeah.

1300
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,620
 - I've got a riddle for you guys.

1301
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,620
 - Oh, give it.

1302
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,620
 - Okay.

1303
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,620
 Carol Spencer was a fashion designer.

1304
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:21,660
 She spent 30 years working for the same client design encodes, but her clothes have never

1305
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,580
 been worn by a human.

1306
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,580
 - Riddle.

1307
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,580
 - Riddle means.

1308
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,820
 It's like a lacy.

1309
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,820
 - Well, it's up there.

1310
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,820
 - It wasn't a lacy.

1311
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,820
 - So it's nice.

1312
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,820
 - A horse saddle.

1313
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,500
 It wasn't a horse related.

1314
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,020
 - James would have got it in the bin.

1315
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,020
 - James would have got it in the bin.

1316
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,020
 - I think I've got it.

1317
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,020
 - God.

1318
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,140
 - I know my hit rate with the tennis racket.

1319
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,140
 - Yeah.

1320
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,140
 - Back and that up.

1321
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:44,700
 I think it's a living Madame Tussaud's wax work.

1322
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,820
 And with the fashion changing of the first--

1323
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,820
 - Like the sauna.

1324
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,820
 - Yeah, exactly.

1325
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:49,820
 - Exactly.

1326
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,820
 - They keep the wax work, but they don't.

1327
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:51,820
 - Oh, that's--

1328
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,820
 - And they change that.

1329
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,820
 - You're so close.

1330
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:54,820
 - Oh.

1331
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,820
 - You're so close.

1332
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,780
 It's a model of a person, but it's not Madame Tussaud.

1333
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,780
 - Oh, is it the--

1334
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,780
 - Is it Lenin?

1335
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,780
 He's kept in the cabinet.

1336
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,780
 - It's not.

1337
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,780
 - Lenin's fashion.

1338
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,780
 - Yeah.

1339
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,780
 - It's a--

1340
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,780
 - Lenin's fashion.

1341
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:07,780
 - Yeah.

1342
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,780
 - Lenin's fashion.

1343
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,780
 - Yeah.

1344
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,780
 - Okay.

1345
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,780
 - Mr. February revolution.

1346
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,780
 - It's Lenin again.

1347
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,780
 - It's like the fashion show, where they're all healed out.

1348
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:17,780
 - Sherman L. Summer.

1349
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,780
 Look.

1350
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,780
 - Isn't the mannequin piece.

1351
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,540
 - It's not the mannequin piece.

1352
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,540
 - Right.

1353
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,540
 Shall I tell you all?

1354
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,540
 - Oh, I feel it.

1355
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,540
 We are close.

1356
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,540
 I'll tell you this one more clue.

1357
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,540
 - Okay.

1358
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:32,340
 - A client was only 11 1/2 inches high.

1359
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,340
 - Oh.

1360
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,340
 - She's fashionable.

1361
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,340
 She's got a lot of outfit changed.

1362
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,340
 - Bobby.

1363
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,340
 - Oh.

1364
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,340
 - Oh.

1365
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,340
 - Bobby.

1366
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,340
 - We get there.

1367
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,340
 - I'm sorry.

1368
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,340
 - You know itching to tell us.

1369
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,340
 - No, no, no, no.

1370
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,340
 - To play the game.

1371
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,340
 - That was a bit longer.

1372
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,340
 - I'm so sorry for truncating in Brooklyn.

1373
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,340
 - No, no, no, no.

1374
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,340
 - I'm sure.

1375
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,340
 - We've all got homes to go too.

1376
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,340
 - For other people listening, we're like,

1377
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,340
 it's obviously Bobby.

1378
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,340
 - Is it Lenin?

1379
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,340
 - Yeah.

1380
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,340
 - Okay.

1381
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,340
 That's it.

1382
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:06,340
 That is all of our facts.

1383
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,340
 - Thank you so much for listening.

1384
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,340
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1385
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,340
 about the things that we have said over the course of this podcast,

1386
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,340
 we can all be found online.

1387
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,340
 I'm on Instagram, on @Streiberland.

1388
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,340
 James.

1389
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,340
 - Come find me on Tech Talk.

1390
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,340
 No such thing as James Harkin.

1391
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,340
 Andy.

1392
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,340
 - Instagram @AndruHunterreb.

1393
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,340
 Tom, where could we find you?

1394
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:26,340
 - My Instagram handle is @TomIndeed.

1395
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,340
 So do feel free to follow me there.

1396
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:31,340
 Or I have just started a visualized podcast.

1397
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:34,340
 I don't know if you're familiar with this idea.

1398
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,340
 And that is available from all podcast providers.

1399
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:41,340
 And also on YouTube at Tom Allen is the handle.

1400
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,340
 And it's called "Potering."

1401
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:45,340
 And it's about gardening and being in the garden with my friends.

1402
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,340
 - Oh, great.

1403
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,340
 So you're in the garden.

1404
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,340
 You've got your guests sitting there in the distance.

1405
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,340
 We see a carpet.

1406
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,340
 Just sort of wandering around.

1407
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,340
 - Yes.

1408
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,340
 Don't acknowledge him.

1409
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,340
 He's got another six years left.

1410
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,340
 - Well, yeah.

1411
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,340
 If you want to get to us as a group,

1412
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,340
 go to podcast@qy.com.

1413
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,340
 You can send us some facts.

1414
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:08,340
 You can send us some extra things that you want us to know about

1415
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,340
 that we were talking about.

1416
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,340
 Whatever you send Andy goes through these emails.

1417
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,340
 He cherry picks the best of them.

1418
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:16,340
 And they make their way to our bonus show called Drop Us A Line.

1419
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:19,340
 Now this is part of a secret club called Club Fish,

1420
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,340
 which you can find on Patreon.

1421
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,340
 If you go to patreon.com/nosuchthingasafish,

1422
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,340
 you can find all the details there.

1423
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,340
 And you can also send us your most interesting facts

1424
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,340
 of bonus show that goes out on this main feed called Little Fish

1425
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,340
 every Monday.

1426
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,340
 And we will be reading out the best of your facts on that show.

1427
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,340
 Otherwise, just come back here next week.

1428
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,340
 We're going to be back again with another wonderful guest.

1429
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,340
 We'll see you then.

1430
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,340
 Goodbye.
