00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,360
 Hello there, exclusive VIP club fish extra special listeners. This is a secret message

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,920
 just for you. And it's a message to say it's time to reap the benefits of your loyalty

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,160
 that we are extremely grateful for. Over the last few months plowing through whatever it

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,760
 is that we decided sure now on this channel, it's about time you got rewarded for it and

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,080
 we thought because Christmas is coming up. We put on a couple of live shows. So you lot

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,960
 get first dibs on the tickets to those live shows. They're both going to be happening

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,240
 in London. They'll be in two halves. We're going to do a brand new podcast in the second

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:47,040
 half and we'll do some real nerdy fun Christmasy, probably get the audience involved kind of

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,960
 things in the first half. Please do come along. One of them will be up the creek in Greenwich

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,800
 and the other one's going to be at the Bloomsbury Theatre. And to get your hands on those top

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:07,280
 secret tickets, go to no such thing as a fish dot com slash Xmas live that is X M A S L I

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,680
 V E or Xmas live if you like, although that doesn't make grammatical sense. But if you

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,120
 go there, you can find the links to get tickets to either of those shows. Please come along.

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,960
 They're always super fun and we promise we'll make these ones extra good just for you. And

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,880
 now time to plow through another brand new format that we are calling nerd credentials.

16
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,400
 Off we go.

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:45,360
 Hello and welcome to nerd credentials. That is currently the name of this little bonus

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:53,080
 feature whereby we look at why our listeners are the nerdiest and the greatest in the entire

19
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,520
 world. We went on tour recently and part of that tour was we were looking for the nerdiest

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,920
 person in each city and town that we visited. And I've got some of the examples that people

21
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,360
 sent us on that tour. And I thought maybe we can discuss them and maybe if we remember

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,600
 some of our favourites, can you remember any good ones?

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,480
 Well, the one I always brought up in the first half was the guy who said that he wasn't sure

24
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,640
 if this qualified as nerdi and then explained that he was in the middle of writing a book

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,640
 called The Handrires of Europe. And then and so what he was doing was going around Europe

26
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,920
 taking photos, the pandemic hit, he had to stop. But he then said it's the projects a

27
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,920
 bit bigger than he realised and it's now a trilogy. So that is to be released on day.

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
 I can't wait till that gets released.

29
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,560
 It was The Handrires of Europe and then The Handrires of South America or The Handrires

30
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
 of Asia.

31
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,920
 I think it was different zones.

32
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,280
 I just thought Europe was such a big playing field. Actually, just while the memory is

33
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,040
 there of people with nerd credentials, we had one amazing moment. I can't remember which

34
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:59,480
 city where we were in the right hand corner of the lower section of the audience.

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,680
 It's hugely helpful. Thank you.

36
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,760
 Well, because this was two rows apart from each other where this happened, where someone

37
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,520
 raised their hand and said, "I was in a James Bond movie and it was a woman who was sitting

38
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,300
 in her office while they were filming a Daniel Craig James Bond scene outside the window

39
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,800
 and she accidentally by just proxy by sitting in her office working ended up in the final

40
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 film."

41
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,120
 And she claimed that she was a Bond girl as a result of this, which is a very elastic

42
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,040
 definition of being a Bond girl, I think.

43
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,040
 You have to be very elastic to be a Bond girl, of course, so low qualified.

44
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,720
 So as she says, I was in a James Bond movie, two rows ahead, a guy suddenly goes, "Whoa!"

45
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,440
 and throws his hand in the air as if like he just suddenly was reminded of his nerd

46
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,960
 credential. And then his was insane because he was the designer of all of M's gadgets.

47
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
 Q's.

48
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
 Oh, Q's gadgets, sorry.

49
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:52,000
 M has no gadgets. M is Judy Dench. Her gadgets are just a steely look and a bit of sarcasm.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,400
 You don't need to design it for that, it's all natural.

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
 All that.

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,280
 So, yeah, so Q and Q's gadgets that you will see in the latest James Bond movies were made

53
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,560
 by this person that was sitting two Bond connections right next to each other.

54
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,480
 We set them up. Anyone else just going to come with them out of their heads rather than

55
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
 me reading them?

56
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
 Sorry, you asked me some.

57
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,720
 Yeah, to be fair, you did ask. You can't tell the student off for answering your question.

58
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,280
 I did ask, but I wasn't expecting multiple.

59
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,320
 One more teacher, one more teacher.

60
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,040
 We actually got quite a lot about schools. Someone wrote to us saying that they were

61
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,160
 taken out of PSHE at school, which is physical and personal social.

62
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,280
 Isn't that the rude, the rude guy?

63
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,120
 Yeah, taken out of there and given Latin lessons instead.

64
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,400
 Because they were too...

65
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,680
 Well, they said, I guess they quite rightly realised that I wouldn't be needing the sex

66
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
 education anyway.

67
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
 Oh!

68
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,120
 Especially given being fluent in Latin.

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
 Yeah.

70
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,320
 That's where all the dirty stuff is hidden, though, in Latin. You know, remember the Natural

71
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,640
 History Museum, the guy who was documenting Penguin sayings?

72
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,120
 Yeah, the sex life of penguins and it was so salacious that you thought he had to write

73
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,880
 it in Latin so that only an educated person would be able to read it.

74
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,560
 I don't think at my school we got any sex stuff in PSHE lessons.

75
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
 Did you know?

76
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,000
 It was all sort of, this is what the Citizens Advice Bureau does.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,480
 This really explains a lot.

78
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
 Yeah.

79
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
 Yeah.

80
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
 We didn't have PSHE, actually.

81
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
 Didn't you?

82
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
 No.

83
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
 But we definitely had it.

84
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
 Isn't it compulsory?

85
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,560
 Oh, maybe we just didn't call it that. We just call it shag in class.

86
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
 Shag in class.

87
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,960
 Everyone behind the bike sheds for an hour.

88
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,160
 We got taught how it's done.

89
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,480
 Yeah, we only got taught some stuff in, but I feel like it was in biology.

90
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,640
 You see, at my school we didn't have Latin.

91
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
 Right.

92
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,920
 Or rather, we did have Latin, but there was only one teacher for the entire school.

93
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,320
 And so I had to do it during lunch times, lunch hours.

94
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,960
 I remember doing it really young and the banana thing, where you put a condom on a banana.

95
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
 In Latin.

96
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
 Bananas.

97
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
 It's quite choppy.

98
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,440
 Hannah, you did do this because you've told us that in that sex ed class they gave you

99
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,680
 a hockey stick or a lacrosse stick that you had to put a condom on.

100
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
 That was in English.

101
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
 That was in English.

102
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,680
 My English teacher was really cool and great and came in and she told us about her dates

103
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
 and stuff.

104
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,960
 But we were like, you know, tell us more and she said, well, how much do you guys know

105
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
 about sex?

106
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,920
 And I suppose we all said nothing.

107
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
 And so she did that.

108
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,360
 But we also got sex ed in biology.

109
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,840
 The thing is, that's a very good charming thing if you were roughly the right age for

110
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
 it.

111
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,000
 If this is a primary school story, it's less cool.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,040
 It's just a 65-year-old male joke of each teacher.

113
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
 Exactly.

114
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,200
 Constantly dragging around his hockey stick.

115
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
 It's less.

116
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
 Yeah.

117
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,280
 We had a teacher at our school who taught us urythmi, which I went to Rudolf Steiner

118
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
 School.

119
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,320
 It's a dance that Steiner invented, which was meant to be words in movement.

120
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,160
 After whom the urythmiics were named the band.

121
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,160
 Genuinely?

122
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
 Wow.

123
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
 Oh, God, that's interesting.

124
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
 I didn't know that.

125
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,440
 It just means good rhythm.

126
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,840
 Yeah, right.

127
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,040
 And he used to come in, and I won't say his name, but he was from either Germany or Austria.

128
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
 And he...

129
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,800
 So you won't even say his nationality?

130
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
 Yeah.

131
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,320
 I'm just going to allude to it.

132
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,040
 It was Mr. A. Hitler.

133
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,560
 He was actually from South America.

134
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,440
 So we had him for years as our teacher all the way through high school.

135
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,720
 And he was dawned for a period and he came back.

136
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,280
 And when he came back, he said, "I was recovering from a vasectomy that I had.

137
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,080
 My wife and I don't want to have kids anymore," and we're like, "Okay."

138
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,080
 Then like about a year later, he was gone again.

139
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
 He came back and he said, "Sorry, I was off.

140
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,160
 I was having it reattached because my wife decided that we wanted to have another kid."

141
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,920
 And then he was gone again a while later saying, "That was a bad idea.

142
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,720
 I've had it disattached again."

143
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,200
 This was a bit more Cotidian one that we got.

144
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,720
 So we would get more like this.

145
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,360
 So when I hang my washing on the line, I always make sure there is an even number of each

146
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,720
 colour of peg, so no one peg colour gets a special treatment.

147
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,080
 Oh, I always do that kind of thing.

148
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,480
 Do you sort of anthropomorphising colours things?

149
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
 Objects.

150
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,480
 And make sure objects are evenly, so if I touch one object and there's another on the

151
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,600
 table, then I'll be like, "Better touch that one as well to give it, to give both equal

152
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
 touches."

153
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
 This is why you don't get to vote to do the parties.

154
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,400
 I'm just going around smearing every bit of colouring on the table.

155
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,600
 Seems like my own spoon, after like everyone else's.

156
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
 That's great.

157
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,760
 I understand that impulse.

158
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
 Yeah.

159
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,160
 You know, you can rotate your plates, can't you?

160
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,000
 Yeah, because the ones at the bottom don't get much for use, do they, when you're cooking

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 for one every night.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,480
 My wife gets really annoyed with it.

163
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,560
 I was one of my best friends at uni.

164
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,160
 She in first year, she had two astrays in her room, we were on the Smokers floor and

165
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
 one of them is...

166
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
 Smokers floor.

167
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
 Yeah, Smokers floor.

168
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,280
 I mean, that sort of dates you for a start.

169
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:54,600
 Like 21 and then I just went you first in China.

170
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,320
 Because since smoke rises, did they put the Smokers floor on the top floor?

171
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,920
 Oh my God, it was actually on the top floor and I wonder if that is genuinely why otherwise

172
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,320
 it would have made all the other smell really bad.

173
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
 Yeah, yeah.

174
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
 That's what I'm thinking.

175
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
 Yeah.

176
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
 Although does it rise?

177
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
 Does it rise through plaster?

178
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
 No.

179
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,760
 But you smoke, like if you have your window open, then it will get up and everyone else

180
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
 will smell out.

181
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
 Yeah, that's a good point.

182
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
 Yeah.

183
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
 It's a very clever Edinburgh if you did that.

184
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,840
 Well, you should do that on high streets where all the restaurants should be on the

185
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,640
 upstairs floor and the residential bits should be below, right?

186
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
 Yeah.

187
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
 Well, why don't we have restaurants always at the top of the building?

188
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
 I lived in...

189
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,880
 Because it smells of food.

190
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
 Yeah.

191
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,600
 I lived in an archway above a Chinese restaurant and it just constantly you have the waft of

192
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
 it coming through.

193
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
 Yeah.

194
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
 But we should have swapped.

195
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
 Absolutely.

196
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

197
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
 And I'm sure it will be much less disruptive for you then to live below a Chinese restaurant.

198
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,360
 I'm sure that wouldn't have led to any problems at all, no people coming or going at late

199
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
 hours.

200
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
 Wow.

201
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,520
 We haven't thought this through, it's an architectural plan.

202
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
 Welcome to...

203
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,440
 Welcome to City of Dan, all the restaurants are on the top floor.

204
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,040
 But when they're done, it means testicles in Chinese.

205
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
 It's true.

206
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,120
 So that's a very specialist restaurant.

207
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,400
 Look, anyway, she had two Astros, one was very beautiful and expensive and so I'd give

208
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,360
 it to her, one was really crap and she always used the beautiful one, but she felt incredibly

209
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
 guilty about that.

210
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,360
 And then one night she just had a breakdown, was like, I feel so awful, I'm neglecting

211
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,840
 the ugly one, but she hurled the beautiful one out of the window and smashed it to pieces.

212
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
 Oh, wow, that's pretty.

213
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,520
 That sounds like a Hans Christian Anderson story, doesn't it?

214
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
 It does a bit, yeah.

215
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,760
 We should write it down.

216
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,160
 So what, so she then only had one Astro?

217
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,920
 Yeah, but at least she didn't feel guilty about preferring the nice one over the shit

218
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
 one.

219
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
 At least there's that.

220
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,320
 Did you, speaking of that, did you see that tweet the other day?

221
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,080
 This is someone else's material, so I shouldn't really say it.

222
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,320
 Hans tweeted that their ex told them a story that when they're at primary school, they

223
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,920
 had the lead role in the ugly duckling.

224
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,560
 But when they changed to a swan, they swapped her in for another child.

225
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,320
 Didn't China do that at the Olympics, didn't it?

226
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
 Oh, they did.

227
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
 This is a singer.

228
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
 Incredibly beautiful child, miming.

229
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,960
 Oh, you'd be opening ceremony.

230
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:05,920
 Well, another child with the voice of an angel sang behind the screen.

231
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
 Was it live?

232
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
 It was pre-recorded, I assume.

233
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,680
 She was lip syncing, but there'd be no point.

234
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,600
 If someone's behind a screen, you might as well record them, right?

235
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
 Yeah.

236
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,120
 It wouldn't make sense to lip sync to someone live.

237
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,920
 The goblin child might as well have sung weeks ago.

238
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
 Pre-recorded.

239
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

240
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
 The goblin child wasn't singing live.

241
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
 No.

242
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,720
 But the beautiful child was miming live.

243
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,720
 Lip syncing.

244
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

245
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,320
 The goblin wasn't behind the screen.

246
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,480
 I think the child was probably perfectly nice looking.

247
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:37,760
 While we're on sport, can I tell you, this is one we got in Chesterfield, and it's a

248
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
 bit controversial.

249
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,680
 So someone said, "I collected all my belly button fluff and asked my grandmother to knit

250
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,080
 it into a Chesterfield FC bobble hat.

251
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,760
 To this day, it is one of my prized possessions."

252
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,960
 That was Jeremiah Kay who said that in live.

253
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
 Can you do that?

254
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
 Would that be strong enough to...

255
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,520
 We asked that, and I seem to remember it was a lie.

256
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
 It was a lie.

257
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
 We asked him live.

258
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,240
 We found him in the audience and asked him if it was true, and he said he was winding

259
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
 us up.

260
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,400
 Because you'd have to have such a large belly button or such a small head.

261
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,440
 There's no way you can get...

262
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,360
 I mean, think about how much belly button fluff you produce then.

263
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
 Yeah.

264
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
 Not very much.

265
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
 Not very much, no.

266
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,680
 How many years would you have to be supporting?

267
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
 Was it Chesterfield FC?

268
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
 Yeah.

269
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
 To get a bobble hat?

270
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,720
 Most Chesterfield FC fans who are elderly will have been supporting them their whole

271
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
 lives.

272
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,160
 Okay, so let's say you've spent 80 years collecting your...

273
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
 Yeah.

274
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,280
 And sorry, then you're getting your grandmother to knit you a hat.

275
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
 Do you see what...

276
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,160
 I see the problem here.

277
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,920
 She's definitely got arthritis at that point.

278
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
 It's not gonna work.

279
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,160
 You could maybe knit like a little finger puppet out of your...

280
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
 Yeah.

281
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
 If you spent your whole life doing it.

282
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
 Yeah.

283
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,160
 But what a wasted life it would be.

284
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
 Yeah.

285
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
 I don't even know if you could out of the fluff in a belly button.

286
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,760
 Do you remember that was that thing where Alan downed like a jar of something weird,

287
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
 like belly button fluff?

288
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,960
 We were playing Ring of Fire with him at two in the morning, weren't we?

289
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
 No, no, no.

290
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,840
 We were on the TV show that he was handed something like a jar of what I thought was

291
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
 belly button fluff.

292
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,400
 It was one of the most disgusting moments I've ever seen on QI.

293
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
 Yeah.

294
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
 Maybe B for belly button.

295
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,040
 You'd feel like we would remember...

296
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,880
 I wasn't here in the B series, or I was working out, but I didn't go to any recording, so...

297
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,640
 I watched it all on DVD when I got the job, and I don't remember that, but I...

298
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,200
 It's quite possible it didn't go out, 'cause I just seem to remember being disgusted in

299
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
 the studio.

300
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
 But I can't...

301
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
 Maybe I'm making that up.

302
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
 That's weird if that's a false memory.

303
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,440
 Here's one that we got in which could easily have come from Alex Bell, our colleague.

304
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,720
 This person said that when they were four years old, they were a sandwich board in school

305
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,960
 all day saying, "Ask me anything about dinosaurs."

306
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,520
 I remember that from the last week.

307
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,480
 Isn't that amazing?

308
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,960
 And then on the same day, someone sent in a message saying, "My wife thought I was

309
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,400
 cheating on her after she found my burner phone.

310
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:54,480
 It was one that I bought so I could have a second Pokémon Go account."

311
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
 It's the...

312
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,800
 James, you were a fan of Pokémon Go.

313
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
 I am.

314
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,200
 What's the advantage to having a second Pokémon Go account?

315
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
 I mean, you're collecting them.

316
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,320
 Yeah, you could swap with yourself.

317
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,200
 You could fight against yourself and cheat, and like deliberately fight your good guys

318
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
 against their bad guys.

319
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,240
 So he was cheating?

320
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,360
 I'm happy with his calling that child a goblin, but I'm not happy with calling another Pokémon

321
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,720
 Go player a cheat.

322
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
 That's funny.

323
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,000
 That's when people do that in chess, don't they?

324
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,520
 They play weak.

325
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,240
 You play someone who's actually just going to throw the game, and then your ranking rises.

326
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
 Or you play someone...

327
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
 It's called sunbagging.

328
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
 Yeah.

329
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,240
 We talk about that.

330
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
 It sounds so much ruder and more fun than it is.

331
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,480
 What do we know about old anal beads who is in the news recently?

332
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,840
 He's still allowed to play.

333
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
 But what was he doing?

334
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,040
 What was the vibrations we're giving?

335
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
 No, no, no.

336
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
 Right.

337
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,560
 He played chess against Magnus Carlson and beat him.

338
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,120
 You wouldn't have expected him to beat him, and actually his rise has been surprisingly

339
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,360
 quick in the world of chess.

340
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,640
 Now Magnus thinks that he cheated, or that he has cheated in the past, and one YouTuber

341
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,200
 or blogger or something said, "Well, here's one way he could possibly have cheated.

342
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,200
 He could have put anal beads up his bum and got them to vibrate whenever he needed to

343
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,960
 do the right move or whatever."

344
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,600
 I don't think anyone actually believes this is a real theory.

345
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,340
 It's incredible for something to go, basically, from one Reddit comment to an accepted piece

346
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,340
 of chess discourse.

347
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,480
 It's basically like if you see this story in The Times, it would say, "Anal bead come

348
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,400
 trovesy guy," says Magnus Carlson.

349
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,840
 It does sort of frighten you about how news gets made when you see that going on.

350
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,800
 The worst thing is I used to play giant chess, and I did cheat at that, and it's just not

351
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
 worth the discomfort.

352
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
 Right.

353
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,240
 You don't need bigger beads.

354
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
 What?

355
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:55,120
 What was I doing with those billions of balls?

356
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,440
 That was my first batch of nerd credentials that you guys sent in.

357
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,120
 I have a million more, so we might do this sometime, but actually, if you have a nerd

358
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,400
 credential and you're at home, why not send us it?

359
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,760
 You've heard what we want to hear.

360
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,400
 Send it to podcast.qi.com, and we might mention a few that you've sent in.

361
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,640
 And to steal a line from Andrew Hunter Murray, bye.

362
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,760
 So catch it.

363
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
 Bye.

364
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:17,760
 Bye.

365
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
 Bye.

366
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
 Bye.

367
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:20,760
 Bye.

368
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
 Bye.

369
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
 Bye.

370
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
 Bye.

371
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
 Bye.

372
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
 Bye.

373
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,340
 (upbeat music)

374
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,920
 (upbeat music)
