00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.360
 Hello there, exclusive VIP club fish extra special listeners. This is a secret message

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.920
 just for you. And it's a message to say it's time to reap the benefits of your loyalty

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.160
 that we are extremely grateful for. Over the last few months plowing through whatever it

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.760
 is that we decided sure now on this channel, it's about time you got rewarded for it and

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.080
 we thought because Christmas is coming up. We put on a couple of live shows. So you lot

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.960
 get first dibs on the tickets to those live shows. They're both going to be happening

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.240
 in London. They'll be in two halves. We're going to do a brand new podcast in the second

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:47.040
 half and we'll do some real nerdy fun Christmasy, probably get the audience involved kind of

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.960
 things in the first half. Please do come along. One of them will be up the creek in Greenwich

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.800
 and the other one's going to be at the Bloomsbury Theatre. And to get your hands on those top

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:07.280
 secret tickets, go to no such thing as a fish dot com slash Xmas live that is X M A S L I

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.680
 V E or Xmas live if you like, although that doesn't make grammatical sense. But if you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.120
 go there, you can find the links to get tickets to either of those shows. Please come along.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.960
 They're always super fun and we promise we'll make these ones extra good just for you. And

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.880
 now time to plow through another brand new format that we are calling nerd credentials.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.400
 Off we go.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:45.360
 Hello and welcome to nerd credentials. That is currently the name of this little bonus

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.080
 feature whereby we look at why our listeners are the nerdiest and the greatest in the entire

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.520
 world. We went on tour recently and part of that tour was we were looking for the nerdiest

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.920
 person in each city and town that we visited. And I've got some of the examples that people

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.360
 sent us on that tour. And I thought maybe we can discuss them and maybe if we remember

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.600
 some of our favourites, can you remember any good ones?

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.480
 Well, the one I always brought up in the first half was the guy who said that he wasn't sure

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.640
 if this qualified as nerdi and then explained that he was in the middle of writing a book

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.640
 called The Handrires of Europe. And then and so what he was doing was going around Europe

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.920
 taking photos, the pandemic hit, he had to stop. But he then said it's the projects a

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.920
 bit bigger than he realised and it's now a trilogy. So that is to be released on day.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.920
 I can't wait till that gets released.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.560
 It was The Handrires of Europe and then The Handrires of South America or The Handrires

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.560
 of Asia.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.920
 I think it was different zones.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.280
 I just thought Europe was such a big playing field. Actually, just while the memory is

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.040
 there of people with nerd credentials, we had one amazing moment. I can't remember which

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.480
 city where we were in the right hand corner of the lower section of the audience.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.680
 It's hugely helpful. Thank you.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.760
 Well, because this was two rows apart from each other where this happened, where someone

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.520
 raised their hand and said, "I was in a James Bond movie and it was a woman who was sitting

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.300
 in her office while they were filming a Daniel Craig James Bond scene outside the window

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.800
 and she accidentally by just proxy by sitting in her office working ended up in the final

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 film."

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.120
 And she claimed that she was a Bond girl as a result of this, which is a very elastic

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.040
 definition of being a Bond girl, I think.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.040
 You have to be very elastic to be a Bond girl, of course, so low qualified.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.720
 So as she says, I was in a James Bond movie, two rows ahead, a guy suddenly goes, "Whoa!"

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.440
 and throws his hand in the air as if like he just suddenly was reminded of his nerd

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.960
 credential. And then his was insane because he was the designer of all of M's gadgets.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.960
 Q's.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.960
 Oh, Q's gadgets, sorry.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.000
 M has no gadgets. M is Judy Dench. Her gadgets are just a steely look and a bit of sarcasm.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.400
 You don't need to design it for that, it's all natural.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400
 All that.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.280
 So, yeah, so Q and Q's gadgets that you will see in the latest James Bond movies were made

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.560
 by this person that was sitting two Bond connections right next to each other.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.480
 We set them up. Anyone else just going to come with them out of their heads rather than

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.480
 me reading them?

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.480
 Sorry, you asked me some.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.720
 Yeah, to be fair, you did ask. You can't tell the student off for answering your question.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.280
 I did ask, but I wasn't expecting multiple.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.320
 One more teacher, one more teacher.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.040
 We actually got quite a lot about schools. Someone wrote to us saying that they were

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.160
 taken out of PSHE at school, which is physical and personal social.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.280
 Isn't that the rude, the rude guy?

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.120
 Yeah, taken out of there and given Latin lessons instead.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.400
 Because they were too...

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.680
 Well, they said, I guess they quite rightly realised that I wouldn't be needing the sex

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.680
 education anyway.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.680
 Oh!

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.120
 Especially given being fluent in Latin.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.120
 Yeah.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.320
 That's where all the dirty stuff is hidden, though, in Latin. You know, remember the Natural

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.640
 History Museum, the guy who was documenting Penguin sayings?

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.120
 Yeah, the sex life of penguins and it was so salacious that you thought he had to write

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.880
 it in Latin so that only an educated person would be able to read it.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.560
 I don't think at my school we got any sex stuff in PSHE lessons.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.560
 Did you know?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.000
 It was all sort of, this is what the Citizens Advice Bureau does.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.480
 This really explains a lot.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.480
 Yeah.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.480
 Yeah.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.480
 We didn't have PSHE, actually.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.480
 Didn't you?

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.480
 No.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.480
 But we definitely had it.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.480
 Isn't it compulsory?

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.560
 Oh, maybe we just didn't call it that. We just call it shag in class.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.560
 Shag in class.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.960
 Everyone behind the bike sheds for an hour.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.160
 We got taught how it's done.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.480
 Yeah, we only got taught some stuff in, but I feel like it was in biology.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.640
 You see, at my school we didn't have Latin.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.640
 Right.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.920
 Or rather, we did have Latin, but there was only one teacher for the entire school.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.320
 And so I had to do it during lunch times, lunch hours.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.960
 I remember doing it really young and the banana thing, where you put a condom on a banana.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.960
 In Latin.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.960
 Bananas.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.960
 It's quite choppy.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.440
 Hannah, you did do this because you've told us that in that sex ed class they gave you

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.680
 a hockey stick or a lacrosse stick that you had to put a condom on.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.680
 That was in English.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.680
 That was in English.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.680
 My English teacher was really cool and great and came in and she told us about her dates

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.680
 and stuff.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.960
 But we were like, you know, tell us more and she said, well, how much do you guys know

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.960
 about sex?

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.920
 And I suppose we all said nothing.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.920
 And so she did that.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.360
 But we also got sex ed in biology.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.840
 The thing is, that's a very good charming thing if you were roughly the right age for

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.840
 it.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.000
 If this is a primary school story, it's less cool.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.040
 It's just a 65-year-old male joke of each teacher.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.040
 Exactly.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.200
 Constantly dragging around his hockey stick.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.200
 It's less.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200
 Yeah.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.280
 We had a teacher at our school who taught us urythmi, which I went to Rudolf Steiner

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.280
 School.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.320
 It's a dance that Steiner invented, which was meant to be words in movement.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.160
 After whom the urythmiics were named the band.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.160
 Genuinely?

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.160
 Wow.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.160
 Oh, God, that's interesting.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.160
 I didn't know that.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.440
 It just means good rhythm.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.840
 Yeah, right.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.040
 And he used to come in, and I won't say his name, but he was from either Germany or Austria.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.040
 And he...

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.800
 So you won't even say his nationality?

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.800
 Yeah.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.320
 I'm just going to allude to it.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.040
 It was Mr. A. Hitler.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.560
 He was actually from South America.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.440
 So we had him for years as our teacher all the way through high school.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.720
 And he was dawned for a period and he came back.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.280
 And when he came back, he said, "I was recovering from a vasectomy that I had.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.080
 My wife and I don't want to have kids anymore," and we're like, "Okay."

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.080
 Then like about a year later, he was gone again.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.080
 He came back and he said, "Sorry, I was off.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.160
 I was having it reattached because my wife decided that we wanted to have another kid."

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.920
 And then he was gone again a while later saying, "That was a bad idea.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.720
 I've had it disattached again."

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.200
 This was a bit more Cotidian one that we got.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.720
 So we would get more like this.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.360
 So when I hang my washing on the line, I always make sure there is an even number of each

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.720
 colour of peg, so no one peg colour gets a special treatment.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.080
 Oh, I always do that kind of thing.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.480
 Do you sort of anthropomorphising colours things?

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.480
 Objects.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.480
 And make sure objects are evenly, so if I touch one object and there's another on the

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.600
 table, then I'll be like, "Better touch that one as well to give it, to give both equal

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.600
 touches."

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.600
 This is why you don't get to vote to do the parties.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.400
 I'm just going around smearing every bit of colouring on the table.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.600
 Seems like my own spoon, after like everyone else's.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.600
 That's great.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.760
 I understand that impulse.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.760
 Yeah.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.160
 You know, you can rotate your plates, can't you?

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.000
 Yeah, because the ones at the bottom don't get much for use, do they, when you're cooking

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 for one every night.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.480
 My wife gets really annoyed with it.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.560
 I was one of my best friends at uni.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.160
 She in first year, she had two astrays in her room, we were on the Smokers floor and

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.160
 one of them is...

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.160
 Smokers floor.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.160
 Yeah, Smokers floor.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.280
 I mean, that sort of dates you for a start.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:54.600
 Like 21 and then I just went you first in China.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.320
 Because since smoke rises, did they put the Smokers floor on the top floor?

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.920
 Oh my God, it was actually on the top floor and I wonder if that is genuinely why otherwise

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.320
 it would have made all the other smell really bad.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.320
 That's what I'm thinking.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.320
 Yeah.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.320
 Although does it rise?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.320
 Does it rise through plaster?

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.320
 No.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.760
 But you smoke, like if you have your window open, then it will get up and everyone else

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.760
 will smell out.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.760
 Yeah, that's a good point.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.760
 Yeah.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.760
 It's a very clever Edinburgh if you did that.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.840
 Well, you should do that on high streets where all the restaurants should be on the

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.640
 upstairs floor and the residential bits should be below, right?

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.640
 Yeah.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.640
 Well, why don't we have restaurants always at the top of the building?

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.640
 I lived in...

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.880
 Because it smells of food.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.880
 Yeah.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.600
 I lived in an archway above a Chinese restaurant and it just constantly you have the waft of

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.600
 it coming through.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.600
 Yeah.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.600
 But we should have swapped.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.600
 Absolutely.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.600
 And I'm sure it will be much less disruptive for you then to live below a Chinese restaurant.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.360
 I'm sure that wouldn't have led to any problems at all, no people coming or going at late

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.360
 hours.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.360
 Wow.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.520
 We haven't thought this through, it's an architectural plan.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.520
 Welcome to...

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.440
 Welcome to City of Dan, all the restaurants are on the top floor.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.040
 But when they're done, it means testicles in Chinese.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.040
 It's true.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.120
 So that's a very specialist restaurant.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.400
 Look, anyway, she had two Astros, one was very beautiful and expensive and so I'd give

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.360
 it to her, one was really crap and she always used the beautiful one, but she felt incredibly

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.360
 guilty about that.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.360
 And then one night she just had a breakdown, was like, I feel so awful, I'm neglecting

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.840
 the ugly one, but she hurled the beautiful one out of the window and smashed it to pieces.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.840
 Oh, wow, that's pretty.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.520
 That sounds like a Hans Christian Anderson story, doesn't it?

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.520
 It does a bit, yeah.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.760
 We should write it down.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.160
 So what, so she then only had one Astro?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.920
 Yeah, but at least she didn't feel guilty about preferring the nice one over the shit

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.920
 one.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.920
 At least there's that.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.320
 Did you, speaking of that, did you see that tweet the other day?

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.080
 This is someone else's material, so I shouldn't really say it.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.320
 Hans tweeted that their ex told them a story that when they're at primary school, they

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.920
 had the lead role in the ugly duckling.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:47.560
 But when they changed to a swan, they swapped her in for another child.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.320
 Didn't China do that at the Olympics, didn't it?

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.320
 Oh, they did.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.320
 This is a singer.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.320
 Incredibly beautiful child, miming.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.960
 Oh, you'd be opening ceremony.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:05.920
 Well, another child with the voice of an angel sang behind the screen.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.920
 Was it live?

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.920
 It was pre-recorded, I assume.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.680
 She was lip syncing, but there'd be no point.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.600
 If someone's behind a screen, you might as well record them, right?

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.600
 Yeah.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.120
 It wouldn't make sense to lip sync to someone live.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.920
 The goblin child might as well have sung weeks ago.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.920
 Pre-recorded.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.920
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.920
 The goblin child wasn't singing live.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.920
 No.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.720
 But the beautiful child was miming live.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.720
 Lip syncing.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.320
 The goblin wasn't behind the screen.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.480
 I think the child was probably perfectly nice looking.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:37.760
 While we're on sport, can I tell you, this is one we got in Chesterfield, and it's a

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.760
 bit controversial.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.680
 So someone said, "I collected all my belly button fluff and asked my grandmother to knit

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.080
 it into a Chesterfield FC bobble hat.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.760
 To this day, it is one of my prized possessions."

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.960
 That was Jeremiah Kay who said that in live.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.960
 Can you do that?

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.960
 Would that be strong enough to...

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.520
 We asked that, and I seem to remember it was a lie.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.520
 It was a lie.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.520
 We asked him live.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.240
 We found him in the audience and asked him if it was true, and he said he was winding

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.240
 us up.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.400
 Because you'd have to have such a large belly button or such a small head.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.440
 There's no way you can get...

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.360
 I mean, think about how much belly button fluff you produce then.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.360
 Yeah.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.360
 Not very much.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.360
 Not very much, no.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.680
 How many years would you have to be supporting?

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.680
 Was it Chesterfield FC?

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.680
 Yeah.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.680
 To get a bobble hat?

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.720
 Most Chesterfield FC fans who are elderly will have been supporting them their whole

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720
 lives.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.160
 Okay, so let's say you've spent 80 years collecting your...

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.160
 Yeah.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.280
 And sorry, then you're getting your grandmother to knit you a hat.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.280
 Do you see what...

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.160
 I see the problem here.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.920
 She's definitely got arthritis at that point.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.920
 It's not gonna work.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.160
 You could maybe knit like a little finger puppet out of your...

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.160
 Yeah.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.160
 If you spent your whole life doing it.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.160
 Yeah.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.160
 But what a wasted life it would be.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.160
 Yeah.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.160
 I don't even know if you could out of the fluff in a belly button.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.760
 Do you remember that was that thing where Alan downed like a jar of something weird,

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.760
 like belly button fluff?

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.960
 We were playing Ring of Fire with him at two in the morning, weren't we?

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.960
 No, no, no.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.840
 We were on the TV show that he was handed something like a jar of what I thought was

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.840
 belly button fluff.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.400
 It was one of the most disgusting moments I've ever seen on QI.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.400
 Yeah.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.400
 Maybe B for belly button.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.040
 You'd feel like we would remember...

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.880
 I wasn't here in the B series, or I was working out, but I didn't go to any recording, so...

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.640
 I watched it all on DVD when I got the job, and I don't remember that, but I...

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.200
 It's quite possible it didn't go out, 'cause I just seem to remember being disgusted in

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.200
 the studio.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.200
 But I can't...

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.200
 Maybe I'm making that up.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200
 That's weird if that's a false memory.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.440
 Here's one that we got in which could easily have come from Alex Bell, our colleague.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.720
 This person said that when they were four years old, they were a sandwich board in school

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.960
 all day saying, "Ask me anything about dinosaurs."

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.520
 I remember that from the last week.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.480
 Isn't that amazing?

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.960
 And then on the same day, someone sent in a message saying, "My wife thought I was

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.400
 cheating on her after she found my burner phone.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:54.480
 It was one that I bought so I could have a second Pokémon Go account."

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.480
 It's the...

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.800
 James, you were a fan of Pokémon Go.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.800
 I am.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.200
 What's the advantage to having a second Pokémon Go account?

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.200
 I mean, you're collecting them.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.320
 Yeah, you could swap with yourself.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.200
 You could fight against yourself and cheat, and like deliberately fight your good guys

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.200
 against their bad guys.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.240
 So he was cheating?

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.360
 I'm happy with his calling that child a goblin, but I'm not happy with calling another Pokémon

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.720
 Go player a cheat.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.720
 That's funny.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.000
 That's when people do that in chess, don't they?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.520
 They play weak.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.240
 You play someone who's actually just going to throw the game, and then your ranking rises.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.240
 Or you play someone...

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.240
 It's called sunbagging.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.240
 Yeah.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.240
 We talk about that.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.240
 It sounds so much ruder and more fun than it is.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:37.480
 What do we know about old anal beads who is in the news recently?

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.840
 He's still allowed to play.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.840
 But what was he doing?

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.040
 What was the vibrations we're giving?

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.040
 No, no, no.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.040
 Right.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.560
 He played chess against Magnus Carlson and beat him.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.120
 You wouldn't have expected him to beat him, and actually his rise has been surprisingly

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.360
 quick in the world of chess.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:58.640
 Now Magnus thinks that he cheated, or that he has cheated in the past, and one YouTuber

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.200
 or blogger or something said, "Well, here's one way he could possibly have cheated.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.200
 He could have put anal beads up his bum and got them to vibrate whenever he needed to

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.960
 do the right move or whatever."

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.600
 I don't think anyone actually believes this is a real theory.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.340
 It's incredible for something to go, basically, from one Reddit comment to an accepted piece

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.340
 of chess discourse.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:22.480
 It's basically like if you see this story in The Times, it would say, "Anal bead come

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.400
 trovesy guy," says Magnus Carlson.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.840
 It does sort of frighten you about how news gets made when you see that going on.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:34.800
 The worst thing is I used to play giant chess, and I did cheat at that, and it's just not

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.800
 worth the discomfort.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.800
 Right.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.240
 You don't need bigger beads.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.240
 What?

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:55.120
 What was I doing with those billions of balls?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.440
 That was my first batch of nerd credentials that you guys sent in.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.120
 I have a million more, so we might do this sometime, but actually, if you have a nerd

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.400
 credential and you're at home, why not send us it?

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.760
 You've heard what we want to hear.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.400
 Send it to podcast.qi.com, and we might mention a few that you've sent in.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.640
 And to steal a line from Andrew Hunter Murray, bye.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.760
 So catch it.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.760
 Bye.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:17.760
 Bye.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.760
 Bye.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.760
 Bye.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:20.760
 Bye.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.760
 Bye.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.760
 Bye.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.760
 Bye.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.760
 Bye.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.760
 Bye.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.340
 (upbeat music)

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.920
 (upbeat music)
