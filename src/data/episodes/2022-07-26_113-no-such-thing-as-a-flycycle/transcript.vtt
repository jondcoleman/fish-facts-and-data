00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 *Bell*

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 My fact is that when you are 30 meters underwater, your lungs are only a quarter of their normal size. That is incredible. Yeah. How? What's... because there's not enough air in them?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Well, there's the same number of air molecules if you just take one lungful and then you dive down, but the water pressure on them is much higher, meaning that you're lung strength.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 So if you're at sea level, all the air above you, if you imagine a column of air stretching all the way up to the edge of the atmosphere, one square inch of that column would weigh 14.7 pounds. Right?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 So we say the pressure at sea level is 14 pounds per square inch, 14.7 pounds.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 It is amazing actually to think all of that air pushing down on you whenever you're walking down the street.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Yeah. We're all superhumanly strong. Well, we're all humanly strong. But in the sea, to get another 14.7 pounds pressing down on you, you only have to go down 10 meters. Right?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 So that depth, if you had a balloon full of gas and you pulled it 10 meters underwater, 33 feet, it would be half the size because there are two atmospheres of pressure.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 So the same thing is happening to your lungs when you go underwater. And if you go three times that if you go 30 meters down, you would have to have four times as many gas molecules in your lungs to fill them to their original size.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Now, it doesn't apply if you have, if you're breathing pressurized air, right? So scuba divers, they breathe in air, which is at a much higher pressure than normal air.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 So you're breathing in a higher number of molecules, four times as many gas molecules at that depth. So their lungs are the same. Yeah. So you're doing about free diving and you're talking about, yeah.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 When you get to about 300 feet under the surface of the water, there was a guy in 1996 who was called Francesco Ferras Rodriguez, his chest shrunk from a size 50 inches to 20.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 So what we're saying is, if you need to get a fit of a suit, don't get fitted 430 feet under the water.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Unless you're planning to wear that suit.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 So I was when you said this fact about the lungs, which is extraordinary, the idea that it can shrink down to that size.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 I started reading into, so James Nestor, I read this article by him, he wrote this book called Free Diving.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 So he talks a lot about this thing that they've been studying for about 50 years, which is called the master switch of life. That's the term for it.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 The idea is that when we go into the water, we slowly start turning into water-based animals, the deeper we go, as in our body adapts to in the way.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 So if you stay underwater for long enough, you turn into a fish. Yeah, basically. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's really fascinating things. So when you start diving down, you have to paddle down because gravity is trying to do a buoyancy thing of sending you back up.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 So you have to go down. As soon as you get to 40 feet, then the gravity shifts and it starts pulling you down. So free divers then just put their hands by their sides and they allow themselves to be pulled down because you need to save every single bit of oxygen that you have inside your body.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 And your heart rate goes down to something, some people, like this is very rare, but some people seven beats a minute. That's how much your body just relaxes into a different state.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Is it called the cold water reflex or the dive reflex? Yeah, the mammalian dive reflex. Yeah, that's this master switch of life. That's the other term for it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 But it happens as soon as you touch water. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 So when you, I have a theory now that when you splash your face with cold water, the reason it can snap you out of like a panic attack or being anxious is because actually it gives you the dive reflex, which immediately slows your heart rate down.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 And it hugely slows it, doesn't it? So there was an experiment where people had to exercise to like synchronize something on the bottom of a deep pool or something and you know, it really doesn't increase at all in the same way that it would above water.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 But I don't think we know how it is that they've been, yeah, they've been, they've been researching someone wrote that free diving is the only sport in which the lung shrink and the heart slows down every other sport there is.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Talking of heart slowing down, have we ever mentioned the guy that got in touch with us? No, no, we haven't. No, a guy emailed us called Martin Brady, email the podcast email address a few weeks ago.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 And he just sent me an email saying, I thought you might like to know that the world record for the lowest resting heartbeat is 27 beats a minute.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 And it's held by someone called Martin Brady and the condition of having a low heart rate is Brady Cardier and the two are completely unrelated. So he's called Martin Brady and the condition is Brady Cardier, weird coincidence, really cool fact.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 And I looked at his email address and replied, I was like, are you Martin Brady? He's like, yes, I am. So yeah, the guy with the Guinness World Record for the lowest heartbeat has been in touch.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 So that'll be the lowest resting heartbeat. Lowest resting. So this guy who goes in the water who can go down to seven beats a minute is slightly different. Yes, yeah, have you guys heard of the Aquaman crystal? No, this is new scientific.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Because it sounds like it's from the Fantastic Four or something. No, it's real. This is real. So I don't fully understand it, but these are, and they're in prototype stage for the moment.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 They're crystals that absorb oxygen. They allow the idea is that they would allow you eventually if we can work out how to use them. Have you? Okay. So yeah, so they do what they take in the oxygen around them.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 So in a room they can suck it. They can absorb all the oxygen into them. So if you were able to take it down into the ocean, you wouldn't need the tank anymore.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 You'd be able just to breathe in through these crystals. But if you're a supervillain for instance, then you could get some of these crystals, put them in a room and it'll just suck all the oxygen out and then you kill everyone in the room.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Oh, wow. That is a damn brown novel waiting to be written. I think I know people who have been using these for years, because whenever you're talking to them, it really feels like all the air has been sucked out of the food.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Why are you looking at me?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Can I ask you a question about lungs? Yeah, ask me. I'll know. I think you will know. There have been a couple of news reports over the last few years about people having plants grow in their lungs.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 So there was a guy who inhaled a fir tree seed and a fir tree started to grow in his lungs. And there was someone else who inhaled a pea seed and I think a pea plant started to grow in his lungs.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Now a study was done, which said or a report was released, which said it is not possible for any plant to grow inside someone's lungs. It needs light, etc.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 But nothing has explained to me how these people I've seen x-rays of their lungs.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 I don't agree with the second thing that you said, because if you have plants in the ground, they don't have the light.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Yeah. So just for them to germinate, they wouldn't need the light.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Yeah. And I assume that's what's happened. I think the like fir tree inside his lungs, it's not like a massive Christmas tree. It's just like a germination of their seeds.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Although they did say the pain was caused by the little fir tree needles poking into his arteries.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 And the bobbles.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 The angel on top really caused a choking hazard.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Imagine if one day he just found a bit of tinsel at the corner of his mouth. Start pulling on it.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 I'd rather it come out of your mouth, I think.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Also, in underwater news, there's someone called Jim Dyke, Jr, who's testing out a new theory that you can actually age wine much better by dropping it to the bottom of or it's certainly quite deep into a notion.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Is that it takes so long to retrieve that it's quite a lot older.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Well, so he was inspired by there was quite a few stories of shipwrecks coming up with all sorts of alcohols, champagne being one of them and they all tasted really good and he has a theory that the aging process through being underwater will actually be much more efficient and much better.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 So it's an ongoing new theory.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 It's going to be unbelievably inconvenient when majestic wine is stationed on the bottom of the ocean.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 I was actually just passing by to get my suit fitted, but I suppose I'll get some wine while I'm here.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 One of the long thing, do you guys remember the story of a doctor called Angus Wallace in the 1990s who was on an airplane and did an amazing thing?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 There are my clues.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Oh, Traciotomy with the Biro.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 Yeah, I'll be my co-hanger.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 A co-hanger, yes.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Biro's not work.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 Do I know?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 No, there was a study about that.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Well, they work for writing before the Biro industry gets onto this.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 They were never designed for Traciotomy.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 I think it would be that defendants.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 I try to bring down the Biro industry.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 You're attacking them in the wrong place.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 But just on that, there was a study done about Biro's for Traciotomies and they reckon that they're just kind of the wrong shape and they just wouldn't quite work.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Oh, really?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 It wasn't actually quite a Traciotomy.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 I don't think on the plane, but it is the most incredible story.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 So this is one of the surgeons Angus Wallace treated Wayne Rooney at the World Cup 2006.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 And 10 years earlier, he'd been on a flight and a girl complained of chest pain and said she'd fallen off her bike and it turned out she'd been in a big motorbike accident.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 And he realized that she had a collapsed lung.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 And so they had to get a catheter up into her lung to stop it from completely caving inwards.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 And the way the only catheter they had in their medical equipment was too floppy because it was for a different part of the body.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 And so we got a co-hanger into the catheter to stiffen it up.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 And then he fashioned a one-way valve by prodding holes into the lid of an Evian bottle.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 And he used a bit of an oxygen mask tubing, I think, to thread it up there.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 And this was one of the blue pizza presents.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 Is this some Magyber?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Yes.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Wow.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Post-curve you. So non-blue pizza, he had to sterilise all the equipment with first-class cognac.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 Even though it turned out they did have alcohol wipes in the first aid kit.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 He said afterwards he didn't have time to check.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 And then his associate held her chest open with a knife and four.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Well, he inserted the catheter.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Oh my god.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Plastic knives and forks.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 I think one of the plastics, yeah.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Oh, this was the 90s, so maybe they were still allowed metal there.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Yeah.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 But then this explains why Wayne Rooney's always injured because he's held together with sticky plastic.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 He held together with, yeah.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 That's the magic of co-hanger.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 And did she make a recovery?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 He said it took about ten minutes and then she passed the rest of the flight,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 uneventfully, easing and watching in flight entertainment.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 What?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 But the person next to her had nowhere to hang his coat.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Chuzinski.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 My fact this week is that online shopping was predicted in 1857.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Yeah.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Amazing.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Yeah.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 So this is quite a prediction.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 So how close is it to modern day online shopping?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Or is it just like, you know, they predicted shopping.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Yeah.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 I've added online to make it sound better.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Well, I think it's quite close.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 So this is an essay that was written in a magazine called The Leisure Hour in 1857.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 And I read it on a website called publicdomainreview.org,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 which is my favourite place on the whole internet.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 It's incredible.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Everyone go to it.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 But yeah, the thing that's going to be predicted was that in every district,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 shops would have electric wires that branched off in all directions away from them

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 that would be attached to all the houses in the area.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 And when, well, he says, no sooner did a housekeeper stand in need of any article,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 she could dispatch the order instantly along the wire.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 So just press a little button along the wire.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 And the shop would receive that message and receive the news of what she wanted.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 And then the very first railway carriage that was passing

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 would be able to drop off the item on its way.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 It's amazing.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 That's pretty cool.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 I read the essay and there are a lot of other predictions in it as well.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 So he predicts that the river Thames will be completely clear and full of fish.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Not quite.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Well, I bet it's a lot more full of fish than it was in those days.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 True.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 He also predicts that there would be 20 new bridges across the Thames

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 between 1857 and 1957.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 And how many?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 I counted. There were 26.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Not bad.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 Pretty close.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 Yeah, no one will be wearing hats or bonnets anymore in 1957.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 That one wasn't quite on because hats were still pretty big then.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Well, though he'd said that they'd just be replaced.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 I got excited by that because I thought, well done.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 You've finally seen the idiocy of the fact that everyone wore a hat until about 1950.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 But then he said they'll just be replaced by a slightly easier head garment,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 less showy head garment.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Why didn't people realise you don't need to wear a head garment at all?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Well, if you want to keep your head warm.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 If they're not necessary now, they won't then, James.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 Take your hats off inside, anyway.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 Well, you and I've got on very well in stockpot in the early 20th century

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 where anyone walking around without a hat would get stones thrown at them.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Really?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Because it was a big hatting area.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 This happened, I think, in Luton as well.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 These were two big hatting areas and it was just seem to be your local duty to always wear a hat.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 And if you didn't, people would just abuse you.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Really?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 I actually didn't think I would have gone down very well in stockpot in the early 20th century anyway.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Isn't Luton now got a big Volkswagen factory?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 It's got an airport.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 It's got an airport.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 So we're not walking around nothing to play these days.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 It's got stones thrown at them.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 It's terrible.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 I was looking into predictions from around roughly the same period.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 I found a nice one that was from 1900 and it was a sort of a hundred-year prediction as well.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 And I think it's actually quite a famous one.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 This is, this is went around the internet quite a lot.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 John Elfroth Watkins.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 So there are a few interesting predictions there.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 One, my favorite one, he thought that Americans would be taller by one to two inches.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 That's quite exciting, which is probably true-ish.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 More than that, I reckon.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 Yeah, right.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 But my favorite one is the one that he got wrong, which is he thought in a hundred years' time,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 there would be no more CX or Q in the everyday alphabet.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 He just thought that would go that we didn't need them.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Sentable, we don't.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 What do we do?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 What do we need to see for that you can't use a K or an S?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Nothing.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Oh, I see.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Right.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 We need an X for that you can't use a K and an S for.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Okay, but the word "quicks" or "sake" would really suffer.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 So that's for all.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Yeah, you're right.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 That's going to have to go, I'm afraid.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 He also predicted ready-cooked meals, but he then thought they'd be delivered through

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 pneumatic tubes from the shops to people's homes.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Oh, okay.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 Who's to say that we won't have that in the future?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Well, fingers crossed.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 Right.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 I saw an article in the Summit County Journal from 1909 that got posted on QI.com

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 by a guy called Mort.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 And I'll just read a little bit out to you if it's okay.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 100 years from now, if you want to avoid the rush and do your Christmas shopping in your own apartments,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 the scientists will probably have provided for you a telescope.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 And the idea is that you'll be able to see the toy department from your house.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 What?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 So you look through the telescope and then using a telephone, you'll be able to get in touch with the

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 truck and tell them what you want from your house.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 No, not that one.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 No, the one behind it.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Well, he said, does everyone have to live directly opposite the toy shop?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 Well, he almost predicted last year's John Lewis advert.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Yeah.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 So just on predictions, have you heard of Effie Smith?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 No.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 He was an amazing guy.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 He was the first Earl of Birkenhead.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 He was alive in the late 19th, early 20th century.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 He was Winston Churchill's best friend.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 He had an enormous brain.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 And in 1930, he made another 100 years from now, predictions.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 So this is 2030, he's talking about.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 Okay.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 So he's got time for some of these to come to you.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 Yeah.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 But I think a lot of them may not.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 So some of them, he gets absolutely right.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 But he says that play ownership will be common.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Like, lots of people will just have their own play and it'll be very, very normal.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 Yeah.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 Have you not got one?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 No.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Also, he says that people will be living into the 120's.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 And that'll be a massive problem for people because how will youths of 20 be able to compete

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 in the professions or business against vigorous men still in their prime at 120

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 with a century of experience on which to draw.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 That's not a really good point.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 But just going back to the error playing thing,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 a lot of people think we'll have flying cars by then.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Right.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Fair play.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Yes.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 Well, he also predicts that everyone will be so wealthy and affluent that we will all be able to go fox hunting all the time.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Again, don't you?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 I do it in my brain.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Sure.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 And this is a thing he was really, really far ahead of his time.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 He saw early TV and he wanted TV to allow us to vote in the same way that the ancient Greek sort of vote.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 And you'd have a referendum over the course of an evening, basically, electronically.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 So he predicted what are all those programmes of Simon Cowell?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 Yeah, a predicted ex-factor.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 Thank you.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 Yeah.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 He also predicted that it should have come true, but hasn't, that men would only have two outfits by 2030.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 Which would save a lot of time.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Because you'd have your casual outfit and then your non-cashel outfit.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 You'd have your one for normal sea level and then one for a hundred metres below.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Something else that a guy called Jules Bois predicted in 1909 was a flying bicycle.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 Did he call it a flysicle?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 He wasn't smart enough for that.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 I mean, the guy was a moron.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 He was a flying bicycle.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 All the film ET.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 So you can relate it to every...

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 Yeah, basically, I can predict anything I like.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 And in a hundred years I'd just say, oh, yeah, it was that.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 That's what I meant.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 You almost understood.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Communicating with each other's brains is something that I think most futurologists say is the most likely thing to happen.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 I was reading an article about two futurologists said that's 100% chance within a hundred years.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Or I think they said by 2050.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 So we won't have to have this podcast at all out loud.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 There'll be no use for our mouths.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 No use for our mouths.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 No use for our mouths.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 No use for our mouths.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 People, how are we going to eat?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 No, no.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 That'll be through the brain as well.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Like an octopus.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 People will use their mouths to keep loose chain and other small items.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Would you transfer the visuals or would it just be the words?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Let's say you're picturing your house.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 You're like, oh, are you still...

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 Am I just hearing you say, are you still living this house?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Or can I see...

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Great question.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 I don't know, ask the futurologist.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 I don't imagine that.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 It will start off just maybe being words and then it will move on to images.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 And then it will move on to 3D images.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 I'll give you a word that's in someone's brain.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 If I'm thinking the word octopus now...

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Octopus now.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 That's amazing.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 Octopus now, great movie.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 I can't imagine the dystopia that will live in though

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 if everything you think everyone will automatically hear.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 That is, I'm going to kill myself.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Imagine if we all knew what each other was thinking right now.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 Wow, it's not a world I want to live in.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 No.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 I don't even like hearing this stuff you guys say.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 Yeah, you definitely don't want to be the one where you know what we think, Andy.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 Okay, it is time for our next fact and that is Harkin.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that the word pants

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 comes from the Greek word for old compassionate.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 This is great.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Yeah, my pants are very thoughtful.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 In the future, we're living a world where everyone's pants are awful.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 They just write you nice messages, send them upwards.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 This is a bit of an etymological merry-go-round.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 So the word pants comes from the word pantalon,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 which came from a character in the Italian comedia del arte called pantelone.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 And he had extremely tight trousers,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 which is where the word pants became to mean trousers.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 And pantelone's name comes from the Greek word meaning old compassionate.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 There you go.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 Like a pan as in everything, right?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 And pantelone or pantelone was a saint, wasn't he?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 I think as well.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 And that's why he was called that in the comedia del arte.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 He was the patron saint of pants.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Venice.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 He was a patron saint of Venice.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 So I think around the 16th century,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 Venetians were referred to as pantelones or pantelions.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Wow.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 So a pair of pantelones in those days just meant two guys from Venice.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 A pair of pants.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 My Italian mates.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 That's cool.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 So the merchant from Venice would just be a pant.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 Yeah.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 A merchant of pants.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 It's a whole different story.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 So what is the comedia del arte theatre thing that this comes from?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 So this is like a Renaissance type of art.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 It was an old play and a lot of the modern day kind of art comes from there.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 So clowns come from there.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 The Harlequin was one of the characters in the modern day clown comes from that.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Punch and punch and duty probably comes from there as well.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Scaramousse.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Scaramousse.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 Of queen fame.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 It's a character from the comedia del arte, isn't he?

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 That's right.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 So Andy, you wouldn't exist without it in your current guys.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 Which would be really for many parents met at a comedia del arte reunion.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 No, what do you mean?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 It was originally called the comedia del improviser because it was turning improvisation into another.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 And so people who are professional actors would do comedia del arte would do this improvised thing.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 So they'd be these characters like Scaramousse or like pantalione.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 But they would make up according to their character in each different performance.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 So you could promise that every performance would be different.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 But equally tedious.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 That is just modern improv.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 Did people do that?

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 Should we just say that Andy is in a very successful improv troupe called ostentatious,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 which you should definitely check out.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 And they are extremely funny.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 Yeah.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 And the other side.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Six out of the seven members are winners.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Yeah.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 But yeah, it was what professional actors would do.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 So amateur actors would be given plays that they would just memorize and then they recite them.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 But proper professional actors would be the ones who were allowed to do this improvised improv.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 Oh, to live in a world where improvisers got the kudos of actors.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 It is totally unbelievable.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 So I think that trousers or pants were invented because King George the Fourth was so fat.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 Really?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 Do you reckon?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 Wait, underpants or trousers?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Oh no, so this has been a matter of contention in this office hasn't it?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 So I'm talking about pants, which are trousers to us.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 So you're talking about how people used to wear bridges rather than trousers, is that right?

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 Yes.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 So people wore breaches or breaches.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 And then trousers started being worn around the turn of the 19th century.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 And this is at the time when George the Fourth was about to take the throne and he was massively fat.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 So his favorite breakfast apparently was two roast pigeons, three beef steaks, a bottle of white wine,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 a glass of champagne, two glasses of port and a glass of brandy.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 But that was just breakfast.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 He was fat and drunk.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 Yeah, I was just breakfast.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 Favorite breakfast.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 You don't have your favorite every day.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 You might have that a few times a week.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 It's like you don't have crunchy.coflakes every minute.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 Exactly.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 It's when he was treating himself.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 So he was gigantic and he found that this new trousers that people were wearing or pantaloons

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 people were wearing were a bit more stretchy, had a little bit more give for the 28 stone man.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 And so he started wearing them and then it sort of took off from there.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 Is it true that Duke of Wellington was once banned from a club for wearing trousers?

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Like he tried to go in there somewhere in London and they wouldn't let him in because he was wearing trousers.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 Oh, I remember that story.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 Were you not allowed trousers?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 No, because everyone, well, bridges rather than trousers and they were just seen as like this.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 It's like wearing a shell suit.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Well, the ancient Romans said that trousers was the mark of a barbarian people.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 Did they?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 Yeah, because trousers go way back as sort of proto trousers if you like.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Your trousers.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 So they was definitely BC and it's really interesting.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 They basically were developed in societies which did a lot of horse riding.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 Because it's much easier to ride a horse wearing trousers than it is wearing a robe.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Yes, yeah.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 I was reading about a bunch of different interesting underpants that are out there on the market at the moment.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 This one's not actually on the market. I don't think quite just yet, but it should be.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 These are wedgie proof underpants.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 So these are four school children designed by school children, the two boys who used to get wedgie to lot.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 So they invented the Ripperway 1000 and it was a Velcro pair of boxers.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 So you would sort of just come off if somebody starts giving away.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 I mean, that is in a way less good than just having, because at least with the wedgie you know you still got your pants.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 I mean, you know more than you ever knew before.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 Yeah, that's true, that's true.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 But Kudos for them developing something new.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 Yeah.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Well done for being a bit imaginative.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Strikers have Velcro trousers, don't they?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Do they?

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 Oh, Strikers.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 Stripers.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 Yeah, but Strikers as well as boarding events.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 They probably get them from the same place.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Maybe.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 I think a lot of them develop their own because you have to get out of your clothes really quickly.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 You can't hang around if you're a Striker undoing your buttons and stuff.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 You have to go for it.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 You have to get them all off in a few seconds and then you're away.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 I agree with you, Anna, that they probably get them from the same place because it'd be a bit weird to have a shop which sold this kind of thing.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 But you only sold it to either Strikers.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 Oh, Strikers.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 No Strikers.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 Yeah.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 I was looking also into the most expensive underwear.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 So, wife fronts.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 They actually, they're a really interesting sort of golden ones that you can buy.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 So, then I thought, okay, so that's, that's wife fronts.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 I'm going to look into boxers and see what the most expensive are.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 And I read the wrong list.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 The most expensive boxers, Floyd Mayweather.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 But that's interesting to know as well.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 There was a pair that was sold.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 These are historical pants.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 So, they're a bit different.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 But there was a pair sold quite recently for £10,500.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 Any guesses?

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 Nipponins.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 Not right era.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Queen Victoria's.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 And they dated, they dated the rough age of the pants by the waistline.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 Because they have a good photographic evidence of when Queen Victoria was what size?

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 These are 45 inches at the waist.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 So, they know roughly what year it's from.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 That is so rough, isn't it?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 I mean, she was very big for about 20 years.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 She could have been 400 metres on the water.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 She was, her girth was bigger than her height, wasn't it, by the end of her life?

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 That's true.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 And I think those pants reflected that.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 Yeah.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 But the report on them said that they were sold to an English woman who was a private collector

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 and did not want to be identified.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 But she assumed the pants would remain in England.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 That's good.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 Sometimes you have to buy a piece of art for the nation, don't you?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 We really do.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 We're all very grateful to that person.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 I read a very good story in 14 times.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 The latest edition of 14 times.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 The headline being squatting in skinny jeans is dangerous.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 So, if you squat in skinny jeans, it can actually cut off all of your circulation of blood.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Oh, right.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 Yeah, cut off your...

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 So, a lady, a doctor's issue to warning after a 35-year-old woman was found lying in an Adelaide street in Australia,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 unable to stand after spending hours emptying cupboards and lifting boxes.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Her calves were so swollen, they had to cut her out of her skinny jeans.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 It sounds like she had the wrong idea of her own size.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 I think she might have been one of those people who's buying a couple of sizes too small.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 Well, you do with skinny jeans because they often stretch.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 You can get those jeggings.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 Do you?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Well, you buy jeans the too small for you.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Yeah, slightly.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 I did wonder why you looked like that every morning.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 While we're in Australia, I read an article about the most popular terms for underwear in Australia.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 But I thought, do you want to have a quick game?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Let's see if this works.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 I'm just going to have a quick game of Australian words for underwear or Australian words for animals.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Okay, amazing.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Okay, I'll read it out and you have to say whether it's an underwear or an animal.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 Poppies.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Animal.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 Animal.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Underwear.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Underwear.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Yeah.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 Fudge amulges.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 Animal.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Underwear.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 Oh, Annie, you are so good at this game.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 Underwear.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Yeah, smashing it.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 Brawgers.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Animals.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 I'm just waiting to see what Anna says.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 Animals.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 Underwear.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 It's an animal.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 It's a type of crane.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 Three out of three.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 And yabbies.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 Underwear.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 Animal.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 Animal.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 Yeah, Dan, you knew that.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 I knew that one, yeah.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 It's a type of inland crayfish.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 Yes.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 And that's the end of animal art pants.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 Can we put a theme tune in that afterwards?

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 Definitely.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Right.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 Animal art pants.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 You used to be able to get paper pants in news agents.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 Did you?

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Yeah.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 With the news on it?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 No.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Sorry.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 I just mean normal paper.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 I don't mean newspaper.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Right.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 Was it for if you'd lost your pants or if you'd wet your pants?

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Thanks.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Okay.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.280
 Because you know when you arrive at an airport on a holiday and your suitcase doesn't turn

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.000
 up, then you get given paper pants by the airport.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 I've had that.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 I lived in paper pants for about five days.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 Really?

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 Yeah.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 On my gap.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Wow.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 Five days.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 Was it the same path?

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 I think they gave me two or three.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 I don't think they gave me enough of the number of days I had to wear them.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 Wow.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.680
 If you've had to get paper pants because you've wet your initial pants, papers are not the

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:43.240
 best material for someone who has a track record.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:48.240
 I think you would go commando in that situation and the word go commando comes from.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.760
 Commandos in the army don't wear pants.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.760
 No, it's not that.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.040
 It's just always being ready and it's like us.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.040
 I think it's a sexual thing.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.520
 Like you're always ready because you're not wearing pants.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.960
 So the commando's are always ready.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.560
 So the commando's always ready and if you don't wear pants, you're always ready for sexual

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.560
 action.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.560
 It's not necessarily true.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.560
 It's not true.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.560
 And I can attest to that.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:15.320
 I like these as sexual action.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.840
 Most women didn't wear pants until the 19th century, did they?

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.840
 They not.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.040
 They went commando for many hundreds of years.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.040
 No.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.040
 For a reason or...

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.040
 Well, they were pants.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.240
 They wanted to be always ready for sexual action apparently.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.280
 It was actually pants were frowned upon really in women before that and were very rare and

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.400
 were thought to be mainly for sort of quarters ans and such like.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:41.480
 And I think bras were worn before pants mostly or bras were popularly worn before pants.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.480
 Wow.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:49.360
 I found out a fact about cod pieces which is that they used to be used as pockets or not

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.360
 badly.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:54.400
 There is a paper online which examines the evidence for and against it but it's not publicly

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.400
 available.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.600
 So I haven't been able to get hold of it yet but some people say it probably didn't happen

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.360
 and other people say yes definitely people kept coins and other little odds and ends in

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.360
 the cod pieces.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:09.200
 From one of the arm resect experts at the Tower of London told me that.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.200
 That's a pretty good source.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200
 Yeah.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.200
 A cod piece goes over everything else right?

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.200
 Yeah.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.200
 So that's fine outside.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.200
 Well that makes a lot of sense.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.200
 Yeah that's a pouch.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.200
 That's the pre pouch.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.000
 But you'd be a bit worried if you saw someone next to the theatre you saw them rummaging

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.400
 around down there and they said oh no it's just my cod piece I'm just getting out some

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.400
 money for an ice cream or something.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.400
 Yeah.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.400
 Is it like a sporon?

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.400
 There isn't it?

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.400
 People rummaged around in their sporons all the time.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.400
 It's not always.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.400
 But sporons aren't shaped like penises.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.400
 That's the other thing I think.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.400
 That's a good point.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.480
 I thought they look a bit like surgical masks more than anything.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.480
 What?

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.480
 Are they sort of just like a...

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.480
 What?

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.960
 So that's also what pedises look like, isn't it?

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:46.120
 Yeah they're green and they're made of cloth and surgeons wear them on their faces.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.120
 Yeah.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.120
 No.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.120
 What?

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.120
 Wait so you're saying it's shaped like?

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:55.240
 I'm saying that you can get copies which are little sort of like they look like lumps

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.240
 basically.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.240
 They're like all my friends.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.240
 Exactly.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.240
 Yeah they look like a sour's mask.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.240
 Like it's just like a...

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.560
 So when you had your appendix out, did you say to the surgeon who you take that copies

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.560
 of your face?

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.560
 I can't concentrate.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:14.600
 It's pretty money in there, I want a nice grip.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.680
 Okay, time for a final factor show and that is my fact.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:24.280
 My fact this week is that all new emojis are approved by one 63 year old man.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.280
 That's so good.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.200
 Yeah, so this is a world of the internet that I didn't know existed.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.000
 I've never thought where do emojis come from.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 I had no idea.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.440
 It turns out that there's a big council that get together and they approve on what the new

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.040
 emojis are going to be that we have out in the world.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.520
 And the reason for that is obviously something I hadn't thought of as well.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:47.760
 That you need to have codes that are working on any kind of gadget, be it Facebook to an iPhone

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.360
 to a galaxy sams and whatever your phone is, they all need to have the same code.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.480
 So basically it's this big group that get together.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.360
 They're all volunteers from big companies like Google and Facebook and so on.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.840
 And they all vote on what they think should be a new emoji.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:07.680
 So it's headed up by one guy who was the co-founder and he is the president called Mark Davis

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:14.480
 and his daughter and many people online call him the shadowy emoji overlord.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.080
 She made him a shirt so that he wears that around whenever he does conferences.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.080
 But he effectively has high command on the approval of these emojis.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.880
 My legie we must have a flaming poo.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.200
 It's amazing.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.920
 So Unicode is not in and of itself a very sexy thing.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:35.040
 It's just sort of ensuring that computers can talk to each other and that characters mean

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.400
 the same thing in different code.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.640
 And it's only really become this really fun, crazy thing since the rise of the emoji is

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.640
 very peculiar.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.800
 But they've been going since the, since well before emojis.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.600
 I think you've, did you say that it's called the Unicode Consortium?

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.600
 No, I hadn't.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:54.520
 And they release about 7,000 characters a year but only about 70 of those are emojis.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.520
 The rest is for language.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:00.400
 It's how you get Chinese and how do you get any Arabic, you know, like all the languages.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.400
 So that's what they focus on.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.640
 So there's 17 new emojis every year?

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.640
 Roughly, yeah.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.640
 Yeah.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:11.280
 So currently there's via these guys, there are 1,624 and this is from an article that appeared

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.280
 a few months ago.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.880
 So there will be new ones approved.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.840
 And some people come in with really high hopes.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.760
 I was reading an article which kind of, most of my researchers come from actually, Liyat

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:27.080
 Baudugo wrote this article called two days with the shadowy emoji overlords.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:32.760
 And she said that there would be people coming with ideas and hoping to get these 10 new food

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.920
 based emojis approved by them and it wasn't looking so good and would it happen?

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.920
 Wow.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.320
 Do you know, have you read the list of the emojis that are up for approval at the moment?

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.320
 No.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.320
 I want to hear them.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.160
 They're actually not as exciting in hilarious as I hoped.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.800
 So a few that were approved last year were the cheese wedge, the middle finger, a mosque,

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:56.480
 a synagogue and a clown face, which I think is quite a nice reflection of our global society.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.480
 Yeah.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:02.320
 And we want some that are up for approval, which will come in to force next year and approved

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.880
 include avocado, a scooter, a canoe, the modern pentathlon.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.880
 Wow.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.880
 How does that work?

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.680
 It's a lot of very intricate little characters.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.720
 A shallow pan of food, a rhino, Mrs. Claus and a selfie.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.720
 I don't think we need an emoji for Mrs. Claus.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.720
 Do we?

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.720
 Oh, every day sexism.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.720
 Oh, sorry.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.720
 Oh, I'm guilty of it.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.720
 Yeah.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.000
 Apparently they've become quite political though, which makes sense.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.120
 So there was controversy about the emission of tacos and burritos from emojis because they

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.760
 come from Japan originally.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.240
 So they were quite heavy on--

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.240
 Sorry.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.240
 Emojis.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.240
 Rather than tacos.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.240
 Sorry.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.800
 Burritos are not from Japan.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.440
 Emojis came from Japan originally.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.160
 So they were quite heavy on Japanese food.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.640
 And then obviously they involve lots of Western foods now.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.040
 And then it was realized that there weren't very many Mexican foods involved.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.920
 So now there are tacos and burritos.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.560
 But someone pointed out that there are hardly any African foods.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.000
 So you haven't got an ingera emoji or a goat curry emoji, which is what they're all very

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.600
 worried about and is in barbed-weight at the moment, I think.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.600
 Yeah, really.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.600
 So here's the thing.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.920
 Anyone can be a part of this group and vote on the new emojis.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.920
 Right.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.920
 Anyone can do it.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.920
 Well, you can sign up.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.320
 You've got to just apply.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:17.120
 The one full thing is that you need to become a member, properly, to do it for the vote itself.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.680
 And that's $18,000 is American.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.120
 A very sad face.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:28.280
 But so as a result, it is the big company's Apple, Facebook, IBM.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.680
 And then also, odd ones like the Ministry of Endowment and Religious Affairs of the Sultanate

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.560
 of Eman, they're also a part of deciding on emojis.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560
 That's nice.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.560
 Yeah.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.560
 Good.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.280
 And the rules are, you're not allowed to have anyone who's alive, like Justin Bieber.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:46.160
 But if someone like Kim Kardashian has invented her own range of emojis, which she has, and

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:50.200
 lots of celebrities are inventing their own ranges, are those not official?

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.200
 They're not through this.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.200
 They're not through this group.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.200
 I see.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.200
 So that's just something that--

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.400
 And they're not going to be working on every platform I'm guessing.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.400
 Sure.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.960
 Because there is a very exciting-- there's a range of Kim Jong-un emojis, which you can

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.960
 send people.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.960
 Is there?

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.960
 Yeah, really?

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.500
 I was released in response to the Kardashian month, pointing out, this is not the only

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:10.360
 famous Kim on the planet, it's another Kim who's just as cheeky and just as determined

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:15.760
 to break the internet, although in his case it's by dropping bombs on the internet.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.040
 Just on Kim Jong-un, very quickly, did you guys see it's going around on Twitter today?

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.880
 There's a lady who's published a photo of her two kneecaps.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.820
 One looks like Kim Jong-un, and the other looks like James Corden, and they do.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.820
 They do.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.820
 They look exactly like--

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:29.820
 Really?

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:30.820
 Yeah, it's hilarious.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:31.820
 Can you not think?

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:32.820
 Yeah.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.820
 Okay.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.820
 The James Corden.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:35.820
 You have James has face blindness, actually.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.820
 So you wouldn't have been able to recognize James Corden.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:37.820
 That's true.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.820
 I don't have knee blindness.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:44.960
 So Finland, apparently, is the first country to create emojis out of national symbols.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.280
 There are three, and I bet you can guess them all.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.280
 Herring.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.280
 No.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.280
 Sona?

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.280
 Yes.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.280
 A naked couple sitting in a sauna is one of them.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.280
 Oh, a Nokia.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.360
 Yep, Nokia 3310, and the third one is--

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.360
 No.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.880
 The flag of Finland.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.880
 No.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.880
 Because that's--

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.880
 A kind of fish.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.880
 No, it's a headbanger making a devil haunt sign with his fingers.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.880
 Cool.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.880
 Nice.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.880
 Apparently, as a sign of Finland.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.880
 See, I would not know that.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:16.760
 That's taught me more about the country of Finland than I actually already know.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.760
 That's true.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.600
 Well, this is emojis becoming the new language as we are constantly told before they come again.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.200
 Have you seen that Moby Dick has been translated into emojis?

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.200
 Oh, wow.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.200
 What an emoji dick.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.200
 Emoji dick is what it's called.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.200
 Oh, wow.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.200
 So it begins.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:34.040
 Now, instead of call me Ishmael, it begins telephone man with Mr. Yacht Whale.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.040
 Okay, sign.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:42.040
 And I'm halfway through, and it is gripping.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.040
 That sounds great.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.040
 That's a really fun idea.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.040
 I think that sounds awesome.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.640
 I don't think anyone will ever read it.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.160
 I know, but the act of it is just cool to know that that exists.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.040
 I read a list on-- have you guys ever read The Daily Wire?

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.040
 No.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.040
 No.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.040
 Because I didn't realize what it was.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.040
 It's actually a very right-wing publication.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.040
 I didn't realize when I opened it.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.040
 So I was looking at ridiculous emojis, and so I saw the heading.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.800
 A list of ridiculous emojis, so I clicked on the article.

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.520
 The full title is a list of ridiculous emojis, forced down your throat to help push the

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.240
 left's agenda.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.640
 And it's about-- it's just an article really against the climate change emoji.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.480
 They're very angry about that.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.640
 Very upset about the gay marriage emoji, very upset about the safe sex emoji.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.680
 It was a really disappointing article.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.840
 What's the climate change emoji?

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.840
 What do you look like?

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.840
 I'm not sure if it's actually--

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.160
 It's a lot of information to get into this.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:31.160
 It's comparing pretty much the largest, most complicated system on the entire planet,

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.920
 and compressing that into a few pixels.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.920
 That's a tough emoji.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:34.920
 Yeah.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.920
 Yeah.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.360
 I guess it's just like sunshine, sunshine, sad face.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.360
 Oh, machine.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.360
 So we should--

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:46.320
 And that is why you are not on the board emoji designers.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.320
 So there is a thing.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:53.520
 So Apple and Samsung will have a different poo emoji, although there is an emoji for pile

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.520
 of feces.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.080
 They pick how to design it, right?

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:59.240
 So the Apple one has a face on it, right?

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.600
 But the Microsoft one doesn't smile, and it doesn't have a face.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:07.160
 It is just because the code for it in unicode is just pile of feces, right?

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.160
 Yeah.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.960
 And someone wrote to Microsoft talking about this.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:14.320
 Whereas Apple designed this like-- there's a Japanese thing called a lucky golden poo, which

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320
 you could buy.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.040
 And you've been able to buy that for years and years, and it's sort of lucky poo.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:25.560
 So someone wrote to Microsoft and pointed out that the pile of feces emoji looks just like

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.480
 the soft scoop ice cream emoji, unfortunately.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.160
 And Microsoft probably was saying, it is a little unfortunate that the pile ends up resembling

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.160
 soft serve.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.160
 But we feel that people have specific intent when they use this emoji, and the risk of it

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:41.360
 being confused or misused as soft serve is very low.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.880
 So the way you distinguish between ice cream and poo, if you're with an Apple product, is

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.000
 the poo is the one with the face on it, yeah?

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.280
 Whereas the way you distinguish between the two, if both are in Microsoft, is the ice cream

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:58.240
 is the one with a cone.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.480
 Can I tell you something that I think you'll really like, Dan?

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:06.520
 I was looking into smiley faces, because the smiley face emoji is probably the most famous.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.440
 And there is a smiley face under Stonehenge.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.440
 What?

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:15.400
 I think this might be the oldest known smiley face.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:21.640
 So they did what was the largest ever geophysical study a couple of years ago, analyzing the Earth

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:22.640
 below Stonehenge.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.640
 They did this survey, and they've revealed all these pits in different shapes under Stonehenge,

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:32.600
 which were made at the same time, so they're from about 2500 to 3000 BC.

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:37.360
 And one of the shapes is a very distinct smiley face, with the round circle over the head,

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.760
 and then the grin for the smile, and then the two dots for the nose.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.760
 Really?

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:49.240
 So that lend support to the theory that it was an early cent of for rave culture.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.240
 Okay, that's it.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.240
 That's all of our facts.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.240
