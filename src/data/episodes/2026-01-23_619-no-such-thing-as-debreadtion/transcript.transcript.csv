00:00:03,00:00:04,"- Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode"
00:00:04,00:00:06,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:06,00:00:10,where we were joined by the brilliant Olga Koch.
00:00:10,00:00:13,"Now, if you remember the last time Anna was on maternity leave,"
00:00:13,00:00:16,Olga came on the show and she absolutely blew us away.
00:00:16,00:00:19,"She was one of our favorite guests in that run,"
00:00:19,00:00:21,so we were so delighted to have her back.
00:00:21,00:00:24,I'm sure you're gonna really enjoy this episode.
00:00:24,00:00:27,"And when you do, you're gonna want to find out more about Olga."
00:00:27,00:00:31,"Now, the best way to do that is to go to her website,"
00:00:31,00:00:34,it is rock n' roger.com.
00:00:34,00:00:39,"I'm gonna spell it, ROCK N R O L G A dot com."
00:00:39,00:00:43,"If you go to rock n' roger.com,"
00:00:43,00:00:45,"then you will find details of her new tour,"
00:00:45,00:00:48,"which is coming up, it's called Fat Tom Cruise,"
00:00:48,00:00:50,and it is playing all over the world.
00:00:50,00:00:53,"Well, it's certainly playing in the UK and Australia,"
00:00:53,00:00:54,that's for sure.
00:00:54,00:00:57,So do go there and see if Olga is coming to a town near you
00:00:57,00:00:58,and get your tickets.
00:00:58,00:01:01,"Don't forget that if you want to hear more from Olga,"
00:01:01,00:01:05,then you can go to our Patreon and get the Excel version
00:01:05,00:01:08,"of this show, along with a whole host of other goodies."
00:01:08,00:01:10,There are three different tiers there.
00:01:10,00:01:13,"They have extra material, they have video content,"
00:01:13,00:01:15,"they have merch, there's all sorts of stuff up there,"

00:01:24,00:01:26,"how much you enjoy it, that is helping as well."
00:01:26,00:01:30,"So, do enjoy this week's show with the incredible Olga Koch,"
00:01:30,00:01:31,on with the podcast.
00:01:31,00:01:34,(upbeat music)
00:01:34,00:01:50,"Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:01:50,00:01:53,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"", a weekly podcast"
00:01:53,00:01:55,coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.
00:01:55,00:01:57,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:01:57,00:02:01,"with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Olga Koch."
00:02:01,00:02:03,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:03,00:02:05,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:02:05,00:02:08,"and in a particular order, here we go,"
00:02:08,00:02:11,"starting with fact number one, and that is Olga."
00:02:11,00:02:16,"- My fact is that TLC held the head of their recording label,"
00:02:16,00:02:18,"Clive Davis Hostage, in order to renegotiate"
00:02:18,00:02:19,their recording contract.
00:02:19,00:02:20,(laughing)
00:02:20,00:02:22,"- Brilliant idea, brilliant."
00:02:22,00:02:23,- As they should.
00:02:23,00:02:25,"- As they should if, this is an amazing story, isn't it?"
00:02:25,00:02:27,"- Have we, so before we go anywhere,"
00:02:27,00:02:29,have we decided how much you're being paid for this podcast?
00:02:29,00:02:31,(laughing)
00:02:31,00:02:33,- I have logged the doors pre-empted.
00:02:33,00:02:36,"So, apparently, basically, there are albums sold"
00:02:36,00:02:38,"something over 10 million copies,"
00:02:38,00:02:40,"and they made $75 million off of it,"
00:02:40,00:02:43,"but each of them, the trio, got paid only 50K."
00:02:43,00:02:45,"- Yeah, so who are the trio?"
00:02:45,00:02:49,"- Well, the trio at TLC, so you've got Lisa Left Eye Lopos."
00:02:49,00:02:50,- She's the L. - She's the L.
00:02:50,00:02:52,"You've got Chilly, who is the--"
00:02:52,00:02:54,- From Bluey?
00:02:54,00:02:57,"- Yeah, so for all you two, turning into a talking dog,"
00:02:57,00:02:59,"Chilly was there, and then there was T-Bos."
00:02:59,00:03:01,I think she was called T-Bos.
00:03:01,00:03:03,- Yes. - I believe so.
00:03:03,00:03:04,- John Watkins.
00:03:04,00:03:07,"And I didn't know, I thought I didn't know who TLC were."
00:03:07,00:03:09,And then I realized they did that song.
00:03:09,00:03:10,- What's it called? - T-Bos?
00:03:10,00:03:11,- No.
00:03:11,00:03:12,- Creep?
00:03:12,00:03:14,- Scrubs on those grubs.
00:03:14,00:03:15,"- Oh my god, those grubs, yeah."
00:03:15,00:03:17,"- Those grubs, which I do like."
00:03:17,00:03:19,"But I'd, no, I don't think I know what's full."
00:03:19,00:03:22,♪ Don't go chasing waterfalls ♪
00:03:22,00:03:25,♪ They took to the rivers and the lakes they flew ♪
00:03:25,00:03:26,- Welcome.
00:03:26,00:03:28,Welcome to our friends at PRS again.
00:03:28,00:03:31,(laughing)
00:03:31,00:03:32,"- Yes, that's a brilliant song."
00:03:32,00:03:33,"Oh, well, great."
00:03:33,00:03:34,- Yeah.
00:03:34,00:03:35,- Harmonized so well.
00:03:35,00:03:37,It actually identified as the actual record.
00:03:37,00:03:38,- That was quite something.
00:03:38,00:03:40,I was ready for you to come in with a snare drum or something.
00:03:40,00:03:41,- You was gonna do the rap.
00:03:41,00:03:44,- We just didn't go long enough.
00:03:44,00:03:44,"So yeah, TLC."
00:03:44,00:03:48,"TLC, that generated $75 million."
00:03:48,00:03:49,"They got $50,000 each."
00:03:49,00:03:51,"They thought, ""Uh-uh, no way."""
00:03:51,00:03:54,And so they went into Clive Davis' office
00:03:54,00:03:57,and they brought lackeys with them.
00:03:57,00:03:59,- They stationed them outside the room
00:03:59,00:04:01,"and said, ""No one in, no one out."""
00:04:01,00:04:06,- And I gather that lackeys were from when Lisa
00:04:06,00:04:08,had been in the big house.
00:04:08,00:04:09,"- Yes, and she made some friends."
00:04:09,00:04:12,"- Yes, and she had been on court-mandated rehab."
00:04:12,00:04:15,"And that was after she burnt down her boyfriend's house,"
00:04:15,00:04:16,I believe not on purpose.
00:04:16,00:04:18,"- Yeah, completely accidentally."
00:04:18,00:04:22,"- She had put a lot of his, not completely accidentally."
00:04:22,00:04:23,- She could end up in prison.
00:04:23,00:04:26,"That doesn't suggest accidental, does it?"
00:04:26,00:04:28,"- What had happened was, she had alleged"
00:04:28,00:04:31,various things against him like assault.
00:04:31,00:04:33,And I think she'd found him cheating on her.
00:04:33,00:04:36,So I would say quite a vexed relationship.
00:04:36,00:04:39,She had put a load of his sneakers in the bath
00:04:39,00:04:41,and set fire to them.
00:04:41,00:04:43,"Now unfortunately, the bath was a low quality model"
00:04:43,00:04:47,because she had also burned down his previous bath.
00:04:47,00:04:51,"So he'd, the previous time he'd annoyed her."
00:04:51,00:04:53,"- You don't know any TLC songs, and yet here you are."
00:04:53,00:04:54,(laughing)
00:04:54,00:04:56,- This is what the research papers were.
00:04:56,00:05:00,"But basically, they'd had a marble bath"
00:05:00,00:05:02,"and she'd put a lot of stuff in there and set fire to it,"
00:05:02,00:05:03,which had damaged the bath.
00:05:03,00:05:04,So her boyfriend had replaced the bath
00:05:04,00:05:07,"with a cheap fiberglass model, which was a bit more flammable."
00:05:07,00:05:08,"So the next time she pulled the,"
00:05:08,00:05:10,"I'm gonna put some of your stuff in the bath and burn it,"
00:05:10,00:05:12,"routine, it burnt down the whole house."
00:05:12,00:05:14,- It melted the bath in the fire spread.
00:05:14,00:05:16,So she didn't mean to do it.
00:05:16,00:05:17,The first time it was all the teddy bears
00:05:17,00:05:20,that he had given her as presents.
00:05:20,00:05:24,"So she did some time and then when she was led out,"
00:05:24,00:05:26,"TLC formed, they released two albums,"
00:05:26,00:05:29,"Crazy Sexy Cool, which is the album we're talking about,"
00:05:29,00:05:31,"which has Waterfalls and so on, second album,"
00:05:31,00:05:34,"went ballistically huge and so yeah,"
00:05:34,00:05:35,they went and held him hostage
00:05:35,00:05:37,and they maintained a good relationship afterwards.
00:05:37,00:05:39,"I mean, you know, these women brought guns."
00:05:39,00:05:42,It wasn't like just a nice little hostage taking.
00:05:42,00:05:45,You know a nice hostage situation.
00:05:45,00:05:46,"When I read this fact,"
00:05:46,00:05:49,"I thought, oh, that's probably just a publicity stunt"
00:05:49,00:05:50,and they probably didn't really do it.
00:05:50,00:05:51,- Yeah.
00:05:51,00:05:52,"- Well, that's not the case."
00:05:52,00:05:53,"- No, they've spoken about it quite a few times"
00:05:53,00:05:55,in interviews and they try and play down the gun element to it.
00:05:55,00:05:57,"They say, it's like, I never took the gun out."
00:05:57,00:05:58,(laughing)
00:05:58,00:06:00,"- But there was a gun there, lovely."
00:06:00,00:06:03,"- I'll also say it's like '94, around '94, right?"
00:06:03,00:06:03,- '94.
00:06:03,00:06:06,- Obviously there's been endless boy band documentaries
00:06:06,00:06:09,"made about this, but record labels were really"
00:06:09,00:06:10,"predatory at the time, right?"
00:06:10,00:06:12,'Cause they would essentially give you all this money
00:06:12,00:06:14,in advance and then you'd have to pay it back.
00:06:14,00:06:18,"So, I think sometimes violence is,"
00:06:18,00:06:19,"well, I don't know where I'm going."
00:06:19,00:06:21,(laughing)
00:06:21,00:06:25,- And I was looking at some other historical musical contracts.
00:06:25,00:06:26,- Oh.
00:06:26,00:06:27,"- Actually, my research for this came from"
00:06:27,00:06:30,"the latest series of ""I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here,"""
00:06:30,00:06:31,- Okay.
00:06:31,00:06:34,- Which I watched for the first time in about 20 years.
00:06:34,00:06:36,And Jack Osborne was on it.
00:06:36,00:06:39,And he talked about his grandfather called Don Arden.
00:06:39,00:06:42,And Don Arden apparently got the small faces
00:06:42,00:06:44,to work for him 'cause he was an agent
00:06:44,00:06:48,by dangling them upside down out of an upper floor balcony
00:06:48,00:06:51,by the ankles until they signed.
00:06:51,00:06:51,- What?
00:06:51,00:06:54,"- And Jack Osborne said this on ""I'm a Celebrity."""
00:06:54,00:06:55,And I checked in.
00:06:55,00:06:56,I think it is mostly true.
00:06:56,00:07:00,Don Arden in his biography said that he didn't do it.
00:07:00,00:07:03,It was a group of thugs that he'd hired.
00:07:03,00:07:04,"- Oh, well, that's a different story."
00:07:04,00:07:05,(laughing)
00:07:05,00:07:07,"- Who overstepped the mark, he said."
00:07:07,00:07:09,- That would be Sharon Osborne's.
00:07:09,00:07:11,- Sharon Osborne's father.
00:07:11,00:07:13,"- Don Arden, born in Manchester."
00:07:13,00:07:16,And he had a little phone box in Manchester
00:07:16,00:07:17,where he used to work in.
00:07:17,00:07:20,And he was such a gangster that no one would go in
00:07:20,00:07:22,to make a phone call because they knew that
00:07:22,00:07:24,"if they went anywhere near his phone box,"
00:07:24,00:07:26,they'd get the shit beat out of them.
00:07:26,00:07:27,- Wow.
00:07:27,00:07:28,"- Yeah, he's like a real gangster,"
00:07:28,00:07:30,like probably the most gangstery
00:07:30,00:07:32,of all the record boxed buses.
00:07:32,00:07:32,- Gosh.
00:07:32,00:07:34,- He also invented the coworking space.
00:07:34,00:07:35,- Yeah.
00:07:35,00:07:36,- Yeah.
00:07:36,00:07:38,- We had people like park up on a Starbucks
00:07:38,00:07:39,for hours on end.
00:07:39,00:07:40,- Yeah.
00:07:40,00:07:42,- Was he working full time in the phone box?
00:07:42,00:07:43,"- Well, that's what I'm asking."
00:07:43,00:07:45,- That was his office.
00:07:45,00:07:47,He would send people that phone number
00:07:47,00:07:48,and they want a speech when they'd have to ring
00:07:48,00:07:50,his phone box.
00:07:50,00:07:51,"- Okay, that's incredible."
00:07:51,00:07:51,"- Wow, that's incredible."
00:07:51,00:07:52,- That is incredible.
00:07:52,00:07:53,- Flex.
00:07:53,00:07:54,"- Yeah, that is."
00:07:54,00:07:56,"- Oh, got you a fan of Ray."
00:07:56,00:07:57,- What do you mean by that?
00:07:57,00:07:58,- She's a singer.
00:07:58,00:07:59,"- Oh, yeah, Ray with an E."
00:07:59,00:08:01,I couldn't hear the E when you were a singer.
00:08:01,00:08:02,- Where the hell is my husband?
00:08:02,00:08:03,- Where the hell is my husband?
00:08:03,00:08:04,- What a song.
00:08:04,00:08:05,"- She kept me going, I asked."
00:08:05,00:08:06,When's your album coming out?
00:08:06,00:08:07,When's your album coming out?
00:08:07,00:08:11,"And she'd say, oh, you know, and then in 2021,"
00:08:11,00:08:12,she got asked the question and she sort of snapped
00:08:12,00:08:14,and she posted online.
00:08:14,00:08:17,I've been on a four album deal for the last seven years.
00:08:17,00:08:19,But the record label keep on not allowing me
00:08:19,00:08:20,to release an album.
00:08:20,00:08:23,"They say, oh, you're not ready and I'll not yet,"
00:08:23,00:08:25,"you know, sometimes the person signs you up for a deal"
00:08:25,00:08:27,and then they leave the company.
00:08:27,00:08:30,"So there's no one inside saying, right, where's the Ray album?"
00:08:30,00:08:32,"So yeah, all the label doesn't want to find"
00:08:32,00:08:32,that to campaign.
00:08:32,00:08:33,- Wow.
00:08:33,00:08:34,"- I think she did eventually get out of it, right?"
00:08:34,00:08:38,And then she self-released 21st century blues.
00:08:38,00:08:42,"- Yeah, so it's still sort of going on"
00:08:42,00:08:44,that you sign up and then you don't get.
00:08:44,00:08:45,- Yeah.
00:08:45,00:08:47,"- The other big one is New Jeans, isn't it,"
00:08:47,00:08:49,who's like the massive K-pop band.
00:08:49,00:08:52,And it even went into like South Korean parliament
00:08:52,00:08:54,was talking about whether they should be allowed
00:08:54,00:08:55,to get out of the contract.
00:08:55,00:08:57,I think it still hasn't been started yet.
00:08:57,00:08:59,"- When in K-pop, it's even harder because obviously"
00:08:59,00:09:02,they start like 13 and it's like basically a boarding school.
00:09:02,00:09:05,So how long are you technically paying them back
00:09:05,00:09:07,for the services that the label provided for you?
00:09:07,00:09:08,- And I don't know if it's in K-pop
00:09:08,00:09:10,"'cause they don't listen to that much, but in J-pop,"
00:09:10,00:09:12,"like the bands will, they'll have the members"
00:09:12,00:09:13,and then the members will leave
00:09:13,00:09:15,and then new members will come up.
00:09:15,00:09:16,"So it'll be the same band,"
00:09:16,00:09:18,but then maybe it'll just be completely different people.
00:09:18,00:09:20,And it's like all the shipathesis.
00:09:20,00:09:21,- Yeah.
00:09:21,00:09:23,"- The trigger's broom, pick your metaphor."
00:09:23,00:09:25,"But is that, so I was thinking about there's that band,"
00:09:25,00:09:26,is it AKB 48?
00:09:26,00:09:27,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:09:27,00:09:27,- Are they Japanese?
00:09:27,00:09:28,- From Akia Bura.
00:09:28,00:09:30,- And they're like 48.
00:09:30,00:09:31,- They're about 48 of them give all take.
00:09:31,00:09:32,- Exactly.
00:09:32,00:09:33,- I was thinking that they were famous years ago.
00:09:33,00:09:36,"And it's like teeth, isn't it?"
00:09:36,00:09:37,- It's like shark teeth.
00:09:37,00:09:38,"- You lose, well you lose a tooth."
00:09:38,00:09:39,"- Yeah, but when you get to human teeth,"
00:09:39,00:09:41,you only have two sets of teeth.
00:09:41,00:09:42,- What?
00:09:42,00:09:44,"- Oh, I've been so kind of late."
00:09:44,00:09:45,I've been waiting for these new ones
00:09:45,00:09:46,to come through for ages.
00:09:46,00:09:47,"- I guess it's like S Club Juniors,"
00:09:47,00:09:49,but if it was all one band.
00:09:49,00:09:50,- Yeah.
00:09:50,00:09:51,- It's like if S Club Juniors came through
00:09:51,00:09:52,"and became S Club again,"
00:09:52,00:09:54,and then S Club babies came along
00:09:54,00:09:57,and became S Club Juniors a mess.
00:09:57,00:09:58,- So good.
00:09:58,00:10:00,- I would like to say that what just happened is
00:10:00,00:10:02,you said Ray and I did like a cool young reference.
00:10:02,00:10:04,"I mean, I can go even younger."
00:10:04,00:10:05,Do you know K-pop?
00:10:05,00:10:06,(laughing)
00:10:06,00:10:08,Anyone want to be more angry at you?
00:10:08,00:10:11,- I would just say that the surprise biggest girl group
00:10:11,00:10:15,of 2025 has to be Huntrix.
00:10:15,00:10:17,"- Well, are they from Demon Hunters?"
00:10:17,00:10:18,"- They, sorry."
00:10:18,00:10:19,- Oh yeah.
00:10:19,00:10:19,- Oh yeah.
00:10:19,00:10:21,- They got nominated for like every Grammy.
00:10:21,00:10:21,It was crazy.
00:10:21,00:10:22,"- Yeah, well, and they're probably gonna get"
00:10:22,00:10:23,an Oscar nomination.
00:10:23,00:10:26,"And they, they're now a traveling band, basically,"
00:10:26,00:10:27,because it's been so successful.
00:10:27,00:10:30,"They had a number one still word, sorry."
00:10:30,00:10:31,Old person here.
00:10:31,00:10:32,What?
00:10:32,00:10:34,- An animation was released earlier this year
00:10:34,00:10:35,"on Netflix called K-pop Demon Hunters,"
00:10:35,00:10:39,which has just absolutely dominated children's parties
00:10:39,00:10:42,"and Netflix streams, like nothing else."
00:10:42,00:10:44,"- And it has a specific song in it called ""Golden"""
00:10:44,00:10:46,"that I would say that the success of ""Golden"""
00:10:46,00:10:49,"is only comparable to, you remember when Frozen came out"
00:10:49,00:10:51,and it was let it go and at first it was just kids
00:10:51,00:10:53,and then it was everybody all the time.
00:10:53,00:10:54,"That's what happened to ""Golden."""
00:10:54,00:10:55,- Interesting.
00:10:55,00:10:57,"Have you guys heard of Duran, Duran?"
00:10:57,00:11:01,Can we just hold the conversation back around Duran?
00:11:01,00:11:02,"- Duran, Duran, of course."
00:11:02,00:11:03,- Yes.
00:11:03,00:11:04,- Of course.
00:11:04,00:11:04,- I heard you the first time.
00:11:04,00:11:09,- I was looking at problems between bands
00:11:09,00:11:12,"and their fans as well, like breaches of contract"
00:11:12,00:11:14,as well as breaches of contract.
00:11:14,00:11:17,"In 2014, they were reported to be suing their own fan club."
00:11:17,00:11:18,- No.
00:11:18,00:11:19,- With a love.
00:11:19,00:11:21,"- And they, it's great."
00:11:21,00:11:23,They signed an agreement with this fan club company
00:11:23,00:11:25,"called ""World Wide Fan Clubs."""
00:11:25,00:11:28,"Which, Duran, Duran will get 75% of the profits"
00:11:28,00:11:30,"from the fan club, but these guys will run it"
00:11:30,00:11:32,and they're alleged that it hadn't been run properly
00:11:32,00:11:34,and they hadn't been collecting membership pieces.
00:11:34,00:11:37,"It became an incredibly boring and technical story,"
00:11:37,00:11:39,but I like the idea of suing your own fans.
00:11:39,00:11:41,- I wonder why as a person who does our inbox.
00:11:41,00:11:44,(laughing)
00:11:44,00:11:48,- I was looking at some of the oldest sort of contracts
00:11:48,00:11:53,from music and the first person I think to get a royalty
00:11:53,00:11:55,was a guy called Albert Chevalier.
00:11:55,00:11:56,Have you heard of him?
00:11:56,00:11:57,- No.
00:11:57,00:11:58,- No.
00:11:58,00:11:59,"- Oh, I love his, I love his second album."
00:11:59,00:12:00,- Yeah.
00:12:00,00:12:01,(laughing)
00:12:01,00:12:03,"- He got one shilling, which is five pence"
00:12:03,00:12:06,for every dozen records sold.
00:12:06,00:12:08,This was in 1891.
00:12:08,00:12:11,And he's also famous for inventing or popularizing
00:12:11,00:12:13,"the phrase ""watcher."""
00:12:13,00:12:14,- Really?
00:12:14,00:12:16,"- Which means like, hello."
00:12:16,00:12:17,- Yeah.
00:12:17,00:12:18,- Was that in his songs?
00:12:18,00:12:20,"- It already existed, but it wasn't that popular,"
00:12:20,00:12:24,"but he had a song called ""watcher"" knocked him out"
00:12:24,00:12:25,the old Kent Road.
00:12:25,00:12:26,- Right.
00:12:26,00:12:29,"- Oh, that's where that really took off."
00:12:29,00:12:32,"- Well, speaking of ""watcher,"""
00:12:32,00:12:33,"did you know the word ""hello"" was popular"
00:12:33,00:12:36,"as by the song ""hello"" my baby, ""hello"" my baby?"
00:12:36,00:12:36,"- No, really?"
00:12:36,00:12:39,"- Before they wanted to use a ""hoi"" to pick up a phone,"
00:12:39,00:12:41,"and ""hello"" was people mocking people picking up the phone."
00:12:41,00:12:42,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:42,00:12:44,- I really hope this is true.
00:12:44,00:12:45,"- Wait, so we need to research this."
00:12:45,00:12:47,- So did that song come before the phone?
00:12:47,00:12:48,- No.
00:12:48,00:12:49,"- Okay, so the phone happened."
00:12:49,00:12:50,"- A ""hoi"" was being used."
00:12:50,00:12:51,- Yes.
00:12:51,00:12:53,"- Someone sent a grand bell once he'd say, ""a ""hoi"" ""hoi"""
00:12:53,00:12:54,- Yeah.
00:12:54,00:12:55,- That's right.
00:12:55,00:12:57,"- And then ""hello"" was like slaying at the time,"
00:12:57,00:12:58,"and ""hello"" my baby, ""hello"" my darling."
00:12:58,00:12:59,- Wow.
00:12:59,00:13:00,"- With them making fun of people using ""hello"" on the phone."
00:13:00,00:13:01,- Wow.
00:13:01,00:13:02,Isn't it a while?
00:13:02,00:13:03,- When you think of time travelers who would come
00:13:03,00:13:06,"to our present day, the things you wouldn't expect"
00:13:06,00:13:07,would blow their mind.
00:13:07,00:13:08,"- You're using ""hello"" as the greeting."
00:13:08,00:13:09,- Yeah.
00:13:09,00:13:10,(laughing)
00:13:10,00:13:13,- That was like fifth version of how you would do that.
00:13:13,00:13:14,- It was like minor slang.
00:13:14,00:13:15,That's wild.
00:13:15,00:13:18,"You know within the world of TLC,"
00:13:18,00:13:20,they basically fell out at one point.
00:13:20,00:13:24,"Lisa left ""I Lopez"" got a big beef with the other two,"
00:13:24,00:13:26,and they started sort of cussing each other
00:13:26,00:13:27,within articles.
00:13:27,00:13:30,"So Lisa in ""Five Magazine"" called them out,"
00:13:30,00:13:32,"saying that everything's going terrible,"
00:13:32,00:13:35,"then in ""Entertainment Weekly,"" T. Bos and Chile,"
00:13:35,00:13:38,"said, ""Well, she's manipulative, she's evil,"
00:13:38,00:13:39,"""she's a bad person."""
00:13:39,00:13:42,"So then Lisa left ""I Lopez"" replies"
00:13:42,00:13:44,"in ""Entertainment Weekly,"" saying, ""Okay,"
00:13:44,00:13:46,"""we've got three albums left on our contract"
00:13:46,00:13:47,"""with this company."
00:13:47,00:13:50,"""Let's release an album that is three CDs long,"
00:13:50,00:13:52,"""but each of them are solo albums,"
00:13:52,00:13:54,"""and we'll let the fans decide who they think"
00:13:54,00:13:56,"""the best solo album is."""
00:13:56,00:13:58,"But hang on, is this a randomized controlled trial?"
00:13:58,00:14:00,Is it a blind listen?
00:14:00,00:14:02,"'Cause you have to, if you're gonna get it--"
00:14:02,00:14:03,"- You can recognize them from the voice, sure."
00:14:03,00:14:05,"- Yeah, well, that's what you'd have to do."
00:14:05,00:14:07,"You'd have to get someone else to sing them all, right?"
00:14:07,00:14:08,"- To sing them all, right?"
00:14:08,00:14:09,"- We could do this scientifically, or are we not?"
00:14:09,00:14:10,"- Yeah, we just--"
00:14:10,00:14:12,"- When the IRA are on TV,"
00:14:12,00:14:14,and they have to get someone to do the voice over.
00:14:14,00:14:16,- They all have to be done by Jerry Adams.
00:14:16,00:14:17,- That's it.
00:14:17,00:14:21,"- And that was the plan, so..."
00:14:21,00:14:22,Jerry Adams then wrote to Entertainment Weekly
00:14:22,00:14:25,"and said, ""Well, I'm Keen, what about you guys?"""
00:14:25,00:14:26,"So it was meant to be called The Challenge,"
00:14:26,00:14:28,"and that was the idea, three CDs,"
00:14:28,00:14:30,"which would then finish their contract,"
00:14:30,00:14:31,'cause that's how many albums to go.
00:14:31,00:14:34,"- I like the idea, but it's pretty bold move, isn't it?"
00:14:34,00:14:36,Someones gonna come last in that competition.
00:14:36,00:14:37,"- Yeah. - Oh, yeah."
00:14:37,00:14:38,- Please never do this on fish.
00:14:38,00:14:41,"- No, we never do that, 'cause Anna is just gonna get it."
00:14:41,00:14:43,I'm far the most wizards.
00:14:43,00:14:44,"- Yeah, we'll be get squashed by her."
00:14:44,00:14:46,"Just while we're on things, the home office"
00:14:46,00:14:48,might have been interested in Jerry Adams.
00:14:48,00:14:49,(laughing)
00:14:49,00:14:52,The home office used to have its own boy band.
00:14:52,00:14:52,- Did it?
00:14:52,00:14:53,- What?
00:14:53,00:14:56,"- Yeah, they were called Mr. Mina,"
00:14:56,00:14:58,"and it was three, sort of, I think, teenage lads,"
00:14:58,00:15:01,and they would go around schools up north
00:15:01,00:15:02,as part of a government initiative
00:15:02,00:15:04,to deter Islamist extremism.
00:15:04,00:15:08,"So they have various songs about things like 9/11,"
00:15:08,00:15:13,"or the sort of, the temptations of going down"
00:15:13,00:15:15,an extremist route.
00:15:15,00:15:17,"It's unclear whether they knew they were being funded,"
00:15:17,00:15:19,"'cause there's quite a secretive home office program,"
00:15:19,00:15:22,"which does a bit of cultural outreach,"
00:15:22,00:15:24,and I'm not clear whether or not they knew you.
00:15:24,00:15:25,- It was a lot of that wasn't the back of the day.
00:15:25,00:15:27,"Like, there was talking about it."
00:15:27,00:15:28,(laughing)
00:15:28,00:15:30,"- Well, during the Cold War,"
00:15:30,00:15:32,"there was lots of people who became really big,"
00:15:32,00:15:36,"and were sort of traveling around the Eastern Europe,"
00:15:36,00:15:38,and they thought it was all because how great they were.
00:15:38,00:15:40,"But actually, the US government"
00:15:40,00:15:41,was just paying for everything.
00:15:41,00:15:42,"- Exactly, see?"
00:15:42,00:15:44,- Scorpion's wind of change vibes?
00:15:44,00:15:45,"- I don't know what that means, but yeah."
00:15:45,00:15:46,"- Oh, okay, never mind."
00:15:46,00:15:47,I'll take that back.
00:15:47,00:15:49,There's a co-rumor that winds of change
00:15:49,00:15:51,"it broke the Soviet Union, the song."
00:15:51,00:15:52,"- Oh, I bet it is that song."
00:15:52,00:15:53,"- The song, right."
00:15:53,00:15:55,"- Well, there was a lot of CIA stuff going around."
00:15:55,00:15:57,"- I often wonder, 'cause at the time of recording,"
00:15:57,00:16:00,we're number one in Apple's comedy podcast charts.
00:16:00,00:16:02,And I always think that's so mental
00:16:02,00:16:04,"that probably the government are doing this,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,and probably they're kind of training us
00:16:06,00:16:10,to take over some country out of the Syops.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"- Wait, you're telling me"
00:16:11,00:16:14,"that a bunch of teenage boys, singing about 9/11,"
00:16:14,00:16:15,didn't realize that they were
00:16:15,00:16:17,(laughing)
00:16:17,00:16:19,"- We said, ""Nonsense."""
00:16:19,00:16:19,(laughing)
00:16:19,00:16:21,"- That's what came out to you about instead of,"
00:16:21,00:16:23,"""Wait, are you telling me this piece of shit"
00:16:23,00:16:25,"""is the number one in the comedy podcast?"""
00:16:25,00:16:26,"- No, no doubt about that."
00:16:26,00:16:28,"- I mean, we know that a lot of our lessons on fish"
00:16:28,00:16:31,"do come from voxels, specifically,"
00:16:31,00:16:32,just next to voxels stations.
00:16:32,00:16:33,"- Right, yeah, that's true."
00:16:33,00:16:35,"- Like, hundreds of thousands every week,"
00:16:35,00:16:36,"just from there, yeah."
00:16:36,00:16:39,- I thought you were talking about the gay sawdust.
00:16:39,00:16:40,(laughing)
00:16:40,00:16:42,"- Yes, but the gay sawdust at my five funded."
00:16:42,00:16:44,"Sorry, just to be completely clear."
00:16:44,00:16:47,(upbeat music)
00:16:47,00:16:52,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:16:52,00:16:53,and that is my fact.
00:16:53,00:16:55,My fact this week is that the height
00:16:55,00:16:58,of the world's third tallest structure was picked
00:16:58,00:17:00,because it worked as a pun.
00:17:00,00:17:01,- Love it.
00:17:01,00:17:02,- Nothing.
00:17:02,00:17:03,"- So this is better, so better be good."
00:17:03,00:17:06,This is the number one comedy podcast town.
00:17:06,00:17:08,Don't send a spiraling back down those charts.
00:17:08,00:17:09,(laughing)
00:17:09,00:17:11,"- So this is the Tokyo Sky Tree,"
00:17:11,00:17:14,which is 634 meters.
00:17:14,00:17:17,It's the tallest free standing tower in the world.
00:17:17,00:17:18,- Where is it?
00:17:18,00:17:18,- It's in Tokyo.
00:17:18,00:17:21,(laughing)
00:17:21,00:17:28,"- And yeah, it's height was picked very specifically"
00:17:28,00:17:32,because the area that they were building this on
00:17:32,00:17:35,was part of an old region that was known as Musashi
00:17:35,00:17:40,"and Musashi and she broken down are Musashi,"
00:17:40,00:17:43,"Sa, three and she, four."
00:17:43,00:17:46,So Musashi is the exact height that they decided on.
00:17:46,00:17:46,- Brilliant.
00:17:46,00:17:49,"- And interestingly, there are different ways"
00:17:49,00:17:51,"that you can count in Japan,"
00:17:51,00:17:53,"as in the way that you say the words,"
00:17:53,00:17:55,'cause there are old Japanese in those a few dollars.
00:17:55,00:17:58,"So, Mou is part of an old version."
00:17:58,00:18:00,"- Yes, it's Jini-san, she go Roku."
00:18:00,00:18:03,"- Exactly, so it's not Roku, but Mou works as well."
00:18:03,00:18:05,Just for anyone wondering why that's the case.
00:18:05,00:18:07,"- Yeah, so they deliberately did that as a pun."
00:18:07,00:18:09,- Very clever. - And it's lovely.
00:18:09,00:18:10,- It's very cool.
00:18:10,00:18:12,- Does that happen much in the world?
00:18:12,00:18:12,(laughing)
00:18:12,00:18:15,- I've been imagining it as you know what I thought of
00:18:15,00:18:19,"when you sent this, was it the crystal palace,"
00:18:19,00:18:24,"which was 1,851 meters in all yards in length or feet"
00:18:24,00:18:27,in length because it was opened in 1851.
00:18:27,00:18:30,"- That's brilliant, I didn't know that."
00:18:30,00:18:30,- That's cute stuff.
00:18:30,00:18:33,- It doesn't help when you don't remember the unit.
00:18:33,00:18:34,(laughing)
00:18:34,00:18:36,"- Gotta be feet. - Yes, yes, yes."
00:18:36,00:18:39,"- It's about 600 meters, like a mile punch."
00:18:39,00:18:40,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:18:40,00:18:42,This kind of gets to happen a lot in Japan.
00:18:42,00:18:45,"So, this is part of a tradition of Japanese puns"
00:18:45,00:18:47,called Guru Wase.
00:18:47,00:18:50,"So, it can be associated with people, ideas."
00:18:50,00:18:53,It can even be associated with Pai.
00:18:53,00:18:54,- That's in the number?
00:18:54,00:18:59,"- Yeah, so if you say 3.14159265 in Japanese,"
00:18:59,00:19:02,those all are numbers that make words.
00:19:02,00:19:04,And that comes out as a sentence that means an obstetrician
00:19:04,00:19:07,faces towards a foreign country.
00:19:07,00:19:08,- Wow.
00:19:08,00:19:10,- They just like finding all these little patterns
00:19:10,00:19:12,within that world.
00:19:12,00:19:18,If you do 18782 plus 18782 equals 3756.
00:19:18,00:19:19,"So, there's a calculation."
00:19:19,00:19:23,That comes out as bad person plus bad person equals massacre.
00:19:23,00:19:25,When you translate it into Japanese words.
00:19:25,00:19:27,"- It's three, three, six, yeah."
00:19:27,00:19:31,"- We have wide at six, eight, seven, because seven, eight, nine."
00:19:31,00:19:33,"- So, you know, we've got our own version of that in our culture."
00:19:33,00:19:34,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:19:34,00:19:36,- It's a classic.
00:19:36,00:19:39,That's the first joke my daughter led.
00:19:39,00:19:41,"- Yeah, yeah, wow, that's bizarre."
00:19:41,00:19:42,"- Yeah, it's very cool."
00:19:42,00:19:43,- It is very cool.
00:19:43,00:19:46,I'll just mention two others just in case.
00:19:46,00:19:49,"There's a famed admiral, Yamamoto,"
00:19:49,00:19:52,whose given name comes from the older pronunciation
00:19:52,00:19:56,"for the word 56, which was his dad's age when he was born."
00:19:56,00:20:00,"So, Yamamoto 56, yeah."
00:20:00,00:20:02,"And then there's a baseball player, quite famous in America,"
00:20:02,00:20:07,"called Icho Suzuki, and his jersey number was 51,"
00:20:07,00:20:11,"which in Japanese is Go Ichi, which is his first name."
00:20:11,00:20:12,"- Oh, fine."
00:20:12,00:20:13,"- Yeah, so it was Go Ichi."
00:20:13,00:20:14,- That's really fun.
00:20:14,00:20:16,- This is all really good stuff.
00:20:16,00:20:18,"I wish I could refining, you know,"
00:20:18,00:20:20,"normally we kind of just bad sort of these,"
00:20:20,00:20:21,but I just like hearing them.
00:20:21,00:20:23,"- Yeah, yeah, it's really cool."
00:20:23,00:20:24,"- Yeah, Ichi was an amazing baseball player."
00:20:24,00:20:27,"So, he was an outfielder and whenever he called a ball,"
00:20:27,00:20:29,it was seen as like really well done.
00:20:29,00:20:31,"So, that area was known as Area 51."
00:20:31,00:20:32,"- Oh, that's, wow."
00:20:32,00:20:33,- So good.
00:20:33,00:20:34,"Oh, God, I love that."
00:20:34,00:20:37,"- Yeah, so that's a thing that happens in Japan, quite a lot."
00:20:37,00:20:38,"- Love it, yeah."
00:20:38,00:20:39,"- The only thing that the entire time was like,"
00:20:39,00:20:43,"and sometimes when I tear a misu, I say, I tear a misu."
00:20:43,00:20:46,"That's the one pond, the only pond"
00:20:46,00:20:47,that was just circulating around my mouth.
00:20:47,00:20:48,- You say it to the food?
00:20:48,00:20:51,"- I say it to the food, because it sounds like misu."
00:20:51,00:20:53,"- Tokyo, have you been?"
00:20:53,00:20:55,- I did go to Tokyo a couple of years ago.
00:20:55,00:20:57,I wrote a whole show about it.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"Basically, I met a guy at a wedding."
00:20:59,00:21:00,"We spent an unforgettable night,"
00:21:00,00:21:02,and then he lived in New Zealand and I lived in the UK.
00:21:02,00:21:04,"So, we decided to meet three months later in Japan."
00:21:04,00:21:05,- Lovely.
00:21:05,00:21:06,- And it was a disaster.
00:21:06,00:21:07,- Oh.
00:21:07,00:21:08,"- Yeah, we absolutely hated each other's guts."
00:21:08,00:21:09,- Really?
00:21:09,00:21:10,- Yeah.
00:21:10,00:21:12,- But what a beautiful city to hate each other's guts at.
00:21:12,00:21:14,- Did you find that out early on in the trip?
00:21:14,00:21:15,- 45 seconds at night.
00:21:15,00:21:16,- Yeah.
00:21:16,00:21:18,- And then you say goodbye or did you hang out the trip?
00:21:18,00:21:21,"- Oh, baby, we planned too much to say goodbye."
00:21:21,00:21:24,"Non-refundable train tickets, restaurant reservations,"
00:21:24,00:21:25,guided tours.
00:21:25,00:21:27,- Did you go out this guy tree?
00:21:27,00:21:30,"- Well, we went up a building of some sort."
00:21:30,00:21:33,- Do you think if he'd have told you all of Don's puns
00:21:33,00:21:34,and things might have gone better?
00:21:34,00:21:35,- 100%.
00:21:35,00:21:36,- Maybe I would have tire missed him.
00:21:36,00:21:39,(laughing)
00:21:39,00:21:40,- That's beautiful.
00:21:40,00:21:40,"- Yeah, the entire time."
00:21:40,00:21:42,"I was like, I wish I had those in my pocket"
00:21:42,00:21:44,to fill the silence in.
00:21:44,00:21:44,(laughing)
00:21:44,00:21:46,- Not.
00:21:46,00:21:48,"- Wow, that's extraordinary."
00:21:48,00:21:49,- Yeah.
00:21:49,00:21:51,- It's one of those things where everybody sort of always
00:21:51,00:21:54,wonders what would happen if they did such an impulsive thing.
00:21:54,00:21:55,"And I'm here to tell you,"
00:21:55,00:21:56,this is why you don't do that.
00:21:56,00:21:58,- Do you remember who was it?
00:21:58,00:22:01,"- Was it I way, way, who did that thing where"
00:22:01,00:22:03,they got two people to walk along the whole of the--
00:22:03,00:22:04,- I think it was Maria.
00:22:04,00:22:05,- Maria.
00:22:05,00:22:06,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:22:06,00:22:10,So she walked all the way along the Great Wall of China
00:22:10,00:22:13,and then met someone halfway and then kissed and then--
00:22:13,00:22:14,- They broke up?
00:22:14,00:22:16,"- It was her, yeah, it was her both artistic partner"
00:22:16,00:22:18,and her partner in life.
00:22:18,00:22:20,"And they both started on either end of the Great Wall,"
00:22:20,00:22:23,met in the middle and broke up when they met in the middle.
00:22:23,00:22:24,- Did they always plan to break up?
00:22:24,00:22:26,Or did they just remember they hated each other
00:22:26,00:22:27,when they got there?
00:22:27,00:22:30,"- I think, yeah, 45 seconds until we're done."
00:22:30,00:22:31,It's only remembered.
00:22:31,00:22:35,- What I mostly remember about Tokyo is how busy it is.
00:22:35,00:22:37,"Like, because we live in a city, London, right?"
00:22:37,00:22:39,"And you think, oh, it's really busy."
00:22:39,00:22:41,And then you go to Tokyo and it's just like
00:22:41,00:22:43,a million times busier.
00:22:43,00:22:47,"Of the 51 busiest train stations in the world,"
00:22:47,00:22:49,all but six of them are in Japan.
00:22:49,00:22:51,And the top three are in Tokyo.
00:22:51,00:22:52,- Wish.
00:22:52,00:22:53,- 51!
00:22:53,00:22:54,(all laughing)
00:22:54,00:22:55,- Go wish you.
00:22:55,00:22:55,- Go wish you.
00:22:55,00:22:57,(all laughing)
00:22:57,00:22:58,The most busy.
00:22:58,00:22:59,"- Sorry, but who else?"
00:22:59,00:23:01,Who makes the top 51?
00:23:01,00:23:03,(all laughing)
00:23:03,00:23:04,- So shy.
00:23:04,00:23:06,(all laughing)
00:23:06,00:23:08,- I don't see the chart that does the chart 51.
00:23:08,00:23:11,"- It does feel like once you get to 52,"
00:23:11,00:23:12,then they're all in a different country.
00:23:12,00:23:14,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:23:14,00:23:17,- But the busiest railway station is Shinjuku.
00:23:17,00:23:21,"And they had, in 2022, the average number of daily passengers"
00:23:21,00:23:26,"was 2,704,703, which is the equivalent of every adult"
00:23:26,00:23:30,in Uruguay passing through the station every day.
00:23:30,00:23:31,- Oh.
00:23:31,00:23:33,- That's just one station.
00:23:33,00:23:34,- Thank you for putting into terms and numbers
00:23:34,00:23:35,I had to understand.
00:23:35,00:23:37,(all laughing)
00:23:37,00:23:38,- I can't picture that many people.
00:23:38,00:23:39,Can you keep it?
00:23:39,00:23:41,- We all know the entire adult population.
00:23:41,00:23:43,"The population, the adult population."
00:23:43,00:23:44,- Yeah.
00:23:44,00:23:45,- The kids of Uruguay.
00:23:45,00:23:48,I'm gonna have a field day where the grownups are away.
00:23:48,00:23:50,- You'll thank us in five months' time
00:23:50,00:23:52,when you're in Uruguay meeting some Australian
00:23:52,00:23:54,from the other side of the world.
00:23:54,00:23:55,(all laughing)
00:23:55,00:23:56,- The chat runs dry.
00:23:56,00:23:57,"- Wow, I had no idea."
00:23:57,00:23:59,Uruguay was so small.
00:23:59,00:23:59,"- Yeah, it is small."
00:23:59,00:24:00,- That's a small population.
00:24:00,00:24:01,"- It's much smaller than you think,"
00:24:01,00:24:04,"but it's just that tiny little bit in South America, isn't it?"
00:24:04,00:24:05,It's not a very big country.
00:24:05,00:24:06,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:06,00:24:08,Do we have any listeners in Uruguay?
00:24:08,00:24:09,- Podcast@QI.com.
00:24:09,00:24:10,"- Ooh, nice."
00:24:10,00:24:11,- Lovely stuff. - Throw this.
00:24:11,00:24:12,- Send us some freight bantos.
00:24:12,00:24:13,- Yeah.
00:24:13,00:24:17,- This Tokyo Sky Tower is a radio and television tower.
00:24:17,00:24:19,"Now, we spoke about one very recently, the BT Tower."
00:24:19,00:24:22,So it's a hot topic on the fish world right now.
00:24:22,00:24:24,- This one is amazing.
00:24:24,00:24:25,I've been reading a bit about it.
00:24:25,00:24:26,"- Oh, yeah, give us some."
00:24:26,00:24:28,- So guess what they did for the 10th anniversary
00:24:28,00:24:29,to celebrate it?
00:24:29,00:24:31,- Was it a pun?
00:24:31,00:24:33,"- It was, no, it wasn't."
00:24:33,00:24:36,"It was, okay, what's the famous Japanese cultural thing?"
00:24:36,00:24:37,- Godzilla.
00:24:37,00:24:38,"- More artist, even more artistic."
00:24:38,00:24:39,- Anime?
00:24:39,00:24:40,- Even more artistic.
00:24:40,00:24:41,(all laughing)
00:24:41,00:24:43,- AKB48.
00:24:43,00:24:44,- Kabuki theatre.
00:24:44,00:24:46,- Oh yeah. - Okay.
00:24:46,00:24:47,- Oh yeah.
00:24:47,00:24:50,"- You know, this is the ancient centuries-old form of theatre."
00:24:50,00:24:51,"And they have really famous actors,"
00:24:51,00:24:52,"and it's quite dynastic as well, isn't it?"
00:24:52,00:24:54,"So sometimes you'll do it because you're, you know,"
00:24:54,00:24:56,"great, great grandfather, et cetera, didn't it?"
00:24:56,00:24:58,"So for the 10th anniversary of the Sky Tree Tower,"
00:24:58,00:25:02,they got a Kabuki actor called Inchikawa Ibizo the 11th
00:25:02,00:25:05,to perform his famous glare from the top of the building.
00:25:05,00:25:07,(all laughing)
00:25:07,00:25:09,- That's incredible.
00:25:09,00:25:10,- It's so good.
00:25:10,00:25:13,"- There's a famous glare called the Nirami,"
00:25:13,00:25:17,and it's done by moving each eye in different directions.
00:25:17,00:25:17,"- Oh, that's cool."
00:25:17,00:25:19,- Which is good.
00:25:19,00:25:21,And also that means that Inchikawa Ibizo the 11th
00:25:21,00:25:23,"could qualify as a fighter pilot,"
00:25:23,00:25:25,'cause I believe you have to do that to be a fighter pilot.
00:25:25,00:25:27,- So you're also looking to different directions at once.
00:25:27,00:25:30,"- I think you have to have one eye on the mig who's up ahead,"
00:25:30,00:25:32,and you have to have one eye on your instruments.
00:25:32,00:25:34,"So I think you need to be able to,"
00:25:34,00:25:35,I think Prince Harry can do it.
00:25:35,00:25:37,"- Wait, is this a thing that you can make yourself do?"
00:25:37,00:25:39,"- No, you can train for that."
00:25:39,00:25:41,- So your brain can take in two different...
00:25:41,00:25:42,- Yeah.
00:25:42,00:25:45,- And Harry's really good at doing those magic eye pictures.
00:25:45,00:25:46,- Yeah.
00:25:46,00:25:46,- Definitely.
00:25:46,00:25:47,- Definitely.
00:25:47,00:25:49,- It's incredible.
00:25:49,00:25:51,"- All day outside of Thina, like I used to do."
00:25:51,00:25:54,Trying to see if he can get a book of those
00:25:54,00:25:55,and just go through them.
00:25:55,00:25:56,That's a tiger.
00:25:56,00:25:56,That's a butterfly.
00:25:56,00:25:57,That's a waterfall.
00:25:57,00:25:58,He can just do it.
00:25:58,00:26:02,- Wow.
00:26:02,00:26:03,- Okay.
00:26:03,00:26:04,"- Anyway, there you go."
00:26:04,00:26:05,"- Olga, when you went to Tokyo,"
00:26:05,00:26:08,"did you go to the Gotakuji Temple,"
00:26:08,00:26:11,which has got all those sort of cats
00:26:11,00:26:12,that wave their arms?
00:26:12,00:26:14,Do you know those ones that you see in Chinese restaurants?
00:26:14,00:26:16,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:26:16,00:26:18,"- Well, there's a temple just outside,"
00:26:18,00:26:22,"it's just outside Tokyo, actually, where they have these."
00:26:22,00:26:25,"And the idea is that there was a guy,"
00:26:25,00:26:27,some priest or other was walking past
00:26:27,00:26:30,and a cat let him come into the temple
00:26:30,00:26:32,and then that became the sort of lucky cat.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"And if you go there, there's thousands of them outside"
00:26:35,00:26:38,"and you can, you know, pay 100 yen and get your own one"
00:26:38,00:26:40,and then write a message on it and stuff like that.
00:26:40,00:26:41,- That's really cool.
00:26:41,00:26:43,- So is the cat waving you in as opposed to waving hello to you?
00:26:43,00:26:44,"- Yeah, it is."
00:26:44,00:26:45,- Right.
00:26:45,00:26:47,"- And also, actually, probably they evolved"
00:26:47,00:26:49,"from waving penises, we think."
00:26:49,00:26:53,So probably this story is like a new story
00:26:53,00:26:55,and where they actually came is that they were used
00:26:55,00:26:59,in brothels and they would have these lucky talismans
00:26:59,00:27:01,in the shape of penises that weren't beckoning people
00:27:01,00:27:03,into the brothels.
00:27:03,00:27:06,There were things that evolved into the cats.
00:27:06,00:27:09,"- I don't want to, I don't want to assume anything,"
00:27:09,00:27:13,but wouldn't the average person not be going
00:27:13,00:27:14,to a brothel for a penis?
00:27:14,00:27:17,"- No, but I suppose you just need to some kind of symbol"
00:27:17,00:27:19,and it's hard to make a vagina wave.
00:27:19,00:27:20,(laughing)
00:27:20,00:27:21,- You tried.
00:27:21,00:27:24,(laughing)
00:27:24,00:27:27,- Good Lord.
00:27:27,00:27:32,"- I could tell as I started, that said,"
00:27:32,00:27:33,since I was not going to ed them all.
00:27:33,00:27:35,(laughing)
00:27:35,00:27:36,- Wow.
00:27:36,00:27:37,"- Yeah, gosh."
00:27:37,00:27:40,But answer a question I did go and there's a tiny little cat
00:27:40,00:27:42,"at that temple that just says, ""Please help."""
00:27:42,00:27:45,(laughing)
00:27:45,00:27:49,"- I have found, certainly for anyone who's not living in Tokyo,"
00:27:49,00:27:52,possibly the most famous musician that they have.
00:27:52,00:27:55,"Certainly, their songs is known more than most songs out there,"
00:27:55,00:27:56,right?
00:27:56,00:27:59,"- So what you're saying is they're really famous in Tokyo,"
00:27:59,00:28:00,but anyone else wouldn't have heard that.
00:28:00,00:28:01,"- Yeah, and possibly in Tokyo,"
00:28:01,00:28:03,"they might not even know the name of the person,"
00:28:03,00:28:05,but they will know the songs and be able to sing.
00:28:05,00:28:06,- Okay.
00:28:06,00:28:09,- The songs are there as impossibly any other composer.
00:28:09,00:28:10,- Are you gonna forget something?
00:28:10,00:28:12,"- I think it's Mr. Meena, the home office funded."
00:28:12,00:28:13,(laughing)
00:28:13,00:28:16,"- And given his boy band, they're huge in Tokyo."
00:28:16,00:28:18,"- It's got to be the music in the underground, is that?"
00:28:18,00:28:20,"'Cause whenever you go on a train,"
00:28:20,00:28:21,"whenever you get into a station,"
00:28:21,00:28:24,they play a certain song in every station.
00:28:24,00:28:25,- There you go.
00:28:25,00:28:26,- That's what it is.
00:28:26,00:28:28,"So it's not what they call it, Mr. Meena."
00:28:28,00:28:31,"- Mr. Meena, I've just heard the joke in that name."
00:28:31,00:28:32,Mr. Meena.
00:28:32,00:28:32,- Yeah.
00:28:32,00:28:33,- Mr. Meena.
00:28:33,00:28:34,"- Yeah, that's good."
00:28:34,00:28:35,- Because that more mean.
00:28:35,00:28:37,"- No, I think terrorism is Mr. Meena."
00:28:37,00:28:40,- I think it works at three levels.
00:28:40,00:28:41,- Get out.
00:28:41,00:28:42,"- Wow, wow."
00:28:42,00:28:43,- This is huge.
00:28:43,00:28:47,"- Arguably extreme terrorism is more than a Mr. Meena, isn't it?"
00:28:47,00:28:48,- Mr. Meena.
00:28:48,00:28:49,(laughing)
00:28:49,00:28:50,- God.
00:28:50,00:28:51,(laughing)
00:28:51,00:28:53,"- We took that, damn tell us."
00:28:53,00:28:54,- We were talking about joke.
00:28:54,00:28:57,"- It's not Mr. Meena, it's Mr. Minoru."
00:28:57,00:28:57,- Brilliant.
00:28:57,00:29:00,"- And this is Minoru Mukaya,"
00:29:00,00:29:04,who is the underground train composer.
00:29:04,00:29:07,Every train station has its own unique jingle
00:29:07,00:29:09,"for when a train comes in and goes out,"
00:29:09,00:29:11,"and he's done over 110 of them,"
00:29:11,00:29:12,"and he will visit each one,"
00:29:12,00:29:14,and he will watch as the train comes in
00:29:14,00:29:16,and try and invoke what kind of feeling it gives you.
00:29:16,00:29:17,"- Oh, really?"
00:29:17,00:29:18,"- Yeah, I thought they were just random."
00:29:18,00:29:20,"- No, he does it station by station,"
00:29:20,00:29:22,"and every single one will be like,"
00:29:22,00:29:23,is this a historical area?
00:29:23,00:29:25,I'm gonna use all Japanese instruments.
00:29:25,00:29:26,Is this a new area?
00:29:26,00:29:28,We're gonna use synths and electron.
00:29:28,00:29:30,"- Oh my God, so they're not even on the same style."
00:29:30,00:29:31,"- No, exactly."
00:29:31,00:29:32,- That's so cool.
00:29:32,00:29:34,- That's a different song and different instruments.
00:29:34,00:29:37,"- And it's not that it's useful for, say, blind people"
00:29:37,00:29:39,who need to hear where they are.
00:29:39,00:29:39,- It probably is.
00:29:39,00:29:40,- We're recognizable.
00:29:40,00:29:42,"- I gotta say, when I was in Tokyo,"
00:29:42,00:29:45,"we actually stayed near Shinjuku,"
00:29:45,00:29:47,"and whenever we got in, I would recognize this."
00:29:47,00:29:49,Like you would just recognize the songs
00:29:49,00:29:50,"as you moved along,"
00:29:50,00:29:52,"and you would know, oh, our stations come in."
00:29:52,00:29:55,"It's not always that easy with the different,"
00:29:55,00:29:56,"kanji and stuff, I guess."
00:29:56,00:29:57,- That was fantastic.
00:29:57,00:29:59,- What would you like for a whole burn?
00:29:59,00:30:00,- Ooh.
00:30:00,00:30:01,- That's a good question.
00:30:01,00:30:02,- Is it your theme tune?
00:30:02,00:30:03,- Yeah.
00:30:03,00:30:03,- There we go.
00:30:03,00:30:04,- For sure.
00:30:04,00:30:05,- What about Margate?
00:30:05,00:30:06,- Margate.
00:30:06,00:30:07,"- Oh, God."
00:30:07,00:30:08,- I do like to be beside the seaside.
00:30:08,00:30:09,- Yeah.
00:30:09,00:30:10,- Absolutely.
00:30:10,00:30:11,"- Also, the Libertyens live there, don't they?"
00:30:11,00:30:12,- They do.
00:30:12,00:30:13,"- Oh, yeah."
00:30:13,00:30:13,- There you go.
00:30:13,00:30:15,"- Yeah, no neighbors."
00:30:15,00:30:15,- He's a friend.
00:30:15,00:30:16,- He's a friend.
00:30:16,00:30:17,- He's a teen.
00:30:17,00:30:18,(laughing)
00:30:18,00:30:19,- He's a light man.
00:30:19,00:30:20,(laughing)
00:30:20,00:30:21,- That's really light man.
00:30:21,00:30:27,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:30:27,00:30:28,and that is James.
00:30:28,00:30:30,"- Okay, my fact this week is that one idea"
00:30:30,00:30:33,to block Russian expansion in Eastern Europe
00:30:33,00:30:37,is to create a 500 mile long bog.
00:30:37,00:30:39,"- That's, it's so such a cool idea."
00:30:39,00:30:40,- It's a amazing idea.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"- Well, I'm a big fan of Pete and bogs."
00:30:43,00:30:44,- And the big enemy of Russia.
00:30:44,00:30:45,(laughing)
00:30:45,00:30:47,- I'm favor a blocking Russian expansionism
00:30:47,00:30:49,seems we've had a bit of that here.
00:30:49,00:30:51,"- Well, actually, like this is kind of one point of it."
00:30:51,00:30:53,"So this is an article that I read in the week,"
00:30:53,00:30:56,"this week, and it's, it does two things"
00:30:56,00:30:59,that the EU is really trying to do at the moment.
00:30:59,00:31:01,"And that's number one, stop Russia from going west,"
00:31:01,00:31:05,but also to stop climate change.
00:31:05,00:31:06,And bogs can do both of those.
00:31:06,00:31:09,"- Yeah, 'cause if you get rid of a bog,"
00:31:09,00:31:10,"it releases a lot of CO2, doesn't it?"
00:31:10,00:31:14,"- Yeah, so if you make one, it stores CO2 back."
00:31:14,00:31:16,- So is this an extension of like trench warfare?
00:31:16,00:31:18,So you do a sort of World War I style trench
00:31:18,00:31:19,and then you fill it with Pete?
00:31:19,00:31:21,- It's kind of-- - How are we doing this?
00:31:21,00:31:24,"- But you don't put any humans in it, I guess."
00:31:24,00:31:26,"But basically, there's already a bog there."
00:31:26,00:31:28,"- It's a kind of, it's a kind of phantom bog."
00:31:28,00:31:30,- It is a phantom bog. - It's a phantom bog.
00:31:30,00:31:32,"- Well, it's, it kind of exists,"
00:31:32,00:31:34,but it doesn't exist as much as they want it to.
00:31:34,00:31:37,"So at the moment, if you go from,"
00:31:37,00:31:38,"let's say you go from Helsinki,"
00:31:38,00:31:41,"all the way down past the Baltic countries,"
00:31:41,00:31:44,"and then towards Poland and wherever,"
00:31:44,00:31:45,"if you go on that line,"
00:31:45,00:31:49,"there's a huge sort of boggy area that goes down there,"
00:31:49,00:31:50,but what they're gonna try and do is make it more
00:31:50,00:31:52,and more boggy. - Can I ask who they are?
00:31:52,00:31:54,"- NATO. - NATO, so it's NATO,"
00:31:54,00:31:57,"but it's also the governments of Estonia,"
00:31:57,00:31:59,"Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland."
00:31:59,00:32:01,"And what they're trying to do is put more and more water there,"
00:32:01,00:32:02,"more and more peat there,"
00:32:02,00:32:06,"so that if anyone tries to come across, it's very difficult."
00:32:06,00:32:09,"And that's something that's happened in history in warfare,"
00:32:09,00:32:11,"that you basically, you water a log an area,"
00:32:11,00:32:12,and so just can't get past it.
00:32:12,00:32:15,"- And what's really lucky is it says by chance almost,"
00:32:15,00:32:18,"all of these boggy areas are on the border,"
00:32:18,00:32:21,but they're on NATO side of the border outside of Russia.
00:32:21,00:32:22,"So you've got, as James says,"
00:32:22,00:32:25,"Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, it's all running down,"
00:32:25,00:32:28,but they wouldn't have to go into Russia in order to build these bogs.
00:32:28,00:32:30,So what sort of they can just do it?
00:32:30,00:32:31,- I love how we go friendly this is.
00:32:31,00:32:32,This is cool. - Yeah.
00:32:32,00:32:34,"- And even better, Kaliningrad,"
00:32:34,00:32:37,"which is like this little X-clave of Russia,"
00:32:37,00:32:39,"so it's still part of Russia, but it's not attached."
00:32:39,00:32:43,"And Belarus, which is like a real ally of Russia at the moment,"
00:32:43,00:32:46,there's a big old bog in between those places as well.
00:32:46,00:32:47,"So it's like a really different,"
00:32:47,00:32:50,that would be a really obvious place for an attack to happen
00:32:50,00:32:53,"because you could put your troops into Belarus,"
00:32:53,00:32:54,"and you could go through Kaliningrad,"
00:32:54,00:32:57,"but actually there's a bog there, so you can't get through."
00:32:57,00:32:59,"And dare I say, maybe this is going to sound very stupid,"
00:32:59,00:33:02,but it almost makes you think that that's why the borders
00:33:02,00:33:03,were drawn there in the first place?
00:33:03,00:33:04,"- You're probably right. - Yeah, okay."
00:33:04,00:33:05,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Maybe here."
00:33:05,00:33:07,- It's not a coincidence that the bog is up there.
00:33:07,00:33:08,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's almost like"
00:33:08,00:33:09,in the head going down it.
00:33:09,00:33:11,"- Damn it, it's an idiot."
00:33:11,00:33:13,"- But it's really fascinating,"
00:33:13,00:33:17,"'cause lots of this land, the reason I say it's a phantom bog,"
00:33:17,00:33:18,is that it's been drained.
00:33:18,00:33:20,"There are ditches that have been cut,"
00:33:20,00:33:23,"and then the wet, watery mass of this land drains away,"
00:33:23,00:33:26,and the bog dries out. - 'Cause they try to reclaim it
00:33:26,00:33:27,"for years, for centuries, I'm saying."
00:33:27,00:33:29,"- For agricultural purposes, you know,"
00:33:29,00:33:31,it means you can expand your farming land.
00:33:31,00:33:34,"And so all you need to do really is to stop draining them,"
00:33:34,00:33:36,"and block up the drainage ditches,"
00:33:36,00:33:37,"and then a couple of years later, you have a bog,"
00:33:37,00:33:39,"and there are all sorts of arguments going on about,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,"well, the farmers won't be very happy with this,"
00:33:41,00:33:43,"and they might need some kind of subsidies,"
00:33:43,00:33:45,"so I don't, it's not being hugely enacted,"
00:33:45,00:33:48,"but one of the guys proposing it is a guy called Hans Yuston,"
00:33:48,00:33:50,who is known as the Peteland Pope.
00:33:50,00:33:52,I just like him so much.
00:33:52,00:33:53,- Yeah.
00:33:53,00:33:55,"- Is that, is our bogs a solution to every problem?"
00:33:55,00:33:57,"- It's pretty much, yeah, yeah."
00:33:57,00:33:58,- Have we considered a bog?
00:33:58,00:34:00,- Yeah.
00:34:00,00:34:01,"- Yeah, so it's fascinating."
00:34:01,00:34:04,"And this was done at the start of the war in Ukraine,"
00:34:04,00:34:06,"as the Ukrainian army, they blew up a dam,"
00:34:06,00:34:08,which turned the whole of this Irpan river basin
00:34:08,00:34:10,"into a massive expanse of bogs and marshes,"
00:34:10,00:34:12,and it turned the area into what one defense consultant
00:34:12,00:34:15,called an impossible turd.
00:34:15,00:34:17,"It just means you cannot drive a tank through that, right?"
00:34:17,00:34:22,"And actually also Russia did the same in, in Zaporizia,"
00:34:22,00:34:26,and they blew up another dam to stop the counter-offensive
00:34:26,00:34:28,"of Ukraine, so both sides are blowing them up,"
00:34:28,00:34:33,"and also both of those dams were also blown up during World War II,"
00:34:33,00:34:36,when Germany attacked and went towards Russia.
00:34:36,00:34:38,This exact same thing happened where they tried to stop
00:34:38,00:34:40,the Germans by blowing up these two particular one
00:34:40,00:34:44,on the Dnieper and one on the Irpan rivers.
00:34:44,00:34:49,"- Can I ask, why are bogs not defeatable to most modern armies?"
00:34:49,00:34:51,- The tanks can't get through them.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"- Yeah, they can't support the wage."
00:34:53,00:34:55,"- No one's invented a thing that can just go,"
00:34:55,00:34:56,let's ride over the bogs.
00:34:56,00:34:57,- Erroplanes?
00:34:57,00:34:58,- Erroplanes.
00:34:58,00:35:00,- We have not considered an airplane.
00:35:00,00:35:03,(all laughing)
00:35:03,00:35:05,"- No, like, you can get through the bogs,"
00:35:05,00:35:07,but it just slows you right.
00:35:07,00:35:07,- Yeah.
00:35:07,00:35:08,- Yeah.
00:35:08,00:35:09,"- And when you're being slowed down,"
00:35:09,00:35:12,you're more of a city duck.
00:35:12,00:35:15,"- Yeah, and it forces you into a narrow path through the bog,"
00:35:15,00:35:17,"for example, and then your enemy can just focus"
00:35:17,00:35:19,their fire on that narrow path.
00:35:19,00:35:20,- Yeah.
00:35:20,00:35:22,- So you sort of canalize your opponent.
00:35:22,00:35:23,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:35:23,00:35:24,"- Yeah, it's pretty amazing, isn't it?"
00:35:24,00:35:27,"- It is, and the bog might be a huge contributor to this."
00:35:27,00:35:28,"- And like Andy says, it's like,"
00:35:28,00:35:30,"it's not really happening that much in the moment,"
00:35:30,00:35:32,"but in Finland, there isn't in Poland, it is."
00:35:32,00:35:34,So Finland have started reclaiming their bogs
00:35:34,00:35:36,for this specific reason in Poland as well.
00:35:36,00:35:38,"So yeah, it is happening."
00:35:38,00:35:41,- And it's also just from a sort of purely philosophical
00:35:41,00:35:43,"perspective, always very comforting when the solution"
00:35:43,00:35:46,"is like organic, as opposed to, it's like,"
00:35:46,00:35:48,"you know what's gonna defeat AI, bogs?"
00:35:48,00:35:50,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:35:50,00:35:53,"It's like for the whole of 20th century, it was barbed wire."
00:35:53,00:35:55,But we had bogs all along.
00:35:55,00:35:56,- You're absolutely right.
00:35:56,00:35:58,Do you know what percentage of greenhouse gases
00:35:58,00:36:01,going into the atmosphere are due to degraded peatlands?
00:36:01,00:36:03,"- Oh my god, Andy, I think you're gonna tell us."
00:36:03,00:36:05,(laughing)
00:36:05,00:36:06,- I guess you're guessing.
00:36:06,00:36:09,"- Welcome to Quiz Corner, Andy."
00:36:09,00:36:10,"So this is one of your quizzes,"
00:36:10,00:36:13,"so let me just guess another two more than 100, isn't it?"
00:36:13,00:36:16,"- Yeah, I'm gonna say 38%."
00:36:16,00:36:17,- Oh.
00:36:17,00:36:18,- Because 38% is my official number now
00:36:18,00:36:20,that that was the answer to a quiz question
00:36:20,00:36:22,about how much urine was in the international space.
00:36:22,00:36:24,"- I'm gonna go it, she's 51%."
00:36:24,00:36:25,(laughing)
00:36:25,00:36:28,"- To be completely honest, I was gonna say 51 as well."
00:36:28,00:36:29,Can you ask the question again?
00:36:29,00:36:31,- What percentage of greenhouse gases
00:36:31,00:36:32,going into the atmosphere?
00:36:32,00:36:33,- I think it must be much lower than
00:36:33,00:36:35,- I do to degraded peatlands.
00:36:35,00:36:36,"- And I'm gonna be honest with you, I'll go."
00:36:36,00:36:40,- If it was 38% or 51% of all greenhouse gases
00:36:40,00:36:42,"being due to degraded peatlands,"
00:36:42,00:36:44,I think we might have got more of a move
00:36:44,00:36:45,on to solve the problem before now.
00:36:45,00:36:47,(laughing)
00:36:47,00:36:49,"- You've gotta realize that in these quizzes,"
00:36:49,00:36:51,sometimes callbacks is more important
00:36:51,00:36:53,"and getting answered, right?"
00:36:53,00:36:57,"- I'm so sorry, and I think that's an unfair clue"
00:36:57,00:36:59,to the final person in the quiz.
00:36:59,00:37:01,"Olga, would you like to guess maybe the 80%"
00:37:01,00:37:04,of all greenhouse gases due to degraded peatlands?
00:37:04,00:37:06,- I'm gonna throw in 11.
00:37:06,00:37:07,"- Well, you're closest."
00:37:07,00:37:12,"It's 4 to 5, not 45, otherwise 51 would have rocked home."
00:37:12,00:37:16,"- Yeah, but it is double flight."
00:37:16,00:37:19,It's double all flights happening around the world.
00:37:19,00:37:21,"All hundreds of thousands of flights happening,"
00:37:21,00:37:23,"you know, every day is due to degraded peatlands."
00:37:23,00:37:24,That's crazy.
00:37:24,00:37:26,- And you know what's bad for it?
00:37:26,00:37:27,"- What, mushrooms."
00:37:27,00:37:29,- Is that so?
00:37:29,00:37:30,- I do not like mushrooms.
00:37:30,00:37:32,"It has been long set on this podcast,"
00:37:32,00:37:34,but in the UK.
00:37:34,00:37:34,- May trip.
00:37:34,00:37:37,(laughing)
00:37:37,00:37:40,"- In the UK, the mushrooms that you eat"
00:37:40,00:37:44,are made using peat that has been dug up from peatlands.
00:37:44,00:37:48,"They have to basically put the peat on top of their,"
00:37:48,00:37:49,like little bodies of mushrooms
00:37:49,00:37:51,and that's what helps them to fruit
00:37:51,00:37:53,and that's what helps you to get them.
00:37:53,00:37:57,And the UK mushroom industry
00:37:57,00:37:59,gives the equivalent emissions
00:37:59,00:38:02,"of more than 2,600 cars."
00:38:02,00:38:03,- Okay.
00:38:03,00:38:06,- Someone took down the UK mushroom industry.
00:38:06,00:38:07,"- Big mushroom, yeah."
00:38:07,00:38:10,"- I will say quite a small number of cars, is it?"
00:38:10,00:38:11,"- Well, all mushrooms."
00:38:11,00:38:12,- I only have one car.
00:38:12,00:38:14,"- Yeah, no, fair enough, fair enough."
00:38:14,00:38:16,"- No, but like, obviously it is bad"
00:38:16,00:38:18,to take peats out of areas
00:38:18,00:38:20,because it takes a long time to get them back.
00:38:20,00:38:23,So I think they are looking to find other ways
00:38:23,00:38:26,to make mushrooms rather than using peats.
00:38:26,00:38:26,- That's great.
00:38:26,00:38:27,- Am I correct in thinking
00:38:27,00:38:31,"that they used to use it for whiskey and they stopped, right?"
00:38:31,00:38:34,"- They did that, I think they might still use it."
00:38:34,00:38:36,- I think it's now a significantly smaller amount
00:38:36,00:38:37,"from what I, yeah."
00:38:37,00:38:40,"- Interesting, 'cause everyone's gonna go peat-free"
00:38:40,00:38:42,in terms of compost for your garden.
00:38:42,00:38:43,"You can still buy peat stuff,"
00:38:43,00:38:45,"but there's been a big campaign saying,"
00:38:45,00:38:47,"""Can you use some peat-free?"""
00:38:47,00:38:48,- Yeah.
00:38:48,00:38:48,"- Comprehensive, you can't get."
00:38:48,00:38:49,So I didn't know that about the mushrooms.
00:38:49,00:38:50,- That's very cool.
00:38:50,00:38:52,- Have you guys heard about the 40 acre bog?
00:38:52,00:38:53,- 40 acre bog.
00:38:53,00:38:54,"- Yeah, no."
00:38:54,00:38:55,- 40 acre bog.
00:38:55,00:38:59,"This is in Lake Chippewa, which is in Wisconsin."
00:38:59,00:39:01,So this was a lake that was created in the 1920s.
00:39:01,00:39:03,They flooded a swamp in order to do it.
00:39:03,00:39:08,"And as a result of it, this bog formed, that's 40 acres"
00:39:08,00:39:10,"and it sort of sits in the middle of the lake,"
00:39:10,00:39:12,but it moves around.
00:39:12,00:39:13,- A bog in the middle of a lake.
00:39:13,00:39:14,"- Yeah, it's pretty amazing."
00:39:14,00:39:16,So it's got sort of mud plains underneath it.
00:39:16,00:39:18,"And on top, it's very grassy"
00:39:18,00:39:20,and it's got a few trees like thin trees sticking out.
00:39:20,00:39:22,- I have seen this.
00:39:22,00:39:24,"- Yeah, it's pretty amazing because it's transient."
00:39:24,00:39:25,It moves around all the time.
00:39:25,00:39:27,So what happens is there's a bridge
00:39:27,00:39:28,that goes over the lake
00:39:28,00:39:31,and this bog keeps coming towards the bridge.
00:39:31,00:39:34,And so what they do is they get all the boats
00:39:34,00:39:35,and they line up against the bog
00:39:35,00:39:37,and they shove it back out of the way.
00:39:37,00:39:38,They all drive the bog.
00:39:38,00:39:39,- Yeah.
00:39:39,00:39:40,- It's like an annual thing.
00:39:40,00:39:42,"They have to do, they have to push the bog."
00:39:42,00:39:43,"- Yeah, and it's not consistent."
00:39:43,00:39:44,They have to check every morning
00:39:44,00:39:47,that the bog isn't making its way back over it.
00:39:47,00:39:48,- How's that even work?
00:39:48,00:39:49,"- I know, it's wild, isn't it?"
00:39:49,00:39:51,"If you've seen images of it, it's pretty cool."
00:39:51,00:39:52,- It's stunning.
00:39:52,00:39:53,- It's absolutely stunning.
00:39:53,00:39:56,"- So it doesn't, I assume it doesn't go that deep"
00:39:56,00:39:57,into the water if it's movable.
00:39:57,00:40:00,"- No, no, no, no, no, no, it's not very far down."
00:40:00,00:40:01,"- It's just floating, Pete."
00:40:01,00:40:02,- It's floating matter.
00:40:02,00:40:04,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:04,00:40:06,- That is so cool.
00:40:06,00:40:09,Does anyone know where is the world's biggest bog?
00:40:09,00:40:11,It's somewhere that's been mentioned
00:40:11,00:40:12,on this podcast already.
00:40:12,00:40:13,"- Okay, okay."
00:40:13,00:40:15,- It's okay.
00:40:15,00:40:16,"- Will it be somewhere,"
00:40:16,00:40:17,"I'm gonna guess somewhere in Eastern Europe,"
00:40:17,00:40:18,somewhere like Belarus.
00:40:18,00:40:19,- You're close.
00:40:19,00:40:20,It's Russia.
00:40:20,00:40:21,- Okay.
00:40:21,00:40:22,- It's the great.
00:40:22,00:40:24,"- I mean, if you have that much land mass,"
00:40:24,00:40:25,statistically speaking.
00:40:25,00:40:26,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:40:26,00:40:30,"- It's the great Vazugian Maya, it's in Siberia"
00:40:30,00:40:33,and it is twice the size of Wales.
00:40:33,00:40:34,- Goodness.
00:40:34,00:40:36,"- But again, to Russia, that's nothing."
00:40:36,00:40:39,"'Cause they've got areas, the size of Wales coming out."
00:40:39,00:40:40,There is.
00:40:40,00:40:43,"And it comes from melting permafrost, basically."
00:40:43,00:40:45,"So the water, melts from the permafrost,"
00:40:45,00:40:48,goes into this area and becomes a marshy land.
00:40:48,00:40:51,And the worst thing about it is the flies and midges
00:40:51,00:40:52,that live there.
00:40:52,00:40:55,"If you ask locals, they say that there's so many midges"
00:40:55,00:40:58,they can drink enough blood from a random traveler
00:40:58,00:41:01,that they will die of midge bites.
00:41:01,00:41:03,"- Oh, the traveler will die."
00:41:03,00:41:04,Not the midge dies of.
00:41:04,00:41:05,"- No, they'll have in a great time."
00:41:05,00:41:06,- Okay.
00:41:06,00:41:07,- Yeah.
00:41:07,00:41:08,"- But yeah, that's what they say."
00:41:08,00:41:10,"And there is no doubt there is a lot of midges there,"
00:41:10,00:41:12,but whether they can actually drain you
00:41:12,00:41:14,"of all your blood, I think probably not."
00:41:14,00:41:15,But anyone who works there has to wear
00:41:15,00:41:19,like hazmat suit solvast or like beekeeper suits
00:41:19,00:41:20,so that they don't get bitten.
00:41:20,00:41:21,"- Oh, not for me."
00:41:21,00:41:22,- Man.
00:41:22,00:41:23,"- No, not for me."
00:41:23,00:41:25,I don't even like one midge.
00:41:25,00:41:27,"- Now, we all know Ireland."
00:41:27,00:41:28,"- Oh, I love him."
00:41:28,00:41:29,- Yeah.
00:41:29,00:41:31,- How many Walesers is that?
00:41:31,00:41:34,- They've got vast piti areas.
00:41:34,00:41:35,- They do.
00:41:35,00:41:36,- Okay.
00:41:36,00:41:40,"- But how many Irish people, according to the latest census,"
00:41:40,00:41:42,heat their homes by burning peat?
00:41:42,00:41:43,- 51.
00:41:43,00:41:44,- Okay.
00:41:44,00:41:45,- 38.
00:41:45,00:41:46,- Two.
00:41:46,00:41:49,"- It's 68,000."
00:41:49,00:41:50,- Wow.
00:41:50,00:41:51,"- 68,000."
00:41:51,00:41:52,- Wow.
00:41:52,00:41:53,- And I would have thought.
00:41:53,00:41:54,"- Yeah, for sure."
00:41:54,00:41:55,- I thought we were doing percentages.
00:41:55,00:41:57,I don't think.
00:41:57,00:41:58,(laughing)
00:41:58,00:41:59,- Sorry.
00:41:59,00:42:00,"- Well, there's one percent of the population,"
00:42:00,00:42:01,so you're not far off.
00:42:01,00:42:01,- Is it really?
00:42:01,00:42:02,- Yeah.
00:42:02,00:42:03,- They've got these raised bogs.
00:42:03,00:42:04,- Thank you.
00:42:04,00:42:07,- But there are some bog bastards as I'm calling them.
00:42:07,00:42:08,- Bogdas.
00:42:08,00:42:09,- It's okay.
00:42:09,00:42:09,(laughing)
00:42:09,00:42:10,"- Is that an official tab, or is it?"
00:42:10,00:42:11,- For majors.
00:42:11,00:42:13,- That's an AHM original.
00:42:13,00:42:14,But those are people who aren't
00:42:14,00:42:17,sneakily cutting special conservation areas of bogs.
00:42:17,00:42:18,Because a lot of these bogs are now protected.
00:42:18,00:42:19,"- From a scientific viewpoint,"
00:42:19,00:42:21,why would I burn peat over wood?
00:42:21,00:42:23,"- Is it, does it burn longer?"
00:42:23,00:42:24,- I think just there's loads of peat around.
00:42:24,00:42:25,"- Oh, okay."
00:42:25,00:42:26,- I think it would burn longer.
00:42:26,00:42:27,"- Oh, would it?"
00:42:27,00:42:28,"- I think so, yeah."
00:42:28,00:42:29,- Right.
00:42:29,00:42:30,"- I think it kind of turns more carbon, doesn't it?"
00:42:30,00:42:31,- Mmm.
00:42:31,00:42:32,- I'm pretty sure.
00:42:32,00:42:34,- Those bogs in Ireland is where you would find
00:42:34,00:42:36,Tories speaking of bog bastards.
00:42:36,00:42:37,(laughing)
00:42:37,00:42:38,- I don't know.
00:42:38,00:42:40,"- So Tories, I think as we've said before,"
00:42:40,00:42:44,"was an old sort of word for an outlaw in Ireland,"
00:42:44,00:42:45,especially a Roman Catholic one.
00:42:45,00:42:47,They would call them Tories.
00:42:47,00:42:48,"And then eventually it became,"
00:42:48,00:42:51,"I can't remember how it became a word for conservatives,"
00:42:51,00:42:53,but it's always that word's from.
00:42:53,00:42:54,"- Yeah, it's originally--"
00:42:54,00:42:55,- It's fascinating.
00:42:55,00:42:58,"- But yeah, they would live in the bogs,"
00:42:58,00:43:00,"these outlaws, and then they would come"
00:43:00,00:43:01,and attack your sheep and stuff.
00:43:01,00:43:02,- Wow.
00:43:02,00:43:04,- We've got peat and Margate.
00:43:04,00:43:04,- Happy?
00:43:04,00:43:05,"- Yeah, peat talkative."
00:43:05,00:43:06,(cheering)
00:43:06,00:43:08,"- A lot of annoying me all the time, eh?"
00:43:08,00:43:09,"- Yeah, here we go."
00:43:09,00:43:10,- That's number one comedy podcast.
00:43:10,00:43:11,(laughing)
00:43:11,00:43:12,- In the end.
00:43:12,00:43:14,(upbeat music)
00:43:14,00:43:19,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:43:19,00:43:21,and that is Andy.
00:43:21,00:43:24,"- My fact is, when the first ever online pizza delivery"
00:43:24,00:43:28,"was made, a hundred journalists turned up to report on it."
00:43:28,00:43:29,The driver got lost.
00:43:29,00:43:30,"It took an hour to deliver,"
00:43:30,00:43:32,and the pizza was long cold.
00:43:32,00:43:32,- Wow.
00:43:32,00:43:34,- So this is something that was printed in the LA Times
00:43:34,00:43:37,"in 1994, which I love to read."
00:43:37,00:43:41,"- Well, only a few months before TLC released"
00:43:41,00:43:42,Crazy Sexy Cool.
00:43:42,00:43:43,- It's the 1994 podcast.
00:43:43,00:43:44,- Yeah.
00:43:44,00:43:45,- It really is.
00:43:45,00:43:46,- Clive Davis was the one to order the pizza
00:43:46,00:43:50,to sort of try and get out of the hospital situation.
00:43:50,00:43:50,- Please help.
00:43:50,00:43:51,(laughing)
00:43:51,00:43:52,- It's typing.
00:43:52,00:43:57,"- Yeah, there was this article headline,"
00:43:57,00:43:58,"online pizza idea is clever,"
00:43:58,00:44:02,"but only half-baked, brilliant."
00:44:02,00:44:04,"And it was by Pizza Hut, giants of the scene."
00:44:04,00:44:05,"- Oh, they always do stuff like that."
00:44:05,00:44:06,- They always do stuff like that.
00:44:06,00:44:07,- But this one was genuinely an innovation.
00:44:07,00:44:09,So they launched the thing called Pizza Net.
00:44:09,00:44:11,"It was in Santa Cruz,"
00:44:11,00:44:13,and I think this was hosted at the University
00:44:13,00:44:14,"of California, Santa Cruz."
00:44:14,00:44:17,"Basically, no one had really tried,"
00:44:18,00:44:20,"not many people had done e-commerce like this,"
00:44:20,00:44:22,especially not with a pizza.
00:44:22,00:44:23,- It was not in 1994.
00:44:23,00:44:25,- This is so long ago.
00:44:25,00:44:26,And you had to put in your stats.
00:44:26,00:44:27,You had to put in your order.
00:44:27,00:44:31,"The data was then sent to Pizza Hut HQ in Kansas,"
00:44:31,00:44:32,quite a long way away.
00:44:32,00:44:36,"It was relayed via a modem to your nearest Pizza Hut branch,"
00:44:36,00:44:38,who would then phone you up to check
00:44:38,00:44:39,that you weren't pranking them.
00:44:39,00:44:41,"And then eventually, after that had all been gone through,"
00:44:41,00:44:43,then they would start making you your pizza
00:44:43,00:44:44,and deliver it to your home.
00:44:44,00:44:46,And they got a hundred journalists in
00:44:46,00:44:47,to report on this.
00:44:47,00:44:49,- People had the internet by them.
00:44:49,00:44:51,I reckon it was about them.
00:44:51,00:44:53,"I went to Georgiaal Bank,"
00:44:53,00:44:57,which is a big telescope in the north of England.
00:44:57,00:44:59,And that was the only place that had the internet.
00:44:59,00:45:02,"- Yeah, that's like, I've never seen the internet."
00:45:02,00:45:03,- Did you go online?
00:45:03,00:45:04,"- Yeah, what did you do?"
00:45:04,00:45:07,"I searched, I was really into fantasy football at the time."
00:45:07,00:45:09,So I searched for the word fantasy
00:45:09,00:45:12,and got as a 14-year-old boy.
00:45:12,00:45:12,- Uh-oh.
00:45:12,00:45:15,- A lot of knowledge that I didn't wish previously had.
00:45:15,00:45:16,- Oh my gosh.
00:45:16,00:45:16,- Oh my gosh.
00:45:16,00:45:17,- Nice.
00:45:17,00:45:19,- Did you have a Georgiaal Bank?
00:45:19,00:45:22,(laughing)
00:45:22,00:45:28,"- Anyway, yeah."
00:45:28,00:45:29,"- It is early internet, isn't it?"
00:45:29,00:45:32,"And 94, that's when Amazon launched."
00:45:32,00:45:34,"- Yeah, 95 is when eBay launched."
00:45:34,00:45:36,It's way older than I realised.
00:45:36,00:45:38,- There was almost nothing on the internet back then.
00:45:38,00:45:40,"Newspapers would run articles saying,"
00:45:40,00:45:42,"""Here are the best websites to go to."""
00:45:42,00:45:43,Which I love.
00:45:43,00:45:44,I think we could do with that again.
00:45:44,00:45:45,- Yeah.
00:45:45,00:45:46,"- 'Cause the internet's been sort of,"
00:45:46,00:45:49,it's like there are now only about what four websites now.
00:45:49,00:45:50,- I'm always looking for a new website.
00:45:50,00:45:52,I love a new website.
00:45:52,00:45:52,- What do you mean?
00:45:52,00:45:53,- I want new cool stuff.
00:45:53,00:45:56,- It used to be when I started working at QI
00:45:56,00:45:58,that you could search for carrot facts
00:45:58,00:46:00,and you would get a page of someone
00:46:00,00:46:03,"who really liked carrots, writing 20 incredible facts."
00:46:03,00:46:04,- That's what I want.
00:46:04,00:46:05,- Really well solved about carrots.
00:46:05,00:46:07,- In comic sands with like a sort of my spacey
00:46:07,00:46:08,background of carrots.
00:46:08,00:46:10,"- No, you put in carrot facts and AI goes."
00:46:10,00:46:13,- Did you know that carrots are all green?
00:46:13,00:46:15,"And you're like, ""Oh right, are you sure?"""
00:46:15,00:46:16,I think they're orange.
00:46:16,00:46:16,"Oh yes, they are."
00:46:16,00:46:18,"Orange, I'm sorry about that."
00:46:18,00:46:20,"- Wait, you guys are extremely smart."
00:46:20,00:46:21,This is unrelated to anything.
00:46:21,00:46:23,"But can someone explain to me,"
00:46:23,00:46:25,"I'm the one, the quote unquote tech person here."
00:46:25,00:46:27,Why can't it say I don't know?
00:46:27,00:46:29,Why can't it say I don't know?
00:46:29,00:46:32,"And second, well, why can't it tell me where it got its knowledge?"
00:46:32,00:46:34,- 'Cause it's stolen from somewhere else
00:46:34,00:46:35,and they don't want to reveal it?
00:46:35,00:46:36,"- Yeah, that's fair."
00:46:36,00:46:38,- I'm sure I can Google this.
00:46:38,00:46:39,It would just be so much more reliable
00:46:39,00:46:40,if it said I don't know.
00:46:40,00:46:42,- Wouldn't it be great?
00:46:42,00:46:43,- But I'm not interested in making a better product.
00:46:43,00:46:44,Never mind.
00:46:44,00:46:46,- But don't you think that?
00:46:46,00:46:48,"That's just true of humans in general, right?"
00:46:48,00:46:49,"So many people, if you ask them,"
00:46:49,00:46:51,"especially people on the internet,"
00:46:51,00:46:52,"if you ask them something,"
00:46:52,00:46:54,"they'll just pretend they know the answer and say,"
00:46:54,00:46:57,"""If we all learned how to say I don't know a bit more,"
00:46:57,00:46:59,"then wouldn't the world be a better place?"""
00:46:59,00:47:00,I don't know.
00:47:00,00:47:03,"Grubhub, have you heard of Grubhub?"
00:47:03,00:47:04,- Love Grubhub.
00:47:04,00:47:06,It's like delivered food for Americans or something.
00:47:06,00:47:07,"- Yeah, I don't really know."
00:47:07,00:47:08,- Are we overpeats a hunt?
00:47:08,00:47:10,"I just have one more thing to say,"
00:47:10,00:47:13,which is I had assumed that hiring Gorbachev
00:47:13,00:47:14,to be in one of their ads was the coolest thing
00:47:14,00:47:15,they did in the '90s.
00:47:15,00:47:16,- Wow.
00:47:16,00:47:18,"- Essentially, it's Gorbachev"
00:47:18,00:47:20,enjoying pizza at Pizza Hut.
00:47:20,00:47:22,And then different people at the restaurant
00:47:22,00:47:23,are debating whether he's a good or bad guy.
00:47:23,00:47:24,- Right.
00:47:24,00:47:26,"- And the ending is, well, he's the one who brought pizza Hut."
00:47:26,00:47:30,"So I guess the conclusion is that you can't beat Pizza Hut,"
00:47:30,00:47:33,but it was more nuanced in terms of where people were standing.
00:47:33,00:47:34,- Wow.
00:47:34,00:47:34,- Then you'd think.
00:47:34,00:47:36,- Pizza Hut in our times.
00:47:36,00:47:38,That's a joke about pizza in our time.
00:47:38,00:47:38,- Yeah.
00:47:38,00:47:40,- Which was something that Gorbachev didn't say.
00:47:40,00:47:41,- Yeah.
00:47:41,00:47:43,- That was another table in.
00:47:43,00:47:45,I felt us literally just moved to number two
00:47:45,00:47:48,"in the comedy challenge, so I said, I don't know."
00:47:48,00:47:50,Did you guys feel that?
00:47:50,00:47:53,It's like a shudder pizza Hut in our times.
00:47:53,00:47:55,(laughing)
00:47:55,00:47:56,- Ooh.
00:47:56,00:47:58,"Meanwhile at Parenting Pal, they're like,"
00:47:58,00:47:59,"""Oh, did you feel that?"
00:47:59,00:48:02,"""I just felt like we lifted you up."""
00:48:02,00:48:04,I think we've just done a terrible job.
00:48:07,00:48:10,"- In my house, we grew up with a giant painting"
00:48:10,00:48:12,of Gorbachev on our lounge room wall.
00:48:12,00:48:13,- Yeah.
00:48:13,00:48:14,(laughing)
00:48:14,00:48:15,"- Again, I'm gonna say lie."
00:48:15,00:48:18,(laughing)
00:48:18,00:48:18,- Is that true?
00:48:18,00:48:19,- Yeah.
00:48:19,00:48:22,We had one of him and one of Chairman Mao.
00:48:22,00:48:23,- What?
00:48:23,00:48:27,"- Yeah, so it was knockoffs of Andy Warhol's collection"
00:48:27,00:48:31,"of Pop Art, and they bought it in a market somewhere."
00:48:31,00:48:32,"But I grew up with Gorbachev on my wall,"
00:48:32,00:48:34,"wondering, who is this guy?"
00:48:34,00:48:36,"Is he good or bad, you know?"
00:48:36,00:48:37,- Interesting.
00:48:37,00:48:38,- Do you know the pizza?
00:48:38,00:48:39,- We grew up with this.
00:48:39,00:48:39,- Things had resolved that.
00:48:39,00:48:41,"- Yeah, all you had to do was watch the ad."
00:48:41,00:48:43,- We grew up with a series of Russian leader
00:48:43,00:48:45,themed matrioshka in my house.
00:48:45,00:48:46,"- Ah, did you?"
00:48:46,00:48:47,"- Yeah, you know the Russian dolls."
00:48:47,00:48:48,The one on the outside was the biggest one.
00:48:48,00:48:49,- I have a name.
00:48:49,00:48:52,(laughing)
00:48:52,00:48:54,- Lovely.
00:48:54,00:48:55,And we're back to number one.
00:48:55,00:48:56,(laughing)
00:48:56,00:48:57,- That's good.
00:48:57,00:49:00,- The big one was it Stalin on the outside.
00:49:00,00:49:02,- The big one was the newest one
00:49:02,00:49:03,who was Yeltsin at the time.
00:49:03,00:49:04,- Yeltsin.
00:49:04,00:49:06,"- And then it was going all the way back to London,"
00:49:06,00:49:06,I think.
00:49:06,00:49:11,"- Grubhub is a food delivery system online, right?"
00:49:11,00:49:15,It was started by a guy called Colin Wallace
00:49:15,00:49:17,and he was a school child
00:49:17,00:49:20,and he wanted to get a sandwich to his classroom
00:49:20,00:49:22,without the teacher noticing.
00:49:22,00:49:24,And so he created a computer program
00:49:24,00:49:27,"which took a text from his phone,"
00:49:27,00:49:30,"sent it to a fax, which was delivered to a restaurant,"
00:49:30,00:49:34,and then they would send the sandwich to the classroom.
00:49:34,00:49:35,"- Right, amazing."
00:49:35,00:49:36,- That's genius.
00:49:36,00:49:39,- And then eventually sort of turn that into a much bigger thing
00:49:39,00:49:42,and then got bought out by some squillianaires.
00:49:42,00:49:43,But yeah.
00:49:43,00:49:44,- Okay.
00:49:44,00:49:44,- Are you the origin stories?
00:49:44,00:49:48,- I don't know if you guys do business ideas here.
00:49:48,00:49:51,"- Oh yeah, we're doing, we're doing."
00:49:51,00:49:53,None of them has taken off yet.
00:49:53,00:49:56,"- Okay, but like you know how there's like the founder movie,"
00:49:56,00:49:58,"right, which is like for the MacDonald's founder movie,"
00:49:58,00:49:59,like that type of thing.
00:49:59,00:50:02,"Imagine with that, it would be like a Disney channel"
00:50:02,00:50:05,original founder movie about like a guy in school.
00:50:05,00:50:06,- Yeah.
00:50:06,00:50:07,"- Oh, that's a cute idea."
00:50:07,00:50:08,- Wouldn't that be so cute?
00:50:08,00:50:10,- So you've come up with an idea for a cultural thing.
00:50:10,00:50:11,- Yes.
00:50:11,00:50:12,"- A movie pitch, don't worry, we do those too."
00:50:12,00:50:14,"- Okay, sorry, I take it back."
00:50:14,00:50:15,It wasn't a business idea.
00:50:15,00:50:17,It was a business idea for us to make money off this movie.
00:50:17,00:50:18,"- Yeah, it's a great, yeah."
00:50:18,00:50:19,That's really good.
00:50:19,00:50:20,- Like a kids founder movie.
00:50:20,00:50:22,- It's like capitals for kids.
00:50:22,00:50:23,- So what's it called?
00:50:23,00:50:25,Grubhub.
00:50:25,00:50:28,"- It's something about sandwich, something about fax."
00:50:28,00:50:29,- We can do this.
00:50:29,00:50:30,- We can definitely do this.
00:50:30,00:50:32,"Come on guys, number one."
00:50:32,00:50:34,This is why we're number one.
00:50:35,00:50:36,(laughing)
00:50:36,00:50:38,- Breadie steady go.
00:50:38,00:50:39,- Breadie steady go.
00:50:39,00:50:40,- No.
00:50:40,00:50:41,- For kids film.
00:50:41,00:50:43,"- It's like, yeah, it's gotta be like something about"
00:50:43,00:50:48,"recess, school, a detention, but with bread in it."
00:50:48,00:50:51,- Just put the word bread into the word detention.
00:50:51,00:50:52,Yeah.
00:50:52,00:50:53,(laughing)
00:50:53,00:50:54,- Depredution.
00:50:54,00:50:58,"- The new number one, I don't know if you've got it."
00:50:58,00:51:01,(laughing)
00:51:01,00:51:02,- It's good to have something to be asked about
00:51:02,00:51:03,in interviews on the press round.
00:51:03,00:51:04,So how do we say the name of this?
00:51:04,00:51:06,(laughing)
00:51:06,00:51:07,How's it pronounced?
00:51:07,00:51:08,- Depredution.
00:51:08,00:51:11,(laughing)
00:51:11,00:51:12,- Podd you see?
00:51:12,00:51:13,(laughing)
00:51:13,00:51:15,- It's gonna be huge in Japan.
00:51:15,00:51:17,(laughing)
00:51:17,00:51:21,"- Oh, yeah."
00:51:21,00:51:22,- Yeah.
00:51:22,00:51:23,- Okay.
00:51:23,00:51:24,- I'm so sorry.
00:51:24,00:51:26,- That might be the one that takes off.
00:51:26,00:51:27,(laughing)
00:51:27,00:51:30,"- Yeah, last week's Google for Smells did not go anywhere."
00:51:30,00:51:31,(laughing)
00:51:31,00:51:33,So we're up for different ideas.
00:51:33,00:51:35,- Can I tell you guys about Jane Snowball?
00:51:35,00:51:36,- Yeah.
00:51:36,00:51:37,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:51:37,00:51:39,"- Okay, she was a 72 year old British woman"
00:51:39,00:51:42,and she did the first ever online grocery order.
00:51:42,00:51:43,In what year?
00:51:43,00:51:45,- 1951.
00:51:45,00:51:46,(laughing)
00:51:46,00:51:47,- 1951.
00:51:47,00:51:48,(laughing)
00:51:48,00:51:49,- 1938.
00:51:49,00:51:50,(laughing)
00:51:50,00:51:52,- You've got a real chance to score the triple here.
00:51:52,00:51:53,(laughing)
00:51:53,00:51:54,"- Okay, I'm going in '96."
00:51:54,00:51:57,"- '96, it's 1984."
00:51:57,00:51:58,And this is insane.
00:51:58,00:52:00,"- Wow, but you said she was in her seventies?"
00:52:00,00:52:01,- Yes.
00:52:01,00:52:02,- Wow.
00:52:02,00:52:04,It was simply the end user of the product.
00:52:04,00:52:06,She had very little to do with the development.
00:52:06,00:52:07,(laughing)
00:52:07,00:52:07,- I'm sorry.
00:52:07,00:52:11,- But I still think in your seventies at that time.
00:52:11,00:52:12,- That's true.
00:52:12,00:52:14,- It's gonna be tough to use new technology.
00:52:14,00:52:15,- Absolutely.
00:52:15,00:52:17,"- No offense to anyone in the seventies,"
00:52:17,00:52:18,but like it's become more difficult
00:52:18,00:52:19,to get older.
00:52:19,00:52:20,- But she's 72.
00:52:20,00:52:21,This is 1984.
00:52:21,00:52:23,This is a long time ago.
00:52:23,00:52:24,- Well hang on.
00:52:24,00:52:24,- That's when I was born.
00:52:24,00:52:25,It's not that long.
00:52:25,00:52:26,- It is a lot.
00:52:26,00:52:27,- Imagine that.
00:52:27,00:52:28,- No one has the internet in their homes.
00:52:28,00:52:29,- Yeah.
00:52:29,00:52:30,- You know.
00:52:30,00:52:31,- Basically.
00:52:31,00:52:32,- It's my entire time we're speaking.
00:52:32,00:52:35,I'm trying to put the word sub into CEO.
00:52:35,00:52:38,(laughing)
00:52:38,00:52:39,- Is it fitting?
00:52:39,00:52:41,(laughing)
00:52:41,00:52:43,- Sorry.
00:52:43,00:52:45,- Keep working on it Olga.
00:52:45,00:52:45,"But it's, I'll tell you."
00:52:45,00:52:46,- If I look distracts.
00:52:46,00:52:47,- I'll tell these guys.
00:52:47,00:52:50,"But basically, she lived in Gateshead."
00:52:50,00:52:51,She had a bad hips.
00:52:51,00:52:52,She couldn't get to the shops.
00:52:52,00:52:54,And there was this thing being run by Gateshead Council
00:52:54,00:52:57,called the Gateshead Shopping Experiment.
00:52:57,00:52:59,"And this developer, Michael Aldrich,"
00:52:59,00:53:01,set up a thing where she could use
00:53:01,00:53:06,her TV to get access to every huge number of shops.
00:53:06,00:53:07,- And I could tell it actually.
00:53:07,00:53:08,- It's something.
00:53:08,00:53:09,- Kind of.
00:53:09,00:53:10,I'm slightly struggling with how exactly it worked.
00:53:10,00:53:12,'Cause I don't think she was pressing her screen.
00:53:12,00:53:14,She shouldn't have been anyway.
00:53:14,00:53:16,But it allowed her to go through every product
00:53:16,00:53:19,that the shops had and order via her telly.
00:53:19,00:53:21,It was unbelievably advanced at the time.
00:53:21,00:53:23,- Do we now have a name for the boy?
00:53:23,00:53:24,- For what?
00:53:24,00:53:25,- The boy in the film.
00:53:25,00:53:26,- Yeah.
00:53:26,00:53:27,- He was called Colin Wallace.
00:53:27,00:53:29,- Wallace.
00:53:29,00:53:29,- Greg's Wallace.
00:53:29,00:53:31,"- I don't know if it's like Walson Grame,"
00:53:31,00:53:32,but the grame has to be bread.
00:53:32,00:53:34,- Wallace and Grubhub.
00:53:34,00:53:35,- Grubhub.
00:53:35,00:53:37,- Wallace and Grady bread.
00:53:37,00:53:39,"- No, keep going."
00:53:39,00:53:40,- Grain Hill.
00:53:40,00:53:41,- Grain Hill.
00:53:41,00:53:42,- 'Cause it's Grange Hill.
00:53:42,00:53:43,- He's good.
00:53:43,00:53:44,- He's actually good.
00:53:44,00:53:45,- School-based thing.
00:53:45,00:53:46,- We can go on that.
00:53:46,00:53:47,"- No, no, no."
00:53:47,00:53:48,- So sorry.
00:53:48,00:53:50,- We'll get it eventually.
00:53:50,00:53:52,"We would usually move on, but it's such a good idea."
00:53:52,00:53:54,(laughing)
00:53:54,00:53:58,"- Podcast@QI.com, send in your titles for"
00:53:58,00:54:00,The Bread Based.
00:54:00,00:54:01,- Disney Channel Original Movie.
00:54:01,00:54:02,- What's it about?
00:54:02,00:54:03,"Oh, the Grubhub."
00:54:03,00:54:04,"- Yeah, CEO."
00:54:04,00:54:05,- Teen CEO of Grubhub.
00:54:05,00:54:06,"- Inventor, yes."
00:54:06,00:54:07,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:54:07,00:54:08,Yeah.
00:54:08,00:54:09,Should we wrap up soon?
00:54:09,00:54:10,- Yeah.
00:54:10,00:54:11,"- All right, here's a quiz."
00:54:11,00:54:14,What was the first thing sold securely on the internet?
00:54:14,00:54:15,It's also 1994.
00:54:15,00:54:16,- Yeah.
00:54:16,00:54:18,- It's about 10 days before the pizza idea was launched.
00:54:18,00:54:19,- The first thing ever sold on eBay
00:54:19,00:54:21,was a broken laser pointer.
00:54:21,00:54:21,- Very good.
00:54:21,00:54:22,- I know that.
00:54:22,00:54:23,"- But this was before that, right?"
00:54:23,00:54:26,"- Yeah, it's the first time anyone bought anything"
00:54:26,00:54:28,that was properly with secure data.
00:54:28,00:54:30,"So previously, people had used our penet"
00:54:30,00:54:33,"to buy and sell weed, things like that."
00:54:33,00:54:34,But that was just arranging a meeting place.
00:54:34,00:54:36,That's not properly an online transaction.
00:54:36,00:54:38,- Was it an OASIS album?
00:54:38,00:54:39,1994?
00:54:39,00:54:41,- It's an album.
00:54:41,00:54:41,- Oh.
00:54:41,00:54:42,- Okay.
00:54:42,00:54:44,"- It's not CLC's crazy sexy cool, is it?"
00:54:44,00:54:45,- No.
00:54:45,00:54:47,- Is it someone from the '90s?
00:54:47,00:54:48,- I'd say so.
00:54:48,00:54:49,He's still alive.
00:54:49,00:54:50,"- I know the answer to this,"
00:54:50,00:54:52,I'm bowing out of the course.
00:54:52,00:54:52,"- Oh, okay."
00:54:52,00:54:54,Brian Adams?
00:54:54,00:54:55,"- Oh, good guess."
00:54:55,00:54:55,- Good answer.
00:54:55,00:54:56,- Good guess.
00:54:56,00:54:58,- I'm just transporting it to '94.
00:54:58,00:54:59,- Not bad.
00:54:59,00:55:01,Who else is?
00:55:01,00:55:02,- Meatloaf.
00:55:02,00:55:04,- British?
00:55:04,00:55:07,There's no way of saying it without you immediately.
00:55:07,00:55:08,- Else a job.
00:55:08,00:55:10,- He likes having sex for a really long time.
00:55:10,00:55:11,- Rod's doing?
00:55:11,00:55:14,(laughing)
00:55:14,00:55:16,"- With his wife, Trudy Styler."
00:55:16,00:55:16,- Yeah.
00:55:16,00:55:17,- Is it stink?
00:55:17,00:55:18,- It's stink.
00:55:18,00:55:21,"It was Sting's album, 10 Summoner's Tales."
00:55:21,00:55:25,And it was a guy called Phil Brandon Berger.
00:55:25,00:55:27,Phil Adolfier.
00:55:27,00:55:30,"- This weirdly, this fact unites all of our facts today."
00:55:30,00:55:34,Because it was bought in 1994.
00:55:34,00:55:34,- Yeah.
00:55:34,00:55:35,- That's TLC.
00:55:35,00:55:39,"It was the first major hit he had since his previous hit,"
00:55:39,00:55:41,"which was called ""Rushens."""
00:55:41,00:55:42,- Uh-huh.
00:55:42,00:55:43,- Very nice.
00:55:43,00:55:45,"And the title of the album, what was it Andy?"
00:55:45,00:55:46,- 10 Summoner's Tales.
00:55:46,00:55:47,- It's a pun.
00:55:47,00:55:48,- Is it a pun?
00:55:48,00:55:49,- It's a pun.
00:55:49,00:55:50,"- His surname is Sumner, isn't it?"
00:55:50,00:55:53,"- His surname is Sumner, and it is a pun on the Canterbury Tales"
00:55:53,00:55:55,of which there was a character called Sumner.
00:55:55,00:55:57,"So it's got a pun, it's got Russia,"
00:55:57,00:55:59,"and it's got 1994, the release of TLC."
00:55:59,00:56:01,"- Damn, and the show now, that's amazing."
00:56:01,00:56:03,"- That's like, that's a bravier."
00:56:03,00:56:05,That's a now-you-see-me-three level.
00:56:05,00:56:06,- Yeah.
00:56:06,00:56:07,(laughing)
00:56:07,00:56:08,"- Oh, bravier."
00:56:08,00:56:08,- And that's a compliment.
00:56:08,00:56:10,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:56:10,00:56:12,(upbeat music)
