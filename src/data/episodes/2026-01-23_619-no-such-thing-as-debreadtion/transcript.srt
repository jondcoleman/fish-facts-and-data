00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,960
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,520
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,240
 where we were joined by the brilliant Olga Koch.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,240
 Now, if you remember the last time Anna was on maternity leave,

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,240
 Olga came on the show and she absolutely blew us away.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,320
 She was one of our favorite guests in that run,

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,840
 so we were so delighted to have her back.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,280
 I'm sure you're gonna really enjoy this episode.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,840
 And when you do, you're gonna want to find out more about Olga.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,120
 Now, the best way to do that is to go to her website,

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,960
 it is rock n' roger.com.

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,960
 I'm gonna spell it, ROCK N R O L G A dot com.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,360
 If you go to rock n' roger.com,

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,840
 then you will find details of her new tour,

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,840
 which is coming up, it's called Fat Tom Cruise,

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,760
 and it is playing all over the world.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,000
 Well, it's certainly playing in the UK and Australia,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,040
 that's for sure.

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,080
 So do go there and see if Olga is coming to a town near you

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,920
 and get your tickets.

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,600
 Don't forget that if you want to hear more from Olga,

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,120
 then you can go to our Patreon and get the Excel version

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,280
 There are three different tiers there.

26
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,080
 They have extra material, they have video content,

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,360

 By listening to the show and telling all your friends

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,800
 how much you enjoy it, that is helping as well.

33
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,720
 So, do enjoy this week's show with the incredible Olga Koch,

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,880
 on with the podcast.

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,460
 (upbeat music)

36
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:50,720
 Hello, and welcome to another episode

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,440
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish", a weekly podcast

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,920
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,960
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

40
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,240
 with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Olga Koch.

41
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

43
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,280
 and in a particular order, here we go,

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,480
 starting with fact number one, and that is Olga.

45
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,120
 - My fact is that TLC held the head of their recording label,

46
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,520
 Clive Davis Hostage, in order to renegotiate

47
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,720
 their recording contract.

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
 (laughing)

49
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,600
 - Brilliant idea, brilliant.

50
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
 - As they should.

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,400
 - As they should if, this is an amazing story, isn't it?

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,120
 - Have we, so before we go anywhere,

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
 have we decided how much you're being paid for this podcast?

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,480
 (laughing)

55
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,840
 - I have logged the doors pre-empted.

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,080
 So, apparently, basically, there are albums sold

57
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,040
 something over 10 million copies,

58
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,640
 and they made $75 million off of it,

59
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,880
 but each of them, the trio, got paid only 50K.

60
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,960
 - Yeah, so who are the trio?

61
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,360
 - Well, the trio at TLC, so you've got Lisa Left Eye Lopos.

62
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
 - She's the L. - She's the L.

63
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,800
 You've got Chilly, who is the--

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,040
 - From Bluey?

65
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,600
 - Yeah, so for all you two, turning into a talking dog,

66
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,960
 Chilly was there, and then there was T-Bos.

67
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,320
 I think she was called T-Bos.

68
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,040
 - Yes. - I believe so.

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,200
 - John Watkins.

70
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,240
 And I didn't know, I thought I didn't know who TLC were.

71
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,240
 And then I realized they did that song.

72
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,320
 - What's it called? - T-Bos?

73
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,160
 - No.

74
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,000
 - Creep?

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,600
 - Scrubs on those grubs.

76
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 - Oh my god, those grubs, yeah.

77
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,560
 - Those grubs, which I do like.

78
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,320
 But I'd, no, I don't think I know what's full.

79
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,680
 ♪ Don't go chasing waterfalls ♪

80
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,840
 ♪ They took to the rivers and the lakes they flew ♪

81
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
 - Welcome.

82
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,440
 Welcome to our friends at PRS again.

83
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,200
 (laughing)

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,720
 - Yes, that's a brilliant song.

85
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
 Oh, well, great.

86
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,560
 - Yeah.

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,400
 - Harmonized so well.

88
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,720
 It actually identified as the actual record.

89
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
 - That was quite something.

90
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,800
 I was ready for you to come in with a snare drum or something.

91
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,960
 - You was gonna do the rap.

92
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,120
 - We just didn't go long enough.

93
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,960
 So yeah, TLC.

94
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,480
 TLC, that generated $75 million.

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,800
 They got $50,000 each.

96
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,360
 They thought, "Uh-uh, no way."

97
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,600
 And so they went into Clive Davis' office

98
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,640
 and they brought lackeys with them.

99
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,720
 - They stationed them outside the room

100
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,960
 and said, "No one in, no one out."

101
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,840
 - And I gather that lackeys were from when Lisa

102
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,040
 had been in the big house.

103
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,080
 - Yes, and she made some friends.

104
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,280
 - Yes, and she had been on court-mandated rehab.

105
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,200
 And that was after she burnt down her boyfriend's house,

106
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,520
 I believe not on purpose.

107
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,560
 - Yeah, completely accidentally.

108
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,160
 - She had put a lot of his, not completely accidentally.

109
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,880
 - She could end up in prison.

110
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,320
 That doesn't suggest accidental, does it?

111
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,840
 - What had happened was, she had alleged

112
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,480
 various things against him like assault.

113
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,040
 And I think she'd found him cheating on her.

114
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,680
 So I would say quite a vexed relationship.

115
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,880
 She had put a load of his sneakers in the bath

116
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,040
 and set fire to them.

117
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,920
 Now unfortunately, the bath was a low quality model

118
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,600
 because she had also burned down his previous bath.

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,200
 So he'd, the previous time he'd annoyed her.

120
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,880
 - You don't know any TLC songs, and yet here you are.

121
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,720
 (laughing)

122
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,520
 - This is what the research papers were.

123
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,120
 But basically, they'd had a marble bath

124
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,080
 and she'd put a lot of stuff in there and set fire to it,

125
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,040
 which had damaged the bath.

126
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,800
 So her boyfriend had replaced the bath

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,440
 with a cheap fiberglass model, which was a bit more flammable.

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,760
 So the next time she pulled the,

129
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,600
 I'm gonna put some of your stuff in the bath and burn it,

130
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,640
 routine, it burnt down the whole house.

131
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,880
 - It melted the bath in the fire spread.

132
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,320
 So she didn't mean to do it.

133
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,880
 The first time it was all the teddy bears

134
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,120
 that he had given her as presents.

135
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,000
 So she did some time and then when she was led out,

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,720
 TLC formed, they released two albums,

137
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,160
 Crazy Sexy Cool, which is the album we're talking about,

138
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,200
 which has Waterfalls and so on, second album,

139
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,200
 went ballistically huge and so yeah,

140
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,360
 they went and held him hostage

141
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,600
 and they maintained a good relationship afterwards.

142
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,760
 I mean, you know, these women brought guns.

143
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,800
 It wasn't like just a nice little hostage taking.

144
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,480
 You know a nice hostage situation.

145
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,800
 When I read this fact,

146
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,120
 I thought, oh, that's probably just a publicity stunt

147
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,480
 and they probably didn't really do it.

148
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,320
 - Yeah.

149
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,160
 - Well, that's not the case.

150
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,360
 - No, they've spoken about it quite a few times

151
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
 in interviews and they try and play down the gun element to it.

152
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,080
 They say, it's like, I never took the gun out.

153
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,400
 (laughing)

154
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,520
 - But there was a gun there, lovely.

155
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,080
 - I'll also say it's like '94, around '94, right?

156
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,920
 - '94.

157
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,440
 - Obviously there's been endless boy band documentaries

158
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,000
 made about this, but record labels were really

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,320
 predatory at the time, right?

160
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,760
 'Cause they would essentially give you all this money

161
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,720
 in advance and then you'd have to pay it back.

162
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,760
 So, I think sometimes violence is,

163
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,920
 well, I don't know where I'm going.

164
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,280
 (laughing)

165
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,120
 - And I was looking at some other historical musical contracts.

166
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
 - Oh.

167
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,960
 - Actually, my research for this came from

168
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,760
 the latest series of "I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here,"

169
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,600
 - Okay.

170
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,080
 - Which I watched for the first time in about 20 years.

171
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,600
 And Jack Osborne was on it.

172
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,840
 And he talked about his grandfather called Don Arden.

173
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,880
 And Don Arden apparently got the small faces

174
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,800
 to work for him 'cause he was an agent

175
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,440
 by dangling them upside down out of an upper floor balcony

176
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,120
 by the ankles until they signed.

177
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,960
 - What?

178
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,400
 - And Jack Osborne said this on "I'm a Celebrity."

179
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,240
 And I checked in.

180
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,880
 I think it is mostly true.

181
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,200
 Don Arden in his biography said that he didn't do it.

182
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,040
 It was a group of thugs that he'd hired.

183
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,440
 - Oh, well, that's a different story.

184
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,560
 (laughing)

185
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,840
 - Who overstepped the mark, he said.

186
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,400
 - That would be Sharon Osborne's.

187
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
 - Sharon Osborne's father.

188
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,840
 - Don Arden, born in Manchester.

189
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,160
 And he had a little phone box in Manchester

190
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,560
 where he used to work in.

191
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,360
 And he was such a gangster that no one would go in

192
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,560
 to make a phone call because they knew that

193
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,440
 if they went anywhere near his phone box,

194
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,120
 they'd get the shit beat out of them.

195
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
 - Wow.

196
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,680
 - Yeah, he's like a real gangster,

197
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,280
 like probably the most gangstery

198
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,040
 of all the record boxed buses.

199
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,880
 - Gosh.

200
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,840
 - He also invented the coworking space.

201
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,680
 - Yeah.

202
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,520
 - Yeah.

203
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,080
 - We had people like park up on a Starbucks

204
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,240
 for hours on end.

205
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
 - Yeah.

206
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,120
 - Was he working full time in the phone box?

207
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,280
 - Well, that's what I'm asking.

208
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,000
 - That was his office.

209
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,200
 He would send people that phone number

210
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,880
 and they want a speech when they'd have to ring

211
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,200
 his phone box.

212
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,040
 - Okay, that's incredible.

213
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,880
 - Wow, that's incredible.

214
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,720
 - That is incredible.

215
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,560
 - Flex.

216
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
 - Yeah, that is.

217
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,160
 - Oh, got you a fan of Ray.

218
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
 - What do you mean by that?

219
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,000
 - She's a singer.

220
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,160
 - Oh, yeah, Ray with an E.

221
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,080
 I couldn't hear the E when you were a singer.

222
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,400
 - Where the hell is my husband?

223
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,600
 - Where the hell is my husband?

224
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,440
 - What a song.

225
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,600
 - She kept me going, I asked.

226
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,680
 When's your album coming out?

227
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,520
 When's your album coming out?

228
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,040
 And she'd say, oh, you know, and then in 2021,

229
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,920
 she got asked the question and she sort of snapped

230
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,240
 and she posted online.

231
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,160
 I've been on a four album deal for the last seven years.

232
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,560
 But the record label keep on not allowing me

233
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,880
 to release an album.

234
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,320
 They say, oh, you're not ready and I'll not yet,

235
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,920
 you know, sometimes the person signs you up for a deal

236
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,320
 and then they leave the company.

237
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,400
 So there's no one inside saying, right, where's the Ray album?

238
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,120
 So yeah, all the label doesn't want to find

239
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,960
 that to campaign.

240
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,800
 - Wow.

241
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,960
 - I think she did eventually get out of it, right?

242
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,680
 And then she self-released 21st century blues.

243
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,960
 - Yeah, so it's still sort of going on

244
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,760
 that you sign up and then you don't get.

245
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
 - Yeah.

246
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
 - The other big one is New Jeans, isn't it,

247
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,920
 who's like the massive K-pop band.

248
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,320
 And it even went into like South Korean parliament

249
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,920
 was talking about whether they should be allowed

250
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
 to get out of the contract.

251
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,400
 I think it still hasn't been started yet.

252
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,440
 - When in K-pop, it's even harder because obviously

253
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,600
 they start like 13 and it's like basically a boarding school.

254
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,040
 So how long are you technically paying them back

255
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,000
 for the services that the label provided for you?

256
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,280
 - And I don't know if it's in K-pop

257
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,080
 'cause they don't listen to that much, but in J-pop,

258
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,920
 like the bands will, they'll have the members

259
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
 and then the members will leave

260
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,400
 and then new members will come up.

261
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,520
 So it'll be the same band,

262
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,560
 but then maybe it'll just be completely different people.

263
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,880
 And it's like all the shipathesis.

264
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,720
 - Yeah.

265
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,240
 - The trigger's broom, pick your metaphor.

266
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,040
 But is that, so I was thinking about there's that band,

267
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,280
 is it AKB 48?

268
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,120
 - Yeah, yeah.

269
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,960
 - Are they Japanese?

270
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
 - From Akia Bura.

271
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,120
 - And they're like 48.

272
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,480
 - They're about 48 of them give all take.

273
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,320
 - Exactly.

274
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
 - I was thinking that they were famous years ago.

275
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,200
 And it's like teeth, isn't it?

276
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,360
 - It's like shark teeth.

277
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,800
 - You lose, well you lose a tooth.

278
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,760
 - Yeah, but when you get to human teeth,

279
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,080
 you only have two sets of teeth.

280
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,400
 - What?

281
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,160
 - Oh, I've been so kind of late.

282
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,200
 I've been waiting for these new ones

283
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,440
 to come through for ages.

284
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,720
 - I guess it's like S Club Juniors,

285
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,200
 but if it was all one band.

286
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,040
 - Yeah.

287
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,360
 - It's like if S Club Juniors came through

288
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,520
 and became S Club again,

289
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,560
 and then S Club babies came along

290
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,120
 and became S Club Juniors a mess.

291
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,280
 - So good.

292
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,440
 - I would like to say that what just happened is

293
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,720
 you said Ray and I did like a cool young reference.

294
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,160
 I mean, I can go even younger.

295
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
 Do you know K-pop?

296
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,440
 (laughing)

297
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,240
 Anyone want to be more angry at you?

298
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,520
 - I would just say that the surprise biggest girl group

299
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,080
 of 2025 has to be Huntrix.

300
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,400
 - Well, are they from Demon Hunters?

301
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,240
 - They, sorry.

302
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,080
 - Oh yeah.

303
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,920
 - Oh yeah.

304
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,120
 - They got nominated for like every Grammy.

305
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,960
 It was crazy.

306
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
 - Yeah, well, and they're probably gonna get

307
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,800
 an Oscar nomination.

308
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,360
 And they, they're now a traveling band, basically,

309
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,680
 because it's been so successful.

310
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,200
 They had a number one still word, sorry.

311
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,040
 Old person here.

312
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,200
 What?

313
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,000
 - An animation was released earlier this year

314
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,960
 on Netflix called K-pop Demon Hunters,

315
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,200
 which has just absolutely dominated children's parties

316
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,280
 and Netflix streams, like nothing else.

317
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,160
 - And it has a specific song in it called "Golden"

318
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,640
 that I would say that the success of "Golden"

319
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,680
 is only comparable to, you remember when Frozen came out

320
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,280
 and it was let it go and at first it was just kids

321
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,360
 and then it was everybody all the time.

322
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,440
 That's what happened to "Golden."

323
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,600
 - Interesting.

324
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,760
 Have you guys heard of Duran, Duran?

325
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,400
 Can we just hold the conversation back around Duran?

326
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,440
 - Duran, Duran, of course.

327
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,280
 - Yes.

328
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,120
 - Of course.

329
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,960
 - I heard you the first time.

330
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,720
 - I was looking at problems between bands

331
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,720
 and their fans as well, like breaches of contract

332
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,480
 as well as breaches of contract.

333
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,960
 In 2014, they were reported to be suing their own fan club.

334
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,800
 - No.

335
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,880
 - With a love.

336
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,000
 - And they, it's great.

337
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,360
 They signed an agreement with this fan club company

338
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,560
 called "World Wide Fan Clubs."

339
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,000
 Which, Duran, Duran will get 75% of the profits

340
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,240
 from the fan club, but these guys will run it

341
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,080
 and they're alleged that it hadn't been run properly

342
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,960
 and they hadn't been collecting membership pieces.

343
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,040
 It became an incredibly boring and technical story,

344
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
 but I like the idea of suing your own fans.

345
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,720
 - I wonder why as a person who does our inbox.

346
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,320
 (laughing)

347
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,920
 - I was looking at some of the oldest sort of contracts

348
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,720
 from music and the first person I think to get a royalty

349
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,880
 was a guy called Albert Chevalier.

350
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,840
 Have you heard of him?

351
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,680
 - No.

352
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,520
 - No.

353
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,960
 - Oh, I love his, I love his second album.

354
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,800
 - Yeah.

355
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,640
 (laughing)

356
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,840
 - He got one shilling, which is five pence

357
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,480
 for every dozen records sold.

358
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,320
 This was in 1891.

359
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,800
 And he's also famous for inventing or popularizing

360
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,560
 the phrase "watcher."

361
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,400
 - Really?

362
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,320
 - Which means like, hello.

363
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,160
 - Yeah.

364
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,640
 - Was that in his songs?

365
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,680
 - It already existed, but it wasn't that popular,

366
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,120
 but he had a song called "watcher" knocked him out

367
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,680
 the old Kent Road.

368
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
 - Right.

369
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,400
 - Oh, that's where that really took off.

370
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,040
 - Well, speaking of "watcher,"

371
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,640
 did you know the word "hello" was popular

372
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,040
 as by the song "hello" my baby, "hello" my baby?

373
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,880
 - No, really?

374
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,360
 - Before they wanted to use a "hoi" to pick up a phone,

375
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,880
 and "hello" was people mocking people picking up the phone.

376
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

377
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,000
 - I really hope this is true.

378
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,400
 - Wait, so we need to research this.

379
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,160
 - So did that song come before the phone?

380
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,000
 - No.

381
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,400
 - Okay, so the phone happened.

382
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,840
 - A "hoi" was being used.

383
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,680
 - Yes.

384
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,440
 - Someone sent a grand bell once he'd say, "a "hoi" "hoi"

385
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,280
 - Yeah.

386
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
 - That's right.

387
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,160
 - And then "hello" was like slaying at the time,

388
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,480
 and "hello" my baby, "hello" my darling.

389
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,320
 - Wow.

390
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,960
 - With them making fun of people using "hello" on the phone.

391
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,800
 - Wow.

392
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,640
 Isn't it a while?

393
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,840
 - When you think of time travelers who would come

394
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,240
 to our present day, the things you wouldn't expect

395
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,440
 would blow their mind.

396
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,880
 - You're using "hello" as the greeting.

397
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,720
 - Yeah.

398
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,560
 (laughing)

399
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,200
 - That was like fifth version of how you would do that.

400
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,960
 - It was like minor slang.

401
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,800
 That's wild.

402
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,480
 You know within the world of TLC,

403
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,520
 they basically fell out at one point.

404
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,160
 Lisa left "I Lopez" got a big beef with the other two,

405
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,680
 and they started sort of cussing each other

406
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,840
 within articles.

407
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,640
 So Lisa in "Five Magazine" called them out,

408
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,560
 saying that everything's going terrible,

409
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,320
 then in "Entertainment Weekly," T. Bos and Chile,

410
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,040
 said, "Well, she's manipulative, she's evil,

411
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,560
 "she's a bad person."

412
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,400
 So then Lisa left "I Lopez" replies

413
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,440
 in "Entertainment Weekly," saying, "Okay,

414
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,640
 "we've got three albums left on our contract

415
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,760
 "with this company.

416
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,640
 "Let's release an album that is three CDs long,

417
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,360
 "but each of them are solo albums,

418
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,880
 "and we'll let the fans decide who they think

419
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,240
 "the best solo album is."

420
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,640
 But hang on, is this a randomized controlled trial?

421
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
 Is it a blind listen?

422
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,200
 'Cause you have to, if you're gonna get it--

423
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,920
 - You can recognize them from the voice, sure.

424
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,040
 - Yeah, well, that's what you'd have to do.

425
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,440
 You'd have to get someone else to sing them all, right?

426
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,280
 - To sing them all, right?

427
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,360
 - We could do this scientifically, or are we not?

428
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,600
 - Yeah, we just--

429
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,200
 - When the IRA are on TV,

430
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,360
 and they have to get someone to do the voice over.

431
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,240
 - They all have to be done by Jerry Adams.

432
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,080
 - That's it.

433
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,120
 - And that was the plan, so...

434
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,920
 Jerry Adams then wrote to Entertainment Weekly

435
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,360
 and said, "Well, I'm Keen, what about you guys?"

436
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,960
 So it was meant to be called The Challenge,

437
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,440
 and that was the idea, three CDs,

438
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,160
 which would then finish their contract,

439
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,320
 'cause that's how many albums to go.

440
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,400
 - I like the idea, but it's pretty bold move, isn't it?

441
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
 Someones gonna come last in that competition.

442
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,240
 - Yeah. - Oh, yeah.

443
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,840
 - Please never do this on fish.

444
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,600
 - No, we never do that, 'cause Anna is just gonna get it.

445
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,320
 I'm far the most wizards.

446
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,800
 - Yeah, we'll be get squashed by her.

447
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,400
 Just while we're on things, the home office

448
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,160
 might have been interested in Jerry Adams.

449
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,880
 (laughing)

450
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,120
 The home office used to have its own boy band.

451
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,960
 - Did it?

452
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,800
 - What?

453
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,080
 - Yeah, they were called Mr. Mina,

454
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,960
 and it was three, sort of, I think, teenage lads,

455
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,160
 and they would go around schools up north

456
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,560
 as part of a government initiative

457
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,680
 to deter Islamist extremism.

458
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,480
 So they have various songs about things like 9/11,

459
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,480
 or the sort of, the temptations of going down

460
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,240
 an extremist route.

461
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,800
 It's unclear whether they knew they were being funded,

462
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,680
 'cause there's quite a secretive home office program,

463
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,920
 which does a bit of cultural outreach,

464
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,560
 and I'm not clear whether or not they knew you.

465
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
 - It was a lot of that wasn't the back of the day.

466
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,240
 Like, there was talking about it.

467
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,440
 (laughing)

468
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,000
 - Well, during the Cold War,

469
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,920
 there was lots of people who became really big,

470
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,280
 and were sort of traveling around the Eastern Europe,

471
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,720
 and they thought it was all because how great they were.

472
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,160
 But actually, the US government

473
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,440
 was just paying for everything.

474
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,280
 - Exactly, see?

475
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,440
 - Scorpion's wind of change vibes?

476
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,720
 - I don't know what that means, but yeah.

477
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
 - Oh, okay, never mind.

478
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,760
 I'll take that back.

479
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,480
 There's a co-rumor that winds of change

480
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,800
 it broke the Soviet Union, the song.

481
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,960
 - Oh, I bet it is that song.

482
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,800
 - The song, right.

483
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
 - Well, there was a lot of CIA stuff going around.

484
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,920
 - I often wonder, 'cause at the time of recording,

485
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,800
 we're number one in Apple's comedy podcast charts.

486
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
 And I always think that's so mental

487
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,680
 that probably the government are doing this,

488
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,760
 and probably they're kind of training us

489
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,360
 to take over some country out of the Syops.

490
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,440
 - Wait, you're telling me

491
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,000
 that a bunch of teenage boys, singing about 9/11,

492
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,680
 didn't realize that they were

493
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,080
 (laughing)

494
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,000
 - We said, "Nonsense."

495
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,840
 (laughing)

496
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,480
 - That's what came out to you about instead of,

497
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,000
 "Wait, are you telling me this piece of shit

498
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,400
 "is the number one in the comedy podcast?"

499
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,520
 - No, no doubt about that.

500
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,800
 - I mean, we know that a lot of our lessons on fish

501
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,160
 do come from voxels, specifically,

502
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,440
 just next to voxels stations.

503
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,600
 - Right, yeah, that's true.

504
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,320
 - Like, hundreds of thousands every week,

505
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,480
 just from there, yeah.

506
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,120
 - I thought you were talking about the gay sawdust.

507
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,200
 (laughing)

508
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,600
 - Yes, but the gay sawdust at my five funded.

509
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,840
 Sorry, just to be completely clear.

510
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,420
 (upbeat music)

511
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,280
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

512
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,680
 and that is my fact.

513
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,400
 My fact this week is that the height

514
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,840
 of the world's third tallest structure was picked

515
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,920
 because it worked as a pun.

516
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,760
 - Love it.

517
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,600
 - Nothing.

518
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,760
 - So this is better, so better be good.

519
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,240
 This is the number one comedy podcast town.

520
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,360
 Don't send a spiraling back down those charts.

521
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,560
 (laughing)

522
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,880
 - So this is the Tokyo Sky Tree,

523
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,880
 which is 634 meters.

524
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,240
 It's the tallest free standing tower in the world.

525
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,080
 - Where is it?

526
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,920
 - It's in Tokyo.

527
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,680
 (laughing)

528
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,880
 - And yeah, it's height was picked very specifically

529
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,040
 because the area that they were building this on

530
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,680
 was part of an old region that was known as Musashi

531
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,440
 and Musashi and she broken down are Musashi,

532
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,040
 Sa, three and she, four.

533
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,080
 So Musashi is the exact height that they decided on.

534
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,920
 - Brilliant.

535
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,800
 - And interestingly, there are different ways

536
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,600
 that you can count in Japan,

537
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,320
 as in the way that you say the words,

538
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,680
 'cause there are old Japanese in those a few dollars.

539
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,520
 So, Mou is part of an old version.

540
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,400
 - Yes, it's Jini-san, she go Roku.

541
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,440
 - Exactly, so it's not Roku, but Mou works as well.

542
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,360
 Just for anyone wondering why that's the case.

543
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,880
 - Yeah, so they deliberately did that as a pun.

544
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,240
 - Very clever. - And it's lovely.

545
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,640
 - It's very cool.

546
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,120
 - Does that happen much in the world?

547
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,960
 (laughing)

548
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,760
 - I've been imagining it as you know what I thought of

549
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,480
 when you sent this, was it the crystal palace,

550
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,480
 which was 1,851 meters in all yards in length or feet

551
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,880
 in length because it was opened in 1851.

552
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,000
 - That's brilliant, I didn't know that.

553
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,840
 - That's cute stuff.

554
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,400
 - It doesn't help when you don't remember the unit.

555
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
 (laughing)

556
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,720
 - Gotta be feet. - Yes, yes, yes.

557
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,440
 - It's about 600 meters, like a mile punch.

558
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,720
 - Yeah, yeah.

559
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,680
 This kind of gets to happen a lot in Japan.

560
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,800
 So, this is part of a tradition of Japanese puns

561
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,360
 called Guru Wase.

562
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,240
 So, it can be associated with people, ideas.

563
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,160
 It can even be associated with Pai.

564
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,040
 - That's in the number?

565
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,040
 - Yeah, so if you say 3.14159265 in Japanese,

566
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,000
 those all are numbers that make words.

567
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,640
 And that comes out as a sentence that means an obstetrician

568
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,000
 faces towards a foreign country.

569
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,160
 - Wow.

570
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,800
 - They just like finding all these little patterns

571
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,000
 within that world.

572
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 If you do 18782 plus 18782 equals 3756.

573
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,960
 So, there's a calculation.

574
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,720
 That comes out as bad person plus bad person equals massacre.

575
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,560
 When you translate it into Japanese words.

576
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,720
 - It's three, three, six, yeah.

577
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,080
 - We have wide at six, eight, seven, because seven, eight, nine.

578
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,920
 - So, you know, we've got our own version of that in our culture.

579
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,760
 - Yeah, yeah.

580
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,960
 - It's a classic.

581
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
 That's the first joke my daughter led.

582
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,360
 - Yeah, yeah, wow, that's bizarre.

583
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,800
 - Yeah, it's very cool.

584
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
 - It is very cool.

585
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,360
 I'll just mention two others just in case.

586
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,840
 There's a famed admiral, Yamamoto,

587
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,360
 whose given name comes from the older pronunciation

588
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,920
 for the word 56, which was his dad's age when he was born.

589
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,240
 So, Yamamoto 56, yeah.

590
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,760
 And then there's a baseball player, quite famous in America,

591
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,720
 called Icho Suzuki, and his jersey number was 51,

592
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,480
 which in Japanese is Go Ichi, which is his first name.

593
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,320
 - Oh, fine.

594
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,600
 - Yeah, so it was Go Ichi.

595
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
 - That's really fun.

596
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,720
 - This is all really good stuff.

597
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,520
 I wish I could refining, you know,

598
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,360
 normally we kind of just bad sort of these,

599
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,800
 but I just like hearing them.

600
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,280
 - Yeah, yeah, it's really cool.

601
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,920
 - Yeah, Ichi was an amazing baseball player.

602
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,720
 So, he was an outfielder and whenever he called a ball,

603
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,320
 it was seen as like really well done.

604
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,360
 So, that area was known as Area 51.

605
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
 - Oh, that's, wow.

606
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,800
 - So good.

607
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,640
 Oh, God, I love that.

608
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,280
 - Yeah, so that's a thing that happens in Japan, quite a lot.

609
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,360
 - Love it, yeah.

610
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,840
 - The only thing that the entire time was like,

611
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,320
 and sometimes when I tear a misu, I say, I tear a misu.

612
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,520
 That's the one pond, the only pond

613
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,760
 that was just circulating around my mouth.

614
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
 - You say it to the food?

615
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,880
 - I say it to the food, because it sounds like misu.

616
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,240
 - Tokyo, have you been?

617
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,920
 - I did go to Tokyo a couple of years ago.

618
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,000
 I wrote a whole show about it.

619
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,120
 Basically, I met a guy at a wedding.

620
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,480
 We spent an unforgettable night,

621
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,520
 and then he lived in New Zealand and I lived in the UK.

622
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,560
 So, we decided to meet three months later in Japan.

623
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,400
 - Lovely.

624
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,360
 - And it was a disaster.

625
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,200
 - Oh.

626
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,760
 - Yeah, we absolutely hated each other's guts.

627
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,600
 - Really?

628
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,440
 - Yeah.

629
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,960
 - But what a beautiful city to hate each other's guts at.

630
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,640
 - Did you find that out early on in the trip?

631
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,800
 - 45 seconds at night.

632
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
 - Yeah.

633
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,960
 - And then you say goodbye or did you hang out the trip?

634
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,520
 - Oh, baby, we planned too much to say goodbye.

635
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,640
 Non-refundable train tickets, restaurant reservations,

636
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,760
 guided tours.

637
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,720
 - Did you go out this guy tree?

638
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,840
 - Well, we went up a building of some sort.

639
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,200
 - Do you think if he'd have told you all of Don's puns

640
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,440
 and things might have gone better?

641
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,280
 - 100%.

642
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,800
 - Maybe I would have tire missed him.

643
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,240
 (laughing)

644
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,080
 - That's beautiful.

645
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,920
 - Yeah, the entire time.

646
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,720
 I was like, I wish I had those in my pocket

647
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,040
 to fill the silence in.

648
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,880
 (laughing)

649
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,440
 - Not.

650
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,200
 - Wow, that's extraordinary.

651
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,040
 - Yeah.

652
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,640
 - It's one of those things where everybody sort of always

653
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,160
 wonders what would happen if they did such an impulsive thing.

654
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,680
 And I'm here to tell you,

655
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,880
 this is why you don't do that.

656
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,360
 - Do you remember who was it?

657
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,080
 - Was it I way, way, who did that thing where

658
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,640
 they got two people to walk along the whole of the--

659
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,640
 - I think it was Maria.

660
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,480
 - Maria.

661
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,640
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

662
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,440
 So she walked all the way along the Great Wall of China

663
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,880
 and then met someone halfway and then kissed and then--

664
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,720
 - They broke up?

665
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,920
 - It was her, yeah, it was her both artistic partner

666
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,720
 and her partner in life.

667
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,600
 And they both started on either end of the Great Wall,

668
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,160
 met in the middle and broke up when they met in the middle.

669
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,760
 - Did they always plan to break up?

670
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,480
 Or did they just remember they hated each other

671
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,320
 when they got there?

672
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,600
 - I think, yeah, 45 seconds until we're done.

673
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,760
 It's only remembered.

674
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,600
 - What I mostly remember about Tokyo is how busy it is.

675
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,760
 Like, because we live in a city, London, right?

676
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,120
 And you think, oh, it's really busy.

677
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,760
 And then you go to Tokyo and it's just like

678
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,880
 a million times busier.

679
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,080
 Of the 51 busiest train stations in the world,

680
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,280
 all but six of them are in Japan.

681
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,440
 And the top three are in Tokyo.

682
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,280
 - Wish.

683
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,120
 - 51!

684
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,280
 (all laughing)

685
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,120
 - Go wish you.

686
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,960
 - Go wish you.

687
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,360
 (all laughing)

688
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,520
 The most busy.

689
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,760
 - Sorry, but who else?

690
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,560
 Who makes the top 51?

691
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,760
 (all laughing)

692
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,600
 - So shy.

693
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
 (all laughing)

694
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,960
 - I don't see the chart that does the chart 51.

695
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,000
 - It does feel like once you get to 52,

696
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,440
 then they're all in a different country.

697
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

698
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,520
 - But the busiest railway station is Shinjuku.

699
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,000
 And they had, in 2022, the average number of daily passengers

700
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 was 2,704,703, which is the equivalent of every adult

701
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,920
 in Uruguay passing through the station every day.

702
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,760
 - Oh.

703
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,040
 - That's just one station.

704
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,480
 - Thank you for putting into terms and numbers

705
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
 I had to understand.

706
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,320
 (all laughing)

707
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,480
 - I can't picture that many people.

708
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
 Can you keep it?

709
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,800
 - We all know the entire adult population.

710
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
 The population, the adult population.

711
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,640
 - Yeah.

712
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,480
 - The kids of Uruguay.

713
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,840
 I'm gonna have a field day where the grownups are away.

714
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,520
 - You'll thank us in five months' time

715
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,520
 when you're in Uruguay meeting some Australian

716
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,160
 from the other side of the world.

717
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,000
 (all laughing)

718
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,200
 - The chat runs dry.

719
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,720
 - Wow, I had no idea.

720
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,080
 Uruguay was so small.

721
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,920
 - Yeah, it is small.

722
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,840
 - That's a small population.

723
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,840
 - It's much smaller than you think,

724
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,480
 but it's just that tiny little bit in South America, isn't it?

725
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,600
 It's not a very big country.

726
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

727
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,360
 Do we have any listeners in Uruguay?

728
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,680
 - Podcast@QI.com.

729
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,520
 - Ooh, nice.

730
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,360
 - Lovely stuff. - Throw this.

731
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,440
 - Send us some freight bantos.

732
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,280
 - Yeah.

733
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,160
 - This Tokyo Sky Tower is a radio and television tower.

734
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,800
 Now, we spoke about one very recently, the BT Tower.

735
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,840
 So it's a hot topic on the fish world right now.

736
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,120
 - This one is amazing.

737
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
 I've been reading a bit about it.

738
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,200
 - Oh, yeah, give us some.

739
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,680
 - So guess what they did for the 10th anniversary

740
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,840
 to celebrate it?

741
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,240
 - Was it a pun?

742
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,040
 - It was, no, it wasn't.

743
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,000
 It was, okay, what's the famous Japanese cultural thing?

744
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,240
 - Godzilla.

745
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,760
 - More artist, even more artistic.

746
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,600
 - Anime?

747
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,880
 - Even more artistic.

748
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,720
 (all laughing)

749
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,640
 - AKB48.

750
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,800
 - Kabuki theatre.

751
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,160
 - Oh yeah. - Okay.

752
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,000
 - Oh yeah.

753
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,040
 - You know, this is the ancient centuries-old form of theatre.

754
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,200
 And they have really famous actors,

755
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,760
 and it's quite dynastic as well, isn't it?

756
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,320
 So sometimes you'll do it because you're, you know,

757
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,520
 great, great grandfather, et cetera, didn't it?

758
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,680
 So for the 10th anniversary of the Sky Tree Tower,

759
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,880
 they got a Kabuki actor called Inchikawa Ibizo the 11th

760
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,920
 to perform his famous glare from the top of the building.

761
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,960
 (all laughing)

762
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,520
 - That's incredible.

763
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,800
 - It's so good.

764
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,840
 - There's a famous glare called the Nirami,

765
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,080
 and it's done by moving each eye in different directions.

766
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,920
 - Oh, that's cool.

767
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,320
 - Which is good.

768
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,840
 And also that means that Inchikawa Ibizo the 11th

769
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,080
 could qualify as a fighter pilot,

770
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,240
 'cause I believe you have to do that to be a fighter pilot.

771
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,200
 - So you're also looking to different directions at once.

772
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,600
 - I think you have to have one eye on the mig who's up ahead,

773
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,800
 and you have to have one eye on your instruments.

774
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,120
 So I think you need to be able to,

775
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,440
 I think Prince Harry can do it.

776
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
 - Wait, is this a thing that you can make yourself do?

777
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,040
 - No, you can train for that.

778
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,640
 - So your brain can take in two different...

779
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,480
 - Yeah.

780
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,240
 - And Harry's really good at doing those magic eye pictures.

781
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,080
 - Yeah.

782
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,920
 - Definitely.

783
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
 - Definitely.

784
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,080
 - It's incredible.

785
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,600
 - All day outside of Thina, like I used to do.

786
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,200
 Trying to see if he can get a book of those

787
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
 and just go through them.

788
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,040
 That's a tiger.

789
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,880
 That's a butterfly.

790
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,720
 That's a waterfall.

791
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
 He can just do it.

792
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,760
 - Wow.

793
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,600
 - Okay.

794
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,440
 - Anyway, there you go.

795
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,920
 - Olga, when you went to Tokyo,

796
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,480
 did you go to the Gotakuji Temple,

797
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,080
 which has got all those sort of cats

798
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,600
 that wave their arms?

799
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,880
 Do you know those ones that you see in Chinese restaurants?

800
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

801
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,840
 - Well, there's a temple just outside,

802
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,080
 it's just outside Tokyo, actually, where they have these.

803
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,120
 And the idea is that there was a guy,

804
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,720
 some priest or other was walking past

805
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,480
 and a cat let him come into the temple

806
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,680
 and then that became the sort of lucky cat.

807
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,000
 And if you go there, there's thousands of them outside

808
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,440
 and you can, you know, pay 100 yen and get your own one

809
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,360
 and then write a message on it and stuff like that.

810
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,200
 - That's really cool.

811
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
 - So is the cat waving you in as opposed to waving hello to you?

812
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,480
 - Yeah, it is.

813
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,320
 - Right.

814
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,680
 - And also, actually, probably they evolved

815
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,720
 from waving penises, we think.

816
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,360
 So probably this story is like a new story

817
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,560
 and where they actually came is that they were used

818
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,000
 in brothels and they would have these lucky talismans

819
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,600
 in the shape of penises that weren't beckoning people

820
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,080
 into the brothels.

821
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,040
 There were things that evolved into the cats.

822
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,120
 - I don't want to, I don't want to assume anything,

823
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,440
 but wouldn't the average person not be going

824
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,960
 to a brothel for a penis?

825
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,680
 - No, but I suppose you just need to some kind of symbol

826
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,520
 and it's hard to make a vagina wave.

827
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,800
 (laughing)

828
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,640
 - You tried.

829
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,400
 (laughing)

830
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,720
 - Good Lord.

831
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,040
 - I could tell as I started, that said,

832
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,920
 since I was not going to ed them all.

833
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,480
 (laughing)

834
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,560
 - Wow.

835
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
 - Yeah, gosh.

836
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,760
 But answer a question I did go and there's a tiny little cat

837
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,800
 at that temple that just says, "Please help."

838
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,000
 (laughing)

839
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,320
 - I have found, certainly for anyone who's not living in Tokyo,

840
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,560
 possibly the most famous musician that they have.

841
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,560
 Certainly, their songs is known more than most songs out there,

842
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,400
 right?

843
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,120
 - So what you're saying is they're really famous in Tokyo,

844
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,480
 but anyone else wouldn't have heard that.

845
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,840
 - Yeah, and possibly in Tokyo,

846
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,400
 they might not even know the name of the person,

847
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,440
 but they will know the songs and be able to sing.

848
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,280
 - Okay.

849
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,400
 - The songs are there as impossibly any other composer.

850
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,320
 - Are you gonna forget something?

851
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,720
 - I think it's Mr. Meena, the home office funded.

852
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,560
 (laughing)

853
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,600
 - And given his boy band, they're huge in Tokyo.

854
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,960
 - It's got to be the music in the underground, is that?

855
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,600
 'Cause whenever you go on a train,

856
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,920
 whenever you get into a station,

857
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,560
 they play a certain song in every station.

858
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,400
 - There you go.

859
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,240
 - That's what it is.

860
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,600
 So it's not what they call it, Mr. Meena.

861
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,240
 - Mr. Meena, I've just heard the joke in that name.

862
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,080
 Mr. Meena.

863
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,920
 - Yeah.

864
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,760
 - Mr. Meena.

865
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,600
 - Yeah, that's good.

866
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,880
 - Because that more mean.

867
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,760
 - No, I think terrorism is Mr. Meena.

868
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,600
 - I think it works at three levels.

869
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,760
 - Get out.

870
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,840
 - Wow, wow.

871
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,680
 - This is huge.

872
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,280
 - Arguably extreme terrorism is more than a Mr. Meena, isn't it?

873
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,440
 - Mr. Meena.

874
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,560
 (laughing)

875
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,400
 - God.

876
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
 (laughing)

877
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,040
 - We took that, damn tell us.

878
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,400
 - We were talking about joke.

879
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,120
 - It's not Mr. Meena, it's Mr. Minoru.

880
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,960
 - Brilliant.

881
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,760
 - And this is Minoru Mukaya,

882
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,360
 who is the underground train composer.

883
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,240
 Every train station has its own unique jingle

884
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,360
 for when a train comes in and goes out,

885
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,320
 and he's done over 110 of them,

886
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,760
 and he will visit each one,

887
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,440
 and he will watch as the train comes in

888
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,880
 and try and invoke what kind of feeling it gives you.

889
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,720
 - Oh, really?

890
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,760
 - Yeah, I thought they were just random.

891
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,960
 - No, he does it station by station,

892
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,280
 and every single one will be like,

893
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,680
 is this a historical area?

894
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,360
 I'm gonna use all Japanese instruments.

895
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,200
 Is this a new area?

896
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,000
 We're gonna use synths and electron.

897
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,680
 - Oh my God, so they're not even on the same style.

898
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,520
 - No, exactly.

899
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
 - That's so cool.

900
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,960
 - That's a different song and different instruments.

901
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,440
 - And it's not that it's useful for, say, blind people

902
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,040
 who need to hear where they are.

903
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,880
 - It probably is.

904
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,960
 - We're recognizable.

905
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,840
 - I gotta say, when I was in Tokyo,

906
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,280
 we actually stayed near Shinjuku,

907
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,960
 and whenever we got in, I would recognize this.

908
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,520
 Like you would just recognize the songs

909
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,360
 as you moved along,

910
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,680
 and you would know, oh, our stations come in.

911
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,240
 It's not always that easy with the different,

912
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,480
 kanji and stuff, I guess.

913
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
 - That was fantastic.

914
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,640
 - What would you like for a whole burn?

915
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,480
 - Ooh.

916
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,320
 - That's a good question.

917
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,160
 - Is it your theme tune?

918
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,000
 - Yeah.

919
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,840
 - There we go.

920
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,680
 - For sure.

921
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
 - What about Margate?

922
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,520
 - Margate.

923
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,360
 - Oh, God.

924
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,880
 - I do like to be beside the seaside.

925
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,720
 - Yeah.

926
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,560
 - Absolutely.

927
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,400
 - Also, the Libertyens live there, don't they?

928
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,240
 - They do.

929
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,080
 - Oh, yeah.

930
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,920
 - There you go.

931
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,080
 - Yeah, no neighbors.

932
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,920
 - He's a friend.

933
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
 - He's a friend.

934
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,760
 - He's a teen.

935
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
 (laughing)

936
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
 - He's a light man.

937
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,600
 (laughing)

938
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,760
 - That's really light man.

939
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

940
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,600
 and that is James.

941
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,760
 - Okay, my fact this week is that one idea

942
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,640
 to block Russian expansion in Eastern Europe

943
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,120
 is to create a 500 mile long bog.

944
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,880
 - That's, it's so such a cool idea.

945
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,800
 - It's a amazing idea.

946
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,080
 - Well, I'm a big fan of Pete and bogs.

947
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,600
 - And the big enemy of Russia.

948
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,600
 (laughing)

949
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,800
 - I'm favor a blocking Russian expansionism

950
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,000
 seems we've had a bit of that here.

951
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,560
 - Well, actually, like this is kind of one point of it.

952
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,720
 So this is an article that I read in the week,

953
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,880
 this week, and it's, it does two things

954
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,000
 that the EU is really trying to do at the moment.

955
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,920
 And that's number one, stop Russia from going west,

956
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,000
 but also to stop climate change.

957
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,840
 And bogs can do both of those.

958
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,160
 - Yeah, 'cause if you get rid of a bog,

959
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,720
 it releases a lot of CO2, doesn't it?

960
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,040
 - Yeah, so if you make one, it stores CO2 back.

961
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,240
 - So is this an extension of like trench warfare?

962
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,040
 So you do a sort of World War I style trench

963
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,840
 and then you fill it with Pete?

964
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,360
 - It's kind of-- - How are we doing this?

965
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,000
 - But you don't put any humans in it, I guess.

966
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,320
 But basically, there's already a bog there.

967
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,840
 - It's a kind of, it's a kind of phantom bog.

968
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,760
 - It is a phantom bog. - It's a phantom bog.

969
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,440
 - Well, it's, it kind of exists,

970
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,920
 but it doesn't exist as much as they want it to.

971
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,000
 So at the moment, if you go from,

972
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,480
 let's say you go from Helsinki,

973
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,520
 all the way down past the Baltic countries,

974
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,640
 and then towards Poland and wherever,

975
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,840
 if you go on that line,

976
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,000
 there's a huge sort of boggy area that goes down there,

977
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,920
 but what they're gonna try and do is make it more

978
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,400
 and more boggy. - Can I ask who they are?

979
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,560
 - NATO. - NATO, so it's NATO,

980
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,400
 but it's also the governments of Estonia,

981
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,440
 Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.

982
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,840
 And what they're trying to do is put more and more water there,

983
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,720
 more and more peat there,

984
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,640
 so that if anyone tries to come across, it's very difficult.

985
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,240
 And that's something that's happened in history in warfare,

986
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,480
 that you basically, you water a log an area,

987
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,640
 and so just can't get past it.

988
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,440
 - And what's really lucky is it says by chance almost,

989
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,240
 all of these boggy areas are on the border,

990
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,320
 but they're on NATO side of the border outside of Russia.

991
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,840
 So you've got, as James says,

992
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,520
 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, it's all running down,

993
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,920
 but they wouldn't have to go into Russia in order to build these bogs.

994
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,200
 So what sort of they can just do it?

995
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,600
 - I love how we go friendly this is.

996
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,440
 This is cool. - Yeah.

997
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,280
 - And even better, Kaliningrad,

998
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,240
 which is like this little X-clave of Russia,

999
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,400
 so it's still part of Russia, but it's not attached.

1000
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,320
 And Belarus, which is like a real ally of Russia at the moment,

1001
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,200
 there's a big old bog in between those places as well.

1002
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,360
 So it's like a really different,

1003
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,640
 that would be a really obvious place for an attack to happen

1004
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,320
 because you could put your troops into Belarus,

1005
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,760
 and you could go through Kaliningrad,

1006
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,040
 but actually there's a bog there, so you can't get through.

1007
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,400
 And dare I say, maybe this is going to sound very stupid,

1008
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,040
 but it almost makes you think that that's why the borders

1009
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,200
 were drawn there in the first place?

1010
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,600
 - You're probably right. - Yeah, okay.

1011
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Maybe here.

1012
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,720
 - It's not a coincidence that the bog is up there.

1013
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's almost like

1014
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,880
 in the head going down it.

1015
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,880
 - Damn it, it's an idiot.

1016
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,360
 - But it's really fascinating,

1017
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,040
 'cause lots of this land, the reason I say it's a phantom bog,

1018
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,720
 is that it's been drained.

1019
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,520
 There are ditches that have been cut,

1020
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,840
 and then the wet, watery mass of this land drains away,

1021
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,000
 and the bog dries out. - 'Cause they try to reclaim it

1022
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,640
 for years, for centuries, I'm saying.

1023
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,320
 - For agricultural purposes, you know,

1024
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,320
 it means you can expand your farming land.

1025
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,040
 And so all you need to do really is to stop draining them,

1026
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,120
 and block up the drainage ditches,

1027
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,880
 and then a couple of years later, you have a bog,

1028
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,400
 and there are all sorts of arguments going on about,

1029
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,880
 well, the farmers won't be very happy with this,

1030
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,320
 and they might need some kind of subsidies,

1031
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,800
 so I don't, it's not being hugely enacted,

1032
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,960
 but one of the guys proposing it is a guy called Hans Yuston,

1033
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,880
 who is known as the Peteland Pope.

1034
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,400
 I just like him so much.

1035
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,240
 - Yeah.

1036
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,080
 - Is that, is our bogs a solution to every problem?

1037
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,040
 - It's pretty much, yeah, yeah.

1038
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,800
 - Have we considered a bog?

1039
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,400
 - Yeah.

1040
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,880
 - Yeah, so it's fascinating.

1041
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,040
 And this was done at the start of the war in Ukraine,

1042
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,000
 as the Ukrainian army, they blew up a dam,

1043
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,240
 which turned the whole of this Irpan river basin

1044
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,600
 into a massive expanse of bogs and marshes,

1045
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,760
 and it turned the area into what one defense consultant

1046
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,000
 called an impossible turd.

1047
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,680
 It just means you cannot drive a tank through that, right?

1048
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,680
 And actually also Russia did the same in, in Zaporizia,

1049
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,240
 and they blew up another dam to stop the counter-offensive

1050
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,720
 of Ukraine, so both sides are blowing them up,

1051
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,120
 and also both of those dams were also blown up during World War II,

1052
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,240
 when Germany attacked and went towards Russia.

1053
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,600
 This exact same thing happened where they tried to stop

1054
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,880
 the Germans by blowing up these two particular one

1055
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,320
 on the Dnieper and one on the Irpan rivers.

1056
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,320
 - Can I ask, why are bogs not defeatable to most modern armies?

1057
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,240
 - The tanks can't get through them.

1058
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,360
 - Yeah, they can't support the wage.

1059
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,240
 - No one's invented a thing that can just go,

1060
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,120
 let's ride over the bogs.

1061
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,120
 - Erroplanes?

1062
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,240
 - Erroplanes.

1063
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,560
 - We have not considered an airplane.

1064
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,560
 (all laughing)

1065
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,840
 - No, like, you can get through the bogs,

1066
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,000
 but it just slows you right.

1067
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,840
 - Yeah.

1068
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,680
 - Yeah.

1069
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,960
 - And when you're being slowed down,

1070
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,040
 you're more of a city duck.

1071
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,200
 - Yeah, and it forces you into a narrow path through the bog,

1072
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,960
 for example, and then your enemy can just focus

1073
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,400
 their fire on that narrow path.

1074
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,240
 - Yeah.

1075
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,160
 - So you sort of canalize your opponent.

1076
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

1077
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,240
 - Yeah, it's pretty amazing, isn't it?

1078
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,240
 - It is, and the bog might be a huge contributor to this.

1079
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,720
 - And like Andy says, it's like,

1080
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,880
 it's not really happening that much in the moment,

1081
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,720
 but in Finland, there isn't in Poland, it is.

1082
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
 So Finland have started reclaiming their bogs

1083
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
 for this specific reason in Poland as well.

1084
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,640
 So yeah, it is happening.

1085
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,480
 - And it's also just from a sort of purely philosophical

1086
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,920
 perspective, always very comforting when the solution

1087
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,320
 is like organic, as opposed to, it's like,

1088
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,960
 you know what's gonna defeat AI, bogs?

1089
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,200
 - Yeah, yeah.

1090
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,920
 It's like for the whole of 20th century, it was barbed wire.

1091
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,400
 But we had bogs all along.

1092
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,600
 - You're absolutely right.

1093
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,960
 Do you know what percentage of greenhouse gases

1094
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,600
 going into the atmosphere are due to degraded peatlands?

1095
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,760
 - Oh my god, Andy, I think you're gonna tell us.

1096
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,680
 (laughing)

1097
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,520
 - I guess you're guessing.

1098
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,200
 - Welcome to Quiz Corner, Andy.

1099
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,520
 So this is one of your quizzes,

1100
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,400
 so let me just guess another two more than 100, isn't it?

1101
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,440
 - Yeah, I'm gonna say 38%.

1102
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,280
 - Oh.

1103
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,760
 - Because 38% is my official number now

1104
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,400
 that that was the answer to a quiz question

1105
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,920
 about how much urine was in the international space.

1106
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,600
 - I'm gonna go it, she's 51%.

1107
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,880
 (laughing)

1108
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,080
 - To be completely honest, I was gonna say 51 as well.

1109
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,440
 Can you ask the question again?

1110
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,040
 - What percentage of greenhouse gases

1111
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,400
 going into the atmosphere?

1112
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,720
 - I think it must be much lower than

1113
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,120
 - I do to degraded peatlands.

1114
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,800
 - And I'm gonna be honest with you, I'll go.

1115
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,880
 - If it was 38% or 51% of all greenhouse gases

1116
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,360
 being due to degraded peatlands,

1117
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,200
 I think we might have got more of a move

1118
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,920
 on to solve the problem before now.

1119
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,080
 (laughing)

1120
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,200
 - You've gotta realize that in these quizzes,

1121
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,920
 sometimes callbacks is more important

1122
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,240
 and getting answered, right?

1123
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,000
 - I'm so sorry, and I think that's an unfair clue

1124
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,440
 to the final person in the quiz.

1125
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,400
 Olga, would you like to guess maybe the 80%

1126
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,680
 of all greenhouse gases due to degraded peatlands?

1127
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,200
 - I'm gonna throw in 11.

1128
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,440
 - Well, you're closest.

1129
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,440
 It's 4 to 5, not 45, otherwise 51 would have rocked home.

1130
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,800
 - Yeah, but it is double flight.

1131
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,080
 It's double all flights happening around the world.

1132
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,160
 All hundreds of thousands of flights happening,

1133
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,880
 you know, every day is due to degraded peatlands.

1134
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,720
 That's crazy.

1135
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,240
 - And you know what's bad for it?

1136
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,640
 - What, mushrooms.

1137
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,000
 - Is that so?

1138
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,800
 - I do not like mushrooms.

1139
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,640
 It has been long set on this podcast,

1140
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,080
 but in the UK.

1141
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,920
 - May trip.

1142
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,640
 (laughing)

1143
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,520
 - In the UK, the mushrooms that you eat

1144
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,800
 are made using peat that has been dug up from peatlands.

1145
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,120
 They have to basically put the peat on top of their,

1146
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,880
 like little bodies of mushrooms

1147
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,400
 and that's what helps them to fruit

1148
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
 and that's what helps you to get them.

1149
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,560
 And the UK mushroom industry

1150
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,600
 gives the equivalent emissions

1151
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,560
 of more than 2,600 cars.

1152
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,400
 - Okay.

1153
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,080
 - Someone took down the UK mushroom industry.

1154
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
 - Big mushroom, yeah.

1155
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,360
 - I will say quite a small number of cars, is it?

1156
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,200
 - Well, all mushrooms.

1157
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,480
 - I only have one car.

1158
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,640
 - Yeah, no, fair enough, fair enough.

1159
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,600
 - No, but like, obviously it is bad

1160
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,280
 to take peats out of areas

1161
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,120
 because it takes a long time to get them back.

1162
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,240
 So I think they are looking to find other ways

1163
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,000
 to make mushrooms rather than using peats.

1164
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,840
 - That's great.

1165
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,840
 - Am I correct in thinking

1166
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,360
 that they used to use it for whiskey and they stopped, right?

1167
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,320
 - They did that, I think they might still use it.

1168
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,800
 - I think it's now a significantly smaller amount

1169
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,800
 from what I, yeah.

1170
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,160
 - Interesting, 'cause everyone's gonna go peat-free

1171
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,240
 in terms of compost for your garden.

1172
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,720
 You can still buy peat stuff,

1173
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,360
 but there's been a big campaign saying,

1174
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,240
 "Can you use some peat-free?"

1175
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,080
 - Yeah.

1176
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,920
 - Comprehensive, you can't get.

1177
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,760
 So I didn't know that about the mushrooms.

1178
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,600
 - That's very cool.

1179
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,720
 - Have you guys heard about the 40 acre bog?

1180
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,840
 - 40 acre bog.

1181
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,680
 - Yeah, no.

1182
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,520
 - 40 acre bog.

1183
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,320
 This is in Lake Chippewa, which is in Wisconsin.

1184
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,720
 So this was a lake that was created in the 1920s.

1185
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,920
 They flooded a swamp in order to do it.

1186
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,920
 And as a result of it, this bog formed, that's 40 acres

1187
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,920
 and it sort of sits in the middle of the lake,

1188
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,560
 but it moves around.

1189
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
 - A bog in the middle of a lake.

1190
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,520
 - Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

1191
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
 So it's got sort of mud plains underneath it.

1192
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,280
 And on top, it's very grassy

1193
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,920
 and it's got a few trees like thin trees sticking out.

1194
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,040
 - I have seen this.

1195
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,640
 - Yeah, it's pretty amazing because it's transient.

1196
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,680
 It moves around all the time.

1197
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,240
 So what happens is there's a bridge

1198
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,720
 that goes over the lake

1199
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,400
 and this bog keeps coming towards the bridge.

1200
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,160
 And so what they do is they get all the boats

1201
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,960
 and they line up against the bog

1202
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,520
 and they shove it back out of the way.

1203
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,920
 They all drive the bog.

1204
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,760
 - Yeah.

1205
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,600
 - It's like an annual thing.

1206
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,200
 They have to do, they have to push the bog.

1207
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,840
 - Yeah, and it's not consistent.

1208
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,760
 They have to check every morning

1209
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,000
 that the bog isn't making its way back over it.

1210
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,800
 - How's that even work?

1211
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
 - I know, it's wild, isn't it?

1212
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,560
 If you've seen images of it, it's pretty cool.

1213
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,400
 - It's stunning.

1214
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,240
 - It's absolutely stunning.

1215
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,000
 - So it doesn't, I assume it doesn't go that deep

1216
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,920
 into the water if it's movable.

1217
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,360
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, it's not very far down.

1218
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,520
 - It's just floating, Pete.

1219
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,920
 - It's floating matter.

1220
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1221
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,080
 - That is so cool.

1222
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,320
 Does anyone know where is the world's biggest bog?

1223
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,240
 It's somewhere that's been mentioned

1224
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,440
 on this podcast already.

1225
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,600
 - Okay, okay.

1226
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,280
 - It's okay.

1227
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,200
 - Will it be somewhere,

1228
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,520
 I'm gonna guess somewhere in Eastern Europe,

1229
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,640
 somewhere like Belarus.

1230
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,720
 - You're close.

1231
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,560
 It's Russia.

1232
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,400
 - Okay.

1233
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,560
 - It's the great.

1234
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,360
 - I mean, if you have that much land mass,

1235
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,640
 statistically speaking.

1236
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
 - Yeah, absolutely.

1237
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,720
 - It's the great Vazugian Maya, it's in Siberia

1238
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,640
 and it is twice the size of Wales.

1239
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
 - Goodness.

1240
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
 - But again, to Russia, that's nothing.

1241
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,160
 'Cause they've got areas, the size of Wales coming out.

1242
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,480
 There is.

1243
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,400
 And it comes from melting permafrost, basically.

1244
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,840
 So the water, melts from the permafrost,

1245
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,480
 goes into this area and becomes a marshy land.

1246
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,200
 And the worst thing about it is the flies and midges

1247
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,520
 that live there.

1248
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,560
 If you ask locals, they say that there's so many midges

1249
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,480
 they can drink enough blood from a random traveler

1250
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,560
 that they will die of midge bites.

1251
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,240
 - Oh, the traveler will die.

1252
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,320
 Not the midge dies of.

1253
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,640
 - No, they'll have in a great time.

1254
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,480
 - Okay.

1255
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,320
 - Yeah.

1256
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
 - But yeah, that's what they say.

1257
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,600
 And there is no doubt there is a lot of midges there,

1258
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,120
 but whether they can actually drain you

1259
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,200
 of all your blood, I think probably not.

1260
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,720
 But anyone who works there has to wear

1261
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,120
 like hazmat suit solvast or like beekeeper suits

1262
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,720
 so that they don't get bitten.

1263
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,920
 - Oh, not for me.

1264
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,760
 - Man.

1265
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,600
 - No, not for me.

1266
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,720
 I don't even like one midge.

1267
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,360
 - Now, we all know Ireland.

1268
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,960
 - Oh, I love him.

1269
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,800
 - Yeah.

1270
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,040
 - How many Walesers is that?

1271
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,640
 - They've got vast piti areas.

1272
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,480
 - They do.

1273
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,320
 - Okay.

1274
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,480
 - But how many Irish people, according to the latest census,

1275
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,600
 heat their homes by burning peat?

1276
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,960
 - 51.

1277
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,800
 - Okay.

1278
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,640
 - 38.

1279
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,480
 - Two.

1280
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,960
 - It's 68,000.

1281
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,800
 - Wow.

1282
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
 - 68,000.

1283
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,640
 - Wow.

1284
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,800
 - And I would have thought.

1285
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,640
 - Yeah, for sure.

1286
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,920
 - I thought we were doing percentages.

1287
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,080
 I don't think.

1288
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,240
 (laughing)

1289
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,080
 - Sorry.

1290
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
 - Well, there's one percent of the population,

1291
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
 so you're not far off.

1292
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,920
 - Is it really?

1293
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,760
 - Yeah.

1294
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
 - They've got these raised bogs.

1295
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,600
 - Thank you.

1296
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,400
 - But there are some bog bastards as I'm calling them.

1297
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,240
 - Bogdas.

1298
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,080
 - It's okay.

1299
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,920
 (laughing)

1300
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,920
 - Is that an official tab, or is it?

1301
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,760
 - For majors.

1302
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,120
 - That's an AHM original.

1303
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,520
 But those are people who aren't

1304
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,080
 sneakily cutting special conservation areas of bogs.

1305
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,600
 Because a lot of these bogs are now protected.

1306
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
 - From a scientific viewpoint,

1307
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,640
 why would I burn peat over wood?

1308
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,000
 - Is it, does it burn longer?

1309
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,640
 - I think just there's loads of peat around.

1310
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,480
 - Oh, okay.

1311
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,480
 - I think it would burn longer.

1312
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,320
 - Oh, would it?

1313
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,160
 - I think so, yeah.

1314
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,000
 - Right.

1315
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,760
 - I think it kind of turns more carbon, doesn't it?

1316
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,600
 - Mmm.

1317
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,440
 - I'm pretty sure.

1318
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,520
 - Those bogs in Ireland is where you would find

1319
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,480
 Tories speaking of bog bastards.

1320
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,400
 (laughing)

1321
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,240
 - I don't know.

1322
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,120
 - So Tories, I think as we've said before,

1323
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,120
 was an old sort of word for an outlaw in Ireland,

1324
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,560
 especially a Roman Catholic one.

1325
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,200
 They would call them Tories.

1326
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,840
 And then eventually it became,

1327
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,240
 I can't remember how it became a word for conservatives,

1328
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,200
 but it's always that word's from.

1329
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,040
 - Yeah, it's originally--

1330
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,840
 - It's fascinating.

1331
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,240
 - But yeah, they would live in the bogs,

1332
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,080
 these outlaws, and then they would come

1333
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,400
 and attack your sheep and stuff.

1334
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,440
 - Wow.

1335
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,000
 - We've got peat and Margate.

1336
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,840
 - Happy?

1337
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,680
 - Yeah, peat talkative.

1338
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,520
 (cheering)

1339
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,120
 - A lot of annoying me all the time, eh?

1340
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,280
 - Yeah, here we go.

1341
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,640
 - That's number one comedy podcast.

1342
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,480
 (laughing)

1343
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,320
 - In the end.

1344
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,900
 (upbeat music)

1345
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,600
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1346
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,000
 and that is Andy.

1347
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,480
 - My fact is, when the first ever online pizza delivery

1348
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,680
 was made, a hundred journalists turned up to report on it.

1349
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,520
 The driver got lost.

1350
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,800
 It took an hour to deliver,

1351
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,120
 and the pizza was long cold.

1352
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,960
 - Wow.

1353
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,720
 - So this is something that was printed in the LA Times

1354
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,720
 in 1994, which I love to read.

1355
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,320
 - Well, only a few months before TLC released

1356
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,400
 Crazy Sexy Cool.

1357
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,960
 - It's the 1994 podcast.

1358
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,800
 - Yeah.

1359
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,640
 - It really is.

1360
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,960
 - Clive Davis was the one to order the pizza

1361
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,000
 to sort of try and get out of the hospital situation.

1362
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,840
 - Please help.

1363
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,920
 (laughing)

1364
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,760
 - It's typing.

1365
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,120
 - Yeah, there was this article headline,

1366
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,800
 online pizza idea is clever,

1367
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,040
 but only half-baked, brilliant.

1368
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,080
 And it was by Pizza Hut, giants of the scene.

1369
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,400
 - Oh, they always do stuff like that.

1370
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,240
 - They always do stuff like that.

1371
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,720
 - But this one was genuinely an innovation.

1372
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,960
 So they launched the thing called Pizza Net.

1373
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,480
 It was in Santa Cruz,

1374
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,880
 and I think this was hosted at the University

1375
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,920
 of California, Santa Cruz.

1376
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,880
 Basically, no one had really tried,

1377
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,840
 not many people had done e-commerce like this,

1378
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,120
 especially not with a pizza.

1379
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,480
 - It was not in 1994.

1380
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,160
 - This is so long ago.

1381
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,280
 And you had to put in your stats.

1382
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,200
 You had to put in your order.

1383
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,280
 The data was then sent to Pizza Hut HQ in Kansas,

1384
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,440
 quite a long way away.

1385
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,640
 It was relayed via a modem to your nearest Pizza Hut branch,

1386
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,240
 who would then phone you up to check

1387
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,720
 that you weren't pranking them.

1388
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,760
 And then eventually, after that had all been gone through,

1389
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,280
 then they would start making you your pizza

1390
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,800
 and deliver it to your home.

1391
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,880
 And they got a hundred journalists in

1392
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,720
 to report on this.

1393
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,920
 - People had the internet by them.

1394
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,200
 I reckon it was about them.

1395
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,120
 I went to Georgiaal Bank,

1396
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,440
 which is a big telescope in the north of England.

1397
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,840
 And that was the only place that had the internet.

1398
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,040
 - Yeah, that's like, I've never seen the internet.

1399
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,120
 - Did you go online?

1400
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,240
 - Yeah, what did you do?

1401
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,520
 I searched, I was really into fantasy football at the time.

1402
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,840
 So I searched for the word fantasy

1403
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,040
 and got as a 14-year-old boy.

1404
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:12,880
 - Uh-oh.

1405
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,200
 - A lot of knowledge that I didn't wish previously had.

1406
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,040
 - Oh my gosh.

1407
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,880
 - Oh my gosh.

1408
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,720
 - Nice.

1409
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,720
 - Did you have a Georgiaal Bank?

1410
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,080
 (laughing)

1411
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:28,240
 - Anyway, yeah.

1412
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,920
 - It is early internet, isn't it?

1413
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,520
 And 94, that's when Amazon launched.

1414
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,360
 - Yeah, 95 is when eBay launched.

1415
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,440
 It's way older than I realised.

1416
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,640
 - There was almost nothing on the internet back then.

1417
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,800
 Newspapers would run articles saying,

1418
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,600
 "Here are the best websites to go to."

1419
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,600
 Which I love.

1420
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,800
 I think we could do with that again.

1421
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,640
 - Yeah.

1422
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,640
 - 'Cause the internet's been sort of,

1423
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,360
 it's like there are now only about what four websites now.

1424
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,720
 - I'm always looking for a new website.

1425
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,040
 I love a new website.

1426
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,880
 - What do you mean?

1427
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,880
 - I want new cool stuff.

1428
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,720
 - It used to be when I started working at QI

1429
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,800
 that you could search for carrot facts

1430
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,280
 and you would get a page of someone

1431
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,400
 who really liked carrots, writing 20 incredible facts.

1432
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,240
 - That's what I want.

1433
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,080
 - Really well solved about carrots.

1434
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,240
 - In comic sands with like a sort of my spacey

1435
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,080
 background of carrots.

1436
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,840
 - No, you put in carrot facts and AI goes.

1437
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,440
 - Did you know that carrots are all green?

1438
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,160
 And you're like, "Oh right, are you sure?"

1439
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,080
 I think they're orange.

1440
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,920
 Oh yes, they are.

1441
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,960
 Orange, I'm sorry about that.

1442
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,560
 - Wait, you guys are extremely smart.

1443
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,880
 This is unrelated to anything.

1444
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,040
 But can someone explain to me,

1445
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,880
 I'm the one, the quote unquote tech person here.

1446
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,560
 Why can't it say I don't know?

1447
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,800
 Why can't it say I don't know?

1448
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,560
 And second, well, why can't it tell me where it got its knowledge?

1449
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,480
 - 'Cause it's stolen from somewhere else

1450
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,480
 and they don't want to reveal it?

1451
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,800
 - Yeah, that's fair.

1452
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,440
 - I'm sure I can Google this.

1453
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,960
 It would just be so much more reliable

1454
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,960
 if it said I don't know.

1455
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,000
 - Wouldn't it be great?

1456
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,920
 - But I'm not interested in making a better product.

1457
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,760
 Never mind.

1458
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,040
 - But don't you think that?

1459
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,440
 That's just true of humans in general, right?

1460
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,840
 So many people, if you ask them,

1461
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,240
 especially people on the internet,

1462
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,280
 if you ask them something,

1463
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,640
 they'll just pretend they know the answer and say,

1464
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,640
 "If we all learned how to say I don't know a bit more,

1465
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,320
 then wouldn't the world be a better place?"

1466
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,160
 I don't know.

1467
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,400
 Grubhub, have you heard of Grubhub?

1468
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,240
 - Love Grubhub.

1469
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,680
 It's like delivered food for Americans or something.

1470
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,680
 - Yeah, I don't really know.

1471
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,720
 - Are we overpeats a hunt?

1472
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,080
 I just have one more thing to say,

1473
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,320
 which is I had assumed that hiring Gorbachev

1474
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,720
 to be in one of their ads was the coolest thing

1475
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,560
 they did in the '90s.

1476
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,880
 - Wow.

1477
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,680
 - Essentially, it's Gorbachev

1478
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,200
 enjoying pizza at Pizza Hut.

1479
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,000
 And then different people at the restaurant

1480
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,840
 are debating whether he's a good or bad guy.

1481
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,680
 - Right.

1482
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,920
 - And the ending is, well, he's the one who brought pizza Hut.

1483
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,040
 So I guess the conclusion is that you can't beat Pizza Hut,

1484
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,200
 but it was more nuanced in terms of where people were standing.

1485
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,040
 - Wow.

1486
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:34,880
 - Then you'd think.

1487
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,160
 - Pizza Hut in our times.

1488
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,040
 That's a joke about pizza in our time.

1489
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,880
 - Yeah.

1490
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,800
 - Which was something that Gorbachev didn't say.

1491
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,640
 - Yeah.

1492
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,120
 - That was another table in.

1493
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,360
 I felt us literally just moved to number two

1494
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,240
 in the comedy challenge, so I said, I don't know.

1495
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,080
 Did you guys feel that?

1496
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,120
 It's like a shudder pizza Hut in our times.

1497
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,520
 (laughing)

1498
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,520
 - Ooh.

1499
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,200
 Meanwhile at Parenting Pal, they're like,

1500
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,760
 "Oh, did you feel that?

1501
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,240
 "I just felt like we lifted you up."

1502
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,120
 I think we've just done a terrible job.

1503
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,320
 - In my house, we grew up with a giant painting

1504
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,400
 of Gorbachev on our lounge room wall.

1505
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,240
 - Yeah.

1506
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,080
 (laughing)

1507
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,800
 - Again, I'm gonna say lie.

1508
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,040
 (laughing)

1509
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,880
 - Is that true?

1510
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,720
 - Yeah.

1511
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,600
 We had one of him and one of Chairman Mao.

1512
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,840
 - What?

1513
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,920
 - Yeah, so it was knockoffs of Andy Warhol's collection

1514
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,160
 of Pop Art, and they bought it in a market somewhere.

1515
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,800
 But I grew up with Gorbachev on my wall,

1516
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,440
 wondering, who is this guy?

1517
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,280
 Is he good or bad, you know?

1518
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,120
 - Interesting.

1519
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,200
 - Do you know the pizza?

1520
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,040
 - We grew up with this.

1521
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,880
 - Things had resolved that.

1522
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,600
 - Yeah, all you had to do was watch the ad.

1523
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,600
 - We grew up with a series of Russian leader

1524
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,480
 themed matrioshka in my house.

1525
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,320
 - Ah, did you?

1526
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,400
 - Yeah, you know the Russian dolls.

1527
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,560
 The one on the outside was the biggest one.

1528
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,720
 - I have a name.

1529
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,400
 (laughing)

1530
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,280
 - Lovely.

1531
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,640
 And we're back to number one.

1532
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,480
 (laughing)

1533
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,640
 - That's good.

1534
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,440
 - The big one was it Stalin on the outside.

1535
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,200
 - The big one was the newest one

1536
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,280
 who was Yeltsin at the time.

1537
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,120
 - Yeltsin.

1538
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,120
 - And then it was going all the way back to London,

1539
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:06,960
 I think.

1540
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,960
 - Grubhub is a food delivery system online, right?

1541
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,040
 It was started by a guy called Colin Wallace

1542
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,360
 and he was a school child

1543
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,280
 and he wanted to get a sandwich to his classroom

1544
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,240
 without the teacher noticing.

1545
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,880
 And so he created a computer program

1546
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,680
 which took a text from his phone,

1547
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,600
 sent it to a fax, which was delivered to a restaurant,

1548
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,160
 and then they would send the sandwich to the classroom.

1549
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,440
 - Right, amazing.

1550
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,680
 - That's genius.

1551
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,560
 - And then eventually sort of turn that into a much bigger thing

1552
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,400
 and then got bought out by some squillianaires.

1553
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,240
 But yeah.

1554
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,080
 - Okay.

1555
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:44,920
 - Are you the origin stories?

1556
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,240
 - I don't know if you guys do business ideas here.

1557
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,680
 - Oh yeah, we're doing, we're doing.

1558
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,760
 None of them has taken off yet.

1559
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,280
 - Okay, but like you know how there's like the founder movie,

1560
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,240
 right, which is like for the MacDonald's founder movie,

1561
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,600
 like that type of thing.

1562
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,440
 Imagine with that, it would be like a Disney channel

1563
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,240
 original founder movie about like a guy in school.

1564
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,080
 - Yeah.

1565
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,320
 - Oh, that's a cute idea.

1566
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,520
 - Wouldn't that be so cute?

1567
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,720
 - So you've come up with an idea for a cultural thing.

1568
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,560
 - Yes.

1569
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,720
 - A movie pitch, don't worry, we do those too.

1570
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,400
 - Okay, sorry, I take it back.

1571
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,320
 It wasn't a business idea.

1572
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,320
 It was a business idea for us to make money off this movie.

1573
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,520
 - Yeah, it's a great, yeah.

1574
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,360
 That's really good.

1575
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,760
 - Like a kids founder movie.

1576
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,520
 - It's like capitals for kids.

1577
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,560
 - So what's it called?

1578
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,400
 Grubhub.

1579
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,720
 - It's something about sandwich, something about fax.

1580
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,720
 - We can do this.

1581
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,560
 - We can definitely do this.

1582
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,640
 Come on guys, number one.

1583
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,160
 This is why we're number one.

1584
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,880
 (laughing)

1585
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,880
 - Breadie steady go.

1586
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,960
 - Breadie steady go.

1587
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,960
 - No.

1588
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,800
 - For kids film.

1589
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,640
 - It's like, yeah, it's gotta be like something about

1590
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,640
 recess, school, a detention, but with bread in it.

1591
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,480
 - Just put the word bread into the word detention.

1592
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,320
 Yeah.

1593
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,560
 (laughing)

1594
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,520
 - Depredution.

1595
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:58,840
 - The new number one, I don't know if you've got it.

1596
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,080
 (laughing)

1597
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,400
 - It's good to have something to be asked about

1598
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,480
 in interviews on the press round.

1599
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,880
 So how do we say the name of this?

1600
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,400
 (laughing)

1601
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,240
 How's it pronounced?

1602
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,240
 - Depredution.

1603
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,160
 (laughing)

1604
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,320
 - Podd you see?

1605
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,360
 (laughing)

1606
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,280
 - It's gonna be huge in Japan.

1607
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,320
 (laughing)

1608
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,600
 - Oh, yeah.

1609
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,600
 - Yeah.

1610
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,440
 - Okay.

1611
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,640
 - I'm so sorry.

1612
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,200
 - That might be the one that takes off.

1613
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,240
 (laughing)

1614
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,040
 - Yeah, last week's Google for Smells did not go anywhere.

1615
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,120
 (laughing)

1616
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,080
 So we're up for different ideas.

1617
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,920
 - Can I tell you guys about Jane Snowball?

1618
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,760
 - Yeah.

1619
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,600
 - Yeah, absolutely.

1620
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,360
 - Okay, she was a 72 year old British woman

1621
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,320
 and she did the first ever online grocery order.

1622
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,160
 In what year?

1623
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,680
 - 1951.

1624
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,520
 (laughing)

1625
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,520
 - 1951.

1626
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,360
 (laughing)

1627
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,360
 - 1938.

1628
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,200
 (laughing)

1629
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,520
 - You've got a real chance to score the triple here.

1630
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,360
 (laughing)

1631
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,840
 - Okay, I'm going in '96.

1632
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,200
 - '96, it's 1984.

1633
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,200
 And this is insane.

1634
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,480
 - Wow, but you said she was in her seventies?

1635
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,320
 - Yes.

1636
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,160
 - Wow.

1637
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,040
 It was simply the end user of the product.

1638
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,280
 She had very little to do with the development.

1639
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,120
 (laughing)

1640
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:07,960
 - I'm sorry.

1641
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,720
 - But I still think in your seventies at that time.

1642
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,560
 - That's true.

1643
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,600
 - It's gonna be tough to use new technology.

1644
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,440
 - Absolutely.

1645
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,080
 - No offense to anyone in the seventies,

1646
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,760
 but like it's become more difficult

1647
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,600
 to get older.

1648
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,440
 - But she's 72.

1649
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,680
 This is 1984.

1650
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,240
 This is a long time ago.

1651
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,080
 - Well hang on.

1652
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:24,920
 - That's when I was born.

1653
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,760
 It's not that long.

1654
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,600
 - It is a lot.

1655
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,440
 - Imagine that.

1656
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,560
 - No one has the internet in their homes.

1657
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,400
 - Yeah.

1658
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,400
 - You know.

1659
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,240
 - Basically.

1660
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,240
 - It's my entire time we're speaking.

1661
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,480
 I'm trying to put the word sub into CEO.

1662
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,000
 (laughing)

1663
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
 - Is it fitting?

1664
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,680
 (laughing)

1665
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,640
 - Sorry.

1666
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,000
 - Keep working on it Olga.

1667
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,840
 But it's, I'll tell you.

1668
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,680
 - If I look distracts.

1669
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,880
 - I'll tell these guys.

1670
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,400
 But basically, she lived in Gateshead.

1671
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,280
 She had a bad hips.

1672
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,560
 She couldn't get to the shops.

1673
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,880
 And there was this thing being run by Gateshead Council

1674
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,240
 called the Gateshead Shopping Experiment.

1675
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,720
 And this developer, Michael Aldrich,

1676
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,160
 set up a thing where she could use

1677
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:06,160
 her TV to get access to every huge number of shops.

1678
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,360
 - And I could tell it actually.

1679
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,200
 - It's something.

1680
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,040
 - Kind of.

1681
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,880
 I'm slightly struggling with how exactly it worked.

1682
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,840
 'Cause I don't think she was pressing her screen.

1683
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,080
 She shouldn't have been anyway.

1684
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,080
 But it allowed her to go through every product

1685
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,400
 that the shops had and order via her telly.

1686
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,680
 It was unbelievably advanced at the time.

1687
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,800
 - Do we now have a name for the boy?

1688
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,640
 - For what?

1689
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,480
 - The boy in the film.

1690
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,320
 - Yeah.

1691
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,960
 - He was called Colin Wallace.

1692
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,120
 - Wallace.

1693
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:29,960
 - Greg's Wallace.

1694
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,040
 - I don't know if it's like Walson Grame,

1695
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,880
 but the grame has to be bread.

1696
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,680
 - Wallace and Grubhub.

1697
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,520
 - Grubhub.

1698
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,960
 - Wallace and Grady bread.

1699
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,360
 - No, keep going.

1700
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,680
 - Grain Hill.

1701
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,760
 - Grain Hill.

1702
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,720
 - 'Cause it's Grange Hill.

1703
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,560
 - He's good.

1704
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,400
 - He's actually good.

1705
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,960
 - School-based thing.

1706
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,960
 - We can go on that.

1707
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:47,800
 - No, no, no.

1708
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,640
 - So sorry.

1709
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,240
 - We'll get it eventually.

1710
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,640
 We would usually move on, but it's such a good idea.

1711
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,680
 (laughing)

1712
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,520
 - Podcast@QI.com, send in your titles for

1713
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,040
 The Bread Based.

1714
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,400
 - Disney Channel Original Movie.

1715
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,240
 - What's it about?

1716
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,080
 Oh, the Grubhub.

1717
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,240
 - Yeah, CEO.

1718
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,400
 - Teen CEO of Grubhub.

1719
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,240
 - Inventor, yes.

1720
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1721
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,800
 Yeah.

1722
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,920
 Should we wrap up soon?

1723
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,760
 - Yeah.

1724
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,600
 - All right, here's a quiz.

1725
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,200
 What was the first thing sold securely on the internet?

1726
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,560
 It's also 1994.

1727
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,400
 - Yeah.

1728
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,040
 - It's about 10 days before the pizza idea was launched.

1729
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,440
 - The first thing ever sold on eBay

1730
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,080
 was a broken laser pointer.

1731
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,920
 - Very good.

1732
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,760
 - I know that.

1733
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,840
 - But this was before that, right?

1734
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,200
 - Yeah, it's the first time anyone bought anything

1735
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,600
 that was properly with secure data.

1736
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,560
 So previously, people had used our penet

1737
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,200
 to buy and sell weed, things like that.

1738
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,720
 But that was just arranging a meeting place.

1739
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,880
 That's not properly an online transaction.

1740
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,600
 - Was it an OASIS album?

1741
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,440
 1994?

1742
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,040
 - It's an album.

1743
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,880
 - Oh.

1744
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,720
 - Okay.

1745
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,680
 - It's not CLC's crazy sexy cool, is it?

1746
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,520
 - No.

1747
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,640
 - Is it someone from the '90s?

1748
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,600
 - I'd say so.

1749
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,840
 He's still alive.

1750
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,800
 - I know the answer to this,

1751
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,120
 I'm bowing out of the course.

1752
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:52,960
 - Oh, okay.

1753
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,240
 Brian Adams?

1754
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,080
 - Oh, good guess.

1755
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:55,920
 - Good answer.

1756
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,760
 - Good guess.

1757
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,120
 - I'm just transporting it to '94.

1758
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,600
 - Not bad.

1759
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,520
 Who else is?

1760
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,520
 - Meatloaf.

1761
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,240
 - British?

1762
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,520
 There's no way of saying it without you immediately.

1763
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,360
 - Else a job.

1764
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,400
 - He likes having sex for a really long time.

1765
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,240
 - Rod's doing?

1766
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,040
 (laughing)

1767
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,080
 - With his wife, Trudy Styler.

1768
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:16,920
 - Yeah.

1769
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,760
 - Is it stink?

1770
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,600
 - It's stink.

1771
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,120
 It was Sting's album, 10 Summoner's Tales.

1772
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,240
 And it was a guy called Phil Brandon Berger.

1773
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,080
 Phil Adolfier.

1774
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,680
 - This weirdly, this fact unites all of our facts today.

1775
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,080
 Because it was bought in 1994.

1776
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,920
 - Yeah.

1777
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,920
 - That's TLC.

1778
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,640
 It was the first major hit he had since his previous hit,

1779
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,240
 which was called "Rushens."

1780
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,400
 - Uh-huh.

1781
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,240
 - Very nice.

1782
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,400
 And the title of the album, what was it Andy?

1783
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,760
 - 10 Summoner's Tales.

1784
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,600
 - It's a pun.

1785
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,440
 - Is it a pun?

1786
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,280
 - It's a pun.

1787
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,280
 - His surname is Sumner, isn't it?

1788
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,160
 - His surname is Sumner, and it is a pun on the Canterbury Tales

1789
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,000
 of which there was a character called Sumner.

1790
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,040
 So it's got a pun, it's got Russia,

1791
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,000
 and it's got 1994, the release of TLC.

1792
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,480
 - Damn, and the show now, that's amazing.

1793
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,080
 - That's like, that's a bravier.

1794
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,280
 That's a now-you-see-me-three level.

1795
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,120
 - Yeah.

1796
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,280
 (laughing)

1797
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,120
 - Oh, bravier.

1798
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:08,960
 - And that's a compliment.

1799
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1800
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,860
 (upbeat music)

1801
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:17,160
 - Okay, that's it.

1802
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,120
 That is all of our facts.

1803
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,560
 Thank you so much for listening.

1819

 - You're so good at titles.

1820
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,280
 What the hell happened in the show?

1821
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,120
 (laughing)

1822
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,800

1825
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,480
 as a group on this podcast, podcast at QY.

1826
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,200
 - Guys, dough, dough is money.

1827
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,040
 - Oh, yes.

1828
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,000
 - But dough is bread.

1829
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,320
 - Yes, dough boy.

1830
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,240
 - Dan!

1831
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,360
 Oh my god.

1832
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,360
 - So boy.

1833
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,600
 - Oh my god, that's so good, sorry.

1834
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,960
 Oh my god, last second.

1835
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,960
 (laughing)

1836
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,600
 - No need to write it now.

1837
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,880
 - Yeah, do not write in any more.

1838
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,360
 (laughing)

1839
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,480
 Olga saved the day.

1840
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,440
 But if you want to talk about anything else but that,

1841
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,840
 they're shaking hands to see, you know what it is.

1842
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,000
 The deal has been done.

1843
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,160

00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,400
 Andy goes through the emails.

1846
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,400
 He cherry picks the best of them

1847
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,480

1848

 It's called Drop Us Align.
