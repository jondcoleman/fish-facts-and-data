00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
 (upbeat music)

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.960
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.520
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.240
 where we were joined by the brilliant Olga Koch.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.240
 Now, if you remember the last time Anna was on maternity leave,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.240
 Olga came on the show and she absolutely blew us away.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.320
 She was one of our favorite guests in that run,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.840
 so we were so delighted to have her back.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.280
 I'm sure you're gonna really enjoy this episode.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.840
 And when you do, you're gonna want to find out more about Olga.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.120
 Now, the best way to do that is to go to her website,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.960
 it is rock n' roger.com.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.960
 I'm gonna spell it, ROCK N R O L G A dot com.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.360
 If you go to rock n' roger.com,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.840
 then you will find details of her new tour,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.840
 which is coming up, it's called Fat Tom Cruise,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.760
 and it is playing all over the world.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.000
 Well, it's certainly playing in the UK and Australia,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.040
 that's for sure.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.080
 So do go there and see if Olga is coming to a town near you

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.920
 and get your tickets.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.600
 Don't forget that if you want to hear more from Olga,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.120
 then you can go to our Patreon and get the Excel version

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.280
 There are three different tiers there.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.080
 They have extra material, they have video content,

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.360
 they have merch, there's all sorts of stuff up there,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.920

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.800
 how much you enjoy it, that is helping as well.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.720
 So, do enjoy this week's show with the incredible Olga Koch,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.880
 on with the podcast.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.460
 (upbeat music)

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:50.720
 Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.440
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish", a weekly podcast

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.920
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.960
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.240
 with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Olga Koch.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.240
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.280
 and in a particular order, here we go,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.480
 starting with fact number one, and that is Olga.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.120
 - My fact is that TLC held the head of their recording label,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.520
 Clive Davis Hostage, in order to renegotiate

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.720
 their recording contract.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.720
 (laughing)

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.600
 - Brilliant idea, brilliant.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600
 - As they should.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.400
 - As they should if, this is an amazing story, isn't it?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.120
 - Have we, so before we go anywhere,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.520
 have we decided how much you're being paid for this podcast?

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.480
 (laughing)

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.840
 - I have logged the doors pre-empted.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.080
 So, apparently, basically, there are albums sold

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.040
 something over 10 million copies,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.640
 and they made $75 million off of it,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.880
 but each of them, the trio, got paid only 50K.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.960
 - Yeah, so who are the trio?

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.360
 - Well, the trio at TLC, so you've got Lisa Left Eye Lopos.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.360
 - She's the L. - She's the L.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.800
 You've got Chilly, who is the--

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.040
 - From Bluey?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.600
 - Yeah, so for all you two, turning into a talking dog,

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.960
 Chilly was there, and then there was T-Bos.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.320
 I think she was called T-Bos.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.040
 - Yes. - I believe so.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.200
 - John Watkins.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.240
 And I didn't know, I thought I didn't know who TLC were.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.240
 And then I realized they did that song.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.320
 - What's it called? - T-Bos?

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.160
 - No.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.000
 - Creep?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.600
 - Scrubs on those grubs.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.600
 - Oh my god, those grubs, yeah.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.560
 - Those grubs, which I do like.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.320
 But I'd, no, I don't think I know what's full.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.680
 ♪ Don't go chasing waterfalls ♪

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.840
 ♪ They took to the rivers and the lakes they flew ♪

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840
 - Welcome.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.440
 Welcome to our friends at PRS again.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.200
 (laughing)

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.720
 - Yes, that's a brilliant song.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.720
 Oh, well, great.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.560
 - Yeah.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.400
 - Harmonized so well.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.720
 It actually identified as the actual record.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.720
 - That was quite something.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.800
 I was ready for you to come in with a snare drum or something.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.960
 - You was gonna do the rap.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.120
 - We just didn't go long enough.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.960
 So yeah, TLC.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.480
 TLC, that generated $75 million.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.800
 They got $50,000 each.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.360
 They thought, "Uh-uh, no way."

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.600
 And so they went into Clive Davis' office

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.640
 and they brought lackeys with them.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.720
 - They stationed them outside the room

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.960
 and said, "No one in, no one out."

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.840
 - And I gather that lackeys were from when Lisa

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.040
 had been in the big house.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.080
 - Yes, and she made some friends.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.280
 - Yes, and she had been on court-mandated rehab.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.200
 And that was after she burnt down her boyfriend's house,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.520
 I believe not on purpose.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.560
 - Yeah, completely accidentally.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.160
 - She had put a lot of his, not completely accidentally.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.880
 - She could end up in prison.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.320
 That doesn't suggest accidental, does it?

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.840
 - What had happened was, she had alleged

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.480
 various things against him like assault.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.040
 And I think she'd found him cheating on her.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.680
 So I would say quite a vexed relationship.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.880
 She had put a load of his sneakers in the bath

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.040
 and set fire to them.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.920
 Now unfortunately, the bath was a low quality model

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.600
 because she had also burned down his previous bath.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.200
 So he'd, the previous time he'd annoyed her.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.880
 - You don't know any TLC songs, and yet here you are.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.720
 (laughing)

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.520
 - This is what the research papers were.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.120
 But basically, they'd had a marble bath

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.080
 and she'd put a lot of stuff in there and set fire to it,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.040
 which had damaged the bath.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.800
 So her boyfriend had replaced the bath

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.440
 with a cheap fiberglass model, which was a bit more flammable.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.760
 So the next time she pulled the,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.600
 I'm gonna put some of your stuff in the bath and burn it,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.640
 routine, it burnt down the whole house.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.880
 - It melted the bath in the fire spread.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.320
 So she didn't mean to do it.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.880
 The first time it was all the teddy bears

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.120
 that he had given her as presents.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.000
 So she did some time and then when she was led out,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.720
 TLC formed, they released two albums,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.160
 Crazy Sexy Cool, which is the album we're talking about,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.200
 which has Waterfalls and so on, second album,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.200
 went ballistically huge and so yeah,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.360
 they went and held him hostage

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.600
 and they maintained a good relationship afterwards.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.760
 I mean, you know, these women brought guns.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.800
 It wasn't like just a nice little hostage taking.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.480
 You know a nice hostage situation.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.800
 When I read this fact,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.120
 I thought, oh, that's probably just a publicity stunt

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.480
 and they probably didn't really do it.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.320
 - Yeah.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.160
 - Well, that's not the case.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.360
 - No, they've spoken about it quite a few times

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.520
 in interviews and they try and play down the gun element to it.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.080
 They say, it's like, I never took the gun out.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.400
 (laughing)

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.520
 - But there was a gun there, lovely.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.080
 - I'll also say it's like '94, around '94, right?

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.920
 - '94.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.440
 - Obviously there's been endless boy band documentaries

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.000
 made about this, but record labels were really

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.320
 predatory at the time, right?

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.760
 'Cause they would essentially give you all this money

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.720
 in advance and then you'd have to pay it back.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.760
 So, I think sometimes violence is,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.920
 well, I don't know where I'm going.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.280
 (laughing)

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.120
 - And I was looking at some other historical musical contracts.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.120
 - Oh.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.960
 - Actually, my research for this came from

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.760
 the latest series of "I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here,"

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.600
 - Okay.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.080
 - Which I watched for the first time in about 20 years.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.600
 And Jack Osborne was on it.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.840
 And he talked about his grandfather called Don Arden.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.880
 And Don Arden apparently got the small faces

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.800
 to work for him 'cause he was an agent

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.440
 by dangling them upside down out of an upper floor balcony

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.120
 by the ankles until they signed.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.960
 - What?

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.400
 - And Jack Osborne said this on "I'm a Celebrity."

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.240
 And I checked in.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.880
 I think it is mostly true.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.200
 Don Arden in his biography said that he didn't do it.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.040
 It was a group of thugs that he'd hired.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.440
 - Oh, well, that's a different story.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.560
 (laughing)

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.840
 - Who overstepped the mark, he said.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.400
 - That would be Sharon Osborne's.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.400
 - Sharon Osborne's father.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.840
 - Don Arden, born in Manchester.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.160
 And he had a little phone box in Manchester

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.560
 where he used to work in.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.360
 And he was such a gangster that no one would go in

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.560
 to make a phone call because they knew that

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.440
 if they went anywhere near his phone box,

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.120
 they'd get the shit beat out of them.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.120
 - Wow.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.680
 - Yeah, he's like a real gangster,

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.280
 like probably the most gangstery

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.040
 of all the record boxed buses.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.880
 - Gosh.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.840
 - He also invented the coworking space.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.680
 - Yeah.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.520
 - Yeah.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.080
 - We had people like park up on a Starbucks

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.240
 for hours on end.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.080
 - Yeah.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.120
 - Was he working full time in the phone box?

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.280
 - Well, that's what I'm asking.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.000
 - That was his office.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.200
 He would send people that phone number

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.880
 and they want a speech when they'd have to ring

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.200
 his phone box.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.040
 - Okay, that's incredible.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.880
 - Wow, that's incredible.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.720
 - That is incredible.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.560
 - Flex.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.560
 - Yeah, that is.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.160
 - Oh, got you a fan of Ray.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.160
 - What do you mean by that?

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.000
 - She's a singer.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.160
 - Oh, yeah, Ray with an E.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.080
 I couldn't hear the E when you were a singer.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.400
 - Where the hell is my husband?

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.600
 - Where the hell is my husband?

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.440
 - What a song.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.600
 - She kept me going, I asked.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.680
 When's your album coming out?

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.520
 When's your album coming out?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.040
 And she'd say, oh, you know, and then in 2021,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.920
 she got asked the question and she sort of snapped

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.240
 and she posted online.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.160
 I've been on a four album deal for the last seven years.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.560
 But the record label keep on not allowing me

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.880
 to release an album.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.320
 They say, oh, you're not ready and I'll not yet,

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.920
 you know, sometimes the person signs you up for a deal

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.320
 and then they leave the company.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.400
 So there's no one inside saying, right, where's the Ray album?

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.120
 So yeah, all the label doesn't want to find

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.960
 that to campaign.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.800
 - Wow.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.960
 - I think she did eventually get out of it, right?

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.680
 And then she self-released 21st century blues.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.960
 - Yeah, so it's still sort of going on

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.760
 that you sign up and then you don't get.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.760
 - Yeah.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.440
 - The other big one is New Jeans, isn't it,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.920
 who's like the massive K-pop band.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.320
 And it even went into like South Korean parliament

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.920
 was talking about whether they should be allowed

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.920
 to get out of the contract.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.400
 I think it still hasn't been started yet.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.440
 - When in K-pop, it's even harder because obviously

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.600
 they start like 13 and it's like basically a boarding school.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.040
 So how long are you technically paying them back

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.000
 for the services that the label provided for you?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.280
 - And I don't know if it's in K-pop

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.080
 'cause they don't listen to that much, but in J-pop,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.920
 like the bands will, they'll have the members

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.920
 and then the members will leave

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.400
 and then new members will come up.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.520
 So it'll be the same band,

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.560
 but then maybe it'll just be completely different people.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.880
 And it's like all the shipathesis.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.720
 - Yeah.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.240
 - The trigger's broom, pick your metaphor.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.040
 But is that, so I was thinking about there's that band,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.280
 is it AKB 48?

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.120
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.960
 - Are they Japanese?

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.960
 - From Akia Bura.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.120
 - And they're like 48.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.480
 - They're about 48 of them give all take.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.320
 - Exactly.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.920
 - I was thinking that they were famous years ago.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.200
 And it's like teeth, isn't it?

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.360
 - It's like shark teeth.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.800
 - You lose, well you lose a tooth.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.760
 - Yeah, but when you get to human teeth,

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.080
 you only have two sets of teeth.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.400
 - What?

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.160
 - Oh, I've been so kind of late.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.200
 I've been waiting for these new ones

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.440
 to come through for ages.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.720
 - I guess it's like S Club Juniors,

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.200
 but if it was all one band.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.040
 - Yeah.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.360
 - It's like if S Club Juniors came through

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.520
 and became S Club again,

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.560
 and then S Club babies came along

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.120
 and became S Club Juniors a mess.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.280
 - So good.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.440
 - I would like to say that what just happened is

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.720
 you said Ray and I did like a cool young reference.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.160
 I mean, I can go even younger.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.160
 Do you know K-pop?

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.440
 (laughing)

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.240
 Anyone want to be more angry at you?

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.520
 - I would just say that the surprise biggest girl group

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.080
 of 2025 has to be Huntrix.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.400
 - Well, are they from Demon Hunters?

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.240
 - They, sorry.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.080
 - Oh yeah.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.920
 - Oh yeah.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.120
 - They got nominated for like every Grammy.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.960
 It was crazy.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.960
 - Yeah, well, and they're probably gonna get

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.800
 an Oscar nomination.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.360
 And they, they're now a traveling band, basically,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.680
 because it's been so successful.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.200
 They had a number one still word, sorry.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.040
 Old person here.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.200
 What?

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.000
 - An animation was released earlier this year

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.960
 on Netflix called K-pop Demon Hunters,

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.200
 which has just absolutely dominated children's parties

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.280
 and Netflix streams, like nothing else.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.160
 - And it has a specific song in it called "Golden"

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.640
 that I would say that the success of "Golden"

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.680
 is only comparable to, you remember when Frozen came out

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.280
 and it was let it go and at first it was just kids

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.360
 and then it was everybody all the time.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.440
 That's what happened to "Golden."

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.600
 - Interesting.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.760
 Have you guys heard of Duran, Duran?

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.400
 Can we just hold the conversation back around Duran?

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.440
 - Duran, Duran, of course.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.280
 - Yes.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.120
 - Of course.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.960
 - I heard you the first time.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.720
 - I was looking at problems between bands

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.720
 and their fans as well, like breaches of contract

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.480
 as well as breaches of contract.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.960
 In 2014, they were reported to be suing their own fan club.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.800
 - No.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.880
 - With a love.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.000
 - And they, it's great.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.360
 They signed an agreement with this fan club company

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.560
 called "World Wide Fan Clubs."

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.000
 Which, Duran, Duran will get 75% of the profits

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.240
 from the fan club, but these guys will run it

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.080
 and they're alleged that it hadn't been run properly

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.960
 and they hadn't been collecting membership pieces.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.040
 It became an incredibly boring and technical story,

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.040
 but I like the idea of suing your own fans.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.720
 - I wonder why as a person who does our inbox.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.320
 (laughing)

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.920
 - I was looking at some of the oldest sort of contracts

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.720
 from music and the first person I think to get a royalty

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.880
 was a guy called Albert Chevalier.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.840
 Have you heard of him?

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.680
 - No.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.520
 - No.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.960
 - Oh, I love his, I love his second album.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.800
 - Yeah.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.640
 (laughing)

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.840
 - He got one shilling, which is five pence

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.480
 for every dozen records sold.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.320
 This was in 1891.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.800
 And he's also famous for inventing or popularizing

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.560
 the phrase "watcher."

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.400
 - Really?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.320
 - Which means like, hello.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.160
 - Yeah.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.640
 - Was that in his songs?

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.680
 - It already existed, but it wasn't that popular,

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.120
 but he had a song called "watcher" knocked him out

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.680
 the old Kent Road.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.680
 - Right.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.400
 - Oh, that's where that really took off.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.040
 - Well, speaking of "watcher,"

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.640
 did you know the word "hello" was popular

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.040
 as by the song "hello" my baby, "hello" my baby?

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.880
 - No, really?

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.360
 - Before they wanted to use a "hoi" to pick up a phone,

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.880
 and "hello" was people mocking people picking up the phone.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.000
 - I really hope this is true.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.400
 - Wait, so we need to research this.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.160
 - So did that song come before the phone?

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.000
 - No.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.400
 - Okay, so the phone happened.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.840
 - A "hoi" was being used.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.680
 - Yes.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.440
 - Someone sent a grand bell once he'd say, "a "hoi" "hoi"

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.280
 - Yeah.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.280
 - That's right.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.160
 - And then "hello" was like slaying at the time,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.480
 and "hello" my baby, "hello" my darling.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.320
 - Wow.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.960
 - With them making fun of people using "hello" on the phone.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.800
 - Wow.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.640
 Isn't it a while?

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.840
 - When you think of time travelers who would come

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.240
 to our present day, the things you wouldn't expect

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.440
 would blow their mind.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.880
 - You're using "hello" as the greeting.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.720
 - Yeah.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.560
 (laughing)

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.200
 - That was like fifth version of how you would do that.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.960
 - It was like minor slang.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.800
 That's wild.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.480
 You know within the world of TLC,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.520
 they basically fell out at one point.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.160
 Lisa left "I Lopez" got a big beef with the other two,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.680
 and they started sort of cussing each other

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.840

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.640
 So Lisa in "Five Magazine" called them out,

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.560
 saying that everything's going terrible,

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.320
 then in "Entertainment Weekly," T. Bos and Chile,

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.040
 said, "Well, she's manipulative, she's evil,

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.560
 "she's a bad person."

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.400
 So then Lisa left "I Lopez" replies

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.440
 in "Entertainment Weekly," saying, "Okay,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.640
 "we've got three albums left on our contract

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.760
 "with this company.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.640
 "Let's release an album that is three CDs long,

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.360
 "but each of them are solo albums,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.880
 "and we'll let the fans decide who they think

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.240
 "the best solo album is."

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.640
 But hang on, is this a randomized controlled trial?

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.640
 Is it a blind listen?

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.200
 'Cause you have to, if you're gonna get it--

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.920
 - You can recognize them from the voice, sure.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.040
 - Yeah, well, that's what you'd have to do.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.440
 You'd have to get someone else to sing them all, right?

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.280
 - To sing them all, right?

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.360
 - We could do this scientifically, or are we not?

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.600
 - Yeah, we just--

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.200
 - When the IRA are on TV,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.360
 and they have to get someone to do the voice over.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.240
 - They all have to be done by Jerry Adams.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.080
 - That's it.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.120
 - And that was the plan, so...

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.920
 Jerry Adams then wrote to Entertainment Weekly

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.360
 and said, "Well, I'm Keen, what about you guys?"

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.960
 So it was meant to be called The Challenge,

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.440
 and that was the idea, three CDs,

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.160
 which would then finish their contract,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.320
 'cause that's how many albums to go.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.400
 - I like the idea, but it's pretty bold move, isn't it?

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.400
 Someones gonna come last in that competition.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.240
 - Yeah. - Oh, yeah.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.840
 - Please never do this on fish.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.600
 - No, we never do that, 'cause Anna is just gonna get it.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.320
 I'm far the most wizards.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.800
 - Yeah, we'll be get squashed by her.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.400
 Just while we're on things, the home office

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.160
 might have been interested in Jerry Adams.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.880
 (laughing)

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.120
 The home office used to have its own boy band.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:52.960
 - Did it?

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.800
 - What?

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.080
 - Yeah, they were called Mr. Mina,

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.960
 and it was three, sort of, I think, teenage lads,

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.160
 and they would go around schools up north

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.560
 as part of a government initiative

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.680
 to deter Islamist extremism.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.480
 So they have various songs about things like 9/11,

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.480
 or the sort of, the temptations of going down

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.240
 an extremist route.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.800
 It's unclear whether they knew they were being funded,

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.680
 'cause there's quite a secretive home office program,

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.920
 which does a bit of cultural outreach,

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.560
 and I'm not clear whether or not they knew you.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.560
 - It was a lot of that wasn't the back of the day.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.240
 Like, there was talking about it.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.440
 (laughing)

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.000
 - Well, during the Cold War,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.920
 there was lots of people who became really big,

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.280
 and were sort of traveling around the Eastern Europe,

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.720
 and they thought it was all because how great they were.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.160
 But actually, the US government

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.440
 was just paying for everything.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.280
 - Exactly, see?

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.440
 - Scorpion's wind of change vibes?

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.720
 - I don't know what that means, but yeah.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720
 - Oh, okay, never mind.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.760
 I'll take that back.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.480
 There's a co-rumor that winds of change

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.800
 it broke the Soviet Union, the song.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.960
 - Oh, I bet it is that song.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.800
 - The song, right.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.800
 - Well, there was a lot of CIA stuff going around.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.920
 - I often wonder, 'cause at the time of recording,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.800
 we're number one in Apple's comedy podcast charts.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.200
 And I always think that's so mental

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.680
 that probably the government are doing this,

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.760
 and probably they're kind of training us

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.360
 to take over some country out of the Syops.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.440
 - Wait, you're telling me

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.000
 that a bunch of teenage boys, singing about 9/11,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.680
 didn't realize that they were

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.080
 (laughing)

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.000
 - We said, "Nonsense."

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:19.840
 (laughing)

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.480
 - That's what came out to you about instead of,

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.000
 "Wait, are you telling me this piece of shit

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.400
 "is the number one in the comedy podcast?"

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.520
 - No, no doubt about that.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.800
 - I mean, we know that a lot of our lessons on fish

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.160
 do come from voxels, specifically,

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.440
 just next to voxels stations.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.600
 - Right, yeah, that's true.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.320
 - Like, hundreds of thousands every week,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.480
 just from there, yeah.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.120
 - I thought you were talking about the gay sawdust.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.200
 (laughing)

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.600
 - Yes, but the gay sawdust at my five funded.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.840
 Sorry, just to be completely clear.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.420
 (upbeat music)

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.280
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.680
 and that is my fact.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.400
 My fact this week is that the height

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.840
 of the world's third tallest structure was picked

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.920
 because it worked as a pun.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.760
 - Love it.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.600
 - Nothing.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.760
 - So this is better, so better be good.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.240
 This is the number one comedy podcast town.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.360
 Don't send a spiraling back down those charts.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.560
 (laughing)

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.880
 - So this is the Tokyo Sky Tree,

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.880
 which is 634 meters.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.240
 It's the tallest free standing tower in the world.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.080
 - Where is it?

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:18.920
 - It's in Tokyo.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.680
 (laughing)

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:28.880
 - And yeah, it's height was picked very specifically

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.040
 because the area that they were building this on

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.680
 was part of an old region that was known as Musashi

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.440
 and Musashi and she broken down are Musashi,

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.040
 Sa, three and she, four.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.080
 So Musashi is the exact height that they decided on.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.920
 - Brilliant.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.800
 - And interestingly, there are different ways

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.600
 that you can count in Japan,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.320
 as in the way that you say the words,

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.680
 'cause there are old Japanese in those a few dollars.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.520
 So, Mou is part of an old version.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.400
 - Yes, it's Jini-san, she go Roku.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.440
 - Exactly, so it's not Roku, but Mou works as well.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.360
 Just for anyone wondering why that's the case.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.880
 - Yeah, so they deliberately did that as a pun.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.240
 - Very clever. - And it's lovely.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.640
 - It's very cool.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.120
 - Does that happen much in the world?

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:12.960
 (laughing)

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.760
 - I've been imagining it as you know what I thought of

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.480
 when you sent this, was it the crystal palace,

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:24.480
 which was 1,851 meters in all yards in length or feet

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.880
 in length because it was opened in 1851.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.000
 - That's brilliant, I didn't know that.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.840
 - That's cute stuff.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.400
 - It doesn't help when you don't remember the unit.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.400
 (laughing)

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.720
 - Gotta be feet. - Yes, yes, yes.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.440
 - It's about 600 meters, like a mile punch.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.720
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.680
 This kind of gets to happen a lot in Japan.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.800
 So, this is part of a tradition of Japanese puns

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.360
 called Guru Wase.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.240
 So, it can be associated with people, ideas.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.160
 It can even be associated with Pai.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.040
 - That's in the number?

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:59.040
 - Yeah, so if you say 3.14159265 in Japanese,

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.000
 those all are numbers that make words.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.640
 And that comes out as a sentence that means an obstetrician

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.000
 faces towards a foreign country.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.160
 - Wow.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.800
 - They just like finding all these little patterns

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.000
 within that world.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 If you do 18782 plus 18782 equals 3756.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.960
 So, there's a calculation.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.720
 That comes out as bad person plus bad person equals massacre.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.560
 When you translate it into Japanese words.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.720
 - It's three, three, six, yeah.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.080
 - We have wide at six, eight, seven, because seven, eight, nine.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.920
 - So, you know, we've got our own version of that in our culture.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.960
 - It's a classic.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.120
 That's the first joke my daughter led.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.360
 - Yeah, yeah, wow, that's bizarre.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.800
 - Yeah, it's very cool.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.800
 - It is very cool.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.360
 I'll just mention two others just in case.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.840
 There's a famed admiral, Yamamoto,

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.360
 whose given name comes from the older pronunciation

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.920
 for the word 56, which was his dad's age when he was born.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.240
 So, Yamamoto 56, yeah.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.760
 And then there's a baseball player, quite famous in America,

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.720
 called Icho Suzuki, and his jersey number was 51,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.480
 which in Japanese is Go Ichi, which is his first name.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.320
 - Oh, fine.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.600
 - Yeah, so it was Go Ichi.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.600
 - That's really fun.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.720
 - This is all really good stuff.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.520
 I wish I could refining, you know,

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.360
 normally we kind of just bad sort of these,

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.800
 but I just like hearing them.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.280
 - Yeah, yeah, it's really cool.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.920
 - Yeah, Ichi was an amazing baseball player.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.720
 So, he was an outfielder and whenever he called a ball,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.320
 it was seen as like really well done.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.360
 So, that area was known as Area 51.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.960
 - Oh, that's, wow.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.800
 - So good.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.640
 Oh, God, I love that.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.280
 - Yeah, so that's a thing that happens in Japan, quite a lot.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.360
 - Love it, yeah.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.840
 - The only thing that the entire time was like,

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.320
 and sometimes when I tear a misu, I say, I tear a misu.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.520
 That's the one pond, the only pond

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.760
 that was just circulating around my mouth.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.760
 - You say it to the food?

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.880
 - I say it to the food, because it sounds like misu.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.240
 - Tokyo, have you been?

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.920
 - I did go to Tokyo a couple of years ago.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.000
 I wrote a whole show about it.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.120
 Basically, I met a guy at a wedding.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.480
 We spent an unforgettable night,

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.520
 and then he lived in New Zealand and I lived in the UK.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.560
 So, we decided to meet three months later in Japan.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.400
 - Lovely.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.360
 - And it was a disaster.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.200
 - Oh.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.760
 - Yeah, we absolutely hated each other's guts.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.600
 - Really?

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.440
 - Yeah.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.960
 - But what a beautiful city to hate each other's guts at.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.640
 - Did you find that out early on in the trip?

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.800
 - 45 seconds at night.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800
 - Yeah.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.960
 - And then you say goodbye or did you hang out the trip?

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.520
 - Oh, baby, we planned too much to say goodbye.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.640
 Non-refundable train tickets, restaurant reservations,

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.760
 guided tours.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.720
 - Did you go out this guy tree?

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.840
 - Well, we went up a building of some sort.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.200
 - Do you think if he'd have told you all of Don's puns

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.440
 and things might have gone better?

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.280
 - 100%.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.800
 - Maybe I would have tire missed him.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.240
 (laughing)

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.080
 - That's beautiful.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:40.920
 - Yeah, the entire time.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.720
 I was like, I wish I had those in my pocket

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.040
 to fill the silence in.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:44.880
 (laughing)

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.440
 - Not.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.200
 - Wow, that's extraordinary.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.040
 - Yeah.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.640
 - It's one of those things where everybody sort of always

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.160
 wonders what would happen if they did such an impulsive thing.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.680
 And I'm here to tell you,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.880
 this is why you don't do that.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.360
 - Do you remember who was it?

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.080
 - Was it I way, way, who did that thing where

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.640
 they got two people to walk along the whole of the--

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.640
 - I think it was Maria.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.480
 - Maria.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.640
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.440
 So she walked all the way along the Great Wall of China

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.880
 and then met someone halfway and then kissed and then--

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:14.720
 - They broke up?

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.920
 - It was her, yeah, it was her both artistic partner

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.720
 and her partner in life.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.600
 And they both started on either end of the Great Wall,

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.160
 met in the middle and broke up when they met in the middle.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.760
 - Did they always plan to break up?

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.480
 Or did they just remember they hated each other

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.320
 when they got there?

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.600
 - I think, yeah, 45 seconds until we're done.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.760
 It's only remembered.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:35.600
 - What I mostly remember about Tokyo is how busy it is.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.760
 Like, because we live in a city, London, right?

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.120
 And you think, oh, it's really busy.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.760
 And then you go to Tokyo and it's just like

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.880
 a million times busier.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.080
 Of the 51 busiest train stations in the world,

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.280
 all but six of them are in Japan.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.440
 And the top three are in Tokyo.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.280
 - Wish.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.120
 - 51!

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.280
 (all laughing)

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.120
 - Go wish you.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.960
 - Go wish you.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.360
 (all laughing)

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.520
 The most busy.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.760
 - Sorry, but who else?

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.560
 Who makes the top 51?

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.760
 (all laughing)

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.600
 - So shy.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.600
 (all laughing)

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.960
 - I don't see the chart that does the chart 51.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.000
 - It does feel like once you get to 52,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.440
 then they're all in a different country.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.520
 - But the busiest railway station is Shinjuku.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.000
 And they had, in 2022, the average number of daily passengers

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 was 2,704,703, which is the equivalent of every adult

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.920
 in Uruguay passing through the station every day.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.760
 - Oh.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.040
 - That's just one station.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.480
 - Thank you for putting into terms and numbers

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.480
 I had to understand.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.320
 (all laughing)

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.480
 - I can't picture that many people.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.480
 Can you keep it?

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.800
 - We all know the entire adult population.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.800
 The population, the adult population.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.640
 - Yeah.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.480
 - The kids of Uruguay.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.840
 I'm gonna have a field day where the grownups are away.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.520
 - You'll thank us in five months' time

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.520
 when you're in Uruguay meeting some Australian

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.160
 from the other side of the world.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.000
 (all laughing)

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.200
 - The chat runs dry.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.720
 - Wow, I had no idea.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.080
 Uruguay was so small.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:23:59.920
 - Yeah, it is small.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.840
 - That's a small population.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.840
 - It's much smaller than you think,

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.480
 but it's just that tiny little bit in South America, isn't it?

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.600
 It's not a very big country.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.360
 Do we have any listeners in Uruguay?

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.680
 - Podcast@QI.com.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.520
 - Ooh, nice.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.360
 - Lovely stuff. - Throw this.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.440
 - Send us some freight bantos.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.280
 - Yeah.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.160
 - This Tokyo Sky Tower is a radio and television tower.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.800
 Now, we spoke about one very recently, the BT Tower.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.840
 So it's a hot topic on the fish world right now.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.120
 - This one is amazing.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.120
 I've been reading a bit about it.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.200
 - Oh, yeah, give us some.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.680
 - So guess what they did for the 10th anniversary

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.840
 to celebrate it?

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.240
 - Was it a pun?

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.040
 - It was, no, it wasn't.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.000
 It was, okay, what's the famous Japanese cultural thing?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.240
 - Godzilla.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.760
 - More artist, even more artistic.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.600
 - Anime?

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.880
 - Even more artistic.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.720
 (all laughing)

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.640
 - AKB48.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.800
 - Kabuki theatre.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.160
 - Oh yeah. - Okay.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.000
 - Oh yeah.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.040
 - You know, this is the ancient centuries-old form of theatre.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.200
 And they have really famous actors,

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.760
 and it's quite dynastic as well, isn't it?

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.320
 So sometimes you'll do it because you're, you know,

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.520
 great, great grandfather, et cetera, didn't it?

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.680
 So for the 10th anniversary of the Sky Tree Tower,

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.880
 they got a Kabuki actor called Inchikawa Ibizo the 11th

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.920
 to perform his famous glare from the top of the building.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.960
 (all laughing)

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.520
 - That's incredible.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.800
 - It's so good.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.840
 - There's a famous glare called the Nirami,

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.080
 and it's done by moving each eye in different directions.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:17.920
 - Oh, that's cool.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.320
 - Which is good.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.840
 And also that means that Inchikawa Ibizo the 11th

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.080
 could qualify as a fighter pilot,

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.240
 'cause I believe you have to do that to be a fighter pilot.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.200
 - So you're also looking to different directions at once.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.600
 - I think you have to have one eye on the mig who's up ahead,

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.800
 and you have to have one eye on your instruments.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.120
 So I think you need to be able to,

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.440
 I think Prince Harry can do it.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.440
 - Wait, is this a thing that you can make yourself do?

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.040
 - No, you can train for that.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.640
 - So your brain can take in two different...

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.480
 - Yeah.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.240
 - And Harry's really good at doing those magic eye pictures.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.080
 - Yeah.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:46.920
 - Definitely.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.920
 - Definitely.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.080
 - It's incredible.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.600
 - All day outside of Thina, like I used to do.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.200
 Trying to see if he can get a book of those

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.200
 and just go through them.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.040
 That's a tiger.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:56.880
 That's a butterfly.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.720
 That's a waterfall.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.720
 He can just do it.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.760
 - Wow.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.600
 - Okay.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.440
 - Anyway, there you go.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.920
 - Olga, when you went to Tokyo,

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.480
 did you go to the Gotakuji Temple,

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.080
 which has got all those sort of cats

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.600
 that wave their arms?

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.880
 Do you know those ones that you see in Chinese restaurants?

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.840
 - Well, there's a temple just outside,

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.080
 it's just outside Tokyo, actually, where they have these.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.120
 And the idea is that there was a guy,

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.720
 some priest or other was walking past

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.480
 and a cat let him come into the temple

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.680
 and then that became the sort of lucky cat.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.000
 And if you go there, there's thousands of them outside

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.440
 and you can, you know, pay 100 yen and get your own one

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.360
 and then write a message on it and stuff like that.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.200
 - That's really cool.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.200
 - So is the cat waving you in as opposed to waving hello to you?

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.480
 - Yeah, it is.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.320
 - Right.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.680
 - And also, actually, probably they evolved

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.720
 from waving penises, we think.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.360
 So probably this story is like a new story

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.560
 and where they actually came is that they were used

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.000
 in brothels and they would have these lucky talismans

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.600
 in the shape of penises that weren't beckoning people

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.080
 into the brothels.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.040
 There were things that evolved into the cats.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.120
 - I don't want to, I don't want to assume anything,

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.440
 but wouldn't the average person not be going

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.960
 to a brothel for a penis?

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.680
 - No, but I suppose you just need to some kind of symbol

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.520
 and it's hard to make a vagina wave.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.800
 (laughing)

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.640
 - You tried.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.400
 (laughing)

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.720
 - Good Lord.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.040
 - I could tell as I started, that said,

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.920
 since I was not going to ed them all.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.480
 (laughing)

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.560
 - Wow.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.560
 - Yeah, gosh.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.760
 But answer a question I did go and there's a tiny little cat

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.800
 at that temple that just says, "Please help."

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.000
 (laughing)

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.320
 - I have found, certainly for anyone who's not living in Tokyo,

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.560
 possibly the most famous musician that they have.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.560
 Certainly, their songs is known more than most songs out there,

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.400
 right?

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.120
 - So what you're saying is they're really famous in Tokyo,

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.480
 but anyone else wouldn't have heard that.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.840
 - Yeah, and possibly in Tokyo,

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.400
 they might not even know the name of the person,

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.440
 but they will know the songs and be able to sing.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.280
 - Okay.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.400
 - The songs are there as impossibly any other composer.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.320
 - Are you gonna forget something?

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.720
 - I think it's Mr. Meena, the home office funded.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.560
 (laughing)

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.600
 - And given his boy band, they're huge in Tokyo.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.960
 - It's got to be the music in the underground, is that?

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.600
 'Cause whenever you go on a train,

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.920
 whenever you get into a station,

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.560
 they play a certain song in every station.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.400
 - There you go.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.240
 - That's what it is.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.600
 So it's not what they call it, Mr. Meena.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.240
 - Mr. Meena, I've just heard the joke in that name.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.080
 Mr. Meena.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:32.920
 - Yeah.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.760
 - Mr. Meena.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.600
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.880
 - Because that more mean.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.760
 - No, I think terrorism is Mr. Meena.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.600
 - I think it works at three levels.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.760
 - Get out.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.840
 - Wow, wow.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.680
 - This is huge.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.280
 - Arguably extreme terrorism is more than a Mr. Meena, isn't it?

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.440
 - Mr. Meena.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.560
 (laughing)

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.400
 - God.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.400
 (laughing)

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.040
 - We took that, damn tell us.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.400
 - We were talking about joke.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.120
 - It's not Mr. Meena, it's Mr. Minoru.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:57.960
 - Brilliant.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.760
 - And this is Minoru Mukaya,

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.360
 who is the underground train composer.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.240
 Every train station has its own unique jingle

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.360
 for when a train comes in and goes out,

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.320
 and he's done over 110 of them,

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.760
 and he will visit each one,

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.440
 and he will watch as the train comes in

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.880
 and try and invoke what kind of feeling it gives you.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.720
 - Oh, really?

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.760
 - Yeah, I thought they were just random.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.960
 - No, he does it station by station,

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.280
 and every single one will be like,

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.680
 is this a historical area?

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.360
 I'm gonna use all Japanese instruments.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.200
 Is this a new area?

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.000
 We're gonna use synths and electron.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.680
 - Oh my God, so they're not even on the same style.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.520
 - No, exactly.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.520
 - That's so cool.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.960
 - That's a different song and different instruments.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.440
 - And it's not that it's useful for, say, blind people

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.040
 who need to hear where they are.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:39.880
 - It probably is.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.960
 - We're recognizable.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.840
 - I gotta say, when I was in Tokyo,

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.280
 we actually stayed near Shinjuku,

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.960
 and whenever we got in, I would recognize this.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.520
 Like you would just recognize the songs

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.360
 as you moved along,

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.680
 and you would know, oh, our stations come in.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.240
 It's not always that easy with the different,

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.480
 kanji and stuff, I guess.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.480
 - That was fantastic.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.640
 - What would you like for a whole burn?

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.480
 - Ooh.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.320
 - That's a good question.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.160
 - Is it your theme tune?

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.000
 - Yeah.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:03.840
 - There we go.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.680
 - For sure.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.680
 - What about Margate?

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.520
 - Margate.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.360
 - Oh, God.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.880
 - I do like to be beside the seaside.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.720
 - Yeah.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.560
 - Absolutely.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.400
 - Also, the Libertyens live there, don't they?

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.240
 - They do.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.080
 - Oh, yeah.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:13.920
 - There you go.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.080
 - Yeah, no neighbors.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:15.920
 - He's a friend.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.920
 - He's a friend.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.760
 - He's a teen.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.760
 (laughing)

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.760
 - He's a light man.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.600
 (laughing)

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.760
 - That's really light man.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:27.560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.600
 and that is James.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.760
 - Okay, my fact this week is that one idea

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.640
 to block Russian expansion in Eastern Europe

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.120
 is to create a 500 mile long bog.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.880
 - That's, it's so such a cool idea.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.800
 - It's a amazing idea.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.080
 - Well, I'm a big fan of Pete and bogs.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.600
 - And the big enemy of Russia.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.600
 (laughing)

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.800
 - I'm favor a blocking Russian expansionism

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.000
 seems we've had a bit of that here.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.560
 - Well, actually, like this is kind of one point of it.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.720
 So this is an article that I read in the week,

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.880
 this week, and it's, it does two things

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.000
 that the EU is really trying to do at the moment.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.920
 And that's number one, stop Russia from going west,

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.000
 but also to stop climate change.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.840
 And bogs can do both of those.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.160
 - Yeah, 'cause if you get rid of a bog,

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.720
 it releases a lot of CO2, doesn't it?

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.040
 - Yeah, so if you make one, it stores CO2 back.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.240
 - So is this an extension of like trench warfare?

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.040
 So you do a sort of World War I style trench

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.840
 and then you fill it with Pete?

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.360
 - It's kind of-- - How are we doing this?

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.000
 - But you don't put any humans in it, I guess.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.320
 But basically, there's already a bog there.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.840
 - It's a kind of, it's a kind of phantom bog.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.760
 - It is a phantom bog. - It's a phantom bog.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.440
 - Well, it's, it kind of exists,

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.920
 but it doesn't exist as much as they want it to.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.000
 So at the moment, if you go from,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.480
 let's say you go from Helsinki,

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.520
 all the way down past the Baltic countries,

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.640
 and then towards Poland and wherever,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.840
 if you go on that line,

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.000
 there's a huge sort of boggy area that goes down there,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.920
 but what they're gonna try and do is make it more

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.400
 and more boggy. - Can I ask who they are?

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.560
 - NATO. - NATO, so it's NATO,

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.400
 but it's also the governments of Estonia,

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.440
 Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.840
 And what they're trying to do is put more and more water there,

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.720
 more and more peat there,

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.640
 so that if anyone tries to come across, it's very difficult.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.240
 And that's something that's happened in history in warfare,

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.480
 that you basically, you water a log an area,

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.640
 and so just can't get past it.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.440
 - And what's really lucky is it says by chance almost,

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.240
 all of these boggy areas are on the border,

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.320
 but they're on NATO side of the border outside of Russia.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.840
 So you've got, as James says,

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.520
 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, it's all running down,

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.920
 but they wouldn't have to go into Russia in order to build these bogs.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.200
 So what sort of they can just do it?

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.600
 - I love how we go friendly this is.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.440
 This is cool. - Yeah.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.280
 - And even better, Kaliningrad,

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.240
 which is like this little X-clave of Russia,

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.400
 so it's still part of Russia, but it's not attached.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:43.320
 And Belarus, which is like a real ally of Russia at the moment,

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.200
 there's a big old bog in between those places as well.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.360
 So it's like a really different,

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.640
 that would be a really obvious place for an attack to happen

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.320
 because you could put your troops into Belarus,

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.760
 and you could go through Kaliningrad,

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.040
 but actually there's a bog there, so you can't get through.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.400
 And dare I say, maybe this is going to sound very stupid,

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.040
 but it almost makes you think that that's why the borders

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.200
 were drawn there in the first place?

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.600
 - You're probably right. - Yeah, okay.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Maybe here.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.720
 - It's not a coincidence that the bog is up there.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's almost like

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.880
 in the head going down it.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.880
 - Damn it, it's an idiot.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.360
 - But it's really fascinating,

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.040
 'cause lots of this land, the reason I say it's a phantom bog,

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.720
 is that it's been drained.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.520
 There are ditches that have been cut,

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.840
 and then the wet, watery mass of this land drains away,

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.000
 and the bog dries out. - 'Cause they try to reclaim it

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.640
 for years, for centuries, I'm saying.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.320
 - For agricultural purposes, you know,

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.320
 it means you can expand your farming land.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:34.040
 And so all you need to do really is to stop draining them,

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.120
 and block up the drainage ditches,

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.880
 and then a couple of years later, you have a bog,

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.400
 and there are all sorts of arguments going on about,

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.880
 well, the farmers won't be very happy with this,

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.320
 and they might need some kind of subsidies,

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.800
 so I don't, it's not being hugely enacted,

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.960
 but one of the guys proposing it is a guy called Hans Yuston,

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.880
 who is known as the Peteland Pope.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.400
 I just like him so much.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.240
 - Yeah.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.080
 - Is that, is our bogs a solution to every problem?

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.040
 - It's pretty much, yeah, yeah.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.800
 - Have we considered a bog?

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.400
 - Yeah.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.880
 - Yeah, so it's fascinating.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.040
 And this was done at the start of the war in Ukraine,

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.000
 as the Ukrainian army, they blew up a dam,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.240
 which turned the whole of this Irpan river basin

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.600
 into a massive expanse of bogs and marshes,

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.760
 and it turned the area into what one defense consultant

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.000
 called an impossible turd.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.680
 It just means you cannot drive a tank through that, right?

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:22.680
 And actually also Russia did the same in, in Zaporizia,

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.240
 and they blew up another dam to stop the counter-offensive

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.720
 of Ukraine, so both sides are blowing them up,

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:33.120
 and also both of those dams were also blown up during World War II,

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.240
 when Germany attacked and went towards Russia.

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.600
 This exact same thing happened where they tried to stop

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.880
 the Germans by blowing up these two particular one

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.320
 on the Dnieper and one on the Irpan rivers.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:49.320
 - Can I ask, why are bogs not defeatable to most modern armies?

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.240
 - The tanks can't get through them.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.360
 - Yeah, they can't support the wage.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.240
 - No one's invented a thing that can just go,

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.120
 let's ride over the bogs.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.120
 - Erroplanes?

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.240
 - Erroplanes.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.560
 - We have not considered an airplane.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.560
 (all laughing)

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.840
 - No, like, you can get through the bogs,

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.000
 but it just slows you right.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:07.840
 - Yeah.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.680
 - Yeah.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.960
 - And when you're being slowed down,

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.040
 you're more of a city duck.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.200
 - Yeah, and it forces you into a narrow path through the bog,

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.960
 for example, and then your enemy can just focus

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.400
 their fire on that narrow path.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.240
 - Yeah.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.160
 - So you sort of canalize your opponent.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.240
 - Yeah, it's pretty amazing, isn't it?

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.240
 - It is, and the bog might be a huge contributor to this.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.720
 - And like Andy says, it's like,

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.880
 it's not really happening that much in the moment,

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.720
 but in Finland, there isn't in Poland, it is.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.720
 So Finland have started reclaiming their bogs

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.720
 for this specific reason in Poland as well.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.640
 So yeah, it is happening.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.480
 - And it's also just from a sort of purely philosophical

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.920
 perspective, always very comforting when the solution

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.320
 is like organic, as opposed to, it's like,

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.960
 you know what's gonna defeat AI, bogs?

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.200
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.920
 It's like for the whole of 20th century, it was barbed wire.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.400
 But we had bogs all along.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.600
 - You're absolutely right.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.960
 Do you know what percentage of greenhouse gases

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.600
 going into the atmosphere are due to degraded peatlands?

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.760
 - Oh my god, Andy, I think you're gonna tell us.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.680
 (laughing)

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.520
 - I guess you're guessing.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.200
 - Welcome to Quiz Corner, Andy.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.520
 So this is one of your quizzes,

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.400
 so let me just guess another two more than 100, isn't it?

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.440
 - Yeah, I'm gonna say 38%.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.280
 - Oh.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.760
 - Because 38% is my official number now

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.400
 that that was the answer to a quiz question

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.920
 about how much urine was in the international space.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.600
 - I'm gonna go it, she's 51%.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.880
 (laughing)

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.080
 - To be completely honest, I was gonna say 51 as well.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.440
 Can you ask the question again?

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.040
 - What percentage of greenhouse gases

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.400
 going into the atmosphere?

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.720
 - I think it must be much lower than

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.120
 - I do to degraded peatlands.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.800
 - And I'm gonna be honest with you, I'll go.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.880
 - If it was 38% or 51% of all greenhouse gases

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.360
 being due to degraded peatlands,

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.200
 I think we might have got more of a move

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.920
 on to solve the problem before now.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.080
 (laughing)

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.200
 - You've gotta realize that in these quizzes,

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.920
 sometimes callbacks is more important

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.240
 and getting answered, right?

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:57.000
 - I'm so sorry, and I think that's an unfair clue

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.440
 to the final person in the quiz.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.400
 Olga, would you like to guess maybe the 80%

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.680
 of all greenhouse gases due to degraded peatlands?

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.200
 - I'm gonna throw in 11.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.440
 - Well, you're closest.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:12.440
 It's 4 to 5, not 45, otherwise 51 would have rocked home.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.800
 - Yeah, but it is double flight.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.080
 It's double all flights happening around the world.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.160
 All hundreds of thousands of flights happening,

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.880
 you know, every day is due to degraded peatlands.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.720
 That's crazy.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.240
 - And you know what's bad for it?

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.640
 - What, mushrooms.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.000
 - Is that so?

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.800
 - I do not like mushrooms.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.640
 It has been long set on this podcast,

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.080
 but in the UK.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:34.920
 - May trip.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.640
 (laughing)

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.520
 - In the UK, the mushrooms that you eat

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.800
 are made using peat that has been dug up from peatlands.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.120
 They have to basically put the peat on top of their,

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.880
 like little bodies of mushrooms

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.400
 and that's what helps them to fruit

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.400
 and that's what helps you to get them.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.560
 And the UK mushroom industry

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.600
 gives the equivalent emissions

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.560
 of more than 2,600 cars.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.400
 - Okay.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.080
 - Someone took down the UK mushroom industry.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.360
 - Big mushroom, yeah.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.360
 - I will say quite a small number of cars, is it?

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.200
 - Well, all mushrooms.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.480
 - I only have one car.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.640
 - Yeah, no, fair enough, fair enough.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.600
 - No, but like, obviously it is bad

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.280
 to take peats out of areas

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.120
 because it takes a long time to get them back.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.240
 So I think they are looking to find other ways

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.000
 to make mushrooms rather than using peats.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.840
 - That's great.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.840
 - Am I correct in thinking

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.360
 that they used to use it for whiskey and they stopped, right?

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.320
 - They did that, I think they might still use it.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.800
 - I think it's now a significantly smaller amount

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.800
 from what I, yeah.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.160
 - Interesting, 'cause everyone's gonna go peat-free

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.240
 in terms of compost for your garden.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.720
 You can still buy peat stuff,

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.360
 but there's been a big campaign saying,

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.240
 "Can you use some peat-free?"

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.080
 - Yeah.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:48.920
 - Comprehensive, you can't get.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.760
 So I didn't know that about the mushrooms.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.600
 - That's very cool.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.720
 - Have you guys heard about the 40 acre bog?

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.840
 - 40 acre bog.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.680
 - Yeah, no.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.520
 - 40 acre bog.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.320
 This is in Lake Chippewa, which is in Wisconsin.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.720
 So this was a lake that was created in the 1920s.

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.920
 They flooded a swamp in order to do it.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:08.920
 And as a result of it, this bog formed, that's 40 acres

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.920
 and it sort of sits in the middle of the lake,

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.560
 but it moves around.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.560
 - A bog in the middle of a lake.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.520
 - Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.520
 So it's got sort of mud plains underneath it.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.280
 And on top, it's very grassy

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.920
 and it's got a few trees like thin trees sticking out.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.040
 - I have seen this.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.640
 - Yeah, it's pretty amazing because it's transient.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.680
 It moves around all the time.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.240
 So what happens is there's a bridge

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.720
 that goes over the lake

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.400
 and this bog keeps coming towards the bridge.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.160
 And so what they do is they get all the boats

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.960
 and they line up against the bog

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.520
 and they shove it back out of the way.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.920
 They all drive the bog.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.760
 - Yeah.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.600
 - It's like an annual thing.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.200
 They have to do, they have to push the bog.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.840
 - Yeah, and it's not consistent.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.760
 They have to check every morning

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.000
 that the bog isn't making its way back over it.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.800
 - How's that even work?

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.800
 - I know, it's wild, isn't it?

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.560
 If you've seen images of it, it's pretty cool.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:52.400
 - It's stunning.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.240
 - It's absolutely stunning.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.000
 - So it doesn't, I assume it doesn't go that deep

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.920
 into the water if it's movable.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.360
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, it's not very far down.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.520
 - It's just floating, Pete.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.920
 - It's floating matter.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.080
 - That is so cool.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.320
 Does anyone know where is the world's biggest bog?

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.240
 It's somewhere that's been mentioned

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.440
 on this podcast already.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.600
 - Okay, okay.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.280
 - It's okay.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.200
 - Will it be somewhere,

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.520
 I'm gonna guess somewhere in Eastern Europe,

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.640
 somewhere like Belarus.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.720
 - You're close.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.560
 It's Russia.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.400
 - Okay.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.560
 - It's the great.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.360
 - I mean, if you have that much land mass,

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.640
 statistically speaking.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:26.640
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.720
 - It's the great Vazugian Maya, it's in Siberia

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.640
 and it is twice the size of Wales.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.640
 - Goodness.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.640
 - But again, to Russia, that's nothing.

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.160
 'Cause they've got areas, the size of Wales coming out.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.480
 There is.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.400
 And it comes from melting permafrost, basically.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.840
 So the water, melts from the permafrost,

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.480
 goes into this area and becomes a marshy land.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.200
 And the worst thing about it is the flies and midges

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.520
 that live there.

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.560
 If you ask locals, they say that there's so many midges

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.480
 they can drink enough blood from a random traveler

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.560
 that they will die of midge bites.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.240
 - Oh, the traveler will die.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.320
 Not the midge dies of.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.640
 - No, they'll have in a great time.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.480
 - Okay.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.320
 - Yeah.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.320
 - But yeah, that's what they say.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.600
 And there is no doubt there is a lot of midges there,

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.120
 but whether they can actually drain you

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.200
 of all your blood, I think probably not.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.720
 But anyone who works there has to wear

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.120
 like hazmat suit solvast or like beekeeper suits

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.720
 so that they don't get bitten.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.920
 - Oh, not for me.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:22.760
 - Man.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.600
 - No, not for me.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.720
 I don't even like one midge.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.360
 - Now, we all know Ireland.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.960
 - Oh, I love him.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.800
 - Yeah.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.040
 - How many Walesers is that?

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.640
 - They've got vast piti areas.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.480
 - They do.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.320
 - Okay.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.480
 - But how many Irish people, according to the latest census,

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.600
 heat their homes by burning peat?

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.960
 - 51.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.800
 - Okay.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.640
 - 38.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.480
 - Two.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.960
 - It's 68,000.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.800
 - Wow.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.800
 - 68,000.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.640
 - Wow.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.800
 - And I would have thought.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.640
 - Yeah, for sure.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.920
 - I thought we were doing percentages.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.080
 I don't think.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.240
 (laughing)

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.080
 - Sorry.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.080
 - Well, there's one percent of the population,

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.080
 so you're not far off.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:01.920
 - Is it really?

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.760
 - Yeah.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.760
 - They've got these raised bogs.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.600
 - Thank you.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.400
 - But there are some bog bastards as I'm calling them.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.240
 - Bogdas.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.080
 - It's okay.

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:09.920
 (laughing)

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:10.920
 - Is that an official tab, or is it?

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.760
 - For majors.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.120
 - That's an AHM original.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.520
 But those are people who aren't

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.080
 sneakily cutting special conservation areas of bogs.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.600
 Because a lot of these bogs are now protected.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.600
 - From a scientific viewpoint,

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.640
 why would I burn peat over wood?

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.000
 - Is it, does it burn longer?

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.640
 - I think just there's loads of peat around.

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.480
 - Oh, okay.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.480
 - I think it would burn longer.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.320
 - Oh, would it?

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.160
 - I think so, yeah.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.000
 - Right.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.760
 - I think it kind of turns more carbon, doesn't it?

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.600
 - Mmm.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:32.440
 - I'm pretty sure.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.520
 - Those bogs in Ireland is where you would find

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.480
 Tories speaking of bog bastards.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.400
 (laughing)

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.240
 - I don't know.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.120
 - So Tories, I think as we've said before,

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:44.120
 was an old sort of word for an outlaw in Ireland,

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.560
 especially a Roman Catholic one.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.200
 They would call them Tories.

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.840
 And then eventually it became,

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.240
 I can't remember how it became a word for conservatives,

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.200
 but it's always that word's from.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.040
 - Yeah, it's originally--

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.840
 - It's fascinating.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.240
 - But yeah, they would live in the bogs,

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.080
 these outlaws, and then they would come

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.400
 and attack your sheep and stuff.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.440
 - Wow.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.000
 - We've got peat and Margate.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:04.840
 - Happy?

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.680
 - Yeah, peat talkative.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.520
 (cheering)

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.120
 - A lot of annoying me all the time, eh?

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.280
 - Yeah, here we go.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.640
 - That's number one comedy podcast.

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.480
 (laughing)

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.320
 - In the end.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.900
 (upbeat music)

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:19.600
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.000
 and that is Andy.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.480
 - My fact is, when the first ever online pizza delivery

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:28.680
 was made, a hundred journalists turned up to report on it.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.520
 The driver got lost.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.800
 It took an hour to deliver,

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.120
 and the pizza was long cold.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:32.960
 - Wow.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.720
 - So this is something that was printed in the LA Times

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.720
 in 1994, which I love to read.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:41.320
 - Well, only a few months before TLC released

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.400
 Crazy Sexy Cool.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.960
 - It's the 1994 podcast.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:44.800
 - Yeah.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.640
 - It really is.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.960
 - Clive Davis was the one to order the pizza

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.000
 to sort of try and get out of the hospital situation.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:50.840
 - Please help.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.920
 (laughing)

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.760
 - It's typing.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:57.120
 - Yeah, there was this article headline,

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.800
 online pizza idea is clever,

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:02.040
 but only half-baked, brilliant.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.080
 And it was by Pizza Hut, giants of the scene.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.400
 - Oh, they always do stuff like that.

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.240
 - They always do stuff like that.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.720
 - But this one was genuinely an innovation.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.960
 So they launched the thing called Pizza Net.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.480
 It was in Santa Cruz,

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.880
 and I think this was hosted at the University

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.920
 of California, Santa Cruz.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.880
 Basically, no one had really tried,

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.840
 not many people had done e-commerce like this,

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.120
 especially not with a pizza.

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.480
 - It was not in 1994.

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.160
 - This is so long ago.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.280
 And you had to put in your stats.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.200
 You had to put in your order.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:31.280
 The data was then sent to Pizza Hut HQ in Kansas,

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.440
 quite a long way away.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:36.640
 It was relayed via a modem to your nearest Pizza Hut branch,

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.240
 who would then phone you up to check

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.720
 that you weren't pranking them.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.760
 And then eventually, after that had all been gone through,

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.280
 then they would start making you your pizza

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.800
 and deliver it to your home.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.880
 And they got a hundred journalists in

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:47.720
 to report on this.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.920
 - People had the internet by them.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.200
 I reckon it was about them.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.120
 I went to Georgiaal Bank,

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:57.440
 which is a big telescope in the north of England.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.840
 And that was the only place that had the internet.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.040
 - Yeah, that's like, I've never seen the internet.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.120
 - Did you go online?

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.240
 - Yeah, what did you do?

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.520
 I searched, I was really into fantasy football at the time.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.840
 So I searched for the word fantasy

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.040
 and got as a 14-year-old boy.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:12.880
 - Uh-oh.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.200
 - A lot of knowledge that I didn't wish previously had.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.040
 - Oh my gosh.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:16.880
 - Oh my gosh.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.720
 - Nice.

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.720
 - Did you have a Georgiaal Bank?

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.080
 (laughing)

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:28.240
 - Anyway, yeah.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.920
 - It is early internet, isn't it?

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.520
 And 94, that's when Amazon launched.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.360
 - Yeah, 95 is when eBay launched.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.440
 It's way older than I realised.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.640
 - There was almost nothing on the internet back then.

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.800
 Newspapers would run articles saying,

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.600
 "Here are the best websites to go to."

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.600
 Which I love.

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.800
 I think we could do with that again.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.640
 - Yeah.

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.640
 - 'Cause the internet's been sort of,

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.360
 it's like there are now only about what four websites now.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.720
 - I'm always looking for a new website.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.040
 I love a new website.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:52.880
 - What do you mean?

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.880
 - I want new cool stuff.

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.720
 - It used to be when I started working at QI

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.800
 that you could search for carrot facts

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.280
 and you would get a page of someone

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.400
 who really liked carrots, writing 20 incredible facts.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.240
 - That's what I want.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.080
 - Really well solved about carrots.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.240
 - In comic sands with like a sort of my spacey

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.080
 background of carrots.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.840
 - No, you put in carrot facts and AI goes.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.440
 - Did you know that carrots are all green?

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.160
 And you're like, "Oh right, are you sure?"

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.080
 I think they're orange.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:16.920
 Oh yes, they are.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.960
 Orange, I'm sorry about that.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.560
 - Wait, you guys are extremely smart.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.880
 This is unrelated to anything.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.040
 But can someone explain to me,

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.880
 I'm the one, the quote unquote tech person here.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.560
 Why can't it say I don't know?

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.800
 Why can't it say I don't know?

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.560
 And second, well, why can't it tell me where it got its knowledge?

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.480
 - 'Cause it's stolen from somewhere else

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.480
 and they don't want to reveal it?

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:36.800
 - Yeah, that's fair.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.440
 - I'm sure I can Google this.

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:39.960
 It would just be so much more reliable

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.960
 if it said I don't know.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.000
 - Wouldn't it be great?

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.920
 - But I'm not interested in making a better product.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:44.760
 Never mind.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.040
 - But don't you think that?

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.440
 That's just true of humans in general, right?

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.840
 So many people, if you ask them,

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.240
 especially people on the internet,

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.280
 if you ask them something,

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.640
 they'll just pretend they know the answer and say,

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.640
 "If we all learned how to say I don't know a bit more,

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.320
 then wouldn't the world be a better place?"

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.160
 I don't know.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.400
 Grubhub, have you heard of Grubhub?

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.240
 - Love Grubhub.

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.680
 It's like delivered food for Americans or something.

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.680
 - Yeah, I don't really know.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.720
 - Are we overpeats a hunt?

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.080
 I just have one more thing to say,

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.320
 which is I had assumed that hiring Gorbachev

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.720
 to be in one of their ads was the coolest thing

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.560
 they did in the '90s.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.880
 - Wow.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.680
 - Essentially, it's Gorbachev

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.200
 enjoying pizza at Pizza Hut.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.000
 And then different people at the restaurant

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.840
 are debating whether he's a good or bad guy.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:24.680
 - Right.

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.920
 - And the ending is, well, he's the one who brought pizza Hut.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:30.040
 So I guess the conclusion is that you can't beat Pizza Hut,

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.200
 but it was more nuanced in terms of where people were standing.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.040
 - Wow.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:34.880
 - Then you'd think.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.160
 - Pizza Hut in our times.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.040
 That's a joke about pizza in our time.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:38.880
 - Yeah.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.800
 - Which was something that Gorbachev didn't say.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.640
 - Yeah.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.120
 - That was another table in.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.360
 I felt us literally just moved to number two

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.240
 in the comedy challenge, so I said, I don't know.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.080
 Did you guys feel that?

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.120
 It's like a shudder pizza Hut in our times.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.520
 (laughing)

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.520
 - Ooh.

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.200
 Meanwhile at Parenting Pal, they're like,

00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.760
 "Oh, did you feel that?

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.240
 "I just felt like we lifted you up."

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.120
 I think we've just done a terrible job.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.320
 - In my house, we grew up with a giant painting

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.400
 of Gorbachev on our lounge room wall.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.240
 - Yeah.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.080
 (laughing)

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.800
 - Again, I'm gonna say lie.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.040
 (laughing)

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:18.880
 - Is that true?

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.720
 - Yeah.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.600
 We had one of him and one of Chairman Mao.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.840
 - What?

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.920
 - Yeah, so it was knockoffs of Andy Warhol's collection

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.160
 of Pop Art, and they bought it in a market somewhere.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.800
 But I grew up with Gorbachev on my wall,

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.440
 wondering, who is this guy?

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.280
 Is he good or bad, you know?

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.120
 - Interesting.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.200
 - Do you know the pizza?

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.040
 - We grew up with this.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:39.880
 - Things had resolved that.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.600
 - Yeah, all you had to do was watch the ad.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.600
 - We grew up with a series of Russian leader

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.480
 themed matrioshka in my house.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.320
 - Ah, did you?

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.400
 - Yeah, you know the Russian dolls.

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.560
 The one on the outside was the biggest one.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.720
 - I have a name.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.400
 (laughing)

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.280
 - Lovely.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.640
 And we're back to number one.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.480
 (laughing)

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.640
 - That's good.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.440
 - The big one was it Stalin on the outside.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.200
 - The big one was the newest one

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.280
 who was Yeltsin at the time.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.120
 - Yeltsin.

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.120
 - And then it was going all the way back to London,

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:06.960
 I think.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:11.960
 - Grubhub is a food delivery system online, right?

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:15.040
 It was started by a guy called Colin Wallace

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.360
 and he was a school child

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.280
 and he wanted to get a sandwich to his classroom

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.240
 without the teacher noticing.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.880
 And so he created a computer program

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:27.680
 which took a text from his phone,

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.600
 sent it to a fax, which was delivered to a restaurant,

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.160
 and then they would send the sandwich to the classroom.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.440
 - Right, amazing.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.680
 - That's genius.

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.560
 - And then eventually sort of turn that into a much bigger thing

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:42.400
 and then got bought out by some squillianaires.

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.240
 But yeah.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.080
 - Okay.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:44.920
 - Are you the origin stories?

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.240
 - I don't know if you guys do business ideas here.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.680
 - Oh yeah, we're doing, we're doing.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.760
 None of them has taken off yet.

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.280
 - Okay, but like you know how there's like the founder movie,

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.240
 right, which is like for the MacDonald's founder movie,

00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.600
 like that type of thing.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.440
 Imagine with that, it would be like a Disney channel

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.240
 original founder movie about like a guy in school.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.080
 - Yeah.

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.320
 - Oh, that's a cute idea.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.520
 - Wouldn't that be so cute?

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.720
 - So you've come up with an idea for a cultural thing.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.560
 - Yes.

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.720
 - A movie pitch, don't worry, we do those too.

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.400
 - Okay, sorry, I take it back.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.320
 It wasn't a business idea.

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.320
 It was a business idea for us to make money off this movie.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.520
 - Yeah, it's a great, yeah.

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.360
 That's really good.

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.760
 - Like a kids founder movie.

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.520
 - It's like capitals for kids.

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.560
 - So what's it called?

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.400
 Grubhub.

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.720
 - It's something about sandwich, something about fax.

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:29.720
 - We can do this.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.560
 - We can definitely do this.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.640
 Come on guys, number one.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.160
 This is why we're number one.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.880
 (laughing)

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.880
 - Breadie steady go.

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:39.960
 - Breadie steady go.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:40.960
 - No.

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.800
 - For kids film.

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.640
 - It's like, yeah, it's gotta be like something about

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.640
 recess, school, a detention, but with bread in it.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:51.480
 - Just put the word bread into the word detention.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.320
 Yeah.

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.560
 (laughing)

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.520
 - Depredution.

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:58.840
 - The new number one, I don't know if you've got it.

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:01.080
 (laughing)

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.400
 - It's good to have something to be asked about

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.480
 in interviews on the press round.

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.880
 So how do we say the name of this?

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.400
 (laughing)

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.240
 How's it pronounced?

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.240
 - Depredution.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.160
 (laughing)

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.320
 - Podd you see?

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.360
 (laughing)

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.280
 - It's gonna be huge in Japan.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.320
 (laughing)

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.600
 - Oh, yeah.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.600
 - Yeah.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.440
 - Okay.

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.640
 - I'm so sorry.

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.200
 - That might be the one that takes off.

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.240
 (laughing)

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:30.040
 - Yeah, last week's Google for Smells did not go anywhere.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.120
 (laughing)

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.080
 So we're up for different ideas.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.920
 - Can I tell you guys about Jane Snowball?

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:36.760
 - Yeah.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.600
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.360
 - Okay, she was a 72 year old British woman

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.320
 and she did the first ever online grocery order.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.160
 In what year?

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.680
 - 1951.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:46.520
 (laughing)

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.520
 - 1951.

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.360
 (laughing)

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.360
 - 1938.

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:50.200
 (laughing)

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.520
 - You've got a real chance to score the triple here.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:53.360
 (laughing)

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.840
 - Okay, I'm going in '96.

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.200
 - '96, it's 1984.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.200
 And this is insane.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.480
 - Wow, but you said she was in her seventies?

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.320
 - Yes.

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.160
 - Wow.

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.040
 It was simply the end user of the product.

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.280
 She had very little to do with the development.

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.120
 (laughing)

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:07.960
 - I'm sorry.

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:11.720
 - But I still think in your seventies at that time.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.560
 - That's true.

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.600
 - It's gonna be tough to use new technology.

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.440
 - Absolutely.

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.080
 - No offense to anyone in the seventies,

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.760
 but like it's become more difficult

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:19.600
 to get older.

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.440
 - But she's 72.

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.680
 This is 1984.

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.240
 This is a long time ago.

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.080
 - Well hang on.

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:24.920
 - That's when I was born.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.760
 It's not that long.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.600
 - It is a lot.

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.440
 - Imagine that.

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.560
 - No one has the internet in their homes.

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:29.400
 - Yeah.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.400
 - You know.

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.240
 - Basically.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.240
 - It's my entire time we're speaking.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.480
 I'm trying to put the word sub into CEO.

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:38.000
 (laughing)

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 - Is it fitting?

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.680
 (laughing)

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.640
 - Sorry.

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.000
 - Keep working on it Olga.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:45.840
 But it's, I'll tell you.

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:46.680
 - If I look distracts.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.880
 - I'll tell these guys.

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.400
 But basically, she lived in Gateshead.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.280
 She had a bad hips.

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:52.560
 She couldn't get to the shops.

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.880
 And there was this thing being run by Gateshead Council

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:57.240
 called the Gateshead Shopping Experiment.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.720
 And this developer, Michael Aldrich,

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.160
 set up a thing where she could use

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:06.160
 her TV to get access to every huge number of shops.

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.360
 - And I could tell it actually.

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:08.200
 - It's something.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.040
 - Kind of.

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.880
 I'm slightly struggling with how exactly it worked.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.840
 'Cause I don't think she was pressing her screen.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.080
 She shouldn't have been anyway.

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.080
 But it allowed her to go through every product

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:19.400
 that the shops had and order via her telly.

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.680
 It was unbelievably advanced at the time.

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.800
 - Do we now have a name for the boy?

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.640
 - For what?

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.480
 - The boy in the film.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.320
 - Yeah.

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.960
 - He was called Colin Wallace.

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.120
 - Wallace.

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:29.960
 - Greg's Wallace.

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.040
 - I don't know if it's like Walson Grame,

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.880
 but the grame has to be bread.

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.680
 - Wallace and Grubhub.

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.520
 - Grubhub.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.960
 - Wallace and Grady bread.

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.360
 - No, keep going.

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.680
 - Grain Hill.

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.760
 - Grain Hill.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.720
 - 'Cause it's Grange Hill.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.560
 - He's good.

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.400
 - He's actually good.

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.960
 - School-based thing.

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:46.960
 - We can go on that.

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:47.800
 - No, no, no.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.640
 - So sorry.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.240
 - We'll get it eventually.

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.640
 We would usually move on, but it's such a good idea.

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.680
 (laughing)

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:58.520
 - Podcast@QI.com, send in your titles for

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.040
 The Bread Based.

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.400
 - Disney Channel Original Movie.

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.240
 - What's it about?

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.080
 Oh, the Grubhub.

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.240
 - Yeah, CEO.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.400
 - Teen CEO of Grubhub.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.240
 - Inventor, yes.

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.800
 Yeah.

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.920
 Should we wrap up soon?

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:10.760
 - Yeah.

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.600
 - All right, here's a quiz.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.200
 What was the first thing sold securely on the internet?

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.560
 It's also 1994.

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.400
 - Yeah.

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.040
 - It's about 10 days before the pizza idea was launched.

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.440
 - The first thing ever sold on eBay

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.080
 was a broken laser pointer.

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:21.920
 - Very good.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:22.760
 - I know that.

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:23.840
 - But this was before that, right?

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.200
 - Yeah, it's the first time anyone bought anything

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.600
 that was properly with secure data.

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.560
 So previously, people had used our penet

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.200
 to buy and sell weed, things like that.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.720
 But that was just arranging a meeting place.

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.880
 That's not properly an online transaction.

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.600
 - Was it an OASIS album?

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.440
 1994?

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.040
 - It's an album.

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:41.880
 - Oh.

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.720
 - Okay.

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.680
 - It's not CLC's crazy sexy cool, is it?

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:45.520
 - No.

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.640
 - Is it someone from the '90s?

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.600
 - I'd say so.

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:49.840
 He's still alive.

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.800
 - I know the answer to this,

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.120
 I'm bowing out of the course.

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:52.960
 - Oh, okay.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.240
 Brian Adams?

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.080
 - Oh, good guess.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:55.920
 - Good answer.

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:56.760
 - Good guess.

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.120
 - I'm just transporting it to '94.

00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.600
 - Not bad.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.520
 Who else is?

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.520
 - Meatloaf.

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.240
 - British?

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.520
 There's no way of saying it without you immediately.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.360
 - Else a job.

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.400
 - He likes having sex for a really long time.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.240
 - Rod's doing?

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:14.040
 (laughing)

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.080
 - With his wife, Trudy Styler.

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:16.920
 - Yeah.

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:17.760
 - Is it stink?

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:18.600
 - It's stink.

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.120
 It was Sting's album, 10 Summoner's Tales.

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:25.240
 And it was a guy called Phil Brandon Berger.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.080
 Phil Adolfier.

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:30.680
 - This weirdly, this fact unites all of our facts today.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.080
 Because it was bought in 1994.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:34.920
 - Yeah.

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:35.920
 - That's TLC.

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:39.640
 It was the first major hit he had since his previous hit,

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.240
 which was called "Rushens."

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.400
 - Uh-huh.

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.240
 - Very nice.

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.400
 And the title of the album, what was it Andy?

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.760
 - 10 Summoner's Tales.

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.600
 - It's a pun.

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.440
 - Is it a pun?

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:49.280
 - It's a pun.

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.280
 - His surname is Sumner, isn't it?

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.160
 - His surname is Sumner, and it is a pun on the Canterbury Tales

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.000
 of which there was a character called Sumner.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.040
 So it's got a pun, it's got Russia,

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.000
 and it's got 1994, the release of TLC.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.480
 - Damn, and the show now, that's amazing.

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.080
 - That's like, that's a bravier.

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.280
 That's a now-you-see-me-three level.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.120
 - Yeah.

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.280
 (laughing)

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.120
 - Oh, bravier.

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:08.960
 - And that's a compliment.

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.860
 (upbeat music)

00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:17.160
 - Okay, that's it.

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.120
 That is all of our facts.

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.560
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.480
 - If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.160

 I'm on @Shrybeland on Instagram, James.

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.760
 - Come find me on TikTok.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:32.080
 No, so you think it's James Harkin?

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:32.920

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:35.280

 - Everywhere at Koga 300.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.200
 - Yeah, nice.

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.240
 And you've just announced a tour, haven't you?

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.000
 - Yes, I'm touring my new show, Fat Tom Cruise,

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.040
 all around the world.

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:44.880
 - You're so good at titles.

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.280
 What the hell happened in the show?

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.120
 (laughing)

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.800
 - Goodbye, take us to my tour at rock and rollga.com.

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.680
 - Lovely, cool, yeah, and if you want to get through

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.840
 to us with anything that we've said

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.480
 as a group on this podcast, podcast at QY.

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.200
 - Guys, dough, dough is money.

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.040
 - Oh, yes.

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.000
 - But dough is bread.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.320
 - Yes, dough boy.

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.240
 - Dan!

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.360
 Oh my god.

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.360
 - So boy.

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.600
 - Oh my god, that's so good, sorry.

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.960
 Oh my god, last second.

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:09.960
 (laughing)

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.600
 - No need to write it now.

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.880
 - Yeah, do not write in any more.

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:15.360
 (laughing)

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.480
 Olga saved the day.

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.440
 But if you want to talk about anything else but that,

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.840
