00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
 (phone ringing)

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.500
 - Hey, I don't want that.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.500
 I don't want that.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.080
 (upbeat music)

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.940
 - Hi.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.780
 - Hello, Man.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.620
 - Hi, guys.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.100
 Welcome to Drop of the Line.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.380
 And welcome you to Drop of the Line.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.700
 Patreon's and Apple subscribers,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.300
 because you're all hearing this,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.100
 and some of you are able to see it too.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.940
 - Yeah.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.060
 - So there might be some physical bits of business

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.180
 we throw in, and it might take a shirt off,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.380
 and it might, so welcome to Drop of the Line.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.940
 I'll fortnightly audience feedback special.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.940
 We've been promoted.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.120
 (laughing)

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.060
 - This is huge, the network won more of us.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.900
 - It's great stuff.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.740
 - Wonderful.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.740
 - I mean, we did the promoting.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.420
 - Who do we have to sleep with together?

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.260
 (laughing)

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.700
 - Each other, it turned out.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.860
 - The worrying thing is when we get canceled.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.860
 - Oh yeah.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.860
 (laughing)

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.300
 - I don't you worry, there's plenty of stuff in here

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.540
 that is going to get us canceled.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.020
 - What would you say about the mailbox this month?

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.940
 - It's been absolutely bulging.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.780
 - Right.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.600
 - I've had to print two separate documents.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.440
 - A bunch.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.660
 (laughing)

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.740
 - Has anyone ever told you about copy paste?

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.100
 You can put two things in one document.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.940
 - Yeah.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.780
 - There's just so much.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.740
 - Have you heard about font sizes as well?

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.020
 - So hello, welcome to Drop of the Line.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.020
 We're going to do the audience feedback,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.060
 and we got some great stuff.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.900
 - Yeah.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.740
 - Let's do it.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.500
 - Let's start off with just with an,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.940
 and I'm actually, actually this is off the back

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.060
 of last month's Drop of the Line.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.820
 You and Taylor writes, on the October Drop of the Line,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.500
 James stated that he did not think

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.520
 that the song Chocolate Salty Balls

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.500
 got to number one in the charts.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.460
 Just to correct this, it was indeed a number one single.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.700
 It missed out on the coveted Christmas number one,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.540
 1998.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.820
 - This is by Scales.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.340
 - With.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.180
 - To become one.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.340
 - Goodbye.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.180
 - Okay, bye.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.940
 (laughing)

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.020
 - However, it would reach number one,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.900
 the following week, where it remained for just one week

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.780
 before being knocked off the top spot by.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.100
 - Oh, good grief.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.100
 - What year are we talking?

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.180
 - 1998, and now maybe 1999.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.420
 - Smash mouth?

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.580
 - Steps.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.700
 - Oh, I said I've got it.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.380
 Okay, 1998 steps.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.300
 Oh, stump or chain reaction.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.940
 - I can't beat a slash tragedy.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.780
 - Really?

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.260
 - Oh, wow.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.100
 - Huh.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.260
 - I'm verified.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.260
 - I'm verified this.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.060
 - And how did Smash mouth do?

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.380
 - You and doesn't relate, I'm so sorry.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.500
 So there you go.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.460
 It was the biggest selling Christmas number two

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.460
 since Wams last Christmas.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.380
 - Wow.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.180
 - And Christmas number two brings us to Mr. Hanky,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.260
 the Christmas poo.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.100
 - Perfect.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.940
 - There we go.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.780
 - Perfect.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.620
 - No, I do remember, like I remembered very clearly

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.980
 the time of Chuck the Salty Balls when it came out.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.300
 I was working in a hotel and it was lots of Christmas parties

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.220
 and we used to play it every single night.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.540
 And I remember really hoping that it would get to number one

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.140
 and then being beaten by the Spice Girls for Christmas.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.740
 And then of course, no one really cares

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.940
 about the first week after Christmas number one.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.060
 No one really thinks about that much.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.300
 - What a shame.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.700
 - It's sort of like the new year.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.380
 It's like this bringing in the year.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.220
 - Yeah, but what happened?

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.020
 - The 12th night number one.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.860
 It's very important.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.340
 - What happens is everyone,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.820
 the amount of money people used to spend on singles

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.620
 the week before Christmas,

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.620
 it clips every other week in the year.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.580
 And then when you got to the first week in January,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.620
 quite a lot of sort of rock bands and indie bands

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.980
 will bring singles out because they knew

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.540
 that no one was buying music then

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.900
 and they could get higher in the charts.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.900
 - That's the time.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.900
 - Done with the days of sales.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.900
 - Family days.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.700
 - Yeah, they were.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.700
 - Happy days, well.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.700
 - Apologies, you and.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.700
 - Yeah, sorry about that.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.540
 - I'm sorry about that.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.180
 And in fairness, Dan, you actually messaged me

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.500
 and said, yeah, you got that wrong James.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.340
 - Well, and because it was part of the last duel.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.620
 Yeah, so the issue, and this is just for all the listeners,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.220
 sometimes if we get something very slightly wrong in a duel,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.820
 you know, what do you do, chop the whole segment?

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.220
 That was a big segment or callbacks all the way through.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.780
 And so I knew someone would write in

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.420
 that we could readdress it on a further one.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.580
 So, yeah.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.420
 - Very clever.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.660
 - Yeah, it was an unfortunate one.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.900
 I don't ever want to do that again.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.980
 - Look what's happened.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.700
 James is having a sit here, defend himself.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.700
 - We're daggers drawn.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.580
 - No, I don't know if you remember.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.540
 We had Ella Alshamahi on a few weeks ago.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.380
 - Oh, yeah.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.220
 - Of course.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.540
 - How would we forget?

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.620
 - I don't know.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.580
 - I don't know if this tickles the old brain bug.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.580
 (laughing)

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.740
 We have one of dad's old friends and someone we've all known

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.580
 for many years.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.420
 - She won.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.420
 - She was great.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.340
 But she led to a lot of correspondence.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.180
 - Okay.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.780
 - So about half the correspondence from that show

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.300
 is about Hobbits.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.140
 - Oh.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.540
 - 'Cause we mentioned the homo floresiensis

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.940
 who are clearly Hobbits.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.220
 - They were giving the nickname Hobbits.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.060
 - Yeah.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.900
 - And yeah.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.980
 - So I'm gonna jump in here and suggest

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.700
 that the correspondence might not be so much

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.900
 about the ancient hominids and more about the tedious novels.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.740
 - It is universally about the tedious novels.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.140
 (laughing)

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.820
 So correction, this isn't, I'm actually from David Spraklin,

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.380
 who writes, the idea that Hobbits have big feet

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.660
 is a fan idea not supported or rejected really

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.140
 by Tolkien's actual words.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.100
 So he's just silent on the size of their feet.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.620
 They are hairy and the only one whose feet are mentioned

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.580
 is smegol, but he was likely a store

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.620
 which isn't a race of Hobbits from the Shire.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.260
 Those would be half-fits and fallow hides, okay?

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.980
 So can we just please put this to bed, this myth.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.020
 - That they had big feet.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.020
 - Yeah.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.380
 It just doesn't say, but apparently it's just a fan idea

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.220
 that's taken off.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.220
 - Did the novels say that they had big penises

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.780
 and people have said, you know what?

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.140
 They say about people with big penises.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.980
 (laughing)

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.900
 - Tolkien is very clear in his concerning Hobbit section.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:45.740
 - Yeah.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.140
 - They're all packing.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.420
 - It's a lot dirtier than we realized.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.260
 - We've had a couple more.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.420
 We've had one from Dan Connolly,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.620
 who writes about the lawsuits over the word Hobbit,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.660
 which is, you know.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.380
 - Yeah, 'cause it's okay.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.300
 So the guy who effectively discovered the homophlerentices,

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.740
 or however that's pronounced,

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.540
 then called it Hobbit and went on a tour

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.820
 and the estate got in touch saying,

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.100
 you can't call it a Hobbit.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.540
 - So that's right, isn't it?

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.380
 - Yes.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.060
 - Well, the people who did Dungeons and Dragons,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.420
 those books, they had to change,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.940
 they put in Hobbit and End and Balrog and Warg,

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.580
 and they had to change all those.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.220
 - 'Cause the estate, I presume, was still pretty active.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.060
 - It's interesting,

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.260
 'cause all the words have been invented prior to,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.140
 or at least Hobbit was certainly used prior to--

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.140
 - This is what Dan Connolly says.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.420
 - The Hobbit is in a list of fairies from the 1850s,

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.060
 that Warg, only Balrog of those,

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.020
 is an invention of Tolkien arguably.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.380
 And that list of fairies includes names for Will of the Wisps.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.580
 - You know, the sort of,

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.420
 phantom lights in marshes, or whatever.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.740
 Names for them include Melch Dick,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.260
 Sponks, Dicker Tuesdays, and Meg with the Wads.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.900
 - That's very funny.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.500
 I must have said this on the show,

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.660
 but Sponk used to mean just any kind of light.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.300
 - Hey. - Oh yeah.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.540
 - Because in Ulysses, I think,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.660
 or at least in one of James Joyce's books,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.860
 I was reading it, and when my daughter was born

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.500
 to try and stay awake, which did not work very well.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.500
 But it says that he created a Sponk and passed it to me

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.220
 or something like that when he's lighting a cigarette.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.500
 - So Sponky does feel like you're saying

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.540
 you've got like a bright energy about you.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.300
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.620
 Sorry, why don't you try and keep yourself awake

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.820
 when your daughter's born rather than trying

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.060
 to desperately claw back every second of sleep?

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.300
 - Because my wife was sleeping at that period,

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.060
 and I needed to stay awake to make sure

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.700
 that my child didn't die.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.500
 And so one of us was always awake.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.820
 - And you thought I'll read one of the most

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.940
 legendarily difficult and boring texts.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.180
 (laughing)

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.420
 - Yeah, it was a mistake.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.260
 What am I going to say?

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.220
 - Were we doing that fact, that week?

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.940
 - No, no. - Right, we just had it in the shelf, right?

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.780
 - No, I'm the same.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.020
 When my first child was born,

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.300
 I read the phone book to try and keep myself awake.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.300
 It just didn't work.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.420
 - It's so night.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.260
 - It's so night.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.940
 - How is your child, Aaron?

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.460
 (laughing)

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.820
 - Aaron A. Aaronson.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.260
 (laughing)

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.100
 - He's doing great.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.980
 - So another thing on the Hobbit Penguin thing.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.020
 You remember there were giant penguins and tiny cows

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.300
 and miniature people and all that.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.940
 We've had an email from Thomas Halliday,

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.500
 the paleontologist.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.780
 - Oh, yeah.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.620
 - I know.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.460
 - Of the author?

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.300
 - Yes.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.620
 - Of other lands?

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.980
 - I don't know which books he's written, but it might be, yeah.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.140
 But no, it is him.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.140
 - Yeah.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.740
 - He says, yes, there were big penguins in the past.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:35.820
 And he emphasizes were.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.180
 And frankly, they could have given Kylie a piggyback.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.460
 - Oh, okay.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.940
 - As we said, they were about the height of Kylie,

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.780
 the giant penguin.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.620
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.660
 So that was a little bit of a mistake, I would say,

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.020
 but I know of a generalization,

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.900
 which we said that they were the size of penguins,

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.300
 by which we meant they were 1.1 meters tall,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.380
 which is about the same as a giant penguin,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.340
 or an emperor penguin,

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.820
 which is the one you think of when you say penguins.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.420
 But actually, of course, there's loads of different types

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.740
 of penguins and they come in all sorts of different sizes.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.460
 - And I think Kylie Minogue is taller than 1.1 meters,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.380
 but that is really, really, really small, isn't it?

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.660
 - That would be small, yeah.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.180
 That's in fact the height of my three-year-old.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.780
 - She has been 1.1 meters at some point in her life,

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.620
 Kylie Minogue.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.460
 - Yes.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.940
 - She's been all heights up to at least five foot.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:22.780
 - Up to where she is now.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:23.620
 - Yes.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.620
 - And maybe a bit beyond,

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.260
 because as you get older, you do shrink a bit, don't you?

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.100
 - What a great,

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.540
 'cause she started so young in her career

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.420
 that is an actual unit of measurement,

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.100
 Kylie Minogue in 1976.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.340
 You know, Kylie Minogue in 1993.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.540
 - No, she did start as a three-year-old though.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.860
 - Even when she came on neighbor, she was a teenager, right?

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.620
 So she would have been relatively adult.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.460
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.620
 - She'd have done the bulk of her growing.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.660
 - Okay, you know, the Olsen twins, you know.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.420
 - They'd have had to throw it in as a plotline otherwise,

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.860
 like, "Oh, Kylie's getting bigger isn't she?"

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.700
 - You know.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.060
 (laughing)

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:51.900
 - That's true.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.060
 - We have had an email complaining about you saying Kylie Minogue.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:54.900
 - I know, I know.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.460
 - But I say stay true to your lights.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.300
 So anyway, thank you Thomas.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.140
 It was a good point.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.980
 Oh, there was the largest ones are estimated

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.780
 of being about two meters.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.620
 - Oh wow.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.460
 - But they're just based on fragments.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.900
 So you've got to scale up from the fragments.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.180
 There's a bit imprecise, but.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.180
 - Okay.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.780
 - And also he answers, "Why there aren't giant humans?"

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.420
 - Oh yes, I've always wondered this.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.220
 - He says, "We are the giant humans."

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.060
 - Oh yeah.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.300
 - 'Cause all the others are little.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.420
 - Oh, we're giants.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.260
 - Yeah.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.100
 - We are the giants.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.940
 That's very cool.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.740
 So the next time you feel, you know, disempowered.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.580
 - Yeah.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.540
 - Just remember, you're actually a giant.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.460
 - Does that mean, in a million years' time,

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.260
 all the humans will be hobbit sized

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.020
 and they'll find our bones and think,

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.260
 oh, they used to be giants.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.100
 - Yeah.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:36.940
 - Interesting.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.540
 - They might have been giants.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.460
 (laughing)

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.300
 - It was a band.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.140
 - It's a band.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.620
 (laughing)

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.100
 - How does they do in 1998?

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.100
 (laughing)

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.660
 - It's the perfective version of the imperfective.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.660
 They might be giants.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.500
 - Yeah.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.380
 - Wow.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.460
 - They will have had to be giants.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.380
 It's their future perfect.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.220
 - Yeah.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.060
 (laughing)

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:57.900
 - They would love that.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.900
 If they're listening, they'll love that.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.060
 'Cause they're very clever band, aren't they?

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.580
 They're always doing clever things.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.780
 - They are, very clever.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.340
 - They're very cool Thomas Aladay, he's a great author.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.180
 - Yes.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.500
 - Well, and actually, while we're on height,

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.860
 but still in the Ella episode,

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.340
 we talked about sci-fi, Elliot Boyd Smith writes,

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:17.020
 as a six foot nine inch, 16 year old,

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.020
 who will likely grow even more,

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.020
 I am very used to the multitude of comments

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.100
 about my height in almost all aspects of my life.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.580
 However, as an avid fish fan and club fish member,

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.020
 I did not expect to be so viciously attacked

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.100
 by the members of my favorite podcast.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.860
 - Oh, because Ella said that all the tall people die.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.100
 - Oh, okay.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.260
 - In episode 601, while discussing mundane sci-fi,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.980
 Dan, quite randomly, shared the fact

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.620
 that the writer of Jurassic Park was six foot nine.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.460
 He then proceeded to call him a dinosaur,

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.460
 sparking Elliot to tell me I'm going to die

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.860
 earlier than everyone else.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.340
 (laughing)

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.140
 I'm sure all your other freakish listeners

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.420
 were just as shocked by the unprovoked attack from Dan,

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.460
 especially considering most of us are literal bigfoot's.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.540
 (laughing)

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.140
 Thanks from the tall community, Elliot.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:05.980
 - There you go.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:06.820
 - One light the hobbit.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.780
 (laughing)

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.780
 - I feel that in, it wasn't a random fact.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.500
 It was connected, we had mentioned dinosaurs earlier,

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.540
 and so I was, I was relating to that.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.260
 - But, I thought that was, come on,

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.900
 Michael Crichton comes in the room,

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.980
 taller than the velociraptor in the movies.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.380
 Are you kidding me?

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.460
 - He struggled with the door handle

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.660
 from it on the outside, but he just couldn't imagine.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.340
 - Your glass of water is wobbling.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.740
 Oh, Crichton's on his way.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.780
 (laughing)

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.700
 - Well, you've done it again.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.220
 (laughing)

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.460
 - This is a polity corner, not come up with extra jokes.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.180
 We didn't think of last time cornering.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.180
 (laughing)

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.140
 - My point is it wasn't an attack.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.700
 There's no attack on the people.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.860
 - Can I, and this is a possibility

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.300
 that we can put a photo up that's on my phone.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.140
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.740
 - So we did a show with Richard Usman recently,

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.180
 and we got a member of the audience to come up on stage

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.820
 and be against him in a quiz, okay.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.860
 Now, Richard Usman is six foot seven, yeah.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.740
 The member of the public was also around six foot seven.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.620
 You two are taller than me.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.860
 You're above that six foot six, one, something like that.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.860
 I'm about five, 10, five, 11.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.340
 So I'm not that small, but I'm just an average height.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.220
 But something about the photo where you two are in the front,

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.620
 and then Usman and this guy are stood right next

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.660
 to me, I look like a literal puppet.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.060
 I look so small in that photo.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.900
 - So funny.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:31.900
 - I've seen that one.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.740
 - I've seen it either.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.580
 - They put that up.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.420
 - That's great.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.580
 - I got measured last night, and full body liked, yeah.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.540
 I thought that I was six foot one,

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.900
 and this lady last night said that I was six foot.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.140
 And it was a real...

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.940
 - Well, as you get older, you do shrink.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.100
 - So in your four days, do you shrink?

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:51.940
 - Oh yeah.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.580
 - Have I prematurely started shrinking?

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.420
 - I think, I saw this fact on Oprah when I was about 12,

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.660
 so it's probably not true,

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.380
 that every year after you're about 35,

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.820
 you shrink a sixteenth of an inch.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.660
 - Right.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.500
 - Okay.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.340
 - Really?

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.340
 - How interesting.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.940
 - Yeah, and again, like heavy, heavy quote marks around me.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.780
 - Well, I haven't measured myself for a while,

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.220
 so maybe, 'cause I am considerably over 35.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.740
 Maybe I am that small.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.340
 - Right, yeah.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.220
 - So maybe, why are you getting so...

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.020
 - We had to, I mean, for now we had to get our medicals done

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.140
 for a thing for the house.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.580
 We were doing a remorage, so...

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.420
 - All right.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.060
 - So she did my height, she did my weight,

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.580
 she asked my my trouser size, so...

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.460
 - What kind of mortgage device are in this?

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.460
 - Sorry.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:38.300
 Before we work out whether you are on a 5.5% or a 6%,

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.980
 can you tell me if you dress to the left?

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.300
 - On the right, so...

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.980
 (laughing)

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.620
 - Yeah, sorry, you fall for another local apartment.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.540
 It just happens time and again.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.700
 Well, she was very nice, me and my wife both liked her.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.300
 She was a fiora, lovely lady.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.180
 But she said, so she got all my measurements,

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.940
 and now I was in the room with Ben.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.020
 And she said to Phinella, so she did her height,

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.700
 did her weight, and then she said breast size.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.420
 And Phinella went, "Oh."

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.660
 And then told her, "Fold her a brass size, right?"

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.140
 I won't say what it was, but she just told her a brass size.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.980
 And this woman staring at her, just went,

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.260
 I said, "Dress size."

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.760
 (laughing)

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.100
 Breast size is the next question down matter.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.660
 Right now, breast size.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.340
 (laughing)

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.220
 - Thanks so much, I'm not a mortgage thing.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.380
 My very nice mortgage device,

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.740
 that David has never once asked me for my inseam.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.580
 - I'm sorry.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.580
 - Okay, I'll have to check that out.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:36.420
 - You too.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.260
 - Yeah.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.420
 I gave him my urine.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.420
 (laughing)

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.540
 - I'm sorry, she said.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.820
 - You did when she told you what you'd be paying

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.660
 for the next two years.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.780
 (laughing)

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.220
 - What's actually happened here is that Phinella

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.500
 has got a life insurance policy out on you

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.260
 and told you it's a mortgage thing.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.660
 - Really wearingly, she has three out on me.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.940
 It's absolutely true.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.340
 And you know me, I'm the kind of guy

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.580
 that's gonna die in a really stupid way.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.740
 It's just gonna look like she had me killed

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.300
 and she's gonna go to jail.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.980
 It's just gonna look suspicious as hell.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.060
 - Damn.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:09.900
 - Stunning.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.740
 - Anyway, it's absolutely stunning.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:11.580
 - A bit of protein in my urine.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.700
 Gotta get that checked out.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.660
 (laughing)

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.500
 Do we have more?

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.340
 - We've got more.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.180
 - Cool.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.900
 - This, oh, this is another room actually.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.900
 Do you remember we talked about wasps?

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.740
 - Yes.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.980
 - Need more.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.340
 - We talked about wasps.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.180
 (laughing)

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.300
 - These small yellow insects.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.140
 (laughing)

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:30.980
 - Okay, yeah.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.820
 - Yes, we did.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.460
 And it was also on the yellow show.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.300
 - Yeah.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.820
 - And we discussed how they were different from bees,

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.980
 for instance. - Yes.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.260
 - And Andy said that in the summer,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.740
 they switched from going after ham to jam

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.580
 or the other way around.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.340
 - Ham to jam, ham to jam.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.460
 - So this is, I'm so sorry James,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.180
 I think this might be something you said.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.820
 This is a lovely email from Aspen Kennedy.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.660
 - Great name.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.660
 Aspen Kennedy.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.780
 - Yeah, it's a really good name.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:58.620
 - Pretty cool.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.780
 - Yeah.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:00.620
 - Yeah.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.060
 - A long time listen, a big fan of the podcast.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.620
 I do want to pull you up on one thing you said

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.100
 in this week's episode, however.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.380
 You said.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.220
 - Love that.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.700
 I love it when that just isn't.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.700
 - Yeah, I'm putting the tone in there.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.060
 But anyway, you said that mud-dorber wasps

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.620
 present a hazard to airliners

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.340
 as they build nests in the engines.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.180
 - Yeah.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.180
 - Which is not correct.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.020
 - Oh.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.100
 - A wasp nest would have zero impact on a jet engine.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.420
 They're designed and tested to be able

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.100
 to ingest whole frozen chickens

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.900
 and still function correctly.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.020
 The wasps actually cause a problem.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.660
 This is pedant of the week, I think.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.500
 - Okay.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.540
 - When they build their nests in the pitot tubes,

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.900
 which are used to measure a plane's airspeed,

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.780
 there are these tiny tubes on the outside of the plane.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.980
 They have a little revolving thing in them, basically.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:41.820
 - Yeah.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:42.660
 - They have a little thing which measures airspeed.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.500
 - Okay.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.100
 - Or it might be to do with pressure differentials, I think.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.300
 Anyway, that's because on,

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.860
 they do this by measuring the pressure of the air,

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.420
 I've got to read these emails before I read them out.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.060
 They do this by measuring the pressure of the air,

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:53.900
 rushing through the tube

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.300
 and comparing it to the static external pressure.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.420
 If wasps build their nests in the pitot tube,

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.980
 it might either cause an erroneously low airspeed reading

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.580
 if minimal air is entering the tube

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.540
 or an erroneously high one.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.100
 If the mud is blocking the air from escaping,

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.700
 this then causes issues with various other computer systems

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.500
 in the plane that are relying on 40 readings.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.780
 It might even cause the pilots

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.180
 to respond to the incorrect speed

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.980
 and slow the plane below stall speed

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.980
 in the belief that it's going far too fast.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:21.820
 - Yes, yes.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.580
 - 'Cause they just get this reading saying

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.180
 you're doing a thousand miles an hour, slow, slow, slow.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.660
 And then they slow down and actually they're slowing down

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.180
 to a hundred miles an hour and then they crash.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:27.940
 And there was a flight,

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.340
 Bergen Air Flight 301, which crashed shortly after takeoff

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.420
 from the Dominican Republic

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.420
 after the pilots incorrectly responded

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.140
 to the erroneous speed readings.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:36.980
 - Okay.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.900
 - What have we done to fix this issue?

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.340
 - Plains on the ground have covers placed over the tubes

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.180
 to prevent this.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.020
 You just put a cover over there.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.220
 - Yeah, there you go.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.740
 - So James, I would say basically right.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.740
 You just said engine instead of PTO tubes.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.700
 - Well, you know, the number of times

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.140
 I've made that mistake when I get

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.100
 to the mechanics just look at my car.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.940
 I think it's a problem with my PTO tubes.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.780
 That's a sorry, it's your engine.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.220
 Oh, okay, no fair enough.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.220
 I didn't know all that extra information,

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.220
 which is very interesting.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.060
 - Really incredible.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.100
 - I once heard, oh, you should never get maggots

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.620
 in your PTO tube and I've always remembered it.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.340
 Such a precise thing to remember

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.380
 like under the beard of advice.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.060
 - Where's your PTO tube on a...

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.180
 - I don't have a PTO tube.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.020
 - Oh, okay.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:19.860
 - On airplanes, you mean?

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.700
 - Yeah.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.980
 - Is it an exclusively...

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.380
 That cars don't have a PTO tube?

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.220
 There's no...

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.060
 - No, no, no, no.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.900
 - They don't...

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.020
 I don't think they need to rely on external pressure sensors

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.020
 to work out the speed.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.860
 - I just don't know the multiple uses it might have.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.300
 - I suppose, because how do cars measure your speed?

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.620
 By the wheels going...

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.220
 I mean, the wheels on the bus go round and round, don't they?

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.420
 So you just measure how far the wheels have...

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.820
 How many times the wheels have gone?

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.540
 - I actually don't know how that works.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.380
 - No.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.380
 - Well, yeah, they used to, I mean, Roman times,

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.780
 there was the first invention of a pedometer, I guess,

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.820
 would be the turn of a wheel, right?

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.180
 So no matter how far you're going,

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.180
 the turn of the wheel will turn the wheel.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.900
 - A turn of the wheel, we would call that at school.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.300
 - Oh, yeah.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.140
 - Try not to...

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.180
 Do you have a turn of the wheels at school?

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.020
 - No.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.580
 - How did you measure things that were one meter in length?

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.380
 - Probably, we used that.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.180
 - They're not talking about town's body, yeah.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.260
 - We used our lifestyles currently, but no poster.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.460
 (laughing)

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.620
 - Chop a head off, that's meter, yeah.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.940
 - So yeah, I guess that could work in theory,

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.500
 although it seems like an odd way of doing it.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.340
 - It does seem like a very...

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.540
 As I said it, I thought that can't be how they do it.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.740
 - Because if I attach my Google Maps to my car,

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.300
 so it's using Google Maps as a satnav,

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.460
 that can tell me how fast I'm going as well.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.140
 And that must be using satellite.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.820
 - That's using satellites, but the car won't be doing,

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.460
 and what no modern car might do.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.300
 - Yeah.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.140
 - Pito tubes.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.020
 - If you know how to speedometer's work, let us know.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.860
 - It's such a risk saying stuff like that James.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.660
 It's such a risk, 'cause I might get one email,

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.860
 which is brilliant and Chris, where I might get 400.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:50.860
 - Okay, if you are the world expert on odometers,

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.740
 they're right into Andy.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.900
 - That's it, there we go.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.860
 - If you kind of half know how it works,

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.780
 or you just go on Google and check how it works,

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.100
 don't write it to Andy.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.700
 - He said right in.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.420
 James Delce, just finished off the wasp chat.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.420
 - Mm-hmm.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.900
 - Do you remember I was banging on about that book,

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.460
 Endless Forms by Professor Sarian Sumner,

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.380
 which is all about wasps.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.220
 - And he hates bees.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.060
 - Very good book.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:12.740
 - Yeah, she actually.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.060
 I wonder whether Professor Sarian Sumner

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.980
 of wasp ham and jam fame is in any way related

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.500
 to Gordon Sumner of police and sting fame.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.740
 (laughing)

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.580
 - Okay.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:29.540
 - Yeah, really a bass player?

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.380
 - No, guitarist?

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.500
 - No, he stings, he stings.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.780
 - Oh, Gordon Sumner, of course.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.620
 He has the singer to take a songwriter.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.980
 - I think that's the best joke we've had this month

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.820
 in the inbox.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:40.660
 - Yeah.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.580
 - I'm gonna give James a preliminary, J-O-T-M.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.820
 - Jotum, is that what we're gonna call this?

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.940
 - Jotum, Jotum, Jotum, Jotum, the month, yeah.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.780
 - Yeah, okay.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.140
 - Jotum, we're doing it by weekly.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.260
 So is it two episodes worth of Jotum?

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.100
 - Jotum.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:53.940
 (laughing)

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.180
 - Jotum, the fortnight, yeah.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.940
 - Yeah, great.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.860
 Let's have another.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:02.700
 Spoons.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.540
 - Oh yeah.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.980
 - We talked to Richard Osmond about the masked spooner.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.820
 - Oh, yeah.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:07.660
 - Oh, yeah.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.140
 - And we've had an email very pleasantly

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.580
 from Cindy Forkel.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.420
 - Brilliant.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.260
 - While you've been joking.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.100
 - Thank you, Cindy.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.860
 And do you remember, I tried to get that

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.180
 Spoon's quiz off the ground.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.020
 - Oh, yeah.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:19.860
 - The Spoon, Idiom Mean.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:20.700
 - Yes.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.540
 - How's that going?

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.220
 (laughing)

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.780
 - It's in development.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:25.620
 - It's in development.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.700
 I've had a lot of interest.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.540
 - Yeah.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.540
 - It's from major broadcasters.

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:29.380
 - Thought you would.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.700
 - Yeah, about Ms. Forkel could be a host.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.940
 - You're absolutely right.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.980
 - You're absolutely right.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:41.980
 - That's gonna turn the dial of the commission, isn't it?

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.420
 - You can see it in Andy's eyes.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.620
 I'm gonna email them right after this.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.340
 - When you sent us this pitch first,

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.660
 we were a flat-note.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.740
 (laughing)

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.220
 Hearing that you've got Forkel involved.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.300
 (laughing)

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.500
 - She hasn't said yes yet.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.500
 - Oh no.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.620
 - I'll imply she has.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.260
 - I know how a pitch works.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.900
 - Forkel, like instead of being a TV show,

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.540
 you could sell it to the New York Times

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.060
 as like a daily quiz.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.780
 - The New Forkel Times.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.620
 - Really?

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.460
 - Yeah.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.340
 - But you know, like you have word-o and stuff.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.180
 - Yeah.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.020
 - That's forkel.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.860
 - Yeah.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:12.700
 - Go on.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.900
 - Well, it's a different cutlery idea every day.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:16.740
 - Yeah.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.580
 - That's really okay.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.420
 Actually, this is really good.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.460
 - Oh, it's like a crossword where the first three letters

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.180
 is the same, but then it trails off into three

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.580
 different options to end it.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:25.420
 - Yeah.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.500
 - So you can have fork, fore, and foreskin.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.340
 - Perfect.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.180
 - There you go.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.180
 - We've got, right, puzzle one.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.180
 This is gonna make our millions.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:37.100
 She just adds that the idiom to hand over the spoon.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:37.940
 - Oh, yeah.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:38.780
 - Is that a new one?

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.860
 - Well, I said to stick one spoon in the wall.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:41.700
 - Yeah.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.540
 - Means to die.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.380
 - Yeah.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.660
 - The German language has then lothal abgabin

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.980
 to hand over the spoon.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.300
 And that means to die.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.940
 - Oh, I don't think when we put it on Instagram,

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.740
 we had someone saying in South Africa, it's a phrase too.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.100
 So it's a thing.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:54.940
 - Yeah.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.780
 - It's a phrase around the world.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.260
 It just happens not to exist in English anymore.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.420
 - It's not weird.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.260
 - Love that.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.020
 - Right, here's a controversial one.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.900
 And it's from the Poundland section we did

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.060
 with Richard Osmond.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.900
 - Oh yeah.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.100
 - Tiana from Queens, New York.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.100
 - New fork.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.220
 - New fork, new fork.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.060
 - Right.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.860
 Just wanted to give my two cents about toilet lights.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.860
 They are fantastic.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.580
 (laughing)

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.380
 - Oh dear, okay, for new listeners.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.140
 This was the fact that in Poundland,

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.300
 was it Orinalde or somewhere you could buy these lights

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.740
 that go on the inside of your toilet.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.300
 And we supposed what kind of video might need that.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.260
 Because who turns the light on when they go to the toilet?

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.100
 - Yeah.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.100
 - Well, we're the kind of video James,

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.100
 'cause we don't turn the light on.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.140
 - Absolutely.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:41.980
 - Yeah.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:42.820
 - Where he's turned the light on.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.660
 - Yeah.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.660
 - And who wakes up in the neighborhood?

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.900
 (laughing)

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.860
 Who are kind of powerful lights do you guys have?

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.860
 You live in lighthouses?

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.700
 Like what?

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.500
 (laughing)

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.500
 - It's jet crash onto the rocks

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.860
 'cause for the critical seconds of the lights

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.700
 it's good.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.780
 I'd be in James standing there, like a piss.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.300
 (laughing)

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.740
 Tiana just wants to say, they're fantastic.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.740
 I've never been to Orinalde,

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.700
 so I've not experienced the Isle of Shame,

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.660
 but boy do I love my toilet light.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.740
 The one we have cycles through 16 colors and is motion sensitive.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.340
 So every time I walk into the bathroom it's a party.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.220
 (laughing)

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.020
 Even with the toilet lid down and the bathroom light on,

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.940
 this thing is bright.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:24.940
 Standing.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.140
 Our primary purpose for owning and using this

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.540
 is not for providing light for middle of the night trips,

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.020
 though it certainly does do that job well.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.540
 Mainly we use our toilet light to bring some joy and wonder

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:35.780
 to the bathroom experience.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.780
 - That's what I get there.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.220
 - It's a great conversation starter when we have guests

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.860
 and becomes even more thrilling

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.940
 when certain substances have been consumed.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.420
 - Be true.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.260
 - Asparagus?

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.260
 - Asparagus.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.180
 - It sounds like drugs.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.180
 It sounds like hard drugs.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.180
 - Oh, I don't know.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.020
 (laughing)

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:54.860
 - I don't know.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.140
 I don't know, I might be wrong.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.580
 But it does show up everything.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.300
 So you do need to be quite as serious with cleaning the lid.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.460
 - Oh, really?

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.460
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.460
 - So I know, thank you, Tiana.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.380
 Great review.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.820
 - Yeah, great review.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.140
 - I feel like Tiana is part of big toilet light.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.180
 She's trying to make this a thing now that everyone buys them.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.300
 She's got shares.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.660
 'Cause it goes in under the thing.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.500
 - Oh, is it like an LED strip that you put in?

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.580
 - I assume so.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.140
 But how would it be lit up?

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.060
 - It would be the lid opening.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.940
 Sorry, I thought it needed a jet of urine

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.940
 in order to light up.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.060
 But then how do you get it on target in the first place?

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:32.020
 - Hmm, anyway, Sarah Crocker, right?

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.980
 Crocker can go with forkle in the, in my show.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.780
 (laughing)

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.740
 Long time fan of the show and a club fish member.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.700
 So hello, Sarah.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:46.340
 I was listening to your latest mail bag show earlier today.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.100
 I was chuckling over your comments about Eric Carmen.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:49.940
 - Oh, right, yeah.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.100
 - Oh yeah.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:51.940
 It's a musician.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.420
 - Yeah, or by myself.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.820
 So the Richard Osmond episode as well.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.060
 - Right, right, yeah.

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.540
 - I'm currently retired and living in Bucket,

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.220
 Bucket Day, Panama.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.860
 But I was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio as was Eric.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.060
 In fact, we dated as teenagers.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:06.900
 - No!

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:07.740
 - Oh!

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.220
 - Oh my gosh.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.060
 - When he was in a local band called The Harlequence.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.220
 It was clear he had talent as a musician, singer,

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.620
 and songwriter, even at that age.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.940
 And I was so enthralled to be his girlfriend.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.180
 Well, until he broke up with me.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.580
 - And you were all by yourself.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.420
 - I'm pretty.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.780
 (laughing)

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.700
 - I genuinely thought that's where that was going.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.460
 (laughing)

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.660
 - No, actually he didn't do it all by himself.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.860
 He had a mutual friend called to break up with me.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.860
 - That's so funny.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.700
 - What a dick.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.540
 - What a rutter.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:38.380
 - Oh my God.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.900
 - I think I cried straight for about nine months.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.460
 I was a teenager after all, then decided he wasn't worth it.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.780
 Good for you, Sarah.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.500
 - Wow, he uses other musicians to write his songs

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.420
 and he uses other people to break up with his girlfriends.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.500
 - Hi, it's an act man and off here.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.940
 (laughing)

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.340
 - My friends tell me to tell you something.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.100
 (laughing)

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.540
 - Superb.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.020
 Oh, so thank you very much, Sarah.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.540
 That's a brilliant, brilliant email.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:04.380
 - That's awesome.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.380
 - Elliot Jeffries writes, "Hello, fish folk.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.540
 On the matter of fish lines,

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.260
 making their way into common parlance,

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.300
 I frequently use the phrase "friend of the podcast"

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.780
 to refer to people frequently discussed with friends.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.620
 For instance, Oscar Wilde, J.S. Bach,

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.380
 and Richard Armitage are all friends of the podcast.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.980
 None of my friends who I've said this to understand it,

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.580
 but have accepted it.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.260
 - So that's nice.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.540
 - There's one name on there that I couldn't work out

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.580
 who it was.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.740
 - J.S. Bach.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.580
 - Yeah.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:32.140
 - It was the Richard Armitage.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:32.980
 - Armitage.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.820
 - Who was Armitage?

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:34.660
 - I can't remember.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.180
 - He invented the Armitage Shanks toilet.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.020
 - Now available with light up bowl.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.660
 (laughing)

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.340
 - Do you know who Richard Armitage is?

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.180
 - Look at filmmaker.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.020
 - Is it?

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.020
 - Should we look it up?

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:45.860
 - Yeah.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.700
 - There's someone with a similar name

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.340
 who's like a forced racing goner.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.180
 - I'll check.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.700
 - But I don't think that's him.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:51.540
 - Oh.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:55.580
 - Richard Armitage, English actor, voice actor and author,

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.460
 his role as Dorf King and leader in Peter Jackson's film,

00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.300
 The Hobbit.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.140
 - Oh, give me a break.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:00.980
 - No.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.420
 - No way.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.340
 Oh my God, look at the size of his feet.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.300
 (laughing)

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.140
 - Really?

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:08.980
 - Yeah.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.860
 - Wow.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.780
 - Friend of the podcast.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:11.620
 - Friend of the podcast.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.660
 - Well, friend of Elliot Jeffries's personal podcast.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.740
 - That's great.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.820
 That's really funny.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.660
 - What are the odds?

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.500
 - What are the odds?

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.780
 - We've had a controversy bit.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:19.620
 - Oh yeah.

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.020
 - Daniel from Wagger Wagger.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:21.860
 - Right.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.700
 - Wow.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.860
 - I know.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.100
 - A truly a global show.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.620
 - So good, they named it twice.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.460
 - That's right.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.540
 (laughing)

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.020
 - Just catching up with some special episodes.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.980
 As I do, when I have the occasion for long drives,

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.260
 where does Wagger Wagger do?

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.100
 - It's Australia.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.260
 - No, no, come on.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.300
 - It's right in the middle, isn't it?

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.340
 - I can't actually remember, yeah.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.180
 - Is it in the bit where they have quiz questions

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.180
 on the road to the road?

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.940
 - Well, it sounds like if there's long drives,

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.700
 that's gonna come up is where the road goes through.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.540
 I'm guessing.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:49.700
 - Well, Daniel, in fact, Daniel,

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.220
 you might be listening to this now,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.860
 because Daniel says, "Always have special interest

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.420
 "in the clubfish extra content."

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.260
 - There we go.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.100
 - Hey, Daniel.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.260
 - You're probably hauling a road train right now.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.460
 - And we're gonna get to that.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:00.860
 (laughing)

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.780
 - But Daniel asks critically,

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.900
 how did Dan's fridge go bad?

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.660
 And he didn't know it was unplugged.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.900
 Surely the light didn't work if it was plugged in.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.420
 Something doesn't add up.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.140
 - What?

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:12.980
 - Okay.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.060
 - Your fridge went bad.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:14.900
 - Oh!

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.740
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.580
 - And it turned out it was turned off at the wall.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.420
 - Yeah.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.420
 - And he thrown away all your delicate wagyu steaks

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:21.860
 and everything had gone green and moldy.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:22.700
 - Yes.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.540
 - Wagyu wagyu.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.260
 (laughing)

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.580
 - Absolutely, absolutely.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:31.860
 - So, sorry, I got lost in what you were saying,

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.420
 repeat the point.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.540
 It was that how did you not know your fridge was unplugged?

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.100
 Because surely the light wouldn't have worked.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.140
 - Well, you see, you and I,

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.620
 when we get up in the night for a midnight snack,

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.260
 and we go to the fridge to get some cheese,

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.300
 we open the fridge door.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.620
 It's very obvious that the light sun,

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.620
 but damn, turns all the emumination

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.100
 and it's entire house sun.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.780
 So, he can't tell the difference.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.540
 (laughing)

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:55.540
 - There we go.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.620
 - Yeah, I don't know an answer to that.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.340
 - No, I've got an answer, Dan, for you.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.460
 - Sorry, Daniel.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.580
 - If Dan's fridge, if the light wasn't working,

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.460
 that's an extra reason to assume your fridge is broken.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.300
 Do you not mean?

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.140
 - Yeah.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:08.980
 - Like if the light's not coming on,

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.740
 and it's clearly gone all warm.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.740
 - Yeah.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:12.740
 - The fact is, how did you not know

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:13.740
 that it was unplugged in the wall,

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.420
 but you frequently can't get to the socket.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.100
 The real mystery is not, how did you not know it was unplugged.

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.580
 The real mystery is how did it become unplugged?

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.420
 - Yeah.

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:23.260
 - Or turned off at the socket.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.460
 Like what is going on there?

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.060
 Because the socket is in excess, I'm presuming.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.060
 - It was pretty hard to get to.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:28.900
 - It's pretty hard to get to.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.740
 - Yeah.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.540
 - What or who, or whom?

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.540
 - Yeah.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.660
 Turned off your fridge.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:39.660
 - So, I, has anyone got three life insurance policies on you?

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.980
 (laughing)

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.620
 (laughing)

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.860
 - 'Cause it fell over on you, didn't it?

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:47.700
 It was so strange.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.540
 - It's very weird.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.380
 - It's very weird.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.220
 - You normally don't.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.060
 - Yeah.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.780
 - You normally not the very stable things actually.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.860
 (laughing)

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.100
 - Yeah, there's a lot of mysteries going on

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:56.940
 in the house of the man.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.340
 - I'm sure we were with 32 C breaths swing.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.700
 (laughing)

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.540
 - Oh, dear.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:07.540
 Shall we come to the sausage parlour?

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.420
 - Yeah, we should.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.860
 - All right, we're getting close to shutting up shop.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.380
 On this week's drop of the line.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.580
 But don't worry, we'll be back again in two weeks.

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:16.420
 - We will.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.820
 - With plenty more corrections,

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.260
 including lots of corrections about things we said about Australia,

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.860
 where Mel Bracewell was on the show.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:22.700
 They have been rolling in,

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.620
 but I want to give the flood more time to build up

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.820
 before releasing the pressure.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.660
 You know what I mean?

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:28.900
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.780
 - So let's just have some light emails about sausages

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.860
 to round us off, okay?

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.700
 (laughing)

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.700
 - Gareth Taylor writes,

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.740
 "You might be uninterested to hear."

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.660
 (laughing)

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.500
 - Well, disinterested.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.460
 - No, I am uninterested, actually I'm afraid.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:44.700
 - Because of some hearing loss,

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.780
 I find F and S sounds very similar.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.660
 And in particular, the names of the letters themselves

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.140
 sound virtually identical to me.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.140
 So when my partner reads me crossword clues

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.700
 and says what letters we have so far,

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:57.180
 she will say fish rather than F and sausage rather than S.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.180
 - Okay. - Oh, that's good, too.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.460
 - I can't remember why we chose those

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.420
 as the substitutions,

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.940
 other than fish and sausages are both great.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.940
 Well, episode 6-0-1 has just arrived,

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.740
 and it's called no such thing as sausage by Chanel.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.900
 I wondered how many sausages you have given us over the years

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.940
 as it's a familiar, fishy word.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.820
 So Gareth has done a quick look at which words

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:19.940
 occur the most often in episode titles.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.020
 - Oh, sausage has to be, has to be the winner.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:23.860
 - Wow. - Oh really?

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.580
 - And there's one coming up.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.420
 (laughing)

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.580
 - Oh, I know, that's gonna be.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.740
 - There was one where we were in,

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.860
 we were sat in a queue, signing books,

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.540
 and someone said, "What will the title of this show be?"

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.140
 And I said, "I don't know, we'll just make it up

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.580
 when we do the show."

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.780
 And they said, "Can you call it this?"

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.820
 And I said, "Okay, so it's gonna be..."

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.540
 - It's a sausage thing, it's gonna be sausage thing.

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.940
 - Nice, I remember her, yeah.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.420
 - So you took out no such thing as,

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.340
 and drop and line and all of that in, you know,

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.660
 all the little words like "the" and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.540
 - And joint ninth place tied with "with" is sausage.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:57.380
 - In ninth.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.220
 - Yeah.

00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.060
 - Yeah.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.420
 - So it's one of the top 10 most frequent words.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.260
 - So we have the top 10.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.300
 - I would have put it absolutely number one.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.380
 I'm really surprised.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.380
 - Can you give us some clues?

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.220
 This is a great game.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:11.140
 - Oh, sorry, if you take out A, the in and of four on and and with.

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:11.980
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:12.820
 - The next word is sausage.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:13.660
 - Oh, okay.

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:14.980
 - It's the most common, proper word.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.820
 - Oh, really?

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:16.660
 - Yeah.

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:17.500
 - Oh, wow.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.420
 - I actually use the word sausage as a conjunction.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.260
 (laughing)

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.500
 - So, okay, here's one.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:28.180
 Can you name any of the next five most common words?

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.660
 - Pope.

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:32.460
 - Oh, nice, not far off.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:33.380
 - Vatican?

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.140
 - No, there is a title, Jesus.

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.220
 - No, I wouldn't do that.

00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:39.580
 Oh, like Queen.

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:40.900
 - Queen, brilliant.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.580
 - Okay, so Queen is one, King.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:43.420
 - Nope.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.820
 - Some kind of animal, maybe?

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.820
 - There are no animals in there.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.700
 - No, a couple of adjectives.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:48.540
 - Oh.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.900
 - Oh, no such thing as a hairy.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.740
 - It's not hairy.

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:55.300
 - A sausage, or, you know, big.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.140
 - No.

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:57.300
 - No such thing as a.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.700
 - I'll give you one, yeah.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.860
 - Yeah, sexy.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.340
 - Really?

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.180
 - Oh gosh.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.420
 - Okay.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.180
 - You've got three more to get from the top.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.180
 - This feels like a--

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.260
 - Give a slight clues.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:11.260
 It's a kind of--

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.100
 - Magic.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:12.940
 - Magic.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:13.780
 (laughing)

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.940
 - Give a slightly more extreme clues, please.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.860
 (laughing)

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:20.860
 - Queen.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.860
 (laughing)

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:28.780
 - Crazy little thing called--

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.300
 (laughing)

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.940
 - No such thing as a magic love sausage, is there?

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.140
 (laughing)

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.580
 - No such thing as the Queen's magic love sausage.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.420
 (laughing)

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.980
 - Once we've done that, we've just done it.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.220
 - That's the final episode.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:43.220
 - No, it's the final episode.

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.980
 We won't even announce it when that pops up.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:50.340
 - There's one more, which is, what's a good example.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:55.820
 Blank.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.220
 Huh?

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.060
 - Blank.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:35:59.900
 - Check.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:00.740
 - No.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:01.580
 - Blank.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.420
 - Blank, man.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.260
 - As a movie with--

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.100
 - It.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.300
 - I think Taylor Swift.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.140
 - Blank.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.300
 - Kelt Travis Kelsey.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.340
 - Blank Space.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.180
 - Space.

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.180
 - Oh, okay.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.500
 - She doesn't think of Blank Spaces, is she?

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.340
 - I don't know.

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.180
 - I don't know either either either.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.020
 - I don't know.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:14.860
 - All right.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.380
 (laughing)

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.220
 And those are the five.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.620
 Sex Eat Love, Space, Queen, and Magic.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:20.460
 - Great.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.300
 - Wow.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.140
 - I know.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.060
 - Good, thank you very much, Gareth.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:23.900
 - Yeah.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.940
 - One final one, Todd Norbury writes, subject line,

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.780
 with regards to your sausage conundrum.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:32.660
 Way back in episode 471, no such thing

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.460
 as a toying costs bracket's classic dam.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.620
 You spoke about the time--

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.740
 (laughing)

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:43.460
 Can you spoke about the time you returned?

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:44.300
 (laughing)

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.140
 - Okay.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.100
 - I forgot about that.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.780
 (laughing)

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.220
 - You spoke about the time you returned

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.620
 to a takeaway shop to complain about a spicy sausage.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.220
 - Oh my goodness.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.300
 - Was this the genesis of spicy meat?

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.220
 I didn't, I wasn't complaining about a spicy sausage.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.460
 I bought a spicy sausage

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.300
 and I was unhappy with the quantity I've received

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.140
 for the money.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:03.980
 - Yeah.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.140
 - Guys, don't bring this up to you.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:05.980
 - Sorry.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.260
 - Todd writes, "I was lucky enough to travel to the UK in July

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.580
 and I also had a sausage moment.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.980
 I have attached a photo of the menu

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.700
 and the nine-quid hot dog.

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.980
 It caused a bit of chatter on the fish cord at the time.

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.580
 I should have done what you did and complained

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:19.580
 but the group was in a hurry

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:21.460
 and I had to down it with copious amounts of water

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.780
 to smooth the way.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.380
 No facts, just a shared sausage experience in the UK.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.180
 So I just wanted you guys to look at what we've got here

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.220
 and say whether you think this is worth nine-quid.

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.060
 - Okay.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.340
 - Oh my God.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:36.780
 - Where's the sausage?

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:37.620
 (laughing)

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.140
 - It's underneath that turd.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.860
 (laughing)

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:42.700
 - Oh, good, is it?

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.660
 - We're looking at, it's a sort of open bun

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.140
 with a sort of dark void.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:51.220
 - I think to me, it looks like it's probably a vegan sausage

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.420
 that's overdone.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.660
 - That's very unkind.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.140
 - No, it's just me like it doesn't have the,

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.140
 it's kind of very cylindrical

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.740
 like often those fake meat sausages are.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.580
 - Yes.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.420
 - Yeah.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.500
 - That's amazing.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.260
 - That looks like, have you ever looked at the hole

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.300
 where Anish Kapoor did his van to a black?

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.300
 (laughing)

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.660
 That's what I feel like I'm looking at.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.500
 - Yeah.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.980
 - And what a reference that is.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:14.980
 - Yeah.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:16.860
 - And if you understood that reference,

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.220
 you are in the right place.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:19.620
 (laughing)

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.340
 - Oh, so there you go, I'm so sorry, Todd.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.020
 - Yeah, so you've absolutely been diddled there.

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:25.860
 - I know.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.380
 - Do you never know where you get with the sausage?

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.220
 - No, that's true.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.220
 - That's a beauty of it really.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.420
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.020
 - The next one will be better, you know?

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.060
 But he came from New Zealand to the UK

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.220
 and that was the sausage we gave him.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.380
 I just feel a bit about, you know, I feel a bit sort of,

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.260
 oh, come on Britain.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.540
 Yeah, we can do better than that.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.460
 - We can, yeah.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.300
 - We can.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.140
 - Yeah.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:43.980
 - Okay.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.560
 (upbeat music)

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:54.260
 - Well, that's it for this episode of "Droppers Aligned".

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.260
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.900

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.540
 or not, you'll be back again in two weeks with another one.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.860
 (laughing)

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:04.700
 Yeah, thank you so much.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.060

 and we'd love to hear yours too.

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.700
 If something we've said has affected you,

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.500
 there will be a hope line available

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.340
 and the sausage help line.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.380
 - The sausage help line.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:20.980
 The help line is podcast.ky.com.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.140
 So just write it there.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:22.980
 Thank you again.

 Bye.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.040
 (upbeat music)

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:36.040
 (upbeat music)
