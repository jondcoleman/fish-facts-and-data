1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
 (phone ringing)

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,500
 - Hey, I don't want that.

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,500
 I don't want that.

4
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,080
 (upbeat music)

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,940
 - Hi.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,780
 - Hello, Man.

7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,620
 - Hi, guys.

8
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,100
 Welcome to Drop of the Line.

9
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,380
 And welcome you to Drop of the Line.

10
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,700
 Patreon's and Apple subscribers,

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,300
 because you're all hearing this,

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,100
 and some of you are able to see it too.

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,940
 - Yeah.

14
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,060
 - So there might be some physical bits of business

15
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,180
 we throw in, and it might take a shirt off,

16
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,380
 and it might, so welcome to Drop of the Line.

17
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,940
 I'll fortnightly audience feedback special.

18
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,940
 We've been promoted.

19
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,120
 (laughing)

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,060
 - This is huge, the network won more of us.

21
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,900
 - It's great stuff.

22
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,740
 - Wonderful.

23
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,740
 - I mean, we did the promoting.

24
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,420
 - Who do we have to sleep with together?

25
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,260
 (laughing)

26
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,700
 - Each other, it turned out.

27
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,860
 - The worrying thing is when we get canceled.

28
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,860
 - Oh yeah.

29
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,860
 (laughing)

30
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,300
 - I don't you worry, there's plenty of stuff in here

31
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,540
 that is going to get us canceled.

32
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,020
 - What would you say about the mailbox this month?

33
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,940
 - It's been absolutely bulging.

34
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,780
 - Right.

35
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,600
 - I've had to print two separate documents.

36
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,440
 - A bunch.

37
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,660
 (laughing)

38
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,740
 - Has anyone ever told you about copy paste?

39
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,100
 You can put two things in one document.

40
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,940
 - Yeah.

41
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,780
 - There's just so much.

42
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,740
 - Have you heard about font sizes as well?

43
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,020
 - So hello, welcome to Drop of the Line.

44
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,020
 We're going to do the audience feedback,

45
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,060
 and we got some great stuff.

46
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,900
 - Yeah.

47
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,740
 - Let's do it.

48
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,500
 - Let's start off with just with an,

49
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,940
 and I'm actually, actually this is off the back

50
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,060
 of last month's Drop of the Line.

51
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,820
 You and Taylor writes, on the October Drop of the Line,

52
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,500
 James stated that he did not think

53
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,520
 that the song Chocolate Salty Balls

54
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,500
 got to number one in the charts.

55
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,460
 Just to correct this, it was indeed a number one single.

56
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,700
 It missed out on the coveted Christmas number one,

57
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,540
 1998.

58
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,820
 - This is by Scales.

59
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,340
 - With.

60
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,180
 - To become one.

61
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,340
 - Goodbye.

62
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,180
 - Okay, bye.

63
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,940
 (laughing)

64
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,020
 - However, it would reach number one,

65
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,900
 the following week, where it remained for just one week

66
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,780
 before being knocked off the top spot by.

67
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,100
 - Oh, good grief.

68
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,100
 - What year are we talking?

69
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,180
 - 1998, and now maybe 1999.

70
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,420
 - Smash mouth?

71
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,580
 - Steps.

72
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,700
 - Oh, I said I've got it.

73
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,380
 Okay, 1998 steps.

74
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,300
 Oh, stump or chain reaction.

75
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,940
 - I can't beat a slash tragedy.

76
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,780
 - Really?

77
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,260
 - Oh, wow.

78
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,100
 - Huh.

79
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,260
 - I'm verified.

80
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,260
 - I'm verified this.

81
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,060
 - And how did Smash mouth do?

82
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,380
 - You and doesn't relate, I'm so sorry.

83
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,500
 So there you go.

84
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,460
 It was the biggest selling Christmas number two

85
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,460
 since Wams last Christmas.

86
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,380
 - Wow.

87
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,180
 - And Christmas number two brings us to Mr. Hanky,

88
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,260
 the Christmas poo.

89
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,100
 - Perfect.

90
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,940
 - There we go.

91
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,780
 - Perfect.

92
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,620
 - No, I do remember, like I remembered very clearly

93
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,980
 the time of Chuck the Salty Balls when it came out.

94
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,300
 I was working in a hotel and it was lots of Christmas parties

95
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,220
 and we used to play it every single night.

96
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,540
 And I remember really hoping that it would get to number one

97
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,140
 and then being beaten by the Spice Girls for Christmas.

98
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,740
 And then of course, no one really cares

99
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,940
 about the first week after Christmas number one.

100
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,060
 No one really thinks about that much.

101
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,300
 - What a shame.

102
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,700
 - It's sort of like the new year.

103
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,380
 It's like this bringing in the year.

104
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,220
 - Yeah, but what happened?

105
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,020
 - The 12th night number one.

106
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,860
 It's very important.

107
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,340
 - What happens is everyone,

108
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,820
 the amount of money people used to spend on singles

109
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,620
 the week before Christmas,

110
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,620
 it clips every other week in the year.

111
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,580
 And then when you got to the first week in January,

112
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,620
 quite a lot of sort of rock bands and indie bands

113
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,980
 will bring singles out because they knew

114
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,540
 that no one was buying music then

115
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,900
 and they could get higher in the charts.

116
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
 - That's the time.

117
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,900
 - Done with the days of sales.

118
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,900
 - Family days.

119
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,700
 - Yeah, they were.

120
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,700
 - Happy days, well.

121
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,700
 - Apologies, you and.

122
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
 - Yeah, sorry about that.

123
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,540
 - I'm sorry about that.

124
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,180
 And in fairness, Dan, you actually messaged me

125
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,500
 and said, yeah, you got that wrong James.

126
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,340
 - Well, and because it was part of the last duel.

127
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,620
 Yeah, so the issue, and this is just for all the listeners,

128
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,220
 sometimes if we get something very slightly wrong in a duel,

129
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,820
 you know, what do you do, chop the whole segment?

130
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,220
 That was a big segment or callbacks all the way through.

131
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,780
 And so I knew someone would write in

132
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,420
 that we could readdress it on a further one.

133
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,580
 So, yeah.

134
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,420
 - Very clever.

135
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,660
 - Yeah, it was an unfortunate one.

136
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,900
 I don't ever want to do that again.

137
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,980
 - Look what's happened.

138
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,700
 James is having a sit here, defend himself.

139
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,700
 - We're daggers drawn.

140
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,580
 - No, I don't know if you remember.

141
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,540
 We had Ella Alshamahi on a few weeks ago.

142
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,380
 - Oh, yeah.

143
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,220
 - Of course.

144
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,540
 - How would we forget?

145
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,620
 - I don't know.

146
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,580
 - I don't know if this tickles the old brain bug.

147
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,580
 (laughing)

148
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,740
 We have one of dad's old friends and someone we've all known

149
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,580
 for many years.

150
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,420
 - She won.

151
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,420
 - She was great.

152
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,340
 But she led to a lot of correspondence.

153
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,180
 - Okay.

154
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,780
 - So about half the correspondence from that show

155
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,300
 is about Hobbits.

156
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,140
 - Oh.

157
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,540
 - 'Cause we mentioned the homo floresiensis

158
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,940
 who are clearly Hobbits.

159
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,220
 - They were giving the nickname Hobbits.

160
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,060
 - Yeah.

161
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:40,900
 - And yeah.

162
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,980
 - So I'm gonna jump in here and suggest

163
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,700
 that the correspondence might not be so much

164
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,900
 about the ancient hominids and more about the tedious novels.

165
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,740
 - It is universally about the tedious novels.

166
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,140
 (laughing)

167
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,820
 So correction, this isn't, I'm actually from David Spraklin,

168
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,380
 who writes, the idea that Hobbits have big feet

169
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,660
 is a fan idea not supported or rejected really

170
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,140
 by Tolkien's actual words.

171
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,100
 So he's just silent on the size of their feet.

172
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,620
 They are hairy and the only one whose feet are mentioned

173
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,580
 is smegol, but he was likely a store

174
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,620
 which isn't a race of Hobbits from the Shire.

175
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,260
 Those would be half-fits and fallow hides, okay?

176
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,980
 So can we just please put this to bed, this myth.

177
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,020
 - That they had big feet.

178
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,020
 - Yeah.

179
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,380
 It just doesn't say, but apparently it's just a fan idea

180
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,220
 that's taken off.

181
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,220
 - Did the novels say that they had big penises

182
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,780
 and people have said, you know what?

183
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,140
 They say about people with big penises.

184
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,980
 (laughing)

185
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,900
 - Tolkien is very clear in his concerning Hobbit section.

186
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,740
 - Yeah.

187
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,140
 - They're all packing.

188
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,420
 - It's a lot dirtier than we realized.

189
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,260
 - We've had a couple more.

190
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,420
 We've had one from Dan Connolly,

191
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,620
 who writes about the lawsuits over the word Hobbit,

192
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,660
 which is, you know.

193
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,380
 - Yeah, 'cause it's okay.

194
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,300
 So the guy who effectively discovered the homophlerentices,

195
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,740
 or however that's pronounced,

196
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,540
 then called it Hobbit and went on a tour

197
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,820
 and the estate got in touch saying,

198
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,100
 you can't call it a Hobbit.

199
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,540
 - So that's right, isn't it?

200
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,380
 - Yes.

201
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,060
 - Well, the people who did Dungeons and Dragons,

202
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,420
 those books, they had to change,

203
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,940
 they put in Hobbit and End and Balrog and Warg,

204
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,580
 and they had to change all those.

205
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,220
 - 'Cause the estate, I presume, was still pretty active.

206
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,060
 - It's interesting,

207
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,260
 'cause all the words have been invented prior to,

208
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,140
 or at least Hobbit was certainly used prior to--

209
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,140
 - This is what Dan Connolly says.

210
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,420
 - The Hobbit is in a list of fairies from the 1850s,

211
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,060
 that Warg, only Balrog of those,

212
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,020
 is an invention of Tolkien arguably.

213
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,380
 And that list of fairies includes names for Will of the Wisps.

214
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,580
 - You know, the sort of,

215
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,420
 phantom lights in marshes, or whatever.

216
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,740
 Names for them include Melch Dick,

217
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,260
 Sponks, Dicker Tuesdays, and Meg with the Wads.

218
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,900
 - That's very funny.

219
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,500
 I must have said this on the show,

220
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,660
 but Sponk used to mean just any kind of light.

221
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,300
 - Hey. - Oh yeah.

222
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,540
 - Because in Ulysses, I think,

223
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,660
 or at least in one of James Joyce's books,

224
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,860
 I was reading it, and when my daughter was born

225
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,500
 to try and stay awake, which did not work very well.

226
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,500
 But it says that he created a Sponk and passed it to me

227
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,220
 or something like that when he's lighting a cigarette.

228
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,500
 - So Sponky does feel like you're saying

229
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,540
 you've got like a bright energy about you.

230
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,300
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

231
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,620
 Sorry, why don't you try and keep yourself awake

232
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,820
 when your daughter's born rather than trying

233
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,060
 to desperately claw back every second of sleep?

234
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,300
 - Because my wife was sleeping at that period,

235
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,060
 and I needed to stay awake to make sure

236
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,700
 that my child didn't die.

237
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,500
 And so one of us was always awake.

238
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,820
 - And you thought I'll read one of the most

239
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,940
 legendarily difficult and boring texts.

240
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,180
 (laughing)

241
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,420
 - Yeah, it was a mistake.

242
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,260
 What am I going to say?

243
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,220
 - Were we doing that fact, that week?

244
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,940
 - No, no. - Right, we just had it in the shelf, right?

245
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,780
 - No, I'm the same.

246
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,020
 When my first child was born,

247
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,300
 I read the phone book to try and keep myself awake.

248
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,300
 It just didn't work.

249
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,420
 - It's so night.

250
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,260
 - It's so night.

251
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,940
 - How is your child, Aaron?

252
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,460
 (laughing)

253
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,820
 - Aaron A. Aaronson.

254
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,260
 (laughing)

255
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,100
 - He's doing great.

256
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,980
 - So another thing on the Hobbit Penguin thing.

257
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,020
 You remember there were giant penguins and tiny cows

258
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,300
 and miniature people and all that.

259
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,940
 We've had an email from Thomas Halliday,

260
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,500
 the paleontologist.

261
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,780
 - Oh, yeah.

262
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,620
 - I know.

263
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,460
 - Of the author?

264
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,300
 - Yes.

265
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,620
 - Of other lands?

266
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,980
 - I don't know which books he's written, but it might be, yeah.

267
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,140
 But no, it is him.

268
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,140
 - Yeah.

269
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,740
 - He says, yes, there were big penguins in the past.

270
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,820
 And he emphasizes were.

271
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,180
 And frankly, they could have given Kylie a piggyback.

272
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,460
 - Oh, okay.

273
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,940
 - As we said, they were about the height of Kylie,

274
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,780
 the giant penguin.

275
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,620
 - Yeah, yeah.

276
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,660
 So that was a little bit of a mistake, I would say,

277
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,020
 but I know of a generalization,

278
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,900
 which we said that they were the size of penguins,

279
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,300
 by which we meant they were 1.1 meters tall,

280
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,380
 which is about the same as a giant penguin,

281
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,340
 or an emperor penguin,

282
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,820
 which is the one you think of when you say penguins.

283
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,420
 But actually, of course, there's loads of different types

284
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,740
 of penguins and they come in all sorts of different sizes.

285
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,460
 - And I think Kylie Minogue is taller than 1.1 meters,

286
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,380
 but that is really, really, really small, isn't it?

287
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,660
 - That would be small, yeah.

288
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,180
 That's in fact the height of my three-year-old.

289
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,780
 - She has been 1.1 meters at some point in her life,

290
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,620
 Kylie Minogue.

291
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,460
 - Yes.

292
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,940
 - She's been all heights up to at least five foot.

293
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,780
 - Up to where she is now.

294
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,620
 - Yes.

295
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,620
 - And maybe a bit beyond,

296
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,260
 because as you get older, you do shrink a bit, don't you?

297
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,100
 - What a great,

298
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,540
 'cause she started so young in her career

299
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,420
 that is an actual unit of measurement,

300
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,100
 Kylie Minogue in 1976.

301
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,340
 You know, Kylie Minogue in 1993.

302
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,540
 - No, she did start as a three-year-old though.

303
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,860
 - Even when she came on neighbor, she was a teenager, right?

304
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,620
 So she would have been relatively adult.

305
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,460
 - Yeah, that's true.

306
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,620
 - She'd have done the bulk of her growing.

307
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,660
 - Okay, you know, the Olsen twins, you know.

308
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,420
 - They'd have had to throw it in as a plotline otherwise,

309
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,860
 like, "Oh, Kylie's getting bigger isn't she?"

310
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,700
 - You know.

311
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,060
 (laughing)

312
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,900
 - That's true.

313
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,060
 - We have had an email complaining about you saying Kylie Minogue.

314
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,900
 - I know, I know.

315
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,460
 - But I say stay true to your lights.

316
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,300
 So anyway, thank you Thomas.

317
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,140
 It was a good point.

318
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,980
 Oh, there was the largest ones are estimated

319
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,780
 of being about two meters.

320
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,620
 - Oh wow.

321
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,460
 - But they're just based on fragments.

322
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,900
 So you've got to scale up from the fragments.

323
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,180
 There's a bit imprecise, but.

324
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,180
 - Okay.

325
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,780
 - And also he answers, "Why there aren't giant humans?"

326
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,420
 - Oh yes, I've always wondered this.

327
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,220
 - He says, "We are the giant humans."

328
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,060
 - Oh yeah.

329
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,300
 - 'Cause all the others are little.

330
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,420
 - Oh, we're giants.

331
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,260
 - Yeah.

332
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,100
 - We are the giants.

333
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,940
 That's very cool.

334
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,740
 So the next time you feel, you know, disempowered.

335
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,580
 - Yeah.

336
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,540
 - Just remember, you're actually a giant.

337
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,460
 - Does that mean, in a million years' time,

338
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,260
 all the humans will be hobbit sized

339
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,020
 and they'll find our bones and think,

340
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,260
 oh, they used to be giants.

341
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,100
 - Yeah.

342
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,940
 - Interesting.

343
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,540
 - They might have been giants.

344
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,460
 (laughing)

345
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,300
 - It was a band.

346
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,140
 - It's a band.

347
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,620
 (laughing)

348
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,100
 - How does they do in 1998?

349
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
 (laughing)

350
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,660
 - It's the perfective version of the imperfective.

351
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,660
 They might be giants.

352
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,500
 - Yeah.

353
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,380
 - Wow.

354
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,460
 - They will have had to be giants.

355
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,380
 It's their future perfect.

356
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,220
 - Yeah.

357
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,060
 (laughing)

358
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,900
 - They would love that.

359
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
 If they're listening, they'll love that.

360
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,060
 'Cause they're very clever band, aren't they?

361
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,580
 They're always doing clever things.

362
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,780
 - They are, very clever.

363
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,340
 - They're very cool Thomas Aladay, he's a great author.

364
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,180
 - Yes.

365
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,500
 - Well, and actually, while we're on height,

366
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,860
 but still in the Ella episode,

367
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,340
 we talked about sci-fi, Elliot Boyd Smith writes,

368
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:17,020
 as a six foot nine inch, 16 year old,

369
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,020
 who will likely grow even more,

370
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,020
 I am very used to the multitude of comments

371
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,100
 about my height in almost all aspects of my life.

372
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,580
 However, as an avid fish fan and club fish member,

373
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,020
 I did not expect to be so viciously attacked

374
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,100
 by the members of my favorite podcast.

375
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,860
 - Oh, because Ella said that all the tall people die.

376
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,100
 - Oh, okay.

377
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,260
 - In episode 601, while discussing mundane sci-fi,

378
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,980
 Dan, quite randomly, shared the fact

379
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,620
 that the writer of Jurassic Park was six foot nine.

380
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,460
 He then proceeded to call him a dinosaur,

381
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,460
 sparking Elliot to tell me I'm going to die

382
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,860
 earlier than everyone else.

383
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,340
 (laughing)

384
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,140
 I'm sure all your other freakish listeners

385
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,420
 were just as shocked by the unprovoked attack from Dan,

386
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,460
 especially considering most of us are literal bigfoot's.

387
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,540
 (laughing)

388
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,140
 Thanks from the tall community, Elliot.

389
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,980
 - There you go.

390
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,820
 - One light the hobbit.

391
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,780
 (laughing)

392
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,780
 - I feel that in, it wasn't a random fact.

393
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,500
 It was connected, we had mentioned dinosaurs earlier,

394
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,540
 and so I was, I was relating to that.

395
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,260
 - But, I thought that was, come on,

396
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,900
 Michael Crichton comes in the room,

397
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,980
 taller than the velociraptor in the movies.

398
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,380
 Are you kidding me?

399
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,460
 - He struggled with the door handle

400
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,660
 from it on the outside, but he just couldn't imagine.

401
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,340
 - Your glass of water is wobbling.

402
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,740
 Oh, Crichton's on his way.

403
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,780
 (laughing)

404
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,700
 - Well, you've done it again.

405
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,220
 (laughing)

406
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,460
 - This is a polity corner, not come up with extra jokes.

407
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,180
 We didn't think of last time cornering.

408
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
 (laughing)

409
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,140
 - My point is it wasn't an attack.

410
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,700
 There's no attack on the people.

411
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,860
 - Can I, and this is a possibility

412
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,300
 that we can put a photo up that's on my phone.

413
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,140
 - Oh yeah.

414
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,740
 - So we did a show with Richard Usman recently,

415
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,180
 and we got a member of the audience to come up on stage

416
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,820
 and be against him in a quiz, okay.

417
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,860
 Now, Richard Usman is six foot seven, yeah.

418
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,740
 The member of the public was also around six foot seven.

419
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,620
 You two are taller than me.

420
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,860
 You're above that six foot six, one, something like that.

421
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,860
 I'm about five, 10, five, 11.

422
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,340
 So I'm not that small, but I'm just an average height.

423
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,220
 But something about the photo where you two are in the front,

424
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,620
 and then Usman and this guy are stood right next

425
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,660
 to me, I look like a literal puppet.

426
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,060
 I look so small in that photo.

427
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,900
 - So funny.

428
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,900
 - I've seen that one.

429
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,740
 - I've seen it either.

430
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,580
 - They put that up.

431
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,420
 - That's great.

432
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,580
 - I got measured last night, and full body liked, yeah.

433
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,540
 I thought that I was six foot one,

434
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,900
 and this lady last night said that I was six foot.

435
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,140
 And it was a real...

436
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,940
 - Well, as you get older, you do shrink.

437
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,100
 - So in your four days, do you shrink?

438
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,940
 - Oh yeah.

439
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,580
 - Have I prematurely started shrinking?

440
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,420
 - I think, I saw this fact on Oprah when I was about 12,

441
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,660
 so it's probably not true,

442
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,380
 that every year after you're about 35,

443
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,820
 you shrink a sixteenth of an inch.

444
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,660
 - Right.

445
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,500
 - Okay.

446
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,340
 - Really?

447
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,340
 - How interesting.

448
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,940
 - Yeah, and again, like heavy, heavy quote marks around me.

449
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,780
 - Well, I haven't measured myself for a while,

450
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,220
 so maybe, 'cause I am considerably over 35.

451
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,740
 Maybe I am that small.

452
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,340
 - Right, yeah.

453
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,220
 - So maybe, why are you getting so...

454
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,020
 - We had to, I mean, for now we had to get our medicals done

455
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,140
 for a thing for the house.

456
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,580
 We were doing a remorage, so...

457
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,420
 - All right.

458
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,060
 - So she did my height, she did my weight,

459
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,580
 she asked my my trouser size, so...

460
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,460
 - What kind of mortgage device are in this?

461
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,460
 - Sorry.

462
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,300
 Before we work out whether you are on a 5.5% or a 6%,

463
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,980
 can you tell me if you dress to the left?

464
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,300
 - On the right, so...

465
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,980
 (laughing)

466
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,620
 - Yeah, sorry, you fall for another local apartment.

467
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,540
 It just happens time and again.

468
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,700
 Well, she was very nice, me and my wife both liked her.

469
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,300
 She was a fiora, lovely lady.

470
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,180
 But she said, so she got all my measurements,

471
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,940
 and now I was in the room with Ben.

472
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,020
 And she said to Phinella, so she did her height,

473
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,700
 did her weight, and then she said breast size.

474
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,420
 And Phinella went, "Oh."

475
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,660
 And then told her, "Fold her a brass size, right?"

476
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,140
 I won't say what it was, but she just told her a brass size.

477
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,980
 And this woman staring at her, just went,

478
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,260
 I said, "Dress size."

479
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,760
 (laughing)

480
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,100
 Breast size is the next question down matter.

481
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,660
 Right now, breast size.

482
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,340
 (laughing)

483
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,220
 - Thanks so much, I'm not a mortgage thing.

484
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,380
 My very nice mortgage device,

485
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,740
 that David has never once asked me for my inseam.

486
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,580
 - I'm sorry.

487
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
 - Okay, I'll have to check that out.

488
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,420
 - You too.

489
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,260
 - Yeah.

490
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,420
 I gave him my urine.

491
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,420
 (laughing)

492
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,540
 - I'm sorry, she said.

493
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,820
 - You did when she told you what you'd be paying

494
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,660
 for the next two years.

495
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,780
 (laughing)

496
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,220
 - What's actually happened here is that Phinella

497
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,500
 has got a life insurance policy out on you

498
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,260
 and told you it's a mortgage thing.

499
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,660
 - Really wearingly, she has three out on me.

500
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,940
 It's absolutely true.

501
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,340
 And you know me, I'm the kind of guy

502
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,580
 that's gonna die in a really stupid way.

503
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,740
 It's just gonna look like she had me killed

504
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,300
 and she's gonna go to jail.

505
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,980
 It's just gonna look suspicious as hell.

506
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,060
 - Damn.

507
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,900
 - Stunning.

508
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,740
 - Anyway, it's absolutely stunning.

509
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,580
 - A bit of protein in my urine.

510
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,700
 Gotta get that checked out.

511
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,660
 (laughing)

512
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,500
 Do we have more?

513
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,340
 - We've got more.

514
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,180
 - Cool.

515
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,900
 - This, oh, this is another room actually.

516
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
 Do you remember we talked about wasps?

517
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,740
 - Yes.

518
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,980
 - Need more.

519
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,340
 - We talked about wasps.

520
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,180
 (laughing)

521
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,300
 - These small yellow insects.

522
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,140
 (laughing)

523
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,980
 - Okay, yeah.

524
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,820
 - Yes, we did.

525
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,460
 And it was also on the yellow show.

526
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,300
 - Yeah.

527
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,820
 - And we discussed how they were different from bees,

528
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,980
 for instance. - Yes.

529
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,260
 - And Andy said that in the summer,

530
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,740
 they switched from going after ham to jam

531
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,580
 or the other way around.

532
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,340
 - Ham to jam, ham to jam.

533
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,460
 - So this is, I'm so sorry James,

534
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,180
 I think this might be something you said.

535
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,820
 This is a lovely email from Aspen Kennedy.

536
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,660
 - Great name.

537
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,660
 Aspen Kennedy.

538
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,780
 - Yeah, it's a really good name.

539
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,620
 - Pretty cool.

540
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,780
 - Yeah.

541
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,620
 - Yeah.

542
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,060
 - A long time listen, a big fan of the podcast.

543
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,620
 I do want to pull you up on one thing you said

544
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,100
 in this week's episode, however.

545
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,380
 You said.

546
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,220
 - Love that.

547
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,700
 I love it when that just isn't.

548
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,700
 - Yeah, I'm putting the tone in there.

549
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,060
 But anyway, you said that mud-dorber wasps

550
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,620
 present a hazard to airliners

551
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,340
 as they build nests in the engines.

552
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,180
 - Yeah.

553
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,180
 - Which is not correct.

554
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,020
 - Oh.

555
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,100
 - A wasp nest would have zero impact on a jet engine.

556
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,420
 They're designed and tested to be able

557
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,100
 to ingest whole frozen chickens

558
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,900
 and still function correctly.

559
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,020
 The wasps actually cause a problem.

560
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,660
 This is pedant of the week, I think.

561
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,500
 - Okay.

562
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,540
 - When they build their nests in the pitot tubes,

563
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,900
 which are used to measure a plane's airspeed,

564
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,780
 there are these tiny tubes on the outside of the plane.

565
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,980
 They have a little revolving thing in them, basically.

566
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,820
 - Yeah.

567
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,660
 - They have a little thing which measures airspeed.

568
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,500
 - Okay.

569
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,100
 - Or it might be to do with pressure differentials, I think.

570
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,300
 Anyway, that's because on,

571
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,860
 they do this by measuring the pressure of the air,

572
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,420
 I've got to read these emails before I read them out.

573
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,060
 They do this by measuring the pressure of the air,

574
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,900
 rushing through the tube

575
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,300
 and comparing it to the static external pressure.

576
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,420
 If wasps build their nests in the pitot tube,

577
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,980
 it might either cause an erroneously low airspeed reading

578
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,580
 if minimal air is entering the tube

579
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,540
 or an erroneously high one.

580
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,100
 If the mud is blocking the air from escaping,

581
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,700
 this then causes issues with various other computer systems

582
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,500
 in the plane that are relying on 40 readings.

583
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,780
 It might even cause the pilots

584
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,180
 to respond to the incorrect speed

585
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,980
 and slow the plane below stall speed

586
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,980
 in the belief that it's going far too fast.

587
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,820
 - Yes, yes.

588
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,580
 - 'Cause they just get this reading saying

589
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,180
 you're doing a thousand miles an hour, slow, slow, slow.

590
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,660
 And then they slow down and actually they're slowing down

591
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,180
 to a hundred miles an hour and then they crash.

592
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,940
 And there was a flight,

593
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,340
 Bergen Air Flight 301, which crashed shortly after takeoff

594
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,420
 from the Dominican Republic

595
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,420
 after the pilots incorrectly responded

596
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,140
 to the erroneous speed readings.

597
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,980
 - Okay.

598
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,900
 - What have we done to fix this issue?

599
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,340
 - Plains on the ground have covers placed over the tubes

600
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,180
 to prevent this.

601
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,020
 You just put a cover over there.

602
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,220
 - Yeah, there you go.

603
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,740
 - So James, I would say basically right.

604
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,740
 You just said engine instead of PTO tubes.

605
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,700
 - Well, you know, the number of times

606
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,140
 I've made that mistake when I get

607
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,100
 to the mechanics just look at my car.

608
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,940
 I think it's a problem with my PTO tubes.

609
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,780
 That's a sorry, it's your engine.

610
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,220
 Oh, okay, no fair enough.

611
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,220
 I didn't know all that extra information,

612
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,220
 which is very interesting.

613
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,060
 - Really incredible.

614
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,100
 - I once heard, oh, you should never get maggots

615
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,620
 in your PTO tube and I've always remembered it.

616
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,340
 Such a precise thing to remember

617
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,380
 like under the beard of advice.

618
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,060
 - Where's your PTO tube on a...

619
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,180
 - I don't have a PTO tube.

620
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,020
 - Oh, okay.

621
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,860
 - On airplanes, you mean?

622
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,700
 - Yeah.

623
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,980
 - Is it an exclusively...

624
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,380
 That cars don't have a PTO tube?

625
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,220
 There's no...

626
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,060
 - No, no, no, no.

627
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,900
 - They don't...

628
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,020
 I don't think they need to rely on external pressure sensors

629
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,020
 to work out the speed.

630
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,860
 - I just don't know the multiple uses it might have.

631
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,300
 - I suppose, because how do cars measure your speed?

632
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,620
 By the wheels going...

633
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,220
 I mean, the wheels on the bus go round and round, don't they?

634
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,420
 So you just measure how far the wheels have...

635
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,820
 How many times the wheels have gone?

636
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,540
 - I actually don't know how that works.

637
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,380
 - No.

638
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,380
 - Well, yeah, they used to, I mean, Roman times,

639
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,780
 there was the first invention of a pedometer, I guess,

640
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,820
 would be the turn of a wheel, right?

641
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,180
 So no matter how far you're going,

642
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,180
 the turn of the wheel will turn the wheel.

643
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,900
 - A turn of the wheel, we would call that at school.

644
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,300
 - Oh, yeah.

645
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,140
 - Try not to...

646
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,180
 Do you have a turn of the wheels at school?

647
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,020
 - No.

648
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,580
 - How did you measure things that were one meter in length?

649
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,380
 - Probably, we used that.

650
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,180
 - They're not talking about town's body, yeah.

651
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,260
 - We used our lifestyles currently, but no poster.

652
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,460
 (laughing)

653
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,620
 - Chop a head off, that's meter, yeah.

654
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,940
 - So yeah, I guess that could work in theory,

655
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,500
 although it seems like an odd way of doing it.

656
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,340
 - It does seem like a very...

657
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,540
 As I said it, I thought that can't be how they do it.

658
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,740
 - Because if I attach my Google Maps to my car,

659
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,300
 so it's using Google Maps as a satnav,

660
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,460
 that can tell me how fast I'm going as well.

661
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,140
 And that must be using satellite.

662
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,820
 - That's using satellites, but the car won't be doing,

663
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,460
 and what no modern car might do.

664
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,300
 - Yeah.

665
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,140
 - Pito tubes.

666
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,020
 - If you know how to speedometer's work, let us know.

667
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,860
 - It's such a risk saying stuff like that James.

668
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,660
 It's such a risk, 'cause I might get one email,

669
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,860
 which is brilliant and Chris, where I might get 400.

670
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,860
 - Okay, if you are the world expert on odometers,

671
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,740
 they're right into Andy.

672
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,900
 - That's it, there we go.

673
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,860
 - If you kind of half know how it works,

674
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,780
 or you just go on Google and check how it works,

675
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,100
 don't write it to Andy.

676
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,700
 - He said right in.

677
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,420
 James Delce, just finished off the wasp chat.

678
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
 - Mm-hmm.

679
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,900
 - Do you remember I was banging on about that book,

680
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,460
 Endless Forms by Professor Sarian Sumner,

681
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,380
 which is all about wasps.

682
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,220
 - And he hates bees.

683
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,060
 - Very good book.

684
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,740
 - Yeah, she actually.

685
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,060
 I wonder whether Professor Sarian Sumner

686
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,980
 of wasp ham and jam fame is in any way related

687
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,500
 to Gordon Sumner of police and sting fame.

688
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,740
 (laughing)

689
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,580
 - Okay.

690
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,540
 - Yeah, really a bass player?

691
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,380
 - No, guitarist?

692
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,500
 - No, he stings, he stings.

693
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,780
 - Oh, Gordon Sumner, of course.

694
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,620
 He has the singer to take a songwriter.

695
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,980
 - I think that's the best joke we've had this month

696
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,820
 in the inbox.

697
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,660
 - Yeah.

698
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,580
 - I'm gonna give James a preliminary, J-O-T-M.

699
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,820
 - Jotum, is that what we're gonna call this?

700
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,940
 - Jotum, Jotum, Jotum, Jotum, the month, yeah.

701
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,780
 - Yeah, okay.

702
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,140
 - Jotum, we're doing it by weekly.

703
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,260
 So is it two episodes worth of Jotum?

704
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,100
 - Jotum.

705
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,940
 (laughing)

706
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,180
 - Jotum, the fortnight, yeah.

707
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,940
 - Yeah, great.

708
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,860
 Let's have another.

709
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,700
 Spoons.

710
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,540
 - Oh yeah.

711
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,980
 - We talked to Richard Osmond about the masked spooner.

712
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,820
 - Oh, yeah.

713
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,660
 - Oh, yeah.

714
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,140
 - And we've had an email very pleasantly

715
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,580
 from Cindy Forkel.

716
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,420
 - Brilliant.

717
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,260
 - While you've been joking.

718
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,100
 - Thank you, Cindy.

719
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,860
 And do you remember, I tried to get that

720
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,180
 Spoon's quiz off the ground.

721
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,020
 - Oh, yeah.

722
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,860
 - The Spoon, Idiom Mean.

723
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,700
 - Yes.

724
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,540
 - How's that going?

725
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,220
 (laughing)

726
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,780
 - It's in development.

727
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,620
 - It's in development.

728
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,700
 I've had a lot of interest.

729
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,540
 - Yeah.

730
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
 - It's from major broadcasters.

731
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,380
 - Thought you would.

732
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,700
 - Yeah, about Ms. Forkel could be a host.

733
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,940
 - You're absolutely right.

734
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,980
 - You're absolutely right.

735
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,980
 - That's gonna turn the dial of the commission, isn't it?

736
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,420
 - You can see it in Andy's eyes.

737
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,620
 I'm gonna email them right after this.

738
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,340
 - When you sent us this pitch first,

739
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,660
 we were a flat-note.

740
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,740
 (laughing)

741
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,220
 Hearing that you've got Forkel involved.

742
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,300
 (laughing)

743
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,500
 - She hasn't said yes yet.

744
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
 - Oh no.

745
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,620
 - I'll imply she has.

746
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,260
 - I know how a pitch works.

747
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,900
 - Forkel, like instead of being a TV show,

748
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,540
 you could sell it to the New York Times

749
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,060
 as like a daily quiz.

750
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,780
 - The New Forkel Times.

751
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,620
 - Really?

752
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,460
 - Yeah.

753
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,340
 - But you know, like you have word-o and stuff.

754
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,180
 - Yeah.

755
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,020
 - That's forkel.

756
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,860
 - Yeah.

757
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,700
 - Go on.

758
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,900
 - Well, it's a different cutlery idea every day.

759
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,740
 - Yeah.

760
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,580
 - That's really okay.

761
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,420
 Actually, this is really good.

762
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,460
 - Oh, it's like a crossword where the first three letters

763
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,180
 is the same, but then it trails off into three

764
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,580
 different options to end it.

765
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,420
 - Yeah.

766
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,500
 - So you can have fork, fore, and foreskin.

767
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,340
 - Perfect.

768
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,180
 - There you go.

769
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,180
 - We've got, right, puzzle one.

770
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,180
 This is gonna make our millions.

771
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,100
 She just adds that the idiom to hand over the spoon.

772
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,940
 - Oh, yeah.

773
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,780
 - Is that a new one?

774
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,860
 - Well, I said to stick one spoon in the wall.

775
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,700
 - Yeah.

776
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,540
 - Means to die.

777
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,380
 - Yeah.

778
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,660
 - The German language has then lothal abgabin

779
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,980
 to hand over the spoon.

780
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,300
 And that means to die.

781
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,940
 - Oh, I don't think when we put it on Instagram,

782
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,740
 we had someone saying in South Africa, it's a phrase too.

783
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,100
 So it's a thing.

784
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,940
 - Yeah.

785
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,780
 - It's a phrase around the world.

786
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,260
 It just happens not to exist in English anymore.

787
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,420
 - It's not weird.

788
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,260
 - Love that.

789
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,020
 - Right, here's a controversial one.

790
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,900
 And it's from the Poundland section we did

791
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,060
 with Richard Osmond.

792
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,900
 - Oh yeah.

793
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,100
 - Tiana from Queens, New York.

794
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
 - New fork.

795
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,220
 - New fork, new fork.

796
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,060
 - Right.

797
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,860
 Just wanted to give my two cents about toilet lights.

798
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
 They are fantastic.

799
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,580
 (laughing)

800
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,380
 - Oh dear, okay, for new listeners.

801
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,140
 This was the fact that in Poundland,

802
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,300
 was it Orinalde or somewhere you could buy these lights

803
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,740
 that go on the inside of your toilet.

804
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,300
 And we supposed what kind of video might need that.

805
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,260
 Because who turns the light on when they go to the toilet?

806
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,100
 - Yeah.

807
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,100
 - Well, we're the kind of video James,

808
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,100
 'cause we don't turn the light on.

809
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,140
 - Absolutely.

810
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,980
 - Yeah.

811
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,820
 - Where he's turned the light on.

812
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,660
 - Yeah.

813
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,660
 - And who wakes up in the neighborhood?

814
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,900
 (laughing)

815
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,860
 Who are kind of powerful lights do you guys have?

816
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,860
 You live in lighthouses?

817
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,700
 Like what?

818
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,500
 (laughing)

819
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
 - It's jet crash onto the rocks

820
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,860
 'cause for the critical seconds of the lights

821
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,700
 it's good.

822
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,780
 I'd be in James standing there, like a piss.

823
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,300
 (laughing)

824
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,740
 Tiana just wants to say, they're fantastic.

825
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,740
 I've never been to Orinalde,

826
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,700
 so I've not experienced the Isle of Shame,

827
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,660
 but boy do I love my toilet light.

828
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,740
 The one we have cycles through 16 colors and is motion sensitive.

829
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,340
 So every time I walk into the bathroom it's a party.

830
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,220
 (laughing)

831
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,020
 Even with the toilet lid down and the bathroom light on,

832
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,940
 this thing is bright.

833
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
 Standing.

834
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,140
 Our primary purpose for owning and using this

835
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,540
 is not for providing light for middle of the night trips,

836
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,020
 though it certainly does do that job well.

837
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,540
 Mainly we use our toilet light to bring some joy and wonder

838
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,780
 to the bathroom experience.

839
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,780
 - That's what I get there.

840
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,220
 - It's a great conversation starter when we have guests

841
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,860
 and becomes even more thrilling

842
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,940
 when certain substances have been consumed.

843
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,420
 - Be true.

844
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,260
 - Asparagus?

845
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,260
 - Asparagus.

846
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,180
 - It sounds like drugs.

847
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,180
 It sounds like hard drugs.

848
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,180
 - Oh, I don't know.

849
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,020
 (laughing)

850
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,860
 - I don't know.

851
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,140
 I don't know, I might be wrong.

852
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,580
 But it does show up everything.

853
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,300
 So you do need to be quite as serious with cleaning the lid.

854
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,460
 - Oh, really?

855
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,460
 Yeah, yeah.

856
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,460
 - So I know, thank you, Tiana.

857
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,380
 Great review.

858
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,820
 - Yeah, great review.

859
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,140
 - I feel like Tiana is part of big toilet light.

860
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,180
 She's trying to make this a thing now that everyone buys them.

861
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,300
 She's got shares.

862
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,660
 'Cause it goes in under the thing.

863
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,500
 - Oh, is it like an LED strip that you put in?

864
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,580
 - I assume so.

865
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,140
 But how would it be lit up?

866
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,060
 - It would be the lid opening.

867
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,940
 Sorry, I thought it needed a jet of urine

868
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
 in order to light up.

869
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,060
 But then how do you get it on target in the first place?

870
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,020
 - Hmm, anyway, Sarah Crocker, right?

871
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,980
 Crocker can go with forkle in the, in my show.

872
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,780
 (laughing)

873
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,740
 Long time fan of the show and a club fish member.

874
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,700
 So hello, Sarah.

875
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,340
 I was listening to your latest mail bag show earlier today.

876
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,100
 I was chuckling over your comments about Eric Carmen.

877
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,940
 - Oh, right, yeah.

878
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,100
 - Oh yeah.

879
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,940
 It's a musician.

880
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,420
 - Yeah, or by myself.

881
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,820
 So the Richard Osmond episode as well.

882
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,060
 - Right, right, yeah.

883
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,540
 - I'm currently retired and living in Bucket,

884
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,220
 Bucket Day, Panama.

885
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,860
 But I was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio as was Eric.

886
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,060
 In fact, we dated as teenagers.

887
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,900
 - No!

888
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,740
 - Oh!

889
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,220
 - Oh my gosh.

890
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,060
 - When he was in a local band called The Harlequence.

891
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,220
 It was clear he had talent as a musician, singer,

892
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,620
 and songwriter, even at that age.

893
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,940
 And I was so enthralled to be his girlfriend.

894
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,180
 Well, until he broke up with me.

895
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,580
 - And you were all by yourself.

896
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,420
 - I'm pretty.

897
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,780
 (laughing)

898
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,700
 - I genuinely thought that's where that was going.

899
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,460
 (laughing)

900
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,660
 - No, actually he didn't do it all by himself.

901
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,860
 He had a mutual friend called to break up with me.

902
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,860
 - That's so funny.

903
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,700
 - What a dick.

904
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,540
 - What a rutter.

905
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,380
 - Oh my God.

906
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,900
 - I think I cried straight for about nine months.

907
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,460
 I was a teenager after all, then decided he wasn't worth it.

908
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,780
 Good for you, Sarah.

909
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,500
 - Wow, he uses other musicians to write his songs

910
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,420
 and he uses other people to break up with his girlfriends.

911
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,500
 - Hi, it's an act man and off here.

912
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,940
 (laughing)

913
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,340
 - My friends tell me to tell you something.

914
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,100
 (laughing)

915
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,540
 - Superb.

916
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,020
 Oh, so thank you very much, Sarah.

917
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,540
 That's a brilliant, brilliant email.

918
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,380
 - That's awesome.

919
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,380
 - Elliot Jeffries writes, "Hello, fish folk.

920
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,540
 On the matter of fish lines,

921
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,260
 making their way into common parlance,

922
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,300
 I frequently use the phrase "friend of the podcast"

923
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,780
 to refer to people frequently discussed with friends.

924
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,620
 For instance, Oscar Wilde, J.S. Bach,

925
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,380
 and Richard Armitage are all friends of the podcast.

926
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,980
 None of my friends who I've said this to understand it,

927
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,580
 but have accepted it.

928
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,260
 - So that's nice.

929
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,540
 - There's one name on there that I couldn't work out

930
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,580
 who it was.

931
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,740
 - J.S. Bach.

932
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,580
 - Yeah.

933
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,140
 - It was the Richard Armitage.

934
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,980
 - Armitage.

935
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,820
 - Who was Armitage?

936
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,660
 - I can't remember.

937
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,180
 - He invented the Armitage Shanks toilet.

938
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,020
 - Now available with light up bowl.

939
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,660
 (laughing)

940
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,340
 - Do you know who Richard Armitage is?

941
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,180
 - Look at filmmaker.

942
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,020
 - Is it?

943
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
 - Should we look it up?

944
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,860
 - Yeah.

945
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,700
 - There's someone with a similar name

946
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,340
 who's like a forced racing goner.

947
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,180
 - I'll check.

948
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,700
 - But I don't think that's him.

949
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,540
 - Oh.

950
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,580
 - Richard Armitage, English actor, voice actor and author,

951
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,460
 his role as Dorf King and leader in Peter Jackson's film,

952
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,300
 The Hobbit.

953
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,140
 - Oh, give me a break.

954
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,980
 - No.

955
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,420
 - No way.

956
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,340
 Oh my God, look at the size of his feet.

957
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,300
 (laughing)

958
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,140
 - Really?

959
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,980
 - Yeah.

960
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,860
 - Wow.

961
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,780
 - Friend of the podcast.

962
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,620
 - Friend of the podcast.

963
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,660
 - Well, friend of Elliot Jeffries's personal podcast.

964
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,740
 - That's great.

965
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,820
 That's really funny.

966
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,660
 - What are the odds?

967
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,500
 - What are the odds?

968
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,780
 - We've had a controversy bit.

969
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,620
 - Oh yeah.

970
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,020
 - Daniel from Wagger Wagger.

971
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,860
 - Right.

972
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,700
 - Wow.

973
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,860
 - I know.

974
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,100
 - A truly a global show.

975
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,620
 - So good, they named it twice.

976
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,460
 - That's right.

977
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,540
 (laughing)

978
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,020
 - Just catching up with some special episodes.

979
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,980
 As I do, when I have the occasion for long drives,

980
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,260
 where does Wagger Wagger do?

981
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,100
 - It's Australia.

982
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,260
 - No, no, come on.

983
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,300
 - It's right in the middle, isn't it?

984
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,340
 - I can't actually remember, yeah.

985
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,180
 - Is it in the bit where they have quiz questions

986
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,180
 on the road to the road?

987
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,940
 - Well, it sounds like if there's long drives,

988
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,700
 that's gonna come up is where the road goes through.

989
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,540
 I'm guessing.

990
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,700
 - Well, Daniel, in fact, Daniel,

991
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,220
 you might be listening to this now,

992
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,860
 because Daniel says, "Always have special interest

993
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,420
 "in the clubfish extra content."

994
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,260
 - There we go.

995
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,100
 - Hey, Daniel.

996
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,260
 - You're probably hauling a road train right now.

997
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,460
 - And we're gonna get to that.

998
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,860
 (laughing)

999
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,780
 - But Daniel asks critically,

1000
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,900
 how did Dan's fridge go bad?

1001
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,660
 And he didn't know it was unplugged.

1002
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,900
 Surely the light didn't work if it was plugged in.

1003
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,420
 Something doesn't add up.

1004
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,140
 - What?

1005
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,980
 - Okay.

1006
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,060
 - Your fridge went bad.

1007
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,900
 - Oh!

1008
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,740
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1009
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,580
 - And it turned out it was turned off at the wall.

1010
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,420
 - Yeah.

1011
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,420
 - And he thrown away all your delicate wagyu steaks

1012
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,860
 and everything had gone green and moldy.

1013
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,700
 - Yes.

1014
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,540
 - Wagyu wagyu.

1015
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,260
 (laughing)

1016
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,580
 - Absolutely, absolutely.

1017
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,860
 - So, sorry, I got lost in what you were saying,

1018
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,420
 repeat the point.

1019
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,540
 It was that how did you not know your fridge was unplugged?

1020
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,100
 Because surely the light wouldn't have worked.

1021
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,140
 - Well, you see, you and I,

1022
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,620
 when we get up in the night for a midnight snack,

1023
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,260
 and we go to the fridge to get some cheese,

1024
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,300
 we open the fridge door.

1025
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,620
 It's very obvious that the light sun,

1026
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,620
 but damn, turns all the emumination

1027
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,100
 and it's entire house sun.

1028
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,780
 So, he can't tell the difference.

1029
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,540
 (laughing)

1030
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,540
 - There we go.

1031
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,620
 - Yeah, I don't know an answer to that.

1032
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,340
 - No, I've got an answer, Dan, for you.

1033
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,460
 - Sorry, Daniel.

1034
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,580
 - If Dan's fridge, if the light wasn't working,

1035
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,460
 that's an extra reason to assume your fridge is broken.

1036
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,300
 Do you not mean?

1037
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,140
 - Yeah.

1038
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,980
 - Like if the light's not coming on,

1039
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,740
 and it's clearly gone all warm.

1040
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,740
 - Yeah.

1041
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,740
 - The fact is, how did you not know

1042
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,740
 that it was unplugged in the wall,

1043
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,420
 but you frequently can't get to the socket.

1044
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,100
 The real mystery is not, how did you not know it was unplugged.

1045
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,580
 The real mystery is how did it become unplugged?

1046
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,420
 - Yeah.

1047
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,260
 - Or turned off at the socket.

1048
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,460
 Like what is going on there?

1049
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,060
 Because the socket is in excess, I'm presuming.

1050
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,060
 - It was pretty hard to get to.

1051
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,900
 - It's pretty hard to get to.

1052
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,740
 - Yeah.

1053
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,540
 - What or who, or whom?

1054
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,540
 - Yeah.

1055
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,660
 Turned off your fridge.

1056
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,660
 - So, I, has anyone got three life insurance policies on you?

1057
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,980
 (laughing)

1058
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,620
 (laughing)

1059
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,860
 - 'Cause it fell over on you, didn't it?

1060
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,700
 It was so strange.

1061
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,540
 - It's very weird.

1062
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,380
 - It's very weird.

1063
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,220
 - You normally don't.

1064
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,060
 - Yeah.

1065
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,780
 - You normally not the very stable things actually.

1066
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,860
 (laughing)

1067
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,100
 - Yeah, there's a lot of mysteries going on

1068
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,940
 in the house of the man.

1069
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,340
 - I'm sure we were with 32 C breaths swing.

1070
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,700
 (laughing)

1071
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,540
 - Oh, dear.

1072
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:07,540
 Shall we come to the sausage parlour?

1073
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,420
 - Yeah, we should.

1074
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,860
 - All right, we're getting close to shutting up shop.

1075
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,380
 On this week's drop of the line.

1076
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,580
 But don't worry, we'll be back again in two weeks.

1077
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,420
 - We will.

1078
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,820
 - With plenty more corrections,

1079
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,260
 including lots of corrections about things we said about Australia,

1080
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,860
 where Mel Bracewell was on the show.

1081
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,700
 They have been rolling in,

1082
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,620
 but I want to give the flood more time to build up

1083
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,820
 before releasing the pressure.

1084
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,660
 You know what I mean?

1085
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,900
 - Yeah, yeah.

1086
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,780
 - So let's just have some light emails about sausages

1087
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,860
 to round us off, okay?

1088
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,700
 (laughing)

1089
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,700
 - Gareth Taylor writes,

1090
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,740
 "You might be uninterested to hear."

1091
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,660
 (laughing)

1092
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,500
 - Well, disinterested.

1093
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,460
 - No, I am uninterested, actually I'm afraid.

1094
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,700
 - Because of some hearing loss,

1095
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,780
 I find F and S sounds very similar.

1096
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,660
 And in particular, the names of the letters themselves

1097
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,140
 sound virtually identical to me.

1098
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,140
 So when my partner reads me crossword clues

1099
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,700
 and says what letters we have so far,

1100
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,180
 she will say fish rather than F and sausage rather than S.

1101
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,180
 - Okay. - Oh, that's good, too.

1102
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,460
 - I can't remember why we chose those

1103
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,420
 as the substitutions,

1104
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,940
 other than fish and sausages are both great.

1105
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,940
 Well, episode 6-0-1 has just arrived,

1106
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,740
 and it's called no such thing as sausage by Chanel.

1107
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,900
 I wondered how many sausages you have given us over the years

1108
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,940
 as it's a familiar, fishy word.

1109
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,820
 So Gareth has done a quick look at which words

1110
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,940
 occur the most often in episode titles.

1111
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,020
 - Oh, sausage has to be, has to be the winner.

1112
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,860
 - Wow. - Oh really?

1113
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,580
 - And there's one coming up.

1114
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,420
 (laughing)

1115
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,580
 - Oh, I know, that's gonna be.

1116
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,740
 - There was one where we were in,

1117
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,860
 we were sat in a queue, signing books,

1118
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,540
 and someone said, "What will the title of this show be?"

1119
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,140
 And I said, "I don't know, we'll just make it up

1120
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,580
 when we do the show."

1121
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,780
 And they said, "Can you call it this?"

1122
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,820
 And I said, "Okay, so it's gonna be..."

1123
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,540
 - It's a sausage thing, it's gonna be sausage thing.

1124
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,940
 - Nice, I remember her, yeah.

1125
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,420
 - So you took out no such thing as,

1126
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,340
 and drop and line and all of that in, you know,

1127
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,660
 all the little words like "the" and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1128
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,540
 - And joint ninth place tied with "with" is sausage.

1129
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,380
 - In ninth.

1130
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,220
 - Yeah.

1131
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,060
 - Yeah.

1132
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,420
 - So it's one of the top 10 most frequent words.

1133
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,260
 - So we have the top 10.

1134
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,300
 - I would have put it absolutely number one.

1135
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,380
 I'm really surprised.

1136
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,380
 - Can you give us some clues?

1137
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,220
 This is a great game.

1138
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,140
 - Oh, sorry, if you take out A, the in and of four on and and with.

1139
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,980
 - Yeah, yeah.

1140
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,820
 - The next word is sausage.

1141
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,660
 - Oh, okay.

1142
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,980
 - It's the most common, proper word.

1143
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,820
 - Oh, really?

1144
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,660
 - Yeah.

1145
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,500
 - Oh, wow.

1146
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,420
 - I actually use the word sausage as a conjunction.

1147
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,260
 (laughing)

1148
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,500
 - So, okay, here's one.

1149
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,180
 Can you name any of the next five most common words?

1150
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,660
 - Pope.

1151
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,460
 - Oh, nice, not far off.

1152
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,380
 - Vatican?

1153
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,140
 - No, there is a title, Jesus.

1154
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,220
 - No, I wouldn't do that.

1155
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,580
 Oh, like Queen.

1156
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,900
 - Queen, brilliant.

1157
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,580
 - Okay, so Queen is one, King.

1158
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,420
 - Nope.

1159
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,820
 - Some kind of animal, maybe?

1160
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,820
 - There are no animals in there.

1161
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,700
 - No, a couple of adjectives.

1162
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,540
 - Oh.

1163
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,900
 - Oh, no such thing as a hairy.

1164
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,740
 - It's not hairy.

1165
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,300
 - A sausage, or, you know, big.

1166
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,140
 - No.

1167
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,300
 - No such thing as a.

1168
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,700
 - I'll give you one, yeah.

1169
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,860
 - Yeah, sexy.

1170
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,340
 - Really?

1171
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,180
 - Oh gosh.

1172
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,420
 - Okay.

1173
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,180
 - You've got three more to get from the top.

1174
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,180
 - This feels like a--

1175
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,260
 - Give a slight clues.

1176
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,260
 It's a kind of--

1177
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,100
 - Magic.

1178
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,940
 - Magic.

1179
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,780
 (laughing)

1180
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,940
 - Give a slightly more extreme clues, please.

1181
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,860
 (laughing)

1182
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,860
 - Queen.

1183
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
 (laughing)

1184
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:28,780
 - Crazy little thing called--

1185
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,300
 (laughing)

1186
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,940
 - No such thing as a magic love sausage, is there?

1187
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,140
 (laughing)

1188
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,580
 - No such thing as the Queen's magic love sausage.

1189
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,420
 (laughing)

1190
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,980
 - Once we've done that, we've just done it.

1191
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,220
 - That's the final episode.

1192
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,220
 - No, it's the final episode.

1193
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,980
 We won't even announce it when that pops up.

1194
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,340
 - There's one more, which is, what's a good example.

1195
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:55,820
 Blank.

1196
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,220
 Huh?

1197
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,060
 - Blank.

1198
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,900
 - Check.

1199
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,740
 - No.

1200
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,580
 - Blank.

1201
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,420
 - Blank, man.

1202
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,260
 - As a movie with--

1203
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,100
 - It.

1204
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,300
 - I think Taylor Swift.

1205
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,140
 - Blank.

1206
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,300
 - Kelt Travis Kelsey.

1207
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,340
 - Blank Space.

1208
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,180
 - Space.

1209
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,180
 - Oh, okay.

1210
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,500
 - She doesn't think of Blank Spaces, is she?

1211
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,340
 - I don't know.

1212
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,180
 - I don't know either either either.

1213
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,020
 - I don't know.

1214
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,860
 - All right.

1215
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,380
 (laughing)

1216
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,220
 And those are the five.

1217
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,620
 Sex Eat Love, Space, Queen, and Magic.

1218
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,460
 - Great.

1219
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,300
 - Wow.

1220
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,140
 - I know.

1221
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,060
 - Good, thank you very much, Gareth.

1222
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,900
 - Yeah.

1223
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,940
 - One final one, Todd Norbury writes, subject line,

1224
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,780
 with regards to your sausage conundrum.

1225
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,660
 Way back in episode 471, no such thing

1226
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,460
 as a toying costs bracket's classic dam.

1227
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,620
 You spoke about the time--

1228
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,740
 (laughing)

1229
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:43,460
 Can you spoke about the time you returned?

1230
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,300
 (laughing)

1231
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,140
 - Okay.

1232
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,100
 - I forgot about that.

1233
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,780
 (laughing)

1234
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,220
 - You spoke about the time you returned

1235
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,620
 to a takeaway shop to complain about a spicy sausage.

1236
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,220
 - Oh my goodness.

1237
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,300
 - Was this the genesis of spicy meat?

1238
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,220
 I didn't, I wasn't complaining about a spicy sausage.

1239
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,460
 I bought a spicy sausage

1240
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,300
 and I was unhappy with the quantity I've received

1241
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,140
 for the money.

1242
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,980
 - Yeah.

1243
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,140
 - Guys, don't bring this up to you.

1244
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,980
 - Sorry.

1245
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,260
 - Todd writes, "I was lucky enough to travel to the UK in July

1246
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,580
 and I also had a sausage moment.

1247
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,980
 I have attached a photo of the menu

1248
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,700
 and the nine-quid hot dog.

1249
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,980
 It caused a bit of chatter on the fish cord at the time.

1250
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,580
 I should have done what you did and complained

1251
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,580
 but the group was in a hurry

1252
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,460
 and I had to down it with copious amounts of water

1253
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,780
 to smooth the way.

1254
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:26,380
 No facts, just a shared sausage experience in the UK.

1255
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,180
 So I just wanted you guys to look at what we've got here

1256
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,220
 and say whether you think this is worth nine-quid.

1257
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,060
 - Okay.

1258
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,340
 - Oh my God.

1259
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,780
 - Where's the sausage?

1260
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,620
 (laughing)

1261
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,140
 - It's underneath that turd.

1262
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,860
 (laughing)

1263
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,700
 - Oh, good, is it?

1264
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,660
 - We're looking at, it's a sort of open bun

1265
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,140
 with a sort of dark void.

1266
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,220
 - I think to me, it looks like it's probably a vegan sausage

1267
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,420
 that's overdone.

1268
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,660
 - That's very unkind.

1269
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,140
 - No, it's just me like it doesn't have the,

1270
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,140
 it's kind of very cylindrical

1271
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,740
 like often those fake meat sausages are.

1272
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,580
 - Yes.

1273
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,420
 - Yeah.

1274
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,500
 - That's amazing.

1275
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,260
 - That looks like, have you ever looked at the hole

1276
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,300
 where Anish Kapoor did his van to a black?

1277
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,300
 (laughing)

1278
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,660
 That's what I feel like I'm looking at.

1279
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,500
 - Yeah.

1280
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,980
 - And what a reference that is.

1281
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,980
 - Yeah.

1282
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,860
 - And if you understood that reference,

1283
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,220
 you are in the right place.

1284
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,620
 (laughing)

1285
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,340
 - Oh, so there you go, I'm so sorry, Todd.

1286
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,020
 - Yeah, so you've absolutely been diddled there.

1287
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,860
 - I know.

1288
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,380
 - Do you never know where you get with the sausage?

1289
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,220
 - No, that's true.

1290
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,220
 - That's a beauty of it really.

1291
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,420
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1292
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,020
 - The next one will be better, you know?

1293
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,060
 But he came from New Zealand to the UK

1294
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,220
 and that was the sausage we gave him.

1295
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,380
 I just feel a bit about, you know, I feel a bit sort of,

1296
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,260
 oh, come on Britain.

1297
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,540
 Yeah, we can do better than that.

1298
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,460
 - We can, yeah.

1299
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,300
 - We can.

1300
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,140
 - Yeah.

1301
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,980
 - Okay.

1302
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,560
 (upbeat music)

1303
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:54,260
 - Well, that's it for this episode of "Droppers Aligned".

1304
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,260
 Thank you so much for listening.

1305
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,900
 If you enjoyed it, well, no matter whether you enjoyed it

1306
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,540
 or not, you'll be back again in two weeks with another one.

1307
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,860
 (laughing)

1308
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,700
 Yeah, thank you so much.

1309
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,060
 Thank you for all these emails, they're brilliant.

 We're going to have plenty more next time

1311

1312
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,700
 If something we've said has affected you,

1313
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,500
 there will be a hope line available

1314
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,340
 and the sausage help line.

1315
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,380
 - The sausage help line.

1316
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,980
 The help line is podcast.ky.com.

1317
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,140
 So just write it there.

 Thank you again.

 We'll see you next time.

 Bye.

1323

 (upbeat music)

1324
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,040
 (upbeat music)
