00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 They don't want it, or who don't want it?

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.200
 Hi!

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.280
 Bless you.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.960
 Lovely. Hello, Andy. Hello.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.240
 Welcome to Drop of the Line.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.600
 Uh, this is already in his feedback, but...

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.640
 And if you're listening at home, let's paint a picture.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.240
 There are three of us here, yep, because someone is now missing.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.720
 The last drop of the line had one extra fish.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.880
 Yep. She's gone. She's gone.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.560
 Only for nine months. She'll be back.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.920
 Yeah, yeah. Hope so.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.160
 She might look very different.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.600
 Don't think so. She might look like a white middle, middle-aged man.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.320
 And I'm a different name.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.160
 But she'll be back in spirit.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.360
 She will be back. Yeah.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.800
 She's having a great time.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.680
 Is she? Yeah.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.880
 I haven't kept in touch.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.080
 That's her. That's her.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.120
 I've been trying to observe the rules about employment law.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.760
 I don't think you're allowed to contact people when they're on maternity leave.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.440
 Well, I messaged her as a friend.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.760
 Yeah. That's where I went wrong.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.400
 And if you're listening with us, which I know you're not.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.320
 She's not listening to us.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.680
 Crazy.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.880
 All right, well, welcome to Drop of the Line.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.560
 This is a audience feedback segment.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.200
 The inbox.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.320
 Oh, it's been absolutely bursting.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.360
 Bulging. Oh, come on. Bulging. Overflowing.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.000
 Really?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Yeah, it's been big. It's been a big month.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.480
 We've got a lot to get through. Let's stop fanning about and let's get on with that.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.160
 Let's go on with that. All right.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.440
 Number one, Fact of the Week.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.040
 New segment that I've introduced.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.840
 Great.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.840
 From Andrew C.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.520
 Long time fan and recent clubfish member.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.800
 So hello, Andrew.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.480
 I have my first fish fact.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.760
 In South Carolina,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.720
 North is 90 miles southeast of New West.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.080
 So North is the name of a town.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.720
 Yep.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.080
 And New West is another town.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.000
 And I suppose that that means that

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.280
 New West is 90 miles northwest of North.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.720
 Right.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.520
 Do we have any details about these places?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.000
 Nothing.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.960
 Ah.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.200
 Because North might just be named after Lord North,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.520
 the Prime Minister.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.840
 He doesn't specify, but I can't imagine it isn't.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.080
 Yeah, no, that's just, that's just a terrific fact.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.200
 We don't know anything else about it.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.000
 We don't know anything about it.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.360
 I'm afraid not. The context is pretty slim here.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.280
 These places don't sound like they're massive.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.000
 I will say that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.560
 Yeah.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.120
 I always love going on the Wikipedia pages of these places

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.400
 because the notable people,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.560
 there's always just one person

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.120
 who is like the biggest basketball player,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.840
 you know, in the world, or it's always really fun.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.160
 Unincorporated, I'm guessing, these towns.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.200
 Again, Michael Jordan.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.440
 It's from all of those places.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.120
 Well, Michael Jordan played for North Carolina.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.840
 Where are we talking?

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.800
 South Carolina.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.440
 So close.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.000
 So close.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.560
 One long throw away.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600
 Anyway, Andrew, thank you. That's just a great fact.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.800
 Yeah, it's a really good fact.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.200
 Very good.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.080
 I feel like we're off the blocks.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.040
 But now we're also on the hook.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.080
 Section two is, get yourself off the hook.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.760
 I'm numbering the sections this month.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.240
 Okay.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.720
 Yeah.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.960
 Which of us is on the hook?

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.080
 Well, great news. It's Anna.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.040
 Dear Anna, I heard you say on the podcast

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.040
 that Singapore is the only country

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.120
 that sells other flavors of yakult.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.000
 Oh, no.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.560
 I've got terrible news for one member of the team.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.680
 How has me who said that?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.920
 Really?

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.840
 That's very honest.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.800
 I know.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.920
 Some people watching this.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.000
 I'll listen to this word of no on that.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.760
 And if I'd have kept stump,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.120
 it would have popped me in a bad light.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.800
 So it's tactical honesty in a way.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.000
 Yeah, fair enough.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.440
 You've been thought your hands been forced.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.400
 Well, James, apparently supermarkets

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.320
 across the channel do do too.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.880
 And then Bart has sent an image of some yakult plus

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.240
 Peer-Zick Smark from other...

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.080
 I can only assume the Netherlands.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.720
 Okay.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.480
 Yeah.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.240
 It's just a new N-E-U-W

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.560
 which suggests that it hasn't always been there.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.800
 Yeah.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.400
 That's a good point.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.360
 I think you're off the hook.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.920
 Whoa!

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.720
 Nice.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.520
 Easy.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.920
 What a great detective.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.520
 You just got given one bit of evidence.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.120
 So you're, like, you columboded it.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.200
 Just one more question.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.760
 That was great.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.560
 Vince writes, fun fact.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.920
 The only advert not to offer a discount on no such thing.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.440
 So we're an AdLan now, I'm afraid.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.760
 Okay.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.840
 Has been the BBC TV license advert.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.960
 Is that true?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.440
 Why?

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.960
 Where is the fish discount?

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.880
 No, that's not true.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.440
 It's not true.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.520
 Airbnb, we don't do a discount for it.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.320
 It's true.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.840
 We've done some charity ones

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.400
 which are sort of, you know, a horrible disease or something

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.280
 and then, like, you can't give a discount on that.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.760
 So...

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.160
 Yeah.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.960
 Quite rightly.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.920
 Quite rightly.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.560
 You can't get a discount, of course, on your TV license

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.680
 if you go black and white.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.440
 Can you still believe there is still one or two holdouts?

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.320
 That's fantastic.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.600
 Can you still get a half price?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.080
 I believe there are still one or two people in the country

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.920
 that have every now and then you get a news article

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.720
 don't you that says there are still 37 people

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.480
 with black and white TV licenses.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.280
 That's so good.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.880
 That's brilliant as half price, isn't it?

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.040
 Whenever the TV license and guy comes round,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.880
 they turn down the colour of my TV.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.960
 I saw a fact just yesterday,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.760
 which was, you know, the scene in The Wizard of Oz

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.720
 where it goes from black and white and then she opens the door

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.920
 in its color, Technicolor.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.800
 Technicolor.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.360
 So there is this little video that suggests,

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.800
 I'd want to say it's total fact,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.240
 but I just saw this the other day,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.000
 that the black and white,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.600
 they painted the inside of the room seepia, as it were,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.280
 and they did that to Dorothy as well.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.760
 So they put her in clothing, which was matching the colour

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.640
 and they did up her face to match the colour.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.200
 So the idea is that they filmed it in colour,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.040
 but they made it seem as if it was in...

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.440
 Brilliant, so when she opens the door,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.760
 they use a stunt double as the door opens

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.440
 of the background of her,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.680
 and then Dorothy, who's in her normal clothing,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.880
 walks into the colour.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.840
 So it's not a jump between black and white and colour,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.440
 the whole thing is in colour.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.480
 That's a really good idea.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.680
 If you go back and watch the clip again,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.440
 it's pretty remarkable if that's the case.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.640
 Yeah, if that's the case.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.480
 Did you say?

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.040
 Yeah, as I said, I saw a video on it yesterday,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.640
 but I didn't think this would come up.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.240
 I haven't checked it to verify it.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.720
 I believe it.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.600
 Kicking for me.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.400
 Oh, yeah?

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.200
 Kyla Jamison writes about, I don't know if you remember,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.760
 we mentioned a lake in Canada called, like, Minne Wanker.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.120
 Oh, yeah, we did.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.640
 And you said that it would be where Tom Cruise went or something?

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.640
 Something like something really unkind like that.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.520
 And I'm sorry, Tom, if you're watching.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.440
 And he probably is watching watches.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.280
 Yeah, he gets this footage, even though,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.440
 even if we don't release it, he'll get it.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.080
 Do you know what I mean?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.960
 It's being live streamed.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.680
 He's got power.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.560
 He's got power.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.560
 Yeah, anyway, it's pronounced Minne Wanker.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.560
 Oh.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.520
 That will be Wanker.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.160
 Yeah.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.320
 Minne Wanker's trucked up factory.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.800
 There you go.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.440
 Very nice.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.920
 Yep.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.200
 Source, I used to live near it.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.320
 It's lovely, says Kyla.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.200
 So thank you for that.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.000
 Yeah.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.840
 I'm just going to say that this podcast

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.840
 does have a history of mispronouncing things

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.800
 to come of effect.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.440
 It's true.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.360
 If you don't like that, listen to a different podcast.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.560
 Yeah.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.680
 We used to apologize, didn't we?

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.800
 Not anymore, which is--

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.760
 Well, now that we are--

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.440
 She gets a bit annoyed about it.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.720
 If she's not here, then.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.760
 So for the next nine months, we're off the blocks.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.400
 This is just a thing we said slightly wrong.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.040
 But it's from Josh McDonald from Atlanta, Georgia.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.120
 Anyway, we-- this is a very recent episode.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.720
 We talked about Quantum Baseball.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.080
 That was the reason-- the episode knows

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.040
 that's the thing is Quantum Baseball.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.600
 Yes.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.240
 So what happened was there was a question

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.120
 about how did one player play for two teams in the same match.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.760
 And you suggested it might have been a quantum effect.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.800
 And actually, the game was postponed halfway through.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.240
 And the game was transferred.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.280
 That's exactly right.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.040
 Well, in the course of that episode,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.200
 we also did a large bit about Sumo wrestling.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.800
 Is that it?

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.520
 So there was no reason for me to go into that.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.280
 But you were so fluent when you said it.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.160
 I thought, well, I can't.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:54.800
 I don't want to.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.320
 So the thing about Sumo wrestling--

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.400
 No, I could go through the whole thing.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.040
 But it was about them being unbicycles, I think.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.920
 Yes.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.760
 But Josh says, during the episode,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.200
 you're referred to the wrestlers as Sumo's multiple times.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.920
 But actually, that would be like calling a dance player a dart

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.400
 or a football ball.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.440
 Yeah, they're Yoko Zuma's, how they--

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.040
 He says Rikishi.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.800
 Oh, Rikishi.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.320
 Rikishi.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:17.840
 There we go.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.520
 Rikishi.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.480
 And you know what's something to do with wrestling?

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.960
 Yeah, it says WWE.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.400
 There was a wrestler that went under that name in the '90s.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.600
 Dan's eyes light up.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.400
 The bloodline.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.560
 Well, it's interesting, because Rikishi

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.400
 is related to Yoko Zuma, who you just mentioned is another thing.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.120
 And the current crop of the biggest stars in WWE

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.280
 are the son of Rikishi.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.280
 So--

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.280
 They're the son of what?

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.520
 Jay Uso is the son of the wrestler Rikishi,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.520
 who's one of the biggest wrestlers.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.520
 Jimmy Uso is one of the biggest--

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.760
 It's not that every single wrestler in WWE

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.720
 are all sons of this one.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.240
 I have to say.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.680
 No, no, no, that'd be crazy.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.000
 But compelling storyline.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.920
 Dominant bloodline.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.280
 We like succession.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.040
 But with being thrown through tables.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.280
 Yeah, it kind of is.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.800
 It kind of is.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.720
 Well, Josh has a fun fact, because of all the breeding exercises

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.760
 that the Sumo wrestlers do for training,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.320
 quite a few of them are excellent singers.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.480
 And he attaches a video of the now retired Coco Zuma

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.280
 Kaku Ryu singing Frank Sinatra's "My Way."

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.280
 Lovely.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.560
 Which I listen to earlier, and it's very good.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.080
 It's good.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.880
 He's got the chops.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.640
 It feels like "My Way" might be the name of a person

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.560
 in Japan or China.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.480
 Like "I Way Way."

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.360
 "I Way Way."

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.520
 "My Way Way" would have been a good show.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.200
 Yes.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.920
 That's a good show.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.520
 That's a good end.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.800
 If he's looking for a fringe, a number of fringe shows.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.600
 Absolutely.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.400
 I think he is.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.000
 Yeah.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.360
 All right, we now come to the "I'm Actuallys."

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:40.960
 OK.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.600
 Section three, I think.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.720
 Yes, we're in section three.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.320
 And the previous one was "Get yourself off the hook."

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.120
 So that was like, you're in trouble.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.440
 And this is just his extra stuff.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.160
 Can I just say this is terrible for the edit

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.520
 that you're putting everything in another,

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.400
 and you keep referencing the order of things?

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.720
 We can't leave anything around.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.840
 I want--

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.920
 I want you not to.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.840
 I want to--

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.280
 I want to ruin things.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.240
 Yeah, I'm in tricks to mode.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.000
 This is dark Andy, you're seeing now.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.520
 Is it?

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.600
 Yeah.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.680
 Well, we'll get through it.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.000
 Andrea Gilby.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.760
 Now, we really missed it.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.680
 We dropped a great opportunity.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.840
 We missed it, rather, in one of the Edinburgh shows.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.080
 There was Nish Kumar talking about Jimmy Hendrix.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.640
 I just listened to the latest episode

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.840
 and re-Nish's story about Jimmy Hendrix and the monkeys.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.760
 They toured together.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.360
 Jimmy Hendrix opened for the monkeys.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.520
 Yeah.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.360
 I don't know where.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.440
 There's a coronation street connection between them two.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.520
 Oh, really?

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.480
 So Jimmy Hendrix loved coronation street.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.480
 Yeah.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.640
 Davey Jones played the grandson of Ena Sharples

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.160
 in Coronation Street.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.680
 Wow.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.720
 So Jimmy Hendrix sort of seen Davey from the monkeys on TV.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.600
 And then--

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.440
 Potentially, if it was in the right--

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:53.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.520
 --and he actually didn't miss that day's episode or anything.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.720
 He played the who?

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.400
 The grandson of Ena Sharples.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.840
 OK.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.520
 When he was really young?

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.360
 It sounds like he was young.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.840
 Because it was before he moved to the USA

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.280
 to play the artful dodger in Oliver.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.720
 So he can't have been--

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.120
 Unless he was watching reruns.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.800
 Unless he was playing an old dodger.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.680
 We decided to re-imagine the role of Dodger.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.440
 A carster was like a 45-year-old man.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.440
 Yeah.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.640
 No, maybe Hendrix wasn't into Coronation Street

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.160
 at that point.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.720
 Anyway, we've had a fun audience message from Luke Delaney,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.960
 who was in Kev Lovic International Airport in Iceland.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:35.280
 And, as Anna mentioned, Jimmy Hendrix's phallic cast,

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.600
 where he got his thing cast in plaster.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.280
 And it's in the phallological museum in Reykjavik.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.640
 And an advert came up for the Iceland penis museum

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.680
 on the screen above the carousel, the baggage carousel,

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.000
 while Luke was waiting to get his bags.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.880
 And then he went fishing while listening

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.440
 to know such thing as a fish.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.040
 That's good.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.560
 Did he go to the museum?

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.200
 He didn't, because he was too busy fishing.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.280
 But he said--

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.560
 It's a small museum.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.280
 What was he called?

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.080
 Andrew.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.080
 Luke.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.200
 Honestly, you could do it in half an hour, Luke.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.760
 There you go.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.360
 But Luke was too busy catching this salmon.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.200
 Very cool.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.360
 A biggie, which he then did release.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.400
 And it went on its way.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.600
 While listening to fish.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.100
 Right.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.280
 So if you've got photos of you doing something extreme,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.040
 while listening to a podcast, like fishing,

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.000
 and the drop is a line.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.760
 I wonder how the owners of a phallic museum

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.880
 feel when someone calls it small.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.760
 You hear of the winter?

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.240
 There is.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.400
 Because we're sometimes called QI elves.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.000
 If you go to the phallological museum,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.680
 they also have displays of fictional characters

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.120
 on what their penises are like, and it has elf.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.000
 And then it says penis-sized, presumably small.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.280
 And they have a golf putter in the shape of a penis, which

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.280
 I used.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.800
 So you get to take it down and hit a ball.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.320
 Yeah.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.480
 It was just you could just pick it up and knock a golf ball.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.640
 There's no one of the precious display.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.120
 It's sort of what some of those museums are like.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.320
 Yeah, they have interactive stuff.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:06.840
 Exactly.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.600
 It was one of those.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.400
 This is the kids.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.400
 Does the ball look like a testicle?

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.120
 No, it's just like a golf ball.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.880
 Actually, don't know what a testicle would look like.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.120
 Mine looked like golf balls.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.720
 We do that.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.920
 Golf balls is a condition like tennis elbow, isn't it?

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.280
 It was--

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.400
 Let's have some spicy meat.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.400
 All right.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:27.880
 Let's do it.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.680
 Steve McCabe.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.440
 How many of these have we done, Andy?

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.280
 What'd you say, drop us a line?

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:33.960
 36.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.680
 I'm still not sure what spicy meat is.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.880
 It's like--

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.280
 I don't need to explain it.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:40.800
 Right.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.920
 Steve says, what section are we in now?

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.240
 I don't know what number it's section four.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.240
 OK.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.080
 For the edit.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.160
 Not sure how, or indeed, if you could use this one,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.880
 but it feels too good to not share.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.600
 Apparently, as you spicy meat, it's sort of gossip.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.880
 All behind the curtain stuff with the three of us.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.760
 Apparently, in the folklore of the Latter-day Saints,

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.440
 brackets, Mormons, Bigfoot is identified as Cain,

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.120
 the son of Adam and Eve in the Bible.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.840
 Just Google Cain, Bigfoot, and Mormons.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.560
 It's a great rabbit warring to go down.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.200
 And that was just because it was down-relevant.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.560
 I thought it was not very spicy that meat, to be honest,

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.560
 but I thought you might know about that already.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.320
 It's ringing a very, very, very distant bell.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.280
 That's cool.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:26.960
 Cool, anyway.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.000
 Question about Bigfoot.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.320
 Yeah.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.040
 Are they an individual?

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.600
 Or are they a species?

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.280
 Species.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.280
 In that case, if Cain is a Bigfoot, presumably able,

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.000
 his brother is also a Bigfoot.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.800
 Yeah.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.440
 Which makes Adam and Eve Bigfoot.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.440
 Yeah.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.000
 Wow, this is actually--

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.560
 So we're all Bigfoot, is what I'm saying.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.480
 We're all Bigfoot.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.480
 Oh, that's a nice theory.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.840
 Mystery solved.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.000
 This detective work that James is doing in this show is wild.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.600
 Liz May, this is stunning.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.160
 This is a dance-centric, potential identity theft.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.040
 He may need to consult a lawyer.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.640
 God, God.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.720
 All right.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.520
 No, they're done.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.520
 You have been ripped off.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.040
 Have I?

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.000
 You've been ripped off.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.960
 Is there a headline?

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.600
 You could walk--

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.120
 Idiot seed.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.200
 No, no.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.120
 Dan, you could get potentially hundreds

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.360
 of thousands in compensation.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:17.880
 OK.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.160
 There's a Japanese anime, where one of the main characters

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.480
 has wavy dark hair.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.200
 OK, I'm sorry, but in Japanese anime,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.040
 I imagine a lot of the characters have wavy dark hair.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.120
 It's common.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.920
 Glasses and an obsession with all things

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.000
 cryptid.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.960
 In the second season, he fights a Mongolian death worm.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.600
 Here comes the kuda grass.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.960
 The show is called Dan, Dad, Dan.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.840
 Oh, Dan, the Dan, I've seen that show.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.160
 That was it.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.480
 I not watched it all the way through by seeing clips of it.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.280
 Oh, OK.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.280
 And is that the fur--

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.080
 I guess so.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.800
 I didn't see it before, but yeah, I see that now.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.080
 Who's dollar from home?

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.720
 Do you think I modeled myself of a Japanese anime?

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.920
 It's possible.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.360
 We've always had questions.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.920
 Whenever my son is in a touristy area, my youngest kid,

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.520
 if there is a group that are from Japan,

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.240
 they all respond to his look, because he has very curly,

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.960
 wild hair, as if they point.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.960
 They don't point to any of our other kids, and they don't see them.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.440
 And they kind of go, oh, and it suggests

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.080
 that he looks exactly like an anime that's over there.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.280
 And I haven't been able to find--

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.160
 So maybe my whole family has been--

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.600
 I'm not sure about that.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.160
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:29.680
 I don't know.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.080
 For instance, my daughter got a similar thing

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.320
 when we were in Sicily, but I think

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.160
 it's because she's very blonde and very fair-skinned,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.960
 and it's kind of different to the people in Sicily.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.320
 And so they really like blonde kids, do you know what I mean?

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.000
 Yeah, because it's an unusual--

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.040
 I think so.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.000
 Oh, maybe she's part of a Sicilian anime.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.880
 Maybe she looks exactly like one of the heads of the Camaro

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.560
 crime family, that's it.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.560
 They all fled in fear, whenever she walked down the street.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.960
 Little Bella was here.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.600
 Little Bella.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.320
 She looked like Molly Brando.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.320
 She talks like him.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:14.840
 Hit now, this is pretty spicy meat.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.360
 Cam Tockos, right?

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.640
 Hello from Kansas City, Missouri.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.160
 Hello.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.560
 So global a show with a very heavy accentuation towards the USA.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.480
 My name is Cam, and I have a very fun fact

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.160
 to share about Dan's book, The Theory of Everything Else.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.160
 OK.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.000
 Dan, a copy of your book is currently

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.960
 doing a submarine tour at Brackett's classified location,

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.760
 many, many miles underwater.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.280
 What?

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.680
 My younger brother is currently working on a submarine,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.480
 where he is heavily restricted on what he can carry on.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.760
 About an hour ago, my mom informed me

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.240
 that she sent him your book in his latest care package.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.080
 There's like, it's a bit lightweight, isn't it?

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.640
 That'll be part of it.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.560
 Can't really put any of that in the adjacent,

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.240
 because there's such effe tones.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:58.920
 That's thick.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.920
 What you need to write is a 30-page.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.280
 Oh, that's amazing.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.400
 That's incredible.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.360
 And it's got a good review.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.960
 My brother wrote to her from underwater saying

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.480
 he enjoyed the read.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.360
 Oh, cool, is that?

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.320
 That's incredible.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.000
 Thank you for sending that in.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.400
 Now, this was a bit I wasn't in,

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.400
 but it was in one of the Edinburgh episodes.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.920
 Gonzalo writes, we don't know where from.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.720
 In fact, number two about Pigs on Trial.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.560
 Dan mentioned how in China, some farms created pig toilets.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.360
 OK, yeah.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.960
 Now, can you just remind the listener?

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.240
 My memory of it is that the idea is

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.240
 that you would make an outdoor toilet.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.360
 And when you flush it, the flush takes it directly

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.840
 into a trough, which becomes part of the food.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.200
 It's not so much a flushes a long drop.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:43.840
 As a long drop?

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.680
 Yeah, it's a long drop.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.960
 OK.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.120
 If you're of a sensitive disposition,

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.120
 you might want to just click forward by 90 seconds.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.400
 OK.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.600
 This made me remember a story that the father

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.560
 of one of my exes told me.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.880
 He was temporarily moving to a province in the Andes in Peru

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.200
 and got invited to a farmhouse for dining.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.960
 After dining, he did ask for the bathroom

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.600
 and got pointed to its location, far from the house.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.480
 The toilet itself was just a block of wood

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.840
 with a hole in the middle.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.640
 He didn't think much of it since it

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.160
 was something common in the area.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.800
 But as he was finishing, he felt something moist.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.440
 From below.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:30.160
 He stood up in a hurry and saw a pig looking back at him

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.800
 from the hole in the wood.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.960
 He then noticed a kind of bowl below in the dirt,

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.800
 a game to the realization of the pig,

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.520
 had legged him in the ass as if searching for more.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.600
 Like, what?

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.080
 So in that case, you don't even need toilet paper

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.720
 in those toilets.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.520
 It's like you know those Japanese toilets

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.440
 where you press a button and it washes your butt.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.960
 Oh my god.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.960
 Yeah.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.360
 So there you go, Peter, on this?

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.040
 Sorry?

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.280
 Peter, oh, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter Andre.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:07.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, Peter, Peter's animal, I don't know, they've got, I mean, they get a lot about animal welfare, but no, I don't know.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.600
 I would have thought that a pig would have quite a rough tongue.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.640
 Yeah, sure.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.000
 Yeah, your hemorrhoids are coming right off.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.400
 Oh, Dennis.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.080
 Oh my god.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:28.240
 Anyway, 90 seconds, because I worry that the 90 seconds was when you just said that.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.760
 Yeah, anyway, there you go.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.320
 Oh, that's a great anecdote.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.320
 Thanks, Gonzalo.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.320
 Yeah, brilliant.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.520
 Quite something.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.400
 We've had a query from Nathan Powell.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.400
 This is an old fish.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.400
 The section is called Old Fish.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:48.400
 You made a comment many episodes ago about fish not being able to swim up a urine stream and into a penis.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.400
 Yeah.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.680
 For years, I have been very nervous about this and I've been very...

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:58.880
 One day I went to the toilet in the Andes and a whole pig swam.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:09.320
 No, and I've been very selective over my riverside urination areas as I believe that fish could swim up a urination stream and into my penis.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.520
 Please can you confirm that fish are unable to do this so I can urinate freely?

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.520
 They can't.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.520
 They can't, yeah.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:22.720
 Because a urine stream, one reason is because a urine stream, if you look at it, it's not usually a full stream when it goes all the way down to a river.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.720
 Oh, right.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:30.040
 Ray cough very slightly and you can especially see that if you kind of do a slow-mo camera shot on it.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.360
 Do we know the origins of that myth?

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.760
 I think it's 19th century.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.600
 So I looked up in the archive, episode one, two, one it was.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.160
 James, you said, idea that candy-ru fish will swim up your penis.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.280
 There have been only one or two stories of it happening in medical literature.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.280
 That's right.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.800
 But that must be people who are already in the water.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:57.560
 I believe, yeah, that's the idea and that they are in the water and the fish sort of follows the, you know, the stream.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.240
 Yeah, they can't taste or do whatever, yeah.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.520
 But yeah, I think them jumping up, the stream is not possible.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.360
 And also, I think that the cases in medical literature are not certain.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.640
 It's dubious, yeah.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.560
 Well, after you said that in that episode, the Anna added, according to one bit of 19th century literature,

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.840
 the only means of preventing the candy-ru fish, swimming up your stream of urine into your bladder,

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.840
 is immediate penis amputation.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.480
 Right, let's carry on.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.480
 Yep.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.440
 We're back on Quantum Baseball, actually.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.400
 And so this is in the nap.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:40.680
 See, see if earlier, or later, depending on the edit.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.320
 Jacob Morris writes, not only did Danny Yance and play for two teams in the same game,

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.160
 but the rules allow for time travel.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.280
 So when a game is suspended due to inclement weather, it is frozen in time, effectively.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.760
 And when it's resumed, the game is considered for record-keeping purposes

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.560
 to have taken place on the same day that it was suspended, right?

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.160
 So you just like cut them together, yeah.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.520
 This means that it's possible for a player to reach a major milestone, quotes,

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:08.600
 before they did it, because the stats from that game are retroactively uncertain.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:13.560
 Notably, superstar Juan Soto made his major league debut May 2018

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.320
 and hit his home run, first home run, May 21st, so the next day.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.040
 Thanks to the quantum science of resumed game time travel,

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.080
 he hit his actual first career home run in a game on June 18th

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.800
 that was resumed from May 15th, five days before he made his debut.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.800
 Amazing.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.680
 That's incredible.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.800
 Isn't that good?

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.360
 It was confusing, but I love it.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.360
 I love it.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.360
 Yeah, thanks, Jacob.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.080
 I feel like when you do the second half of that game, resuming it,

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.560
 there should be a thing of continuity, where if you were in the stands,

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:45.480
 you had to come dressed exactly as you were, everyone has to...

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.960
 So you could smash the two bits of footage together.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.680
 Yeah, that's a really fun idea.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.080
 I'll mention that to Jacob, next time you try.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.560
 Derek Elliott Jones writes, "I was a good little listener this week

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.560
 and followed James' instructions to connect on LinkedIn."

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.520
 Was that your end of show, I'm on LinkedIn, right?

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.200
 Yeah, I did, and I've been absolutely inundated.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.000
 I've been LinkedIn links, yeah.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 I've got loads.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 They're still coming through.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 Great.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 I want to connect.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.120
 Your professional network must be absolutely bulging.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.120
 It is.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.120
 Yeah.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.880
 And I'm never going to do anything with it, because I don't really use LinkedIn.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.720
 But if anyone wants to offer me a job...

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.720
 You're looking.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.720
 Yeah.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.720
 Yeah.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:31.520
 I did years ago, when we did LinkedIn ads, I made a joke in the show that I ran a banana company,

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.520
 something like that.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.520
 That's all bananas.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.520
 And I...

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.520
 Was it called banana?

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.520
 It should have been.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.520
 It's absolutely should have been.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.520
 But I just put it as my description.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.520
 I did it on the day.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.520
 Oh, nice.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.520
 Like, not too long ago.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:46.520
 And I forgot that I'd left it there, and so it's my professional page, you know.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.680
 Oh, I thought you were going to say that, like, big banana have been in touch, and they

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.680
 wanted to.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.680
 Nothing.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680
 Didn't get anything.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.680
 Really?

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.880
 Just a banana salesman on it and door to door or...

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.880
 It's in specify.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.840
 Maybe I should have been more specific.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.320
 I mean, door to door is a good off.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.320
 I sort of...

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.960
 I would be compelled to buy a banana at the door from someone who turned up as one.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.960
 Which?

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.960
 Not with just one.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.240
 Someone just came to your door and said, "I have one banana."

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.240
 He's chanting heavily.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.240
 He's been running.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.880
 We don't know where from, but he needs to get rid of this banana.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.880
 I'd be tempted.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.880
 I have...

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.280
 I've had two bits of work from LinkedIn over the years.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.280
 Have you?

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.280
 Yeah.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.280
 What people have just messaged me saying, "Well, I do this.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.040
 I must have met at least one of them was unpaid."

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.040
 But...

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.040
 Must do.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.040
 That's great.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.040
 Yeah.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.040
 When we did our tour and I had to find people for the end of the show.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.040
 LinkedIn saved me.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040
 Must have done.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.320
 Sounds like we're doing an ad for LinkedIn now, but it genuinely did save me.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.360
 That's how I got the Asparamancer.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360
 It was LinkedIn.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.360
 Confined it.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.560
 My Sparagas fortune teller is on LinkedIn.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.760
 Yeah, but it's only if you're banana salesman, you're going to be connected to her, aren't you?

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.760
 Yeah.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.400
 She did get confused when it turned out I was on a podcast about facts.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.400
 Yeah.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.720
 Well, Derek writes, because you know when you connect with someone, there are more profiles

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.720
 for you.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.720
 Yeah.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.720
 Or if you search for someone that'll suggest links.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:08.540
 The algorithm tried to find other QI people for him to connect to, so there's Andrew Murray,

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:12.440
 but just a random director at Hunter Mason, I don't know what that is.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.280
 There's Anna Tajinska, a content producer.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:22.200
 There's Anna Tajinska-Biali, and there's Laura Coonsburg.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.320
 I get all those as well, I might too.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.320
 Yeah.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.960
 I just assumed it was you guys because you didn't want to have your real name on LinkedIn.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.800
 I'm Laura Coonsburg on LinkedIn at me.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.480
 I like the Andrew Murray who's at Hunter.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.480
 Which one was that?

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.480
 Did you not connect the Hunter bit?

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.480
 Nope.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.480
 Okay.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.480
 Wow.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.480
 Wow.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.480
 It's a very difficult job hosting this show, Dan.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.480
 You're doing a great job.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.360
 I don't have time to spot my own name in the middle of a sentence.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.360
 Okay.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.360
 Yeah.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.720
 If anyone's listened to this and hasn't added me on LinkedIn, then why not?

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.720
 Why not?

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.080
 I don't see what's in it for you.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.480
 Definitely nothing's in it for me, but do it anyway.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.480
 Yeah.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.800
 And Caleb Partridge writes, "I was wondering if you've noticed," writes Caitlin, "that the

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.080
 name Everard Digby scans perfectly with Erlin Erigby."

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.000
 I have noticed, because do you remember?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.920
 Did I actually do this or did I just write it?

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.920
 I wrote a song.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.920
 Yeah, I heard it.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.920
 I did do it, didn't I?

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:25.640
 I did it on stage and it was, Erlin Erigby was a tune and Everard Digby was

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.480
 one of the verses and Anna Toshinsky was another one.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.480
 And it was like this.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.440
 I don't think you ever, I think maybe you played it once at a work in progress, but I remember

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.000
 you sending us a video of you playing it.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 On piano?

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 I think you played it on piano.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 I don't know.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 I don't remember that.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 That sounds good.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Erlin Erigby, yeah.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 Wow.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.520
 And it was like, I don't know, can't remember what it was about now, but it was just something

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.520
 about the podcast.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.520
 Yeah.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.360
 And they all led up to the final song, which was Erlin Erigby.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.360
 Love it.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.800
 I suppose you want to be able to do that anyway, because the Beatles are.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.800
 I don't know.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.800
 We're down there with it.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.800
 Yeah.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.800
 That must be parody laws.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.800
 There are parody laws.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.800
 So thank you, Caitlin.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.840
 We've got a wedding coming up.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.000
 This is nice.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.200
 Jody has written some information about golf, which I'll tell you later, James.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.200
 I think everyone would like to hear that.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.200
 That's all right.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.280
 It's about a cut price golf.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.280
 It's about railway tickets as well, so I am interested.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:29.360
 But in the 20s, there was a, there was a cut price golfers permit between Liverpool Street

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.400
 in London and Oldborough in Suffolk, so a couple of hours away on the train.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.400
 Wow.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:39.600
 And there was a golfers certificate in the 20s, where you had reduced fares to 130 golf adjacent

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.720
 stations if you got it signed by a golf club secretary, and you were going to play golf.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.720
 That sounds great.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.720
 Get money off.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.720
 Isn't that crazy?

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.720
 That is really cool.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.720
 Money off.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.040
 A tick tocker who goes around all the golf courses in London and plays them and says

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.960
 how good they are and also how far they are from the tube stations.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.960
 That's very useful.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.960
 Right.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.960
 It is, yeah.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.720
 I stayed in a caravan park the other day, and they've got the, yeah, officially, officially.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.480
 Oh, as in we, like, we were allowed to be there.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.480
 You booked.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.480
 Yeah, I stayed in it.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.480
 What are these?

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.240
 It just, you made it sound a bit like you just, like, I stayed in a caravan park the other

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.240
 day.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.080
 I wasn't, like, I just passed out, you know.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.280
 That's Anna, I'm thinking, oh, that's Anna.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.280
 Sorry.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.720
 It's my head went straight to that you'd been kicked out of home.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.480
 Well, that's not real all alone.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.480
 Personal stuff, yeah.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.480
 Is it a summer holiday?

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.480
 Is it a marital breakdown?

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.480
 It doesn't matter.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.240
 The point is I'm away and I'm getting the fresh air and it's really nice.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.680
 And actually, I prefer it without a caravan, you know what I mean?

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.760
 Yeah, because you didn't say I was in a caravan, you said I was in a caravan park.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.760
 Yeah.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.760
 Yeah.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.160
 Because the anecdote hasn't got me in the caravan park.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.160
 I'm so sorry.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.160
 We jumped right.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.160
 We jumped all over.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.160
 No, please.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.560
 I just know that your anecdotes need help sometimes.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.280
 Let's let this one struggle to tease.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.000
 That's Andy's anecdotes.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.640
 Well, it does need ending, that's the difference.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.040
 There is a crazy golf course there.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.600
 And there was a board inside the restaurant that they have there where it showed a giant

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.600
 circuit of crazy golf that goes on where it was a leaderboard and it printed out the monthly

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.240
 list of who was leading around the fanat area.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.680
 And I wonder if you've ever been part of a crazy golf tour.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.480
 To be honest, I'm more of a maxi golf guy.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.480
 What's maxi?

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.760
 As in large golf.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.480
 I'm not really a mini golf person.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.800
 So no, here's the answer.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.120
 Also, I've never been to fanat.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.800
 Well, I've been inviting you for a long time.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.080
 That's a lovely caravan for you to stay in what you're right.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.680
 No, I haven't put that big right.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:44.560
 I have been to a few like small golf courses where they put the best scores of the month.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.560
 I think it's nice.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.560
 What about this wedding?

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.560
 Yes.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.560
 Jodie writes.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.560
 She sent the information about the golf.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.800
 And then she says, "I'm getting married to my own James at the end of September."

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.320
 Sadly, I can't say we met through the podcast, but I was already a fan and introduced him

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.320
 to it.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:04.280
 But as we were both obsessed with heritage rowways, there is a steam train theme to the wedding.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.280
 Cool.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.280
 Yes.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.800
 We will be travelling and having the meal on a steam train.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:14.200
 And I'm also planning to make candy coal for the favours, which is maybe think of you guys,

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.040
 is there somewhere I can send some to you guys?

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.000
 So she's going to send some candy coal for us.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 Great.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 Nice.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.840
 We'll eat it on our next duel.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.840
 Absolutely.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:23.840
 There we go.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.840
 There you go.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.840
 Kathleen Keast.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840
 Right?

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:30.880
 I've just listened to episode 5 and 4 about a pig being tried for murder in France.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:37.160
 You might want to check out a 1993 movie, The Advocate, which starred Colin Firth as the

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.840
 lawyer who defended that murderous pig.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.840
 Wow.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.840
 Really?

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.840
 How good is that?

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.840
 Yeah.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.640
 He's not afraid to take a risk, Firth.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.640
 Yeah.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.160
 And Daniel Day Lewis played the pig?

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.160
 Yes.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:54.640
 I had to live under a tiradilated peru for three months beforehand.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.440
 Oh, god.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.920
 Oh, there you go.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.520
 Thanks for that.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.840
 Buff fins.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.440
 I can't even remember what that stands for.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.440
 It's big.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.440
 Big old fish fan.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.440
 Factsperts.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.440
 It's experts.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.960
 Pete Today has just written, "Hi, ladies and gents.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.960
 Just listen to your piece on jigsaws.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:16.320
 I wanted to thank you for the publicity because Pete is the chair of the benevolent confraternity

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.320
 of dysectologists."

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.320
 Oh, cool.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:25.400
 The jigsaw group, and has included an election of some of his collection of old and new wooden

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.400
 puzzles.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.640
 That your wife is a member of?

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:33.520
 I'm afraid as a former member, she never made it along to the meetings and she wasn't kicked

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.520
 out for anything.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.520
 I just think she renewed herself.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.520
 Membership flat.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.520
 Yeah.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.520
 Right.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.520
 I bought it for her as a one-year thing.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.560
 And I said, unless you're using your styling, I'm going to be quite serious and come off

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.560
 it.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.560
 I think it's about £12 for the year's membership.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.920
 You're not using the electricity, is your hands at you, but you're not using it.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:55.280
 You're not using the light, then the light button, the bulb goes.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.760
 Oh, that's nice.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.760
 Anyway, so thanks.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.760
 Thank you.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.760
 Anything from him?

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.520
 No, it was a link to some images of his collection of jigsaws, so it was an informational

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.520
 gift, not a...

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.000
 Well, that went into your personal folder.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.720
 Did your wife have the card, you know, the...

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.720
 The Jigsaw?

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.720
 Yeah, I know.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.720
 I can't remember now.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.720
 I can't remember either.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.280
 Is this where we got to last time?

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.280
 It was a bit of an ampass.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.880
 I think I politely said, yes, she did have the card, but I can't remember.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.880
 She probably did.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.880
 Yeah, imagine if you're joining, you get the card.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.880
 Right.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:33.760
 And just to finish us off, so do you form that point?

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:39.760
 That's definitely going to have to go at the end for continuity reasons.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:46.960
 Honestly, Adam's been away for two weeks.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.000
 He's been talking about introducing this page on this.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.080
 The new tier on Patreon.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.840
 Okay, sorry.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:07.440
 I can't actually see anymore, because I can't see.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.440
 Oh, dear.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.960
 All right, well, the continuity of me crying with laughter will that be a problem?

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.960
 Yeah.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.120
 It's just a little bit of non-determ.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.120
 Go on.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:21.920
 There's a guy called Dr. William Wood, who's on a mission to ban wood stoves in Tasmania.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.920
 Very good.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.920
 Yeah.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:28.520
 I saw a book about the history of bread by a guy called Dr. Butterie.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:29.520
 No.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.520
 That's brilliant.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.520
 That's really good.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:37.160
 That's from Sam Leicester, I should say, sorry.

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:41.160
 So Tracy Gunn writes, "Harrin Gate Council's noise and nuisance officer is Craig Bellringer."

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.160
 Very good.

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.160
 Very good.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.160
 Pretty good.

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.160
 That's it.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.160
 Oh, nice.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.160
 Happy ending.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.160
 That was a...

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:58.240
 So thanks so much for listening to Dr. Sir Lion this month.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.240
 It's wonderful.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:03.120
 It's just a joy to read your emails.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.120
 Keep them coming.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.120
 We should do this more often.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.120
 Yeah.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.120
 Yeah.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.120
 Okay.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.120
 Finish us off.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:18.600
 Thanks for listening, and if you'd like to comment on anything we've said in the course

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:23.120
 of this episode or any other episodes, then write an email to podcast@QI.com.

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.760
 We'll be back before long with another drop of the line.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.760
 We'll see you then.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.280
 Bye.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.860
 (upbeat music)
