00:00:00,00:00:03,"They don't want it, or who don't want it?"
00:00:03,00:00:11,Hi!
00:00:11,00:00:14,Bless you.
00:00:14,00:00:16,"Lovely. Hello, Andy. Hello."
00:00:16,00:00:19,Welcome to Drop of the Line.
00:00:19,00:00:21,"Uh, this is already in his feedback, but..."
00:00:21,00:00:24,"And if you're listening at home, let's paint a picture."
00:00:24,00:00:28,"There are three of us here, yep, because someone is now missing."
00:00:28,00:00:30,The last drop of the line had one extra fish.
00:00:30,00:00:32,Yep. She's gone. She's gone.
00:00:32,00:00:34,Only for nine months. She'll be back.
00:00:34,00:00:35,"Yeah, yeah. Hope so."
00:00:35,00:00:38,She might look very different.
00:00:38,00:00:43,"Don't think so. She might look like a white middle, middle-aged man."
00:00:43,00:00:46,And I'm a different name.
00:00:46,00:00:48,But she'll be back in spirit.
00:00:48,00:00:49,She will be back. Yeah.
00:00:49,00:00:50,She's having a great time.
00:00:50,00:00:51,Is she? Yeah.
00:00:51,00:00:52,I haven't kept in touch.
00:00:52,00:00:54,That's her. That's her.
00:00:54,00:00:57,I've been trying to observe the rules about employment law.
00:00:57,00:00:59,I don't think you're allowed to contact people when they're on maternity leave.
00:00:59,00:01:01,"Well, I messaged her as a friend."
00:01:01,00:01:03,Yeah. That's where I went wrong.
00:01:03,00:01:08,"And if you're listening with us, which I know you're not."
00:01:08,00:01:10,She's not listening to us.
00:01:10,00:01:11,Crazy.
00:01:11,00:01:12,"All right, well, welcome to Drop of the Line."
00:01:12,00:01:14,This is a audience feedback segment.
00:01:14,00:01:17,The inbox.
00:01:17,00:01:20,"Oh, it's been absolutely bursting."
00:01:20,00:01:23,"Bulging. Oh, come on. Bulging. Overflowing."
00:01:23,00:01:24,Really?
00:01:24,00:01:26,"Yeah, it's been big. It's been a big month."
00:01:26,00:01:28,We've got a lot to get through. Let's stop fanning about and let's get on with that.
00:01:28,00:01:30,Let's go on with that. All right.
00:01:30,00:01:31,"Number one, Fact of the Week."
00:01:31,00:01:33,New segment that I've introduced.
00:01:33,00:01:33,Great.
00:01:33,00:01:35,From Andrew C.
00:01:35,00:01:37,Long time fan and recent clubfish member.
00:01:37,00:01:38,"So hello, Andrew."
00:01:38,00:01:40,I have my first fish fact.
00:01:40,00:01:41,"In South Carolina,"
00:01:41,00:01:44,North is 90 miles southeast of New West.
00:01:44,00:01:50,So North is the name of a town.
00:01:50,00:01:50,Yep.
00:01:50,00:01:52,And New West is another town.
00:01:54,00:01:56,And I suppose that that means that
00:01:56,00:01:59,New West is 90 miles northwest of North.
00:01:59,00:02:00,Right.
00:02:00,00:02:03,Do we have any details about these places?
00:02:03,00:02:04,Nothing.
00:02:04,00:02:04,Ah.
00:02:04,00:02:07,"Because North might just be named after Lord North,"
00:02:07,00:02:09,the Prime Minister.
00:02:09,00:02:11,"He doesn't specify, but I can't imagine it isn't."
00:02:11,00:02:18,"Yeah, no, that's just, that's just a terrific fact."
00:02:18,00:02:19,We don't know anything else about it.
00:02:19,00:02:20,We don't know anything about it.
00:02:20,00:02:21,I'm afraid not. The context is pretty slim here.
00:02:21,00:02:23,These places don't sound like they're massive.
00:02:23,00:02:24,I will say that.
00:02:24,00:02:24,Yeah.
00:02:24,00:02:27,I always love going on the Wikipedia pages of these places
00:02:27,00:02:28,"because the notable people,"
00:02:28,00:02:30,there's always just one person
00:02:30,00:02:33,"who is like the biggest basketball player,"
00:02:33,00:02:35,"you know, in the world, or it's always really fun."
00:02:35,00:02:38,"Unincorporated, I'm guessing, these towns."
00:02:38,00:02:39,"Again, Michael Jordan."
00:02:39,00:02:41,It's from all of those places.
00:02:41,00:02:43,"Well, Michael Jordan played for North Carolina."
00:02:43,00:02:43,Where are we talking?
00:02:43,00:02:44,South Carolina.
00:02:44,00:02:45,So close.
00:02:45,00:02:46,So close.
00:02:46,00:02:48,One long throw away.
00:02:51,00:02:53,"Anyway, Andrew, thank you. That's just a great fact."
00:02:53,00:02:54,"Yeah, it's a really good fact."
00:02:54,00:02:55,Very good.
00:02:55,00:02:56,I feel like we're off the blocks.
00:02:56,00:02:59,But now we're also on the hook.
00:02:59,00:03:02,"Section two is, get yourself off the hook."
00:03:02,00:03:03,I'm numbering the sections this month.
00:03:03,00:03:04,Okay.
00:03:04,00:03:04,Yeah.
00:03:04,00:03:06,Which of us is on the hook?
00:03:06,00:03:08,"Well, great news. It's Anna."
00:03:08,00:03:15,"Dear Anna, I heard you say on the podcast"
00:03:15,00:03:17,that Singapore is the only country
00:03:17,00:03:19,that sells other flavors of yakult.
00:03:19,00:03:20,"Oh, no."
00:03:20,00:03:22,I've got terrible news for one member of the team.
00:03:22,00:03:23,How has me who said that?
00:03:23,00:03:25,Really?
00:03:25,00:03:27,That's very honest.
00:03:27,00:03:28,I know.
00:03:28,00:03:29,Some people watching this.
00:03:29,00:03:32,I'll listen to this word of no on that.
00:03:32,00:03:33,"And if I'd have kept stump,"
00:03:33,00:03:35,it would have popped me in a bad light.
00:03:35,00:03:36,So it's tactical honesty in a way.
00:03:36,00:03:38,"Yeah, fair enough."
00:03:38,00:03:39,You've been thought your hands been forced.
00:03:39,00:03:42,"Well, James, apparently supermarkets"
00:03:42,00:03:44,across the channel do do too.
00:03:44,00:03:46,And then Bart has sent an image of some yakult plus
00:03:46,00:03:50,Peer-Zick Smark from other...
00:03:50,00:03:52,I can only assume the Netherlands.
00:03:52,00:03:52,Okay.
00:03:52,00:03:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:53,00:03:54,Yeah.
00:03:54,00:03:58,It's just a new N-E-U-W
00:03:58,00:04:00,which suggests that it hasn't always been there.
00:04:00,00:04:00,Yeah.
00:04:00,00:04:02,That's a good point.
00:04:02,00:04:03,I think you're off the hook.
00:04:03,00:04:03,Whoa!
00:04:03,00:04:04,Nice.
00:04:04,00:04:05,Easy.
00:04:05,00:04:07,What a great detective.
00:04:07,00:04:09,You just got given one bit of evidence.
00:04:09,00:04:11,"So you're, like, you columboded it."
00:04:11,00:04:13,Just one more question.
00:04:13,00:04:13,That was great.
00:04:13,00:04:16,"Vince writes, fun fact."
00:04:16,00:04:19,The only advert not to offer a discount on no such thing.
00:04:19,00:04:21,"So we're an AdLan now, I'm afraid."
00:04:21,00:04:21,Okay.
00:04:21,00:04:23,Has been the BBC TV license advert.
00:04:23,00:04:24,Is that true?
00:04:24,00:04:25,Why?
00:04:25,00:04:26,Where is the fish discount?
00:04:26,00:04:28,"No, that's not true."
00:04:28,00:04:29,It's not true.
00:04:29,00:04:31,"Airbnb, we don't do a discount for it."
00:04:31,00:04:32,It's true.
00:04:32,00:04:33,We've done some charity ones
00:04:33,00:04:36,"which are sort of, you know, a horrible disease or something"
00:04:36,00:04:39,"and then, like, you can't give a discount on that."
00:04:39,00:04:39,So...
00:04:39,00:04:40,Yeah.
00:04:40,00:04:40,Quite rightly.
00:04:40,00:04:41,Quite rightly.
00:04:41,00:04:44,"You can't get a discount, of course, on your TV license"
00:04:44,00:04:45,if you go black and white.
00:04:46,00:04:49,Can you still believe there is still one or two holdouts?
00:04:49,00:04:50,That's fantastic.
00:04:50,00:04:51,Can you still get a half price?
00:04:51,00:04:54,I believe there are still one or two people in the country
00:04:54,00:04:55,that have every now and then you get a news article
00:04:55,00:04:58,don't you that says there are still 37 people
00:04:58,00:05:00,with black and white TV licenses.
00:05:00,00:05:01,That's so good.
00:05:01,00:05:02,"That's brilliant as half price, isn't it?"
00:05:02,00:05:05,"Whenever the TV license and guy comes round,"
00:05:05,00:05:06,they turn down the colour of my TV.
00:05:06,00:05:10,"I saw a fact just yesterday,"
00:05:10,00:05:13,"which was, you know, the scene in The Wizard of Oz"
00:05:13,00:05:16,where it goes from black and white and then she opens the door
00:05:16,00:05:17,"in its color, Technicolor."
00:05:17,00:05:18,Technicolor.
00:05:18,00:05:23,"So there is this little video that suggests,"
00:05:23,00:05:24,"I'd want to say it's total fact,"
00:05:24,00:05:26,"but I just saw this the other day,"
00:05:26,00:05:28,"that the black and white,"
00:05:28,00:05:31,"they painted the inside of the room seepia, as it were,"
00:05:31,00:05:33,and they did that to Dorothy as well.
00:05:33,00:05:35,"So they put her in clothing, which was matching the colour"
00:05:35,00:05:38,and they did up her face to match the colour.
00:05:38,00:05:41,"So the idea is that they filmed it in colour,"
00:05:41,00:05:43,but they made it seem as if it was in...
00:05:43,00:05:45,"Brilliant, so when she opens the door,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,they use a stunt double as the door opens
00:05:47,00:05:49,"of the background of her,"
00:05:49,00:05:51,"and then Dorothy, who's in her normal clothing,"
00:05:51,00:05:52,walks into the colour.
00:05:52,00:05:55,"So it's not a jump between black and white and colour,"
00:05:55,00:05:57,the whole thing is in colour.
00:05:57,00:05:58,That's a really good idea.
00:05:58,00:05:59,"If you go back and watch the clip again,"
00:05:59,00:06:01,it's pretty remarkable if that's the case.
00:06:01,00:06:02,"Yeah, if that's the case."
00:06:02,00:06:04,Did you say?
00:06:04,00:06:07,"Yeah, as I said, I saw a video on it yesterday,"
00:06:07,00:06:08,but I didn't think this would come up.
00:06:08,00:06:10,I haven't checked it to verify it.
00:06:10,00:06:10,I believe it.
00:06:12,00:06:13,Kicking for me.
00:06:13,00:06:14,"Oh, yeah?"
00:06:14,00:06:17,"Kyla Jamison writes about, I don't know if you remember,"
00:06:17,00:06:19,"we mentioned a lake in Canada called, like, Minne Wanker."
00:06:19,00:06:21,"Oh, yeah, we did."
00:06:21,00:06:24,And you said that it would be where Tom Cruise went or something?
00:06:24,00:06:26,Something like something really unkind like that.
00:06:26,00:06:29,"And I'm sorry, Tom, if you're watching."
00:06:29,00:06:31,And he probably is watching watches.
00:06:31,00:06:33,"Yeah, he gets this footage, even though,"
00:06:33,00:06:35,"even if we don't release it, he'll get it."
00:06:35,00:06:36,Do you know what I mean?
00:06:36,00:06:36,It's being live streamed.
00:06:36,00:06:37,He's got power.
00:06:37,00:06:38,He's got power.
00:06:38,00:06:40,"Yeah, anyway, it's pronounced Minne Wanker."
00:06:40,00:06:42,Oh.
00:06:42,00:06:43,That will be Wanker.
00:06:43,00:06:44,Yeah.
00:06:44,00:06:46,Minne Wanker's trucked up factory.
00:06:46,00:06:46,There you go.
00:06:46,00:06:47,Very nice.
00:06:47,00:06:47,Yep.
00:06:47,00:06:49,"Source, I used to live near it."
00:06:49,00:06:50,"It's lovely, says Kyla."
00:06:50,00:06:51,So thank you for that.
00:06:51,00:06:52,Yeah.
00:06:52,00:06:53,I'm just going to say that this podcast
00:06:53,00:06:55,does have a history of mispronouncing things
00:06:55,00:06:56,to come of effect.
00:06:56,00:06:57,It's true.
00:06:57,00:06:59,"If you don't like that, listen to a different podcast."
00:06:59,00:07:00,Yeah.
00:07:00,00:07:01,"We used to apologize, didn't we?"
00:07:01,00:07:02,"Not anymore, which is--"
00:07:02,00:07:03,"Well, now that we are--"
00:07:03,00:07:05,She gets a bit annoyed about it.
00:07:05,00:07:06,"If she's not here, then."
00:07:06,00:07:07,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:07,00:07:09,"So for the next nine months, we're off the blocks."
00:07:10,00:07:14,This is just a thing we said slightly wrong.
00:07:14,00:07:19,"But it's from Josh McDonald from Atlanta, Georgia."
00:07:19,00:07:21,"Anyway, we-- this is a very recent episode."
00:07:21,00:07:22,We talked about Quantum Baseball.
00:07:22,00:07:24,That was the reason-- the episode knows
00:07:24,00:07:25,that's the thing is Quantum Baseball.
00:07:25,00:07:25,Yes.
00:07:25,00:07:28,So what happened was there was a question
00:07:28,00:07:33,about how did one player play for two teams in the same match.
00:07:33,00:07:35,And you suggested it might have been a quantum effect.
00:07:35,00:07:38,"And actually, the game was postponed halfway through."
00:07:38,00:07:40,And the game was transferred.
00:07:40,00:07:41,That's exactly right.
00:07:41,00:07:43,"Well, in the course of that episode,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,we also did a large bit about Sumo wrestling.
00:07:45,00:07:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:46,00:07:48,Is that it?
00:07:48,00:07:51,So there was no reason for me to go into that.
00:07:51,00:07:53,But you were so fluent when you said it.
00:07:53,00:07:54,"I thought, well, I can't."
00:07:54,00:07:54,I don't want to.
00:07:54,00:07:56,So the thing about Sumo wrestling--
00:07:56,00:07:58,"No, I could go through the whole thing."
00:07:58,00:08:01,"But it was about them being unbicycles, I think."
00:08:01,00:08:01,Yes.
00:08:01,00:08:04,"But Josh says, during the episode,"
00:08:04,00:08:08,you're referred to the wrestlers as Sumo's multiple times.
00:08:08,00:08:10,"But actually, that would be like calling a dance player a dart"
00:08:10,00:08:12,or a football ball.
00:08:12,00:08:14,"Yeah, they're Yoko Zuma's, how they--"
00:08:14,00:08:16,He says Rikishi.
00:08:16,00:08:16,"Oh, Rikishi."
00:08:16,00:08:17,Rikishi.
00:08:17,00:08:17,There we go.
00:08:17,00:08:18,Rikishi.
00:08:18,00:08:20,And you know what's something to do with wrestling?
00:08:20,00:08:21,"Yeah, it says WWE."
00:08:21,00:08:24,There was a wrestler that went under that name in the '90s.
00:08:24,00:08:25,Dan's eyes light up.
00:08:25,00:08:26,The bloodline.
00:08:26,00:08:28,"Well, it's interesting, because Rikishi"
00:08:28,00:08:31,"is related to Yoko Zuma, who you just mentioned is another thing."
00:08:31,00:08:35,And the current crop of the biggest stars in WWE
00:08:35,00:08:36,are the son of Rikishi.
00:08:36,00:08:37,So--
00:08:37,00:08:38,They're the son of what?
00:08:38,00:08:40,"Jay Uso is the son of the wrestler Rikishi,"
00:08:40,00:08:41,who's one of the biggest wrestlers.
00:08:41,00:08:42,Jimmy Uso is one of the biggest--
00:08:42,00:08:44,It's not that every single wrestler in WWE
00:08:44,00:08:46,are all sons of this one.
00:08:46,00:08:47,I have to say.
00:08:47,00:08:49,"No, no, no, that'd be crazy."
00:08:49,00:08:52,But compelling storyline.
00:08:52,00:08:53,Dominant bloodline.
00:08:53,00:08:55,We like succession.
00:08:55,00:08:58,But with being thrown through tables.
00:08:58,00:08:59,"Yeah, it kind of is."
00:08:59,00:09:00,It kind of is.
00:09:00,00:09:03,"Well, Josh has a fun fact, because of all the breeding exercises"
00:09:03,00:09:05,"that the Sumo wrestlers do for training,"
00:09:05,00:09:07,quite a few of them are excellent singers.
00:09:07,00:09:10,And he attaches a video of the now retired Coco Zuma
00:09:10,00:09:13,"Kaku Ryu singing Frank Sinatra's ""My Way."""
00:09:13,00:09:14,Lovely.
00:09:14,00:09:15,"Which I listen to earlier, and it's very good."
00:09:15,00:09:16,It's good.
00:09:16,00:09:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:17,00:09:18,He's got the chops.
00:09:18,00:09:21,"It feels like ""My Way"" might be the name of a person"
00:09:21,00:09:24,in Japan or China.
00:09:24,00:09:25,"Like ""I Way Way."""
00:09:25,00:09:26,"""I Way Way."""
00:09:26,00:09:28,"""My Way Way"" would have been a good show."
00:09:28,00:09:29,Yes.
00:09:29,00:09:30,That's a good show.
00:09:30,00:09:31,That's a good end.
00:09:31,00:09:33,"If he's looking for a fringe, a number of fringe shows."
00:09:33,00:09:34,Absolutely.
00:09:34,00:09:36,I think he is.
00:09:36,00:09:38,Yeah.
00:09:38,00:09:40,"All right, we now come to the ""I'm Actuallys."""
00:09:40,00:09:40,OK.
00:09:40,00:09:42,"Section three, I think."
00:09:42,00:09:44,"Yes, we're in section three."
00:09:44,00:09:46,"And the previous one was ""Get yourself off the hook."""
00:09:46,00:09:48,"So that was like, you're in trouble."
00:09:48,00:09:50,And this is just his extra stuff.
00:09:50,00:09:53,Can I just say this is terrible for the edit
00:09:53,00:09:54,"that you're putting everything in another,"
00:09:54,00:09:57,and you keep referencing the order of things?
00:09:57,00:09:59,We can't leave anything around.
00:09:59,00:10:00,I want--
00:10:00,00:10:01,I want you not to.
00:10:01,00:10:02,I want to--
00:10:02,00:10:04,I want to ruin things.
00:10:04,00:10:06,"Yeah, I'm in tricks to mode."
00:10:06,00:10:08,"This is dark Andy, you're seeing now."
00:10:08,00:10:08,Is it?
00:10:08,00:10:09,Yeah.
00:10:09,00:10:10,"Well, we'll get through it."
00:10:10,00:10:12,Andrea Gilby.
00:10:12,00:10:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:12,00:10:14,"Now, we really missed it."
00:10:14,00:10:17,We dropped a great opportunity.
00:10:17,00:10:19,"We missed it, rather, in one of the Edinburgh shows."
00:10:19,00:10:23,There was Nish Kumar talking about Jimmy Hendrix.
00:10:23,00:10:24,I just listened to the latest episode
00:10:24,00:10:27,and re-Nish's story about Jimmy Hendrix and the monkeys.
00:10:27,00:10:28,They toured together.
00:10:28,00:10:30,Jimmy Hendrix opened for the monkeys.
00:10:30,00:10:31,Yeah.
00:10:31,00:10:33,I don't know where.
00:10:33,00:10:36,There's a coronation street connection between them two.
00:10:36,00:10:37,"Oh, really?"
00:10:37,00:10:39,So Jimmy Hendrix loved coronation street.
00:10:39,00:10:40,Yeah.
00:10:40,00:10:43,Davey Jones played the grandson of Ena Sharples
00:10:43,00:10:45,in Coronation Street.
00:10:45,00:10:46,Wow.
00:10:46,00:10:50,So Jimmy Hendrix sort of seen Davey from the monkeys on TV.
00:10:50,00:10:51,And then--
00:10:51,00:10:53,"Potentially, if it was in the right--"
00:10:53,00:10:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:53,00:10:56,--and he actually didn't miss that day's episode or anything.
00:10:56,00:10:57,He played the who?
00:10:57,00:10:59,The grandson of Ena Sharples.
00:10:59,00:11:00,OK.
00:11:00,00:11:02,When he was really young?
00:11:02,00:11:03,It sounds like he was young.
00:11:03,00:11:04,Because it was before he moved to the USA
00:11:04,00:11:06,to play the artful dodger in Oliver.
00:11:06,00:11:07,So he can't have been--
00:11:07,00:11:09,Unless he was watching reruns.
00:11:09,00:11:10,Unless he was playing an old dodger.
00:11:10,00:11:12,We decided to re-imagine the role of Dodger.
00:11:12,00:11:15,A carster was like a 45-year-old man.
00:11:15,00:11:16,Yeah.
00:11:16,00:11:18,"No, maybe Hendrix wasn't into Coronation Street"
00:11:18,00:11:19,at that point.
00:11:19,00:11:24,"Anyway, we've had a fun audience message from Luke Delaney,"
00:11:24,00:11:29,who was in Kev Lovic International Airport in Iceland.
00:11:29,00:11:35,"And, as Anna mentioned, Jimmy Hendrix's phallic cast,"
00:11:35,00:11:39,where he got his thing cast in plaster.
00:11:39,00:11:42,And it's in the phallological museum in Reykjavik.
00:11:42,00:11:44,And an advert came up for the Iceland penis museum
00:11:44,00:11:47,"on the screen above the carousel, the baggage carousel,"
00:11:47,00:11:52,while Luke was waiting to get his bags.
00:11:52,00:11:53,And then he went fishing while listening
00:11:53,00:11:55,to know such thing as a fish.
00:11:55,00:11:56,That's good.
00:11:56,00:11:57,Did he go to the museum?
00:11:57,00:12:00,"He didn't, because he was too busy fishing."
00:12:00,00:12:01,But he said--
00:12:01,00:12:02,It's a small museum.
00:12:02,00:12:03,What was he called?
00:12:03,00:12:04,Andrew.
00:12:04,00:12:05,Luke.
00:12:05,00:12:07,"Honestly, you could do it in half an hour, Luke."
00:12:07,00:12:08,There you go.
00:12:08,00:12:11,But Luke was too busy catching this salmon.
00:12:11,00:12:12,Very cool.
00:12:12,00:12:14,"A biggie, which he then did release."
00:12:14,00:12:15,And it went on its way.
00:12:15,00:12:16,While listening to fish.
00:12:16,00:12:17,Right.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"So if you've got photos of you doing something extreme,"
00:12:19,00:12:23,"while listening to a podcast, like fishing,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,and the drop is a line.
00:12:25,00:12:26,I wonder how the owners of a phallic museum
00:12:26,00:12:29,feel when someone calls it small.
00:12:29,00:12:30,You hear of the winter?
00:12:30,00:12:35,There is.
00:12:35,00:12:38,Because we're sometimes called QI elves.
00:12:38,00:12:40,"If you go to the phallological museum,"
00:12:40,00:12:43,they also have displays of fictional characters
00:12:43,00:12:47,"on what their penises are like, and it has elf."
00:12:47,00:12:52,"And then it says penis-sized, presumably small."
00:12:52,00:12:55,"And they have a golf putter in the shape of a penis, which"
00:12:55,00:12:56,I used.
00:12:56,00:12:58,So you get to take it down and hit a ball.
00:12:58,00:12:59,Yeah.
00:12:59,00:13:02,It was just you could just pick it up and knock a golf ball.
00:13:02,00:13:03,There's no one of the precious display.
00:13:03,00:13:05,It's sort of what some of those museums are like.
00:13:05,00:13:06,"Yeah, they have interactive stuff."
00:13:06,00:13:06,Exactly.
00:13:06,00:13:07,It was one of those.
00:13:07,00:13:08,This is the kids.
00:13:08,00:13:10,Does the ball look like a testicle?
00:13:10,00:13:12,"No, it's just like a golf ball."
00:13:12,00:13:13,"Actually, don't know what a testicle would look like."
00:13:13,00:13:15,Mine looked like golf balls.
00:13:15,00:13:15,We do that.
00:13:15,00:13:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:18,00:13:20,"Golf balls is a condition like tennis elbow, isn't it?"
00:13:20,00:13:21,It was--
00:13:21,00:13:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:24,00:13:26,Let's have some spicy meat.
00:13:26,00:13:27,All right.
00:13:27,00:13:27,Let's do it.
00:13:27,00:13:29,Steve McCabe.
00:13:29,00:13:31,"How many of these have we done, Andy?"
00:13:31,00:13:33,"What'd you say, drop us a line?"
00:13:33,00:13:33,36.
00:13:33,00:13:36,I'm still not sure what spicy meat is.
00:13:36,00:13:38,It's like--
00:13:38,00:13:40,I don't need to explain it.
00:13:40,00:13:40,Right.
00:13:40,00:13:42,"Steve says, what section are we in now?"
00:13:42,00:13:45,I don't know what number it's section four.
00:13:45,00:13:47,OK.
00:13:47,00:13:48,For the edit.
00:13:48,00:13:53,"Not sure how, or indeed, if you could use this one,"
00:13:53,00:13:54,but it feels too good to not share.
00:13:54,00:13:58,"Apparently, as you spicy meat, it's sort of gossip."
00:13:58,00:14:02,All behind the curtain stuff with the three of us.
00:14:02,00:14:05,"Apparently, in the folklore of the Latter-day Saints,"
00:14:05,00:14:10,"brackets, Mormons, Bigfoot is identified as Cain,"
00:14:10,00:14:13,the son of Adam and Eve in the Bible.
00:14:13,00:14:14,"Just Google Cain, Bigfoot, and Mormons."
00:14:14,00:14:16,It's a great rabbit warring to go down.
00:14:16,00:14:18,And that was just because it was down-relevant.
00:14:18,00:14:20,"I thought it was not very spicy that meat, to be honest,"
00:14:20,00:14:22,but I thought you might know about that already.
00:14:22,00:14:25,"It's ringing a very, very, very distant bell."
00:14:25,00:14:26,That's cool.
00:14:26,00:14:26,"Cool, anyway."
00:14:26,00:14:28,Question about Bigfoot.
00:14:28,00:14:29,Yeah.
00:14:29,00:14:31,Are they an individual?
00:14:31,00:14:32,Or are they a species?
00:14:32,00:14:33,Species.
00:14:33,00:14:36,"In that case, if Cain is a Bigfoot, presumably able,"
00:14:36,00:14:38,his brother is also a Bigfoot.
00:14:38,00:14:38,Yeah.
00:14:38,00:14:40,Which makes Adam and Eve Bigfoot.
00:14:40,00:14:41,Yeah.
00:14:41,00:14:43,"Wow, this is actually--"
00:14:43,00:14:44,"So we're all Bigfoot, is what I'm saying."
00:14:44,00:14:45,We're all Bigfoot.
00:14:45,00:14:46,"Oh, that's a nice theory."
00:14:46,00:14:47,Mystery solved.
00:14:47,00:14:52,This detective work that James is doing in this show is wild.
00:14:52,00:14:53,"Liz May, this is stunning."
00:14:53,00:14:56,"This is a dance-centric, potential identity theft."
00:14:56,00:14:58,He may need to consult a lawyer.
00:14:58,00:15:00,"God, God."
00:15:00,00:15:02,All right.
00:15:02,00:15:03,"No, they're done."
00:15:03,00:15:04,You have been ripped off.
00:15:04,00:15:05,Have I?
00:15:05,00:15:07,You've been ripped off.
00:15:07,00:15:07,Is there a headline?
00:15:07,00:15:08,You could walk--
00:15:08,00:15:10,Idiot seed.
00:15:10,00:15:14,"No, no."
00:15:14,00:15:16,"Dan, you could get potentially hundreds"
00:15:16,00:15:17,of thousands in compensation.
00:15:17,00:15:17,OK.
00:15:17,00:15:21,"There's a Japanese anime, where one of the main characters"
00:15:21,00:15:22,has wavy dark hair.
00:15:22,00:15:24,"OK, I'm sorry, but in Japanese anime,"
00:15:24,00:15:26,I imagine a lot of the characters have wavy dark hair.
00:15:26,00:15:27,It's common.
00:15:27,00:15:29,Glasses and an obsession with all things
00:15:29,00:15:31,cryptid.
00:15:31,00:15:34,"In the second season, he fights a Mongolian death worm."
00:15:34,00:15:36,Here comes the kuda grass.
00:15:36,00:15:38,"The show is called Dan, Dad, Dan."
00:15:38,00:15:40,"Oh, Dan, the Dan, I've seen that show."
00:15:40,00:15:41,That was it.
00:15:41,00:15:42,"Yeah, yeah."
00:15:42,00:15:44,I not watched it all the way through by seeing clips of it.
00:15:44,00:15:45,"Oh, OK."
00:15:45,00:15:47,And is that the fur--
00:15:47,00:15:48,I guess so.
00:15:48,00:15:50,"I didn't see it before, but yeah, I see that now."
00:15:50,00:15:54,Who's dollar from home?
00:15:54,00:15:58,Do you think I modeled myself of a Japanese anime?
00:15:58,00:15:59,It's possible.
00:15:59,00:16:01,We've always had questions.
00:16:01,00:16:06,"Whenever my son is in a touristy area, my youngest kid,"
00:16:06,00:16:09,"if there is a group that are from Japan,"
00:16:09,00:16:13,"they all respond to his look, because he has very curly,"
00:16:13,00:16:15,"wild hair, as if they point."
00:16:15,00:16:17,"They don't point to any of our other kids, and they don't see them."
00:16:17,00:16:20,"And they kind of go, oh, and it suggests"
00:16:20,00:16:23,that he looks exactly like an anime that's over there.
00:16:23,00:16:25,And I haven't been able to find--
00:16:25,00:16:27,So maybe my whole family has been--
00:16:27,00:16:28,I'm not sure about that.
00:16:28,00:16:29,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:16:29,00:16:29,I don't know.
00:16:29,00:16:32,"For instance, my daughter got a similar thing"
00:16:32,00:16:34,"when we were in Sicily, but I think"
00:16:34,00:16:37,"it's because she's very blonde and very fair-skinned,"
00:16:37,00:16:39,and it's kind of different to the people in Sicily.
00:16:39,00:16:43,"And so they really like blonde kids, do you know what I mean?"
00:16:43,00:16:45,"Yeah, because it's an unusual--"
00:16:45,00:16:47,I think so.
00:16:47,00:16:51,"Oh, maybe she's part of a Sicilian anime."
00:16:51,00:16:53,Maybe she looks exactly like one of the heads of the Camaro
00:16:53,00:16:56,"crime family, that's it."
00:16:56,00:16:59,"They all fled in fear, whenever she walked down the street."
00:16:59,00:17:00,Little Bella was here.
00:17:00,00:17:03,Little Bella.
00:17:03,00:17:06,She looked like Molly Brando.
00:17:06,00:17:07,She talks like him.
00:17:07,00:17:14,"Hit now, this is pretty spicy meat."
00:17:14,00:17:16,"Cam Tockos, right?"
00:17:16,00:17:19,"Hello from Kansas City, Missouri."
00:17:19,00:17:20,Hello.
00:17:20,00:17:24,So global a show with a very heavy accentuation towards the USA.
00:17:24,00:17:26,"My name is Cam, and I have a very fun fact"
00:17:26,00:17:29,"to share about Dan's book, The Theory of Everything Else."
00:17:29,00:17:30,OK.
00:17:30,00:17:32,"Dan, a copy of your book is currently"
00:17:32,00:17:36,"doing a submarine tour at Brackett's classified location,"
00:17:36,00:17:39,"many, many miles underwater."
00:17:39,00:17:41,What?
00:17:41,00:17:43,"My younger brother is currently working on a submarine,"
00:17:43,00:17:46,where he is heavily restricted on what he can carry on.
00:17:46,00:17:48,"About an hour ago, my mom informed me"
00:17:48,00:17:51,that she sent him your book in his latest care package.
00:17:51,00:17:53,"There's like, it's a bit lightweight, isn't it?"
00:17:53,00:17:54,That'll be part of it.
00:17:54,00:17:56,"Can't really put any of that in the adjacent,"
00:17:56,00:17:58,because there's such effe tones.
00:17:58,00:17:58,That's thick.
00:17:58,00:18:01,What you need to write is a 30-page.
00:18:01,00:18:03,"Oh, that's amazing."
00:18:03,00:18:04,That's incredible.
00:18:04,00:18:05,And it's got a good review.
00:18:05,00:18:06,My brother wrote to her from underwater saying
00:18:06,00:18:08,he enjoyed the read.
00:18:08,00:18:09,"Oh, cool, is that?"
00:18:09,00:18:10,That's incredible.
00:18:10,00:18:12,Thank you for sending that in.
00:18:12,00:18:13,"Now, this was a bit I wasn't in,"
00:18:13,00:18:17,but it was in one of the Edinburgh episodes.
00:18:17,00:18:20,"Gonzalo writes, we don't know where from."
00:18:20,00:18:22,"In fact, number two about Pigs on Trial."
00:18:22,00:18:26,"Dan mentioned how in China, some farms created pig toilets."
00:18:26,00:18:27,"OK, yeah."
00:18:27,00:18:29,"Now, can you just remind the listener?"
00:18:29,00:18:32,My memory of it is that the idea is
00:18:32,00:18:35,that you would make an outdoor toilet.
00:18:35,00:18:38,"And when you flush it, the flush takes it directly"
00:18:38,00:18:40,"into a trough, which becomes part of the food."
00:18:40,00:18:43,It's not so much a flushes a long drop.
00:18:43,00:18:43,As a long drop?
00:18:43,00:18:44,"Yeah, it's a long drop."
00:18:44,00:18:45,OK.
00:18:45,00:18:48,"If you're of a sensitive disposition,"
00:18:48,00:18:52,you might want to just click forward by 90 seconds.
00:18:52,00:18:53,OK.
00:18:53,00:18:55,This made me remember a story that the father
00:18:55,00:18:57,of one of my exes told me.
00:18:57,00:19:00,He was temporarily moving to a province in the Andes in Peru
00:19:00,00:19:03,and got invited to a farmhouse for dining.
00:19:03,00:19:04,"After dining, he did ask for the bathroom"
00:19:04,00:19:08,"and got pointed to its location, far from the house."
00:19:08,00:19:10,The toilet itself was just a block of wood
00:19:10,00:19:11,with a hole in the middle.
00:19:11,00:19:13,He didn't think much of it since it
00:19:13,00:19:15,was something common in the area.
00:19:15,00:19:20,"But as he was finishing, he felt something moist."
00:19:20,00:19:21,From below.
00:19:21,00:19:30,He stood up in a hurry and saw a pig looking back at him
00:19:30,00:19:31,from the hole in the wood.
00:19:31,00:19:33,"He then noticed a kind of bowl below in the dirt,"
00:19:33,00:19:35,"a game to the realization of the pig,"
00:19:35,00:19:39,had legged him in the ass as if searching for more.
00:19:39,00:19:41,"Like, what?"
00:19:41,00:19:45,"So in that case, you don't even need toilet paper"
00:19:45,00:19:46,in those toilets.
00:19:46,00:19:48,It's like you know those Japanese toilets
00:19:48,00:19:51,where you press a button and it washes your butt.
00:19:51,00:19:52,Oh my god.
00:19:52,00:19:53,Yeah.
00:19:53,00:19:56,"So there you go, Peter, on this?"
00:19:56,00:19:58,Sorry?
00:19:58,00:20:01,"Peter, oh, Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter Andre."
00:20:01,00:20:07,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, Peter, Peter's animal, I don't know, they've got, I mean, they get a lot about animal welfare, but no, I don't know."
00:20:07,00:20:10,I would have thought that a pig would have quite a rough tongue.
00:20:10,00:20:12,"Yeah, sure."
00:20:12,00:20:15,"Yeah, your hemorrhoids are coming right off."
00:20:15,00:20:17,"Oh, Dennis."
00:20:17,00:20:20,Oh my god.
00:20:20,00:20:28,"Anyway, 90 seconds, because I worry that the 90 seconds was when you just said that."
00:20:28,00:20:29,"Yeah, anyway, there you go."
00:20:29,00:20:31,"Oh, that's a great anecdote."
00:20:31,00:20:32,"Thanks, Gonzalo."
00:20:32,00:20:33,"Yeah, brilliant."
00:20:33,00:20:35,Quite something.
00:20:35,00:20:40,We've had a query from Nathan Powell.
00:20:40,00:20:41,This is an old fish.
00:20:41,00:20:43,The section is called Old Fish.
00:20:43,00:20:48,You made a comment many episodes ago about fish not being able to swim up a urine stream and into a penis.
00:20:48,00:20:49,Yeah.
00:20:49,00:20:51,"For years, I have been very nervous about this and I've been very..."
00:20:51,00:20:58,One day I went to the toilet in the Andes and a whole pig swam.
00:20:58,00:21:09,"No, and I've been very selective over my riverside urination areas as I believe that fish could swim up a urination stream and into my penis."
00:21:09,00:21:12,Please can you confirm that fish are unable to do this so I can urinate freely?
00:21:12,00:21:13,They can't.
00:21:13,00:21:14,"They can't, yeah."
00:21:14,00:21:22,"Because a urine stream, one reason is because a urine stream, if you look at it, it's not usually a full stream when it goes all the way down to a river."
00:21:22,00:21:23,"Oh, right."
00:21:23,00:21:30,Ray cough very slightly and you can especially see that if you kind of do a slow-mo camera shot on it.
00:21:30,00:21:33,Do we know the origins of that myth?
00:21:33,00:21:35,I think it's 19th century.
00:21:35,00:21:38,"So I looked up in the archive, episode one, two, one it was."
00:21:38,00:21:42,"James, you said, idea that candy-ru fish will swim up your penis."
00:21:42,00:21:45,There have been only one or two stories of it happening in medical literature.
00:21:45,00:21:46,That's right.
00:21:46,00:21:47,But that must be people who are already in the water.
00:21:47,00:21:57,"I believe, yeah, that's the idea and that they are in the water and the fish sort of follows the, you know, the stream."
00:21:57,00:22:00,"Yeah, they can't taste or do whatever, yeah."
00:22:00,00:22:04,"But yeah, I think them jumping up, the stream is not possible."
00:22:04,00:22:09,"And also, I think that the cases in medical literature are not certain."
00:22:09,00:22:10,"It's dubious, yeah."
00:22:10,00:22:15,"Well, after you said that in that episode, the Anna added, according to one bit of 19th century literature,"
00:22:15,00:22:19,"the only means of preventing the candy-ru fish, swimming up your stream of urine into your bladder,"
00:22:19,00:22:21,is immediate penis amputation.
00:22:21,00:22:24,"Right, let's carry on."
00:22:24,00:22:25,Yep.
00:22:25,00:22:30,"We're back on Quantum Baseball, actually."
00:22:30,00:22:32,And so this is in the nap.
00:22:32,00:22:40,"See, see if earlier, or later, depending on the edit."
00:22:40,00:22:45,"Jacob Morris writes, not only did Danny Yance and play for two teams in the same game,"
00:22:45,00:22:48,but the rules allow for time travel.
00:22:48,00:22:52,"So when a game is suspended due to inclement weather, it is frozen in time, effectively."
00:22:52,00:22:55,"And when it's resumed, the game is considered for record-keeping purposes"
00:22:55,00:22:58,"to have taken place on the same day that it was suspended, right?"
00:22:58,00:23:00,"So you just like cut them together, yeah."
00:23:00,00:23:03,"This means that it's possible for a player to reach a major milestone, quotes,"
00:23:03,00:23:08,"before they did it, because the stats from that game are retroactively uncertain."
00:23:08,00:23:13,"Notably, superstar Juan Soto made his major league debut May 2018"
00:23:13,00:23:18,"and hit his home run, first home run, May 21st, so the next day."
00:23:18,00:23:21,"Thanks to the quantum science of resumed game time travel,"
00:23:21,00:23:25,he hit his actual first career home run in a game on June 18th
00:23:25,00:23:28,"that was resumed from May 15th, five days before he made his debut."
00:23:28,00:23:29,Amazing.
00:23:29,00:23:31,That's incredible.
00:23:31,00:23:32,Isn't that good?
00:23:32,00:23:34,"It was confusing, but I love it."
00:23:34,00:23:35,I love it.
00:23:35,00:23:36,"Yeah, thanks, Jacob."
00:23:36,00:23:39,"I feel like when you do the second half of that game, resuming it,"
00:23:39,00:23:41,"there should be a thing of continuity, where if you were in the stands,"
00:23:41,00:23:45,"you had to come dressed exactly as you were, everyone has to..."
00:23:45,00:23:47,So you could smash the two bits of footage together.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"Yeah, that's a really fun idea."
00:23:49,00:23:54,"I'll mention that to Jacob, next time you try."
00:23:54,00:23:56,"Derek Elliott Jones writes, ""I was a good little listener this week"
00:23:56,00:23:59,"and followed James' instructions to connect on LinkedIn."""
00:23:59,00:24:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:01,00:24:04,"Was that your end of show, I'm on LinkedIn, right?"
00:24:04,00:24:06,"Yeah, I did, and I've been absolutely inundated."
00:24:06,00:24:08,"I've been LinkedIn links, yeah."
00:24:08,00:24:09,I've got loads.
00:24:09,00:24:10,They're still coming through.
00:24:10,00:24:11,Great.
00:24:11,00:24:12,I want to connect.
00:24:12,00:24:14,Your professional network must be absolutely bulging.
00:24:14,00:24:15,It is.
00:24:15,00:24:16,Yeah.
00:24:16,00:24:18,"And I'm never going to do anything with it, because I don't really use LinkedIn."
00:24:18,00:24:21,But if anyone wants to offer me a job...
00:24:21,00:24:22,You're looking.
00:24:22,00:24:23,Yeah.
00:24:23,00:24:24,Yeah.
00:24:24,00:24:31,"I did years ago, when we did LinkedIn ads, I made a joke in the show that I ran a banana company,"
00:24:31,00:24:32,something like that.
00:24:32,00:24:33,That's all bananas.
00:24:33,00:24:34,And I...
00:24:34,00:24:35,Was it called banana?
00:24:35,00:24:36,It should have been.
00:24:36,00:24:37,It's absolutely should have been.
00:24:37,00:24:38,But I just put it as my description.
00:24:38,00:24:39,I did it on the day.
00:24:39,00:24:40,"Oh, nice."
00:24:40,00:24:41,"Like, not too long ago."
00:24:41,00:24:46,"And I forgot that I'd left it there, and so it's my professional page, you know."
00:24:46,00:24:49,"Oh, I thought you were going to say that, like, big banana have been in touch, and they"
00:24:49,00:24:50,wanted to.
00:24:50,00:24:51,Nothing.
00:24:51,00:24:52,Didn't get anything.
00:24:52,00:24:53,Really?
00:24:53,00:24:56,Just a banana salesman on it and door to door or...
00:24:56,00:24:57,It's in specify.
00:24:57,00:24:59,Maybe I should have been more specific.
00:24:59,00:25:01,"I mean, door to door is a good off."
00:25:01,00:25:02,I sort of...
00:25:02,00:25:04,I would be compelled to buy a banana at the door from someone who turned up as one.
00:25:04,00:25:05,Which?
00:25:05,00:25:06,Not with just one.
00:25:06,00:25:11,"Someone just came to your door and said, ""I have one banana."""
00:25:11,00:25:12,He's chanting heavily.
00:25:12,00:25:13,He's been running.
00:25:13,00:25:16,"We don't know where from, but he needs to get rid of this banana."
00:25:16,00:25:17,I'd be tempted.
00:25:17,00:25:18,I have...
00:25:18,00:25:22,I've had two bits of work from LinkedIn over the years.
00:25:22,00:25:23,Have you?
00:25:23,00:25:24,Yeah.
00:25:24,00:25:25,"What people have just messaged me saying, ""Well, I do this."
00:25:25,00:25:28,"I must have met at least one of them was unpaid."""
00:25:28,00:25:29,But...
00:25:29,00:25:30,Must do.
00:25:30,00:25:31,That's great.
00:25:31,00:25:32,Yeah.
00:25:32,00:25:33,When we did our tour and I had to find people for the end of the show.
00:25:33,00:25:34,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:34,00:25:35,LinkedIn saved me.
00:25:35,00:25:36,Must have done.
00:25:36,00:25:39,"Sounds like we're doing an ad for LinkedIn now, but it genuinely did save me."
00:25:39,00:25:40,That's how I got the Asparamancer.
00:25:40,00:25:41,It was LinkedIn.
00:25:41,00:25:42,Confined it.
00:25:42,00:25:44,My Sparagas fortune teller is on LinkedIn.
00:25:44,00:25:49,"Yeah, but it's only if you're banana salesman, you're going to be connected to her, aren't you?"
00:25:49,00:25:50,Yeah.
00:25:50,00:25:54,She did get confused when it turned out I was on a podcast about facts.
00:25:54,00:25:55,Yeah.
00:25:55,00:25:58,"Well, Derek writes, because you know when you connect with someone, there are more profiles"
00:25:58,00:25:59,for you.
00:25:59,00:26:00,Yeah.
00:26:00,00:26:01,Or if you search for someone that'll suggest links.
00:26:01,00:26:08,"The algorithm tried to find other QI people for him to connect to, so there's Andrew Murray,"
00:26:08,00:26:12,"but just a random director at Hunter Mason, I don't know what that is."
00:26:12,00:26:17,"There's Anna Tajinska, a content producer."
00:26:17,00:26:22,"There's Anna Tajinska-Biali, and there's Laura Coonsburg."
00:26:22,00:26:24,"I get all those as well, I might too."
00:26:24,00:26:25,Yeah.
00:26:25,00:26:28,I just assumed it was you guys because you didn't want to have your real name on LinkedIn.
00:26:28,00:26:34,I'm Laura Coonsburg on LinkedIn at me.
00:26:34,00:26:37,I like the Andrew Murray who's at Hunter.
00:26:37,00:26:38,Which one was that?
00:26:38,00:26:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:39,00:26:40,Did you not connect the Hunter bit?
00:26:40,00:26:41,Nope.
00:26:41,00:26:42,Okay.
00:26:42,00:26:43,Wow.
00:26:43,00:26:44,Wow.
00:26:44,00:26:45,"It's a very difficult job hosting this show, Dan."
00:26:45,00:26:46,You're doing a great job.
00:26:46,00:26:50,I don't have time to spot my own name in the middle of a sentence.
00:26:50,00:26:51,Okay.
00:26:51,00:26:52,Yeah.
00:26:52,00:26:54,"If anyone's listened to this and hasn't added me on LinkedIn, then why not?"
00:26:54,00:26:55,Why not?
00:26:55,00:26:58,I don't see what's in it for you.
00:26:58,00:27:00,"Definitely nothing's in it for me, but do it anyway."
00:27:00,00:27:01,Yeah.
00:27:01,00:27:06,"And Caleb Partridge writes, ""I was wondering if you've noticed,"" writes Caitlin, ""that the"
00:27:06,00:27:10,"name Everard Digby scans perfectly with Erlin Erigby."""
00:27:10,00:27:15,"I have noticed, because do you remember?"
00:27:15,00:27:16,Did I actually do this or did I just write it?
00:27:16,00:27:17,I wrote a song.
00:27:17,00:27:18,"Yeah, I heard it."
00:27:18,00:27:19,"I did do it, didn't I?"
00:27:19,00:27:25,"I did it on stage and it was, Erlin Erigby was a tune and Everard Digby was"
00:27:25,00:27:29,one of the verses and Anna Toshinsky was another one.
00:27:29,00:27:30,And it was like this.
00:27:30,00:27:35,"I don't think you ever, I think maybe you played it once at a work in progress, but I remember"
00:27:35,00:27:38,you sending us a video of you playing it.
00:27:38,00:27:39,On piano?
00:27:39,00:27:40,I think you played it on piano.
00:27:40,00:27:41,I don't know.
00:27:41,00:27:42,I don't remember that.
00:27:42,00:27:43,That sounds good.
00:27:43,00:27:44,"Erlin Erigby, yeah."
00:27:44,00:27:45,Wow.
00:27:45,00:27:48,"And it was like, I don't know, can't remember what it was about now, but it was just something"
00:27:48,00:27:49,about the podcast.
00:27:49,00:27:50,Yeah.
00:27:50,00:27:53,"And they all led up to the final song, which was Erlin Erigby."
00:27:53,00:27:54,Love it.
00:27:54,00:27:57,"I suppose you want to be able to do that anyway, because the Beatles are."
00:27:57,00:27:58,I don't know.
00:27:58,00:27:59,We're down there with it.
00:27:59,00:28:00,Yeah.
00:28:00,00:28:01,That must be parody laws.
00:28:01,00:28:02,There are parody laws.
00:28:02,00:28:03,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:03,00:28:04,"So thank you, Caitlin."
00:28:04,00:28:08,We've got a wedding coming up.
00:28:08,00:28:10,This is nice.
00:28:10,00:28:14,"Jody has written some information about golf, which I'll tell you later, James."
00:28:14,00:28:16,I think everyone would like to hear that.
00:28:16,00:28:17,That's all right.
00:28:17,00:28:20,It's about a cut price golf.
00:28:20,00:28:24,"It's about railway tickets as well, so I am interested."
00:28:24,00:28:29,"But in the 20s, there was a, there was a cut price golfers permit between Liverpool Street"
00:28:29,00:28:33,"in London and Oldborough in Suffolk, so a couple of hours away on the train."
00:28:33,00:28:34,Wow.
00:28:34,00:28:39,"And there was a golfers certificate in the 20s, where you had reduced fares to 130 golf adjacent"
00:28:39,00:28:44,"stations if you got it signed by a golf club secretary, and you were going to play golf."
00:28:44,00:28:45,That sounds great.
00:28:45,00:28:46,Get money off.
00:28:46,00:28:47,Isn't that crazy?
00:28:47,00:28:48,That is really cool.
00:28:48,00:28:49,Money off.
00:28:49,00:28:53,A tick tocker who goes around all the golf courses in London and plays them and says
00:28:53,00:28:55,how good they are and also how far they are from the tube stations.
00:28:55,00:28:56,That's very useful.
00:28:56,00:28:57,Right.
00:28:57,00:28:58,"It is, yeah."
00:28:58,00:29:03,"I stayed in a caravan park the other day, and they've got the, yeah, officially, officially."
00:29:03,00:29:05,"Oh, as in we, like, we were allowed to be there."
00:29:05,00:29:06,You booked.
00:29:06,00:29:07,"Yeah, I stayed in it."
00:29:07,00:29:09,What are these?
00:29:09,00:29:13,"It just, you made it sound a bit like you just, like, I stayed in a caravan park the other"
00:29:13,00:29:14,day.
00:29:14,00:29:16,"I wasn't, like, I just passed out, you know."
00:29:16,00:29:18,"That's Anna, I'm thinking, oh, that's Anna."
00:29:18,00:29:19,Sorry.
00:29:19,00:29:21,It's my head went straight to that you'd been kicked out of home.
00:29:21,00:29:24,"Well, that's not real all alone."
00:29:24,00:29:26,"Personal stuff, yeah."
00:29:26,00:29:27,Is it a summer holiday?
00:29:27,00:29:28,Is it a marital breakdown?
00:29:28,00:29:29,It doesn't matter.
00:29:29,00:29:32,The point is I'm away and I'm getting the fresh air and it's really nice.
00:29:32,00:29:35,"And actually, I prefer it without a caravan, you know what I mean?"
00:29:35,00:29:39,"Yeah, because you didn't say I was in a caravan, you said I was in a caravan park."
00:29:39,00:29:40,Yeah.
00:29:40,00:29:41,Yeah.
00:29:41,00:29:44,Because the anecdote hasn't got me in the caravan park.
00:29:44,00:29:45,I'm so sorry.
00:29:45,00:29:46,We jumped right.
00:29:46,00:29:47,We jumped all over.
00:29:47,00:29:48,"No, please."
00:29:48,00:29:51,I just know that your anecdotes need help sometimes.
00:29:51,00:29:54,Let's let this one struggle to tease.
00:29:54,00:29:56,That's Andy's anecdotes.
00:29:56,00:29:59,"Well, it does need ending, that's the difference."
00:29:59,00:30:02,There is a crazy golf course there.
00:30:02,00:30:06,And there was a board inside the restaurant that they have there where it showed a giant
00:30:06,00:30:11,circuit of crazy golf that goes on where it was a leaderboard and it printed out the monthly
00:30:11,00:30:15,list of who was leading around the fanat area.
00:30:15,00:30:18,And I wonder if you've ever been part of a crazy golf tour.
00:30:18,00:30:21,"To be honest, I'm more of a maxi golf guy."
00:30:21,00:30:22,What's maxi?
00:30:22,00:30:23,As in large golf.
00:30:23,00:30:27,I'm not really a mini golf person.
00:30:27,00:30:28,"So no, here's the answer."
00:30:28,00:30:31,"Also, I've never been to fanat."
00:30:31,00:30:34,"Well, I've been inviting you for a long time."
00:30:34,00:30:38,That's a lovely caravan for you to stay in what you're right.
00:30:38,00:30:39,"No, I haven't put that big right."
00:30:39,00:30:44,I have been to a few like small golf courses where they put the best scores of the month.
00:30:44,00:30:45,I think it's nice.
00:30:45,00:30:47,What about this wedding?
00:30:47,00:30:48,Yes.
00:30:48,00:30:49,Jodie writes.
00:30:49,00:30:50,She sent the information about the golf.
00:30:50,00:30:53,"And then she says, ""I'm getting married to my own James at the end of September."""
00:30:53,00:30:58,"Sadly, I can't say we met through the podcast, but I was already a fan and introduced him"
00:30:58,00:30:59,to it.
00:30:59,00:31:04,"But as we were both obsessed with heritage rowways, there is a steam train theme to the wedding."
00:31:04,00:31:05,Cool.
00:31:05,00:31:06,Yes.
00:31:06,00:31:08,We will be travelling and having the meal on a steam train.
00:31:08,00:31:14,"And I'm also planning to make candy coal for the favours, which is maybe think of you guys,"
00:31:14,00:31:16,is there somewhere I can send some to you guys?
00:31:16,00:31:18,So she's going to send some candy coal for us.
00:31:18,00:31:19,Great.
00:31:19,00:31:20,Nice.
00:31:20,00:31:21,We'll eat it on our next duel.
00:31:21,00:31:22,Absolutely.
00:31:22,00:31:23,There we go.
00:31:23,00:31:24,There you go.
00:31:24,00:31:25,Kathleen Keast.
00:31:25,00:31:26,Right?
00:31:26,00:31:30,I've just listened to episode 5 and 4 about a pig being tried for murder in France.
00:31:30,00:31:37,"You might want to check out a 1993 movie, The Advocate, which starred Colin Firth as the"
00:31:37,00:31:39,lawyer who defended that murderous pig.
00:31:39,00:31:40,Wow.
00:31:40,00:31:41,Really?
00:31:41,00:31:42,How good is that?
00:31:42,00:31:43,Yeah.
00:31:43,00:31:45,"He's not afraid to take a risk, Firth."
00:31:45,00:31:46,Yeah.
00:31:46,00:31:48,And Daniel Day Lewis played the pig?
00:31:48,00:31:49,Yes.
00:31:49,00:31:54,I had to live under a tiradilated peru for three months beforehand.
00:31:54,00:31:56,"Oh, god."
00:31:56,00:31:57,"Oh, there you go."
00:31:57,00:32:00,Thanks for that.
00:32:00,00:32:01,Buff fins.
00:32:01,00:32:03,I can't even remember what that stands for.
00:32:03,00:32:04,It's big.
00:32:04,00:32:05,Big old fish fan.
00:32:05,00:32:06,Factsperts.
00:32:06,00:32:07,It's experts.
00:32:07,00:32:09,"Pete Today has just written, ""Hi, ladies and gents."
00:32:09,00:32:10,Just listen to your piece on jigsaws.
00:32:10,00:32:16,I wanted to thank you for the publicity because Pete is the chair of the benevolent confraternity
00:32:16,00:32:17,"of dysectologists."""
00:32:17,00:32:18,"Oh, cool."
00:32:18,00:32:25,"The jigsaw group, and has included an election of some of his collection of old and new wooden"
00:32:25,00:32:26,puzzles.
00:32:26,00:32:28,That your wife is a member of?
00:32:28,00:32:33,"I'm afraid as a former member, she never made it along to the meetings and she wasn't kicked"
00:32:33,00:32:34,out for anything.
00:32:34,00:32:35,I just think she renewed herself.
00:32:35,00:32:36,Membership flat.
00:32:36,00:32:37,Yeah.
00:32:37,00:32:38,Right.
00:32:38,00:32:39,I bought it for her as a one-year thing.
00:32:39,00:32:41,"And I said, unless you're using your styling, I'm going to be quite serious and come off"
00:32:41,00:32:42,it.
00:32:42,00:32:45,I think it's about £12 for the year's membership.
00:32:45,00:32:49,"You're not using the electricity, is your hands at you, but you're not using it."
00:32:49,00:32:55,"You're not using the light, then the light button, the bulb goes."
00:32:55,00:32:56,"Oh, that's nice."
00:32:56,00:32:57,"Anyway, so thanks."
00:32:57,00:32:58,Thank you.
00:32:58,00:32:59,Anything from him?
00:32:59,00:33:03,"No, it was a link to some images of his collection of jigsaws, so it was an informational"
00:33:03,00:33:04,"gift, not a..."
00:33:04,00:33:07,"Well, that went into your personal folder."
00:33:07,00:33:08,"Yeah, exactly."
00:33:08,00:33:10,"Did your wife have the card, you know, the..."
00:33:10,00:33:11,The Jigsaw?
00:33:11,00:33:12,"Yeah, I know."
00:33:12,00:33:13,I can't remember now.
00:33:13,00:33:14,I can't remember either.
00:33:14,00:33:16,Is this where we got to last time?
00:33:16,00:33:17,It was a bit of an ampass.
00:33:17,00:33:19,"I think I politely said, yes, she did have the card, but I can't remember."
00:33:19,00:33:20,She probably did.
00:33:20,00:33:22,"Yeah, imagine if you're joining, you get the card."
00:33:22,00:33:23,Right.
00:33:23,00:33:33,"And just to finish us off, so do you form that point?"
00:33:33,00:33:39,That's definitely going to have to go at the end for continuity reasons.
00:33:39,00:33:46,"Honestly, Adam's been away for two weeks."
00:33:46,00:33:51,He's been talking about introducing this page on this.
00:33:51,00:33:55,The new tier on Patreon.
00:33:55,00:33:58,"Okay, sorry."
00:33:58,00:34:07,"I can't actually see anymore, because I can't see."
00:34:07,00:34:08,"Oh, dear."
00:34:08,00:34:11,"All right, well, the continuity of me crying with laughter will that be a problem?"
00:34:11,00:34:12,Yeah.
00:34:12,00:34:16,It's just a little bit of non-determ.
00:34:16,00:34:17,Go on.
00:34:17,00:34:21,"There's a guy called Dr. William Wood, who's on a mission to ban wood stoves in Tasmania."
00:34:21,00:34:22,Very good.
00:34:22,00:34:23,Yeah.
00:34:23,00:34:28,I saw a book about the history of bread by a guy called Dr. Butterie.
00:34:28,00:34:29,No.
00:34:29,00:34:31,That's brilliant.
00:34:31,00:34:32,That's really good.
00:34:32,00:34:37,"That's from Sam Leicester, I should say, sorry."
00:34:37,00:34:41,"So Tracy Gunn writes, ""Harrin Gate Council's noise and nuisance officer is Craig Bellringer."""
00:34:41,00:34:42,Very good.
00:34:42,00:34:43,Very good.
00:34:43,00:34:45,Pretty good.
00:34:45,00:34:46,That's it.
00:34:46,00:34:47,"Oh, nice."
00:34:47,00:34:48,Happy ending.
00:34:48,00:34:49,That was a...
00:34:49,00:34:58,So thanks so much for listening to Dr. Sir Lion this month.
00:34:58,00:34:59,It's wonderful.
00:34:59,00:35:03,It's just a joy to read your emails.
00:35:03,00:35:04,Keep them coming.
00:35:04,00:35:05,We should do this more often.
00:35:05,00:35:06,Yeah.
00:35:06,00:35:07,Yeah.
00:35:07,00:35:08,Okay.
00:35:08,00:35:09,Finish us off.
00:35:09,00:35:18,"Thanks for listening, and if you'd like to comment on anything we've said in the course"
00:35:18,00:35:23,"of this episode or any other episodes, then write an email to podcast@QI.com."
00:35:23,00:35:26,We'll be back before long with another drop of the line.
00:35:26,00:35:27,We'll see you then.
00:35:27,00:35:28,Bye.
