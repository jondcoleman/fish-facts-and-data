00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
 She's not gonna be a huddle, won't work, is it?

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.380
 She's not gonna be a huddle, won't work, is it?

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.620
 She's not gonna be a huddle, won't work, is it?

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:20.100
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.300
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.200
 My name is Dan Tribert, and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anitzzynski, and Andy

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.160
 Murray, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.640
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.480
 Andrew Hunter Murray, I saw your face.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.680
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact, my fact this week is that scientists

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.760
 have finally worked out why the four of us, and all humans, are not constantly leaking.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.040
 They started with the four of us, didn't they?

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.040
 We were the guinea pigs.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.040
 Yeah, extrapolated.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.040
 Yes, exactly.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.960
 No, this is, we've just worked out, actually, I say just, actually, and also I think, and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.960
 you are leaking, are you?

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 Oh, sorry, yeah.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.760
 We've already had these chairs upholstered once this week, I think, come on.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.560
 This was discovered or published at least in November of 2016, and I didn't know this,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.480
 but scientists have been desperately trying to work out, desperately as a bit of a straight

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.760
 figure, why we don't constantly leak, because we shed more than 500 million cells every

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.760
 24 hours.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.840
 So basically in a two to four week period, our entire body of outer layer skin is completely

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.920
 replaced.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.720
 In the process of that happening, we should just be suddenly, you know, a bit of arm skin

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.520
 goes and suddenly blood spurting out or sweat or we should be like just sprinkler systems

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.600
 nonstop, but we're not, and they don't know why, except for now they do.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.160
 And why is it then?

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.000
 It is so easy to explain, I'm not even going to bother.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Let me try.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.680
 Okay, what it is is, we have effectively three layers of skin, which I think works a bit

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.080
 like a conveyor belt.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.760
 You know how, like, sharp teeth get replaced, the further they go forward.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.760
 Yeah.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.400
 So the top layer is just the dead skin almost, it's really flaky and it goes all over

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400
 the shop.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.920
 Then there's this middle one, which is a bit fluidy, and that's really nice.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.120
 And then we have an original layer, which is sort of like the real meat of the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.120
 cake.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.120
 Of the meat cake.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.120
 Excellent metaphors.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.120
 Yeah.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.520
 I didn't realize it was this easy to explain, I have to say.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.840
 And so what happens is they all shift up one place and what they didn't know was how it

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.160
 was that no holes were being revealed when the flakes of skin were disappearing, what was

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.120
 plugging the gap and what they've discovered is what effectively is kind of like a pricked

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120
 glue.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.800
 It's like a temporary glue, not as good as super glue, which eventually comes to the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.240
 second layer, but that original layer has a sort of pricked stick glue, which holds the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.480
 gaps closed so it holds all the stuff in.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.200
 So it's like a meaty cake with pricked stick on it?

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.720
 Yeah, at the bottom layer.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.040
 And don't forget there are three layers of sharks teeth on the top layer.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.040
 Yeah.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.200
 I didn't realize that we were completely dead on the outside.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200
 No, we're not dead.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.040
 It's almost dead on the inside.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.840
 No, there's the very outermost layer of skin cells that are dead, I think.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.120
 Yeah, we're just we're we're wearing death.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.080
 New wearing today, just death, that's the worst bits of me.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.080
 That is weird, isn't it?

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.080
 Yeah.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.080
 The cells are there.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.400
 They're full of keratin, which is also when you're, you know, you're thinking of your

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.720
 hair and things, but none of the cell machinery is in that outermost layer.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.960
 Yeah, that is bizarre.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.960
 That's the same thing.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.000
 So this study has found the structure of that second layer down.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.040
 The second layer is called the stratum granuloseum, and that layer has got a special

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.600
 structure that they've just found out.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.760
 And that's the reason that they've worked out that we're not leaking, right?

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.680
 This structure is an extremely efficient way to pack together shapes.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.560
 And it was first discovered by Lord Kelvin, and it is tetradecahedrons, which means it's

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.880
 objects with 14 faces, and our cells are made of these shapes, so they really pack together

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.480
 nicely, which means nothing can get through.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.480
 Yeah.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.640
 Well, though, I've been so confused by this and I know mine mine was way easier as an

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.640
 explanation.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.640
 What was that?

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.640
 Tetradecahedrons.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.600
 The thing is, tetradecahedrons, you would have thought, if that was good at plugging gaps,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.160
 then the ones with 16 faces are going to be even better, and shapes with 18 faces are going

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.160
 to be even better.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.120
 It can't be that 14 faces is the maximum goodness of plugging gaps out, but then think about

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.600
 a cube.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.480
 That fits together perfectly, but then an object with five faces isn't quite as good as

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.480
 a cube, is it?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.920
 I don't really know.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.920
 Okay.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.440
 But I'll take your word for it.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.480
 What are you saying that nature should have selected a better tetradecahedron?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.280
 I'm just saying it's interesting that this 14 face shape seemed to be the ideal shape for

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.280
 our skin to be.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.280
 Right.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.280
 Okay.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.280
 Yeah.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.280
 It's the same shape as the new £1 coin.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.280
 I don't know.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.280
 Yeah.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.520
 So in an extremist, could you plug a gap or a wound in your skin with a £1 coin?

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.520
 Yes.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.520
 But hang on.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.520
 No, is it the same shape as that?

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.520
 I thought it's a 3D.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.520
 It would be if it was a 3D.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.680
 It's the same shape as that because the new £1 coin has 12 sides around the edge and then

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.640
 it has two sides on the front of that.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.640
 I mean, it's the same shape.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.640
 It's not exactly that.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.640
 It's got the same number of faces.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.640
 Yes.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.640
 Yeah.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.080
 Because it's more like a Rubik's cube, but with more faces.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.000
 It's more equilateral, I think, the one in the skin compared to the £1 coin.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.840
 But basically, as you say, when I seriously wound you later, you can shove a £1 coin in there

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.120
 and see how much good it does.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.800
 So, Lord Kelvin, back in the day, he was trying to work out what is the best way that foam

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.240
 can work.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.800
 So if you have a load of bubbles, what's the absolute most efficient way that they can

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.800
 pack together?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.800
 Yeah.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.440
 And he came up with this particular shape and then it's only recently that we found out

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.440
 it's in the human body.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.440
 That's amazing.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.440
 That's really cool.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.640
 Why was there a problem in the 19th century with foam being inefficiently packed?

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.720
 Well, no.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.960
 So he was studying mathematics and there's a really interesting thing in maths, which is

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.520
 if you get a load of bowls and put them together, how do they pack nicest?

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.360
 And the way it turns out is the same way as green grossers do it with oranges.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.600
 So you put them all down, then you put spheres in all the gaps, and that's the most efficient

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.600
 way of packing it.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.640
 And they've done it with four-dimensional, five-dimensional, six-dimensional.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.040
 It's a really interesting kind of mathematical thing that they do.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.520
 Have you guys heard of Matt Tech?

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.520
 No.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.000
 It's a lab in America and its business is growing human skin.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Oh, wow.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.920
 So there's an incredible feature about them in white.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.560
 I really recommend reading it.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:37.360
 They grow two humans' worth of skin every week, but in thousands of little coin forms.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.360
 And basically, it's so that you can test shampoos or cosmetics or anything you like detergent

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.400
 or lukelyner or suntan lotion on these little coins of skin.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.400
 Wow.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.400
 Yeah, and they grow them.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.880
 So what they do is they get off cuts from hospitals.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.880
 So if you've been circumcised in Boston, your skin may have been your foreskin, may have

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.240
 been grown to two football pitches in size, and then cut up for experiments.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240
 Wow.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.000
 So Shampoo will have the same effect on someone's foreskin as it will on someone's scalp.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Can we be sure of that?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 No.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Okay.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 We cannot.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 But I think he can plant that.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 I think he's got a thing that says on the bottle.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.200
 No, it's been tested on foreskin, but they know what they're doing.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.200
 Yeah.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.200
 All the other operations as well.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.200
 Like a tummy-tuck or breast surgery.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.680
 They're various things like this.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.680
 Yeah.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.680
 Wow.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.680
 I know.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.680
 And they grow it, and so imagine that.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.080
 What I was also experimented on skin is a guy called Brown Secard, who I reckoned probably

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.080
 talked about before.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.920
 He was a scientist in the 19th century who was always experimenting on himself.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.320
 And he wanted to know why we needed skin and whether we'd be fine without it.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.240
 And so to do, to find out whether we'd be right without our skin, he didn't do the disgusting

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.240
 thing you're imagining.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.800
 He covered his skin completely from head to toe in fly paper varnish, which completely

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.960
 blocks it up.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.600
 So it was to find out if the skin's actually having a useful interaction with the outside

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.600
 world.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.520
 And almost dying, because it turns out we do need asking it.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.520
 Yeah.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.520
 That's like gold finger.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.520
 Yeah.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.920
 The lady who, not the villain, it was the lady in the movie she was covering in gold.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.920
 And she died.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.920
 And there was a roof.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.920
 Did she though?

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.920
 I think was that not a rumor?

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.920
 No, in the movie she died.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.920
 Oh, in the movie she died.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.920
 I think it was.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.920
 I think it was.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.920
 I know.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.920
 I don't go to the movies and just listen to the rumors up to let's see.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.200
 Actually, everybody dies in the movie, but like, did he really die?

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200
 It was a rumor.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.200
 He did.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.960
 It would be a big a bit of film trivia if one of the bond movies had killed an actress

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.960
 by painting her goals.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.920
 No, but that was one of the great myths of it, is that in real life, she suffered from that

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.920
 and she died.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.880
 I thought it was real myth that if that happened, you would die.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.040
 But I thought they had left something like a patch of skin on her back unpainted and she

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.160
 breathed through the house.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.160
 That was a rumor.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.680
 But we don't know the absolute truth about this bond lady.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.440
 I don't think, based on that conversation, except she definitely didn't die.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.440
 Right?

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.440
 Don't know.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.440
 She's alive.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.440
 She's fine.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.880
 So, I did that and he did nearly die and you can't, if you do that and his student burst

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.160
 in and found him completely unconscious in the corner of the room covered in varnish.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.720
 And so he got some sandpaper and started sandpaper in his farm.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.280
 Yeah, he sanded him down and then when he regained consciousness, he shouts.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.280
 Must be a better way.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:11.280
 Did he then cover him in a layer of teacoil and slowly work that in with the grain?

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.280
 Yes, sir.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.280
 Is that a carpentry joke?

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.280
 Kind of, yeah.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.280
 Okay.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.280
 Jokes a bit much.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.040
 But yeah, and he was really pissed off, Brownsacar, when he regained consciousness, he said

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.040
 he ruined the experiment.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.560
 We were going to find out if it could kill somebody.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.560
 That's amazing.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.840
 And the student was like, no, it can.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.040
 He's the same guy who, he ate a patient's vomit once to give himself cholera, so he could

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.720
 prove that lording them worked.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.820
 And then he almost died from that as well, actually, and had to be revived.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.920
 Is it the same student who's just saving him?

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:47.200
 It comes into work each day, hey, oh, Jesus, he's covered in rats, what's going on?

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:54.000
 We know house mites, so they live on our skin, and they eat skin, and do you know what they

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 also eat?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 They also eat their own skin.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Do they?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Yeah.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.600
 So house mites are as much of a problem for themselves as they are for us, basically.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.640
 Do you dung beetles eat their own dung?

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.960
 Don't know.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.960
 You would, wouldn't you?

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.960
 You would.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.120
 If you were into dung, it's the most readily accessible dung you can get, isn't it?

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120
 Yeah.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.720
 But the thing about house mites is that they have skin, and then when it flakes off, they

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.440
 eat it, and they also excrete it and they eat it several times to get all the nutrition out

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.440
 of it.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.440
 Clever?

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.440
 Yes.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.440
 I know.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.840
 I read the fact that I found prettier astonishing today, which is that we have a microbiome,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.840
 so we're covered.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.920
 Obviously, every, apparently, centimeter of our skin is covered in thousands of different

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.320
 species of bacteria.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:41.120
 So we are literally housing a planet in the same way that our planet is housing life.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.240
 We're doing the exact same thing, just on our own body with bacteria.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.760
 And the article said that if you were to, if there was a scientist who decided to grind

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:57.160
 up a single person and sequence all the DNA for that guy to grind up himself, but he's got

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.160
 one foot in the grinder.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.160
 It makes sense.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160
 He comes in, boss.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.160
 No.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.160
 So, yeah.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:10.040
 So the article was saying, if a sadistic scientist like him did decide to do that, grind up

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.360
 and sequence all of that DNA that was on our entire body, either in our body or on top of

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:22.280
 our body, only 2% of the genetic material that he would find would be us, the human in the

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.280
 rest of it.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.280
 The rest of it is all the bacteria.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.280
 The rest of it is all the animals.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.280
 Yeah.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.280
 98%.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.080
 We're carrying 98% something else other than us.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.080
 Filthy.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.080
 That's not yet.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.080
 That's very cool.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.080
 We need a shower.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.080
 That's disgusting.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.080
 Yeah.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.080
 Okay.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.960
 It is time for fact number two.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.960
 And that is James.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.960
 Okay.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:45.360
 My fact this week is that the iconic green code at the start of the Matrix movie is made from

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.360
 sushi recipes.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.200
 So cool.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.200
 So this is a fact.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.320
 He's been on the internet a little bit over the last few weeks, but I really like it.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.880
 And it was an interview with CNET by production designer Simon Whitley.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.400
 And he said that these little things that are going up and down are made of reverse letters,

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.920
 numbers and Japanese katakana characters, which are from sushi recipes.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.920
 Yeah.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.280
 It's his wife's sushi recipe book, wasn't it?

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.320
 He scanned it in and took all of the, yeah, the writing.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.320
 So cool.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.840
 So do you think there's anyone who just watches the Matrix when they need to cook a jacket,

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.600
 Japanese meal for their friends?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.240
 Where is that DVD?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.520
 I also think I've only eaten sushi.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.520
 I've never made it.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.240
 There can't be much in the way of recipes.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.240
 Yeah.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.240
 No.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.240
 Take some fish.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.240
 Take some rice.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.240
 Wrap it up.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.240
 Into it.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.240
 Into the Matrix, we all live in the Matrix.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.480
 It's an exciting theory, isn't it?

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.480
 Yeah.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.800
 Actually, a relatively mainstream theory these days that we might live in the Matrix.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800
 It is.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.360
 But like I was reading a lot of articles about it off the back of you putting this fact forward.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.520
 And there's a lot of conferences with big scientists talking about it.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:00.040
 And even I, who love this kind of thing, was a bit like, "Guys, this is bullshit.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.360
 You're wasting your time."

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.200
 But then I have a physics degree and I actually believe it.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.200
 Do you?

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.680
 Do you know what the problem is?

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.680
 This is what I noticed.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.680
 You had these big scientists.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.800
 Neil DeGrasse Tyson was the host of this big conference and a lot of scientists talking

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.800
 about it.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.840
 And I realize the difference is that stoners say this stuff all the time.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.840
 No one takes it seriously.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.440
 But if you're able to like say an equation at the end of your sentence, suddenly the world

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.120
 is really interested.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.120
 And that's what that was.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.920
 That was a stoner conference with maths.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.120
 Maybe every time you say something stupid, if you just say, "Why equals X squared?"

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.120
 Exactly.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.600
 Do you just only like conspiracy theories before they get mainstream?

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.360
 I think you're kind of a hipster for nonsense.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.360
 Yeah.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.120
 The JFK assassination is so hack.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.680
 So one of the most basic ways of looking at this is we think it's probably possible for

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.480
 us to make a simulation of the universe at some stage in the future it will be.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.720
 And when that happens, it will be done.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.440
 And it will be done more than once.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.280
 And we wouldn't know if we're in here or if we're in the simulation.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.840
 And so likelihood is there's one reality and loads of simulations.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.840
 So statistically we're more likely to be in one of the simulations.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.160
 Although I have a problem with that slightly because I'm not quite sure how we know there's

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.160
 any one reality.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.800
 And then there's like a kind of multiverse theory and a parallel universe theory.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.800
 Yeah.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.240
 So there could just be infinite numbers of simulations and realities.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.240
 That's true.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.240
 That's true.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.360
 Although it could be that each of the realities has a load of simulations.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.360
 Oh god.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.360
 Of course.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.360
 And you can have different levels of infinity.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.360
 You can have higher infinities and lower infinities.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:36.800
 So I'm plugging the joint, handed over, man, give me a hit of that.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.560
 Elon Musk, I think, says, and I know he's got, he's a bit wacky.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.440
 But he does say that that he thinks there's billions to one chance that we're not living

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.440
 in a simulation.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.440
 Yeah, I would.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.440
 So.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.440
 But you say that.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.040
 I don't know if people really believe it.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.280
 You know intellectually it's probably true.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.840
 But do you really think we're in someone's video game?

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.720
 I think it's more likely than not.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.120
 But then I also think that it doesn't make any difference.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.240
 Why was about to ask, what can I do?

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.960
 We're in a simulation.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.040
 What am I to do about it?

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:13.240
 You can hire, in Silicon Valley, to tech billionaires who have remained anonymous, have hired

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.400
 a bunch of scientists to try and work on breaking out of the simulation.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.400
 It must be Musk, right?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.400
 It must be him who's one of them.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.400
 They've remained anonymous.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.400
 I don't want to spread rumors about it.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.400
 I have people being given money to try and break us out of the simulation that we're

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.400
 in.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.640
 That was two sentences, I think, in a New Yorker's article, right?

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.000
 And no one has followed up on who these people are.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 But it sounds like it's true.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 It's a good job, though, isn't it?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 What a job.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Yeah.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 The scientist is just sorry.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Yeah, still nothing.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 So we'll need another grant.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 I'm afraid.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.200
 Yeah, we haven't been in the boss on level three yet, so do you think they would just play

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.840
 the Sims and try and work out how to get the Sims out of their simulation?

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.840
 That's such a good idea.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.840
 Yeah.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.440
 Can you make the Sims play Sims when you're playing the Sims?

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440
 Ah.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.440
 Don't know, mate.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.440
 Because if you can do that, I'm with you and your theory.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.120
 The only Alex Bell, who almost came on this podcast today, would know the answer to that

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.640
 because he's a Sims fanatic and he's not here.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.640
 Yeah.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.640
 Oh, well.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.920
 There was an engineer from MIT who works out how much computer memory it would take up

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.480
 to simulate the universe as it is now.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.760
 So the universe is massively complicated.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.240
 And he looked into the size of the computer that would be needed to get in all this information.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.320
 And he worked out that the computer itself that is running our simulation would have to

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.120
 be bigger than the universe.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.280
 So that's impossible.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.280
 But then--

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.280
 Using windows or--

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.280
 Yeah.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.280
 Looks like you're trying to build a universe.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.200
 Then he upgraded his system and it turns out it's fine.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.960
 Because you would just put on that little star screen saver with the stars, wouldn't you?

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.960
 Yeah.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.720
 That's basically good enough for a first step.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.720
 See, I think a lot of people think that's not good enough and that there's more to the

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.720
 universe.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.000
 No, maybe we're not even the computer game.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.320
 Maybe we're the screen saver.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.840
 How embarrassing.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.280
 The point is we don't require much computer memory because it's not like there's an entire

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.640
 universe that's been simulated.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.960
 They've only simulated the bits that we're clever enough to spot.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.280
 So we're too stupid to see all the massive gaps in this computer system.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.240
 So it's like every time we study the movement of stars or something, then in this computer simulation

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.040
 they go, OK, the humans are looking at it now.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.000
 We better provide some information for them here.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.400
 But the rest of the time, they don't have that information there.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.080
 And that saves on computer memory.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.960
 And that's why there is a computer that's the right size to run this simulation that

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.960
 we're all in.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.960
 And that's why in quantum physics, things only change when you actually observe them.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960
 Yes.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.560
 Because we're all in a computer.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.560
 That's the thing.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.440
 Like, you don't see the, you know, I haven't played Sims, but presumably there are people

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.440
 in it.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.440
 Are there people in it?

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.440
 Yeah, you build a family and they have jobs and lives.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.800
 So you don't see the family suddenly sitting around dinner going, do you think we're in

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.800
 a simulation?

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.800
 Of course.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.640
 Because if we are, the simulation has started to question itself.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.840
 There is a philosophy expansion pack of the Sims where they do do that.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.440
 So it's really good.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.560
 So one way you might be able to tell if you're in the matrix is if there's a glitch in the

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.240
 matrix, this is a thing, isn't it?

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.560
 It's like a little meme.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.480
 If you're going to read it, you can go on to reddit.com/glitch in the matrix.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.480
 Oh, cool.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.520
 And you can see examples of when people have spotted it.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.520
 Spotted it.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.520
 Right.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.800
 So some of them, I only read the headlines because they read a few of the actual explanations

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.240
 they were a bit boring.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:21.600
 But someone said, three eggs have disappeared in my fridge.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.600
 Glitch in the matrix, guys.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.440
 Where is my sandwich glitch in the matrix?

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:33.720
 I think I heard perfect by Ed Sheeran in 2008 or 2009.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720
 Wow.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.720
 Come on, guys.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.720
 If that isn't evidence, I don't know what it is.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.720
 It's irrefutable.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:44.400
 There's a famous one as well, which I was told about by our buddy Joel, who is one of

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.480
 the writers of those ladybird books.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.480
 And he's very much convinced that this is the glitch.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.320
 And it's that there used to be a series of kids books, which I used to read as a kid called

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.320
 the baronstein.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.320
 What's that?

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.320
 We've never heard that before.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.840
 Oh, we got a bit close to reality, guys.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.840
 Which alert?

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.840
 Which alert?

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.240
 They're coming for us.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.920
 We're getting a man in black, I'm in there.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:16.760
 Yeah, so the baronstein bears, it was a series of kid books, and the glitch is that everyone

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.720
 seems to remember that they're called the baronstein bears, but in fact, they're called

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.440
 the baronstein bears.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.760
 The authors were baronstein.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.920
 And genuinely, there's a whole thing on the internet of people talking about, "I swear

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.280
 to God, I grew up on these books.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.640
 My whole childhood, it had an e, not an a, instein, not stay."

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.640
 Really?

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.880
 And the glitches, the books have suddenly just all changed themselves to a different

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.880
 name.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.320
 That's like Walker's crisps, everyone thinks they remember Walker's cheese non-ion crisps

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.160
 being the blue flavor or whatever flavor they're not.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.160
 The green flavor.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.160
 They are the blue flavor.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.400
 Yeah, they are the blue flavor, and everyone thinks that they used to be the green flavor,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.400
 and they never were.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.960
 But that sounds like it's another glitch.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.960
 Yeah.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.240
 And it's like, what happens to my sandwich, guys?

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.240
 So many glitches.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.120
 In the Matrix, the creators of it were quite keen that everyone who was involved got

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.160
 to grips with a philosophy, weren't they?

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.280
 So it was the Wachowski brothers who are, in fact, both the Wachowski sisters now.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.920
 So it was the Wachowski brothers who wrote the screenplay for and directed the Matrix,

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:23.600
 and they are both transgender, and they are both now Lana and Lily Wachowski.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.360
 But they, you know, cited as their influences for the Matrix, like Homer and Hitchcock and

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.000
 Dostoevsky in this whole array of kind of different sources.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.800
 So I knew I was always going, "Don't!"

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:45.400
 You think it's the first part of the word "Dostoevsky"?

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.400
 Wow!

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.840
 We're really on different planes aren't we, Dostoevsky?

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.480
 Anyway, during the filming of it, everyone who worked in it, all the actors were made to

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.480
 read three books.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.520
 They were made to read three books of philosophy.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:04.360
 So Simulacra and Simulation by Jean-Baudrillard, who's like a sociologist and philosopher, and

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.280
 then they were made to read out of control by a next editor of Wired, and they were made

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.800
 to read introducing evolutionary psychology.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.520
 So they had to really come to terms with the philosophy that they were exploring.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.520
 Yeah, that's interesting.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:21.680
 That's sort of coming very handy during the massive gun fight seen in the lobby.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.120
 So the Warner Brothers, they didn't trust the Wachowski brothers at first, because the

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.920
 Wachowski brothers had very little experience making films, and this was a very big idea.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.600
 So they told them they had to go away and direct another film first.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.600
 Okay.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.000
 And just a go away and make a different film, and if that one's a success, we'll let you

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 make the Matrix.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 And what would see the other one?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.560
 They went and made a film called "Bound", which is described by the New Yorker as a lesbian

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.800
 thriller with a happy ending, which doesn't sound very close to the Matrix.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.080
 It doesn't seem like a perfect proof of concept.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.240
 No, you mean they've set them sort of a bad job interview there?

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.480
 Yeah, but it was a success, and then they said, all right, you can go away and make the

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.480
 Matrix.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.840
 And did they do a sort of classic happy ending, or did they misinterpret it as a massage

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.840
 happy ending?

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.440
 Well, it was a scene bound, just curious, if I saw the make a movie with a happy ending.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.440
 You would do that.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.440
 Would you though?

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.840
 So it doesn't fit in with the plot, but they told me to do it.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.520
 Every Disney fan would end in a masturbation scene, I've done this there.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.520
 Well, we saved the day.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.120
 Just got to have a quick massage.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.320
 It's very worth it you're happy ending, and that's the first thing you assume.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.360
 The Matrix would not have been made if you were the Wachowski brothers.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:40.280
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chisinski.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:45.200
 My fact this week is that the longest ever kayak trip was completed by a man who couldn't

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.600
 swim.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.320
 This was a really good article in Fantasy Fair over some time in the last couple of weeks.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.480
 It's about a guy called Oscar Speck, who was just this amazing guy.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.280
 He was German, and in 1932, he climbed into a kayak.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.600
 His business wasn't going very well, like Germany was in the doldrums then, because of the

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.200
 depression and because of the Versailles Treaty, combination of the two.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:11.760
 He got in a kayak thought, sod this, got onto the Danube, and he kayaked for 30,000 miles

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.400
 all the way to Australia, where he arrived in 1939, and when he arrived.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.880
 And when he arrived, he was immediately put in prison because the World War II had started.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.520
 He was German, but he enjoyed it so much that he decided he was going to go to Australia.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.800
 That was never the plan.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:31.120
 So he would kayak during the day, and then he would dine in the evenings with ambassadors

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.400
 and the rich of every place that he was staying.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.280
 In fact, he even, and this is maybe potentially why he was arrested when he got to Australia.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.040
 He was German, obviously, but at one point, he met up with a Nazi officer who gave him money

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:49.040
 funding the next leg of his kayak trip, and he had a Nazi flag on the front of the kayak

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.040
 as he was going.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:56.320
 They probably thought they were being invaded by the smallest ever German bosses.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.480
 You wait till the other guys get here.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.560
 Yeah, he didn't think he was going to go to Australia, didn't he?

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.560
 He had a vague goal of reaching Cyprus to work in the copper mines.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.280
 Yeah, that was his big dream, wasn't it?

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.280
 He wanted to work in a mine.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.280
 That was his...

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.280
 And he realized it.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.280
 Yeah.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.240
 So he ended up, by kind of coincidence, I guess, a kind of north of Sydney in a big,

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:23.320
 opal mining area, and he really did make his living from then on with opal mining.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.560
 So he had this fantasy about mining, and he was always sending random bits of rock home

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.800
 to his family, and saying, "I think this is really precious and they just go, it's a lump

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.800
 of rock, mate.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.800
 Keep kayaking."

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:36.800
 But he really did make his fortune in opal mining, and he never went back home.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.640
 I don't think, "Oh, he didn't go back home until 1970, never sort of parents again,

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.840
 spent the rest of his days out in Australia."

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.160
 Well, seven of them were spent in prison of war.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:51.200
 He was, we should add, he stayed in Australia post-war, but for the entirety of World War

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.040
 II, he was in jail.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.040
 So he was, he arrived, was arrested, and spent World War II.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.800
 Although he did escape twice.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.760
 Did he get recaptured because he insisted on going with his kayak?

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:08.680
 Just look for any waterways suitable for a kayak, could be on one of those.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.960
 He got arrested in India.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:18.360
 On the theory, they believed that his kayak was also a submarine.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.640
 And they thought they thought it was a spy, right?

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.960
 They thought he was a spy and that he was kind of scouting for the Nazis.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:32.160
 I've been canoeing or kayaking, and for a lot of the time, my kayak was a submarine.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:37.600
 I had the problem where I went, I think it was kayaking with my wife, both of us in the

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.440
 same kayak, but I sat the back and she sat at the front, and I'm a lot heavier than she

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.440
 is.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:49.560
 And so she was paddling in midair, and I was just sinking.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.560
 So the one thing that I didn't read in all of this stuff about him is that he couldn't

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.560
 swim.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.400
 Did that change at all when he was...

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.720
 No, he never learned to swim.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.720
 He never learned to swim.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.720
 No, I mean.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.200
 Because there's huge stretches of just ocean, like dangerous, high wave ocean.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.200
 Well, there wasn't.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.840
 I mean, there were stretches where he'd go for like 15 miles or whatever.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.320
 But actually, if you look at the route, he did hug the coast as much as he could, as you

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.320
 would.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.200
 Also, he didn't really reach Australia.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:19.600
 He reached an island that the Australians had colonized and it wasn't mainland Australia.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.600
 But it still was.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.600
 But it still was Australia.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.880
 I would argue that you would have quite a journey to then get actually to the coast of

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.880
 Oz.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.960
 He'd been all the way around Papua New Guinea and fell by that point and dropped down.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.960
 Yeah.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.160
 He landed in Syby, which was Australia.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.160
 I'm impressed.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.160
 Like it's...

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.160
 Yeah.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.160
 You'd do it, Dan.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.160
 I'm just saying.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:42.120
 But it's interesting that the non- not being able to swim thing is extraordinary because as

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.480
 soon as you're even this far away in a pool from a ledge and you can't swim, that becomes

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.480
 dangerous.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.480
 Yeah.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.480
 A kilometer is dangerous if you can't swim.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.480
 Yeah, it is mad.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.480
 Yeah.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.480
 He was probably a bit mad.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.480
 I'm big in the mouth here.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.480
 Yeah.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.480
 Yeah.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.080
 So, Britain sells kayaks to the Inuits now.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.080
 Really?

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:06.000
 Yes, because a school trip went there a few years ago with a few kayaks and then by the

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.440
 end they didn't need the kayaks anymore.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.440
 They were going home.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.080
 And so they said to those guys, "Do you want these?"

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.120
 And they were like, "Oh yeah, we ran out a few decades ago.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.120
 We'll take some back."

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.920
 And then the company that makes them now send a few over every year.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.920
 That's very cool.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.920
 That's very nice.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.560
 Pope John Paul, the second loved kayaking.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.560
 To do.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.560
 Yeah.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.560
 He was in a race and he was winning it.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.240
 And just before the finish line, he got a hole in his boat and he sunk just a holy

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.240
 boat.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.560
 That's so good.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:40.840
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:45.840
 My fact is that male butterflies use fake sperm to trick each other into thinking they're

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.840
 extra fertile.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.560
 I'm glad we were going to have the ending to this podcast.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.920
 90% of butterflies sperm is fake.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.920
 What?

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.920
 So, what is it?

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.920
 Plaster of Paris.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.640
 It's...it's just filler.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.640
 Poly filler.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.600
 It's not poly...it's completely bogus sperm.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.680
 It's sperm lookalikes which have no nucleus.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.160
 They carry no proper genetic information that can be passed on in a mating sense.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.160
 90%.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160
 Wow.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.960
 So a sperm without a nucleus.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.960
 Yeah.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.960
 So it's just a dummy.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:23.960
 It's a dummy.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.760
 Do they know that?

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:46.000
 They don't know what they're doing yet, because when they're mating, right?

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.680
 Male butterflies, this is a bit gross, but they use their penis to measure inside the females

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.000
 how fault she is, are you whether she's mated before?

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.080
 And it's like using the dipstick in a car's oil tank, is the closest analogy, yeah?

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.080
 Okay.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.080
 Yeah, they then decide how...

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.720
 So sorry, do they pull it out and see where the line is?

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.720
 I don't know what they do, but they...

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.720
 Okay.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.560
 I don't know exactly how they do it, but they then decide how much sperm to deposit based

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.280
 on the female's mating history, and it's much cheaper for them to produce non-fertile

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.280
 sperm, right?

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.600
 It's cheaper in form, as far as energy is concerned, it takes a lot less results.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.600
 Not money.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.600
 Yeah.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:25.440
 If the female is nearly empty, then the male will inject lots of fertile sperm, but then loads

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.960
 and loads of fake stuff, which is designed to put off future males who might mate with the

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.960
 female.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.960
 Because then they do the dipstick thing.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.360
 They come along and they'll say, oh, then there's females mate with those of males, and

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.240
 there's a less of a chance that my genetic material will get passed on to the next generation,

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.240
 so they might be deterred from mating.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.240
 Yeah.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.240
 Yeah.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.720
 So that's why they have these huge amounts of phony sperm.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.720
 They also...

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:51.400
 Maybe this is the same thing that they inject actually, it's something called methyl salicylate,

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.480
 which is also called oil of wintergreen, which I think is that substance, and it smells

00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:00.000
 really, really strong, and that's what tells the males, don't mate with this one, she's

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 already been mated with.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 And it's the same.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Anti-affordiziac.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 Yes.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Deodorant.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Exactly.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 They spray all the female often.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 It turns you off.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 Yeah, okay.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.600
 But it's in mouthwash, and in chewing gum.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.640
 And in various things that we use, that's why you never have butterflies trying to mate with

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.640
 your mouth.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.640
 Yeah.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.640
 And thank God.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.240
 So, can I just get my head round this whole animal?

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.760
 Don't know what they're doing thing.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.960
 So they don't know that they've put the filler in.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.760
 I don't know that we know what they know.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.760
 But, no, no.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:40.080
 They don't know that they've put the filler in, because otherwise they would then put

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.280
 the dipstick in to someone and be like, "Oh, I reckon that's all filler."

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:51.760
 No, because if they find that the female's tank is already full, they inject a more potent

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.760
 mixture to compete more with the other males, so they have different tactics depending

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.520
 on the mating situation, basically.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.560
 And why would you not just go for your most potent sperm?

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.800
 Because it takes a lot of resources.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.800
 Okay.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.800
 So it's easier to use the fake stuff.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.360
 I don't know what you mean, I don't understand why they haven't evolved to instinctively

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.400
 think when they go in and then they dip in and they realise that she's full up instinctively

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.400
 evolved to be like, "Well, I do that a lot, and it's not real."

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.400
 That's my trick.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.400
 I'm afraid actually.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.120
 Maybe the other guys have caught on.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.120
 So they don't know.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.000
 They don't know that they're all filler.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 Maybe some of them do.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.560
 Maybe they're not doing it as much as they were a few thousand years ago.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:37.760
 So the females, if they don't want the sperm, they will eat it, because they have

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:43.200
 a stomach next to their vaginas, which will eat the sperm.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.680
 So this is specifically to male cabbage whites.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:51.480
 And when your male comes in, he might do a blockage in the vagina to stop anyone else coming

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.480
 in.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.680
 But obviously that's not good for the female, because she wants as much genetic material

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.680
 as possible.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:01.960
 And so they found that she has something called a bursa copulatrix inside her reproductive

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.200
 tract, which is basically a second stomach, which means she can digest stuff that's

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.200
 in there.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.040
 So she can eat through her mouth and her vagina.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.440
 It's quite the party trick.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.280
 No, but there are jaws.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.960
 She's got jaws down there, because the stuff the male, the posits, is surrounded by an incredibly

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:27.520
 hard shell, which is designed to block up the entire thing so that other males can't

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.520
 make with her.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.440
 So she has evolved incredibly tough jaws to chew through this thing.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.280
 There's a film where jaws, yeah, with shells.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.280
 It's a few.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.280
 It's not the one I think he is.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.280
 It's a butterfly vagina.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.280
 It's a butterfly vagina.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.280
 It's a butterfly vagina.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.280
 Yes, yeah.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.280
 I think it's a B movie.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.280
 I don't think it was a Spielberg issue.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:57.120
 Obviously, when a B movie is opposed to a butterfly movie.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.720
 But yeah, it is good to eat, isn't it?

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.680
 So the semen can actually contain useful stuff.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.960
 And the men know that, and so they do this thing called puddling male butterflies, where

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.880
 they suck salts off the ground.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.880
 So the way butterflies drink is, they drink through a straw in their mouth.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.760
 There's long proboscis, which they encoyle.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.800
 And the males will go along the ground, sucking up lots of salts, lots of sodium.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.880
 And then this goes into their sperm.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:25.800
 And when the woman, the woman, when the female butterfly eats that, then that creates good

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.800
 offspring.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:32.360
 So what happens when it's winter, and there's loads of ice, and we put loads of salt on

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.360
 the roads, and the butterflies come down and eat loads of salt.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.360
 What happens then, Anna?

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.080
 You get super, super butterfly.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.080
 That's what you get.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.080
 Yeah.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.080
 Do you actually?

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.080
 You do.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.440
 You get males with extra muscles and females with bigger eyes and bigger brains.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.440
 Wow.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.440
 I didn't see many butterflies in gyms.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.440
 Gyms.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.440
 Gyms.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.960
 I thought they all, I didn't think you'd got many flying around in winter.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.960
 Yeah.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.720
 So you can get, let's say, you might salt the roads when it's not winter, or you might

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.040
 salt them in the higher places when it's cold or whatever.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:10.920
 But basically, they found out recently that if you salt the roads and the butterflies eat

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:16.200
 the stuff, then the next summer, they have extra muscles, bigger eyes, bigger brains.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.960
 And they asked the scientist who's involved.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:23.480
 So surely, that means that road salt is good for butterflies.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.840
 And she said, I do not want that to be the take-home message.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.840
 Why not?

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.840
 Why not?

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:34.440
 Yeah. Well, I think because, basically, you are changing nature in some way.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.200
 And generally speaking, we think that doing that is probably not a good idea.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.200
 Oh.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.720
 There's always something, isn't there?

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.720
 Oh, right.

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:45.440
 I would love to see muscular butterflies flying around with big arms.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.680
 Did you, I didn't read more on this because I didn't think it would be a good topic to

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.680
 talk about.

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:56.840
 But in Fukushima, there were mutant butterflies off the back of the radiation that were super

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.840
 strength.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.840
 Yeah.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.000
 Again, the take-home message is not that give a load of radiation to butterflies.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 Yeah.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 Just quickly, on this burst of copulatrix that we're talking about, James, so it's the chewing

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.880
 and digesting organ, it takes 36 hours of constant chewing by the female to get through

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.880
 it.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.880
 That's how tough the thing is.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.480
 That's a lot of chewing, even with your mouth.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.480
 Exactly.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.480
 Yeah.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.480
 Exactly.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:29.720
 When it's flunching, it's a whole new ball game.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.440
 Oh god.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:36.200
 But no, a team of scientists looked into how the super strength spermatophore and they

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.240
 could only break it down by boiling it in concentrated sulfuric acid.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.240
 No.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.240
 Wow.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.240
 That is how tough this thing that the male produces is.

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.240
 That's wild.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:48.200
 And the males, the spermatophore, the actual package that they give to the female, is

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.880
 up to 13% of the male's weight.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.880
 It's amazing, isn't it?

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:53.880
 It's all just a fight.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.080
 Basically, the males are just going to make it harder and harder and more difficult to

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:01.560
 break down and the females are just going to learn more tricks to break it down.

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.560
 Yeah.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.560
 Yeah.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.560
 Crazy.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.560
 It's amazing.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.560
 It's the battle of the sexes.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.560
 Mm-hmm.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.560
 We're all fighting it.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.560
 Yeah.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:13.600
 We were at James and I were talking to our group, Buddy Leven Skyro, who's been on

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.400
 the podcast a bunch of times, and he was saying there's a new report that just came

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:23.520
 out, which showed that the butterfly mouth and tongue predate flowers.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.940
 And so you kind of go, well, that's what were they eating beforehand if it wasn't that.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:32.520
 And the suggestion from this new study is dinosaur tears.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.520
 Yeah.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.520
 I mean, that's very cool.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.520
 Isn't that amazing?

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.520
 Yeah.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.320
 So they dip into the, so they've got this rhomboscis that we think is evolved to go

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.160
 into flowers, but actually it's evolved to dip into the dinosaur's eye sockets.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.160
 Yeah.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.160
 Yeah.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.160
 I guess these sockets themselves.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.160
 Yeah.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.160
 I didn't.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.160
 I'm just remembering.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.160
 No, you're right.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.160
 James and I literally saw him yesterday.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.160
 Yeah.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.680
 So even now, butterflies will eat the tears of animals.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.520
 I think we all probably knew that.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.600
 But yeah, the idea is that because they existed before flowers, they must have been eaten

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.520
 the tears before they even the flowers came along.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:08.200
 Well, you would think if you were trying to gain sustenance from drinking animals' tears,

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.800
 that you would be more subtle than a massive butterfly.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.800
 Yeah.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.800
 You know what I mean?

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.360
 It would be kind of a wings, if something like that landed on my eye, I would notice.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:20.040
 I suppose that you could say that I don't know what these animals are because I haven't seen

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:24.080
 the study, but I imagine that they didn't look exactly like butterflies, like with the

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.080
 bigger shape wings and stuff.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.800
 But do you think the butterflies had to evolve to make the dinosaurs cry?

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.800
 Like, develop.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.440
 They evolved to say, "Heartful comments."

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.440
 Yeah.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.440
 Yeah.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.640
 Otherwise, how do they do it or to punch them?

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:41.720
 Maybe that's why they had the superhuman butterflies then.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.720
 I don't like a butterfly.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.720
 Sting like a butterfly.

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:48.720
 Punch like a butterfly.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.800
 Okay, that is it.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.280
 That is all of our facts.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.640
