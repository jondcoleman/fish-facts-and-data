00:00:00,00:00:04,"She's not gonna be a huddle, won't work, is it?"
00:00:04,00:00:07,"She's not gonna be a huddle, won't work, is it?"
00:00:07,00:00:12,"She's not gonna be a huddle, won't work, is it?"
00:00:12,00:00:20,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:20,00:00:23,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Tribert, and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anitzzynski, and Andy"
00:00:28,00:00:32,"Murray, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:32,00:00:37,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:41,"Andrew Hunter Murray, I saw your face."
00:00:41,00:00:46,"Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact, my fact this week is that scientists"
00:00:46,00:00:53,"have finally worked out why the four of us, and all humans, are not constantly leaking."
00:00:53,00:00:56,"They started with the four of us, didn't they?"
00:00:56,00:00:57,We were the guinea pigs.
00:00:57,00:00:58,"Yeah, extrapolated."
00:00:58,00:00:59,"Yes, exactly."
00:00:59,00:01:03,"No, this is, we've just worked out, actually, I say just, actually, and also I think, and"
00:01:03,00:01:04,"you are leaking, are you?"
00:01:04,00:01:05,"Oh, sorry, yeah."
00:01:05,00:01:11,"We've already had these chairs upholstered once this week, I think, come on."
00:01:11,00:01:17,"This was discovered or published at least in November of 2016, and I didn't know this,"
00:01:17,00:01:22,"but scientists have been desperately trying to work out, desperately as a bit of a straight"
00:01:22,00:01:27,"figure, why we don't constantly leak, because we shed more than 500 million cells every"
00:01:27,00:01:28,24 hours.
00:01:28,00:01:33,"So basically in a two to four week period, our entire body of outer layer skin is completely"
00:01:33,00:01:34,replaced.
00:01:34,00:01:38,"In the process of that happening, we should just be suddenly, you know, a bit of arm skin"
00:01:38,00:01:44,goes and suddenly blood spurting out or sweat or we should be like just sprinkler systems
00:01:44,00:01:49,"nonstop, but we're not, and they don't know why, except for now they do."
00:01:49,00:01:51,And why is it then?
00:01:51,00:01:56,"It is so easy to explain, I'm not even going to bother."
00:01:56,00:01:57,Let me try.
00:01:57,00:02:02,"Okay, what it is is, we have effectively three layers of skin, which I think works a bit"
00:02:02,00:02:04,like a conveyor belt.
00:02:04,00:02:06,"You know how, like, sharp teeth get replaced, the further they go forward."
00:02:06,00:02:07,Yeah.
00:02:07,00:02:11,"So the top layer is just the dead skin almost, it's really flaky and it goes all over"
00:02:11,00:02:12,the shop.
00:02:12,00:02:16,"Then there's this middle one, which is a bit fluidy, and that's really nice."
00:02:16,00:02:21,"And then we have an original layer, which is sort of like the real meat of the"
00:02:21,00:02:22,cake.
00:02:22,00:02:23,Of the meat cake.
00:02:23,00:02:24,"Oh, yeah."
00:02:24,00:02:25,Excellent metaphors.
00:02:25,00:02:26,Yeah.
00:02:26,00:02:30,"I didn't realize it was this easy to explain, I have to say."
00:02:30,00:02:34,And so what happens is they all shift up one place and what they didn't know was how it
00:02:34,00:02:40,"was that no holes were being revealed when the flakes of skin were disappearing, what was"
00:02:40,00:02:44,plugging the gap and what they've discovered is what effectively is kind of like a pricked
00:02:44,00:02:45,glue.
00:02:45,00:02:48,"It's like a temporary glue, not as good as super glue, which eventually comes to the"
00:02:48,00:02:53,"second layer, but that original layer has a sort of pricked stick glue, which holds the"
00:02:53,00:02:55,gaps closed so it holds all the stuff in.
00:02:55,00:02:58,So it's like a meaty cake with pricked stick on it?
00:02:58,00:02:59,"Yeah, at the bottom layer."
00:02:59,00:03:02,And don't forget there are three layers of sharks teeth on the top layer.
00:03:02,00:03:03,Yeah.
00:03:03,00:03:05,I didn't realize that we were completely dead on the outside.
00:03:05,00:03:06,"No, we're not dead."
00:03:06,00:03:08,It's almost dead on the inside.
00:03:08,00:03:11,"No, there's the very outermost layer of skin cells that are dead, I think."
00:03:11,00:03:16,"Yeah, we're just we're we're wearing death."
00:03:16,00:03:20,"New wearing today, just death, that's the worst bits of me."
00:03:20,00:03:21,"That is weird, isn't it?"
00:03:21,00:03:22,Yeah.
00:03:22,00:03:23,The cells are there.
00:03:23,00:03:25,"They're full of keratin, which is also when you're, you know, you're thinking of your"
00:03:25,00:03:28,"hair and things, but none of the cell machinery is in that outermost layer."
00:03:28,00:03:29,"Yeah, that is bizarre."
00:03:29,00:03:30,That's the same thing.
00:03:30,00:03:35,So this study has found the structure of that second layer down.
00:03:35,00:03:40,"The second layer is called the stratum granuloseum, and that layer has got a special"
00:03:40,00:03:41,structure that they've just found out.
00:03:41,00:03:44,"And that's the reason that they've worked out that we're not leaking, right?"
00:03:44,00:03:49,This structure is an extremely efficient way to pack together shapes.
00:03:49,00:03:55,"And it was first discovered by Lord Kelvin, and it is tetradecahedrons, which means it's"
00:03:55,00:04:00,"objects with 14 faces, and our cells are made of these shapes, so they really pack together"
00:04:00,00:04:02,"nicely, which means nothing can get through."
00:04:02,00:04:03,Yeah.
00:04:03,00:04:07,"Well, though, I've been so confused by this and I know mine mine was way easier as an"
00:04:07,00:04:08,explanation.
00:04:08,00:04:09,What was that?
00:04:09,00:04:10,Tetradecahedrons.
00:04:10,00:04:15,"The thing is, tetradecahedrons, you would have thought, if that was good at plugging gaps,"
00:04:15,00:04:19,"then the ones with 16 faces are going to be even better, and shapes with 18 faces are going"
00:04:19,00:04:20,to be even better.
00:04:20,00:04:25,"It can't be that 14 faces is the maximum goodness of plugging gaps out, but then think about"
00:04:25,00:04:26,a cube.
00:04:26,00:04:31,"That fits together perfectly, but then an object with five faces isn't quite as good as"
00:04:31,00:04:32,"a cube, is it?"
00:04:32,00:04:33,I don't really know.
00:04:33,00:04:34,Okay.
00:04:34,00:04:36,But I'll take your word for it.
00:04:36,00:04:42,What are you saying that nature should have selected a better tetradecahedron?
00:04:42,00:04:47,I'm just saying it's interesting that this 14 face shape seemed to be the ideal shape for
00:04:47,00:04:48,our skin to be.
00:04:48,00:04:49,Right.
00:04:49,00:04:50,Okay.
00:04:50,00:04:51,Yeah.
00:04:51,00:04:52,It's the same shape as the new £1 coin.
00:04:52,00:04:53,I don't know.
00:04:53,00:04:54,Yeah.
00:04:54,00:04:57,"So in an extremist, could you plug a gap or a wound in your skin with a £1 coin?"
00:04:57,00:04:58,Yes.
00:04:58,00:04:59,But hang on.
00:04:59,00:05:00,"No, is it the same shape as that?"
00:05:00,00:05:01,I thought it's a 3D.
00:05:01,00:05:02,It would be if it was a 3D.
00:05:02,00:05:06,It's the same shape as that because the new £1 coin has 12 sides around the edge and then
00:05:06,00:05:08,it has two sides on the front of that.
00:05:08,00:05:09,"I mean, it's the same shape."
00:05:09,00:05:10,It's not exactly that.
00:05:10,00:05:11,It's got the same number of faces.
00:05:11,00:05:12,Yes.
00:05:12,00:05:13,Yeah.
00:05:13,00:05:17,"Because it's more like a Rubik's cube, but with more faces."
00:05:17,00:05:20,"It's more equilateral, I think, the one in the skin compared to the £1 coin."
00:05:20,00:05:25,"But basically, as you say, when I seriously wound you later, you can shove a £1 coin in there"
00:05:25,00:05:29,and see how much good it does.
00:05:29,00:05:33,"So, Lord Kelvin, back in the day, he was trying to work out what is the best way that foam"
00:05:33,00:05:35,can work.
00:05:35,00:05:38,"So if you have a load of bubbles, what's the absolute most efficient way that they can"
00:05:38,00:05:39,pack together?
00:05:39,00:05:40,Yeah.
00:05:40,00:05:43,And he came up with this particular shape and then it's only recently that we found out
00:05:43,00:05:44,it's in the human body.
00:05:44,00:05:45,That's amazing.
00:05:45,00:05:46,That's really cool.
00:05:46,00:05:50,Why was there a problem in the 19th century with foam being inefficiently packed?
00:05:50,00:05:52,"Well, no."
00:05:52,00:05:57,"So he was studying mathematics and there's a really interesting thing in maths, which is"
00:05:57,00:06:03,"if you get a load of bowls and put them together, how do they pack nicest?"
00:06:03,00:06:07,And the way it turns out is the same way as green grossers do it with oranges.
00:06:07,00:06:11,"So you put them all down, then you put spheres in all the gaps, and that's the most efficient"
00:06:11,00:06:12,way of packing it.
00:06:12,00:06:15,"And they've done it with four-dimensional, five-dimensional, six-dimensional."
00:06:15,00:06:19,It's a really interesting kind of mathematical thing that they do.
00:06:19,00:06:21,Have you guys heard of Matt Tech?
00:06:21,00:06:22,No.
00:06:22,00:06:26,It's a lab in America and its business is growing human skin.
00:06:26,00:06:27,"Oh, wow."
00:06:27,00:06:28,So there's an incredible feature about them in white.
00:06:28,00:06:30,I really recommend reading it.
00:06:30,00:06:37,"They grow two humans' worth of skin every week, but in thousands of little coin forms."
00:06:37,00:06:43,"And basically, it's so that you can test shampoos or cosmetics or anything you like detergent"
00:06:43,00:06:46,or lukelyner or suntan lotion on these little coins of skin.
00:06:46,00:06:47,Wow.
00:06:47,00:06:48,"Yeah, and they grow them."
00:06:48,00:06:50,So what they do is they get off cuts from hospitals.
00:06:50,00:06:55,"So if you've been circumcised in Boston, your skin may have been your foreskin, may have"
00:06:55,00:07:00,"been grown to two football pitches in size, and then cut up for experiments."
00:07:00,00:07:01,Wow.
00:07:01,00:07:06,So Shampoo will have the same effect on someone's foreskin as it will on someone's scalp.
00:07:06,00:07:07,Can we be sure of that?
00:07:07,00:07:08,No.
00:07:08,00:07:09,Okay.
00:07:09,00:07:10,We cannot.
00:07:10,00:07:11,But I think he can plant that.
00:07:11,00:07:12,I think he's got a thing that says on the bottle.
00:07:12,00:07:16,"No, it's been tested on foreskin, but they know what they're doing."
00:07:16,00:07:17,Yeah.
00:07:17,00:07:18,All the other operations as well.
00:07:18,00:07:19,Like a tummy-tuck or breast surgery.
00:07:19,00:07:20,They're various things like this.
00:07:20,00:07:21,Yeah.
00:07:21,00:07:22,Wow.
00:07:22,00:07:23,I know.
00:07:23,00:07:24,"And they grow it, and so imagine that."
00:07:24,00:07:29,"What I was also experimented on skin is a guy called Brown Secard, who I reckoned probably"
00:07:29,00:07:30,talked about before.
00:07:30,00:07:33,He was a scientist in the 19th century who was always experimenting on himself.
00:07:33,00:07:37,And he wanted to know why we needed skin and whether we'd be fine without it.
00:07:37,00:07:42,"And so to do, to find out whether we'd be right without our skin, he didn't do the disgusting"
00:07:42,00:07:43,thing you're imagining.
00:07:43,00:07:47,"He covered his skin completely from head to toe in fly paper varnish, which completely"
00:07:47,00:07:48,blocks it up.
00:07:48,00:07:52,So it was to find out if the skin's actually having a useful interaction with the outside
00:07:52,00:07:53,world.
00:07:53,00:07:55,"And almost dying, because it turns out we do need asking it."
00:07:55,00:07:56,Yeah.
00:07:56,00:07:57,That's like gold finger.
00:07:57,00:07:58,Yeah.
00:07:58,00:08:02,"The lady who, not the villain, it was the lady in the movie she was covering in gold."
00:08:02,00:08:03,And she died.
00:08:03,00:08:04,And there was a roof.
00:08:04,00:08:05,Did she though?
00:08:05,00:08:06,I think was that not a rumor?
00:08:06,00:08:07,"No, in the movie she died."
00:08:07,00:08:08,"Oh, in the movie she died."
00:08:08,00:08:09,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:09,00:08:10,I think it was.
00:08:10,00:08:11,I think it was.
00:08:11,00:08:12,I know.
00:08:12,00:08:14,I don't go to the movies and just listen to the rumors up to let's see.
00:08:14,00:08:18,"Actually, everybody dies in the movie, but like, did he really die?"
00:08:18,00:08:19,It was a rumor.
00:08:19,00:08:20,He did.
00:08:20,00:08:22,It would be a big a bit of film trivia if one of the bond movies had killed an actress
00:08:22,00:08:23,by painting her goals.
00:08:23,00:08:28,"No, but that was one of the great myths of it, is that in real life, she suffered from that"
00:08:28,00:08:29,and she died.
00:08:29,00:08:31,"I thought it was real myth that if that happened, you would die."
00:08:31,00:08:36,But I thought they had left something like a patch of skin on her back unpainted and she
00:08:36,00:08:38,breathed through the house.
00:08:38,00:08:40,That was a rumor.
00:08:40,00:08:43,But we don't know the absolute truth about this bond lady.
00:08:43,00:08:47,"I don't think, based on that conversation, except she definitely didn't die."
00:08:47,00:08:48,Right?
00:08:48,00:08:49,Don't know.
00:08:49,00:08:50,She's alive.
00:08:50,00:08:51,She's fine.
00:08:51,00:08:54,"So, I did that and he did nearly die and you can't, if you do that and his student burst"
00:08:54,00:08:58,in and found him completely unconscious in the corner of the room covered in varnish.
00:08:58,00:09:01,And so he got some sandpaper and started sandpaper in his farm.
00:09:01,00:09:05,"Yeah, he sanded him down and then when he regained consciousness, he shouts."
00:09:05,00:09:06,Must be a better way.
00:09:06,00:09:11,Did he then cover him in a layer of teacoil and slowly work that in with the grain?
00:09:11,00:09:12,"Yes, sir."
00:09:12,00:09:13,Is that a carpentry joke?
00:09:13,00:09:14,"Kind of, yeah."
00:09:14,00:09:15,Okay.
00:09:15,00:09:16,Jokes a bit much.
00:09:16,00:09:21,"But yeah, and he was really pissed off, Brownsacar, when he regained consciousness, he said"
00:09:21,00:09:22,he ruined the experiment.
00:09:22,00:09:24,We were going to find out if it could kill somebody.
00:09:24,00:09:25,That's amazing.
00:09:25,00:09:26,"And the student was like, no, it can."
00:09:26,00:09:31,"He's the same guy who, he ate a patient's vomit once to give himself cholera, so he could"
00:09:31,00:09:32,prove that lording them worked.
00:09:32,00:09:35,"And then he almost died from that as well, actually, and had to be revived."
00:09:35,00:09:38,Is it the same student who's just saving him?
00:09:38,00:09:47,"It comes into work each day, hey, oh, Jesus, he's covered in rats, what's going on?"
00:09:47,00:09:54,"We know house mites, so they live on our skin, and they eat skin, and do you know what they"
00:09:54,00:09:55,also eat?
00:09:55,00:09:56,They also eat their own skin.
00:09:56,00:09:57,Do they?
00:09:57,00:09:58,Yeah.
00:09:58,00:10:00,"So house mites are as much of a problem for themselves as they are for us, basically."
00:10:00,00:10:02,Do you dung beetles eat their own dung?
00:10:02,00:10:03,Don't know.
00:10:03,00:10:04,"You would, wouldn't you?"
00:10:04,00:10:05,You would.
00:10:05,00:10:09,"If you were into dung, it's the most readily accessible dung you can get, isn't it?"
00:10:09,00:10:10,Yeah.
00:10:10,00:10:12,"But the thing about house mites is that they have skin, and then when it flakes off, they"
00:10:12,00:10:17,"eat it, and they also excrete it and they eat it several times to get all the nutrition out"
00:10:17,00:10:18,of it.
00:10:18,00:10:19,Clever?
00:10:19,00:10:20,Yes.
00:10:20,00:10:21,I know.
00:10:21,00:10:27,"I read the fact that I found prettier astonishing today, which is that we have a microbiome,"
00:10:27,00:10:28,so we're covered.
00:10:28,00:10:32,"Obviously, every, apparently, centimeter of our skin is covered in thousands of different"
00:10:32,00:10:34,species of bacteria.
00:10:34,00:10:41,So we are literally housing a planet in the same way that our planet is housing life.
00:10:41,00:10:44,"We're doing the exact same thing, just on our own body with bacteria."
00:10:44,00:10:49,"And the article said that if you were to, if there was a scientist who decided to grind"
00:10:49,00:10:57,"up a single person and sequence all the DNA for that guy to grind up himself, but he's got"
00:10:57,00:10:59,one foot in the grinder.
00:10:59,00:11:00,It makes sense.
00:11:00,00:11:01,"He comes in, boss."
00:11:01,00:11:02,No.
00:11:02,00:11:04,"So, yeah."
00:11:04,00:11:10,"So the article was saying, if a sadistic scientist like him did decide to do that, grind up"
00:11:10,00:11:15,"and sequence all of that DNA that was on our entire body, either in our body or on top of"
00:11:15,00:11:22,"our body, only 2% of the genetic material that he would find would be us, the human in the"
00:11:22,00:11:23,rest of it.
00:11:23,00:11:24,The rest of it is all the bacteria.
00:11:24,00:11:25,The rest of it is all the animals.
00:11:25,00:11:26,Yeah.
00:11:26,00:11:27,98%.
00:11:27,00:11:29,We're carrying 98% something else other than us.
00:11:29,00:11:30,Filthy.
00:11:30,00:11:31,That's not yet.
00:11:31,00:11:32,That's very cool.
00:11:32,00:11:33,We need a shower.
00:11:33,00:11:34,That's disgusting.
00:11:34,00:11:35,Yeah.
00:11:35,00:11:36,Okay.
00:11:36,00:11:37,It is time for fact number two.
00:11:37,00:11:38,And that is James.
00:11:38,00:11:39,Okay.
00:11:39,00:11:45,My fact this week is that the iconic green code at the start of the Matrix movie is made from
00:11:45,00:11:47,sushi recipes.
00:11:47,00:11:50,So cool.
00:11:50,00:11:51,So this is a fact.
00:11:51,00:11:54,"He's been on the internet a little bit over the last few weeks, but I really like it."
00:11:54,00:11:58,And it was an interview with CNET by production designer Simon Whitley.
00:11:58,00:12:02,"And he said that these little things that are going up and down are made of reverse letters,"
00:12:02,00:12:06,"numbers and Japanese katakana characters, which are from sushi recipes."
00:12:06,00:12:07,Yeah.
00:12:07,00:12:10,"It's his wife's sushi recipe book, wasn't it?"
00:12:10,00:12:14,"He scanned it in and took all of the, yeah, the writing."
00:12:14,00:12:15,So cool.
00:12:15,00:12:18,"So do you think there's anyone who just watches the Matrix when they need to cook a jacket,"
00:12:18,00:12:21,Japanese meal for their friends?
00:12:21,00:12:23,Where is that DVD?
00:12:23,00:12:25,I also think I've only eaten sushi.
00:12:25,00:12:26,I've never made it.
00:12:26,00:12:28,There can't be much in the way of recipes.
00:12:28,00:12:29,Yeah.
00:12:29,00:12:30,No.
00:12:30,00:12:31,Take some fish.
00:12:31,00:12:32,Take some rice.
00:12:32,00:12:33,Wrap it up.
00:12:33,00:12:34,Into it.
00:12:34,00:12:36,"Into the Matrix, we all live in the Matrix."
00:12:36,00:12:37,"Oh, yeah."
00:12:37,00:12:38,"It's an exciting theory, isn't it?"
00:12:38,00:12:39,Yeah.
00:12:39,00:12:43,"Actually, a relatively mainstream theory these days that we might live in the Matrix."
00:12:43,00:12:44,It is.
00:12:44,00:12:50,But like I was reading a lot of articles about it off the back of you putting this fact forward.
00:12:50,00:12:54,And there's a lot of conferences with big scientists talking about it.
00:12:54,00:13:00,"And even I, who love this kind of thing, was a bit like, ""Guys, this is bullshit."
00:13:00,00:13:01,"You're wasting your time."""
00:13:01,00:13:04,But then I have a physics degree and I actually believe it.
00:13:04,00:13:05,Do you?
00:13:05,00:13:06,Do you know what the problem is?
00:13:06,00:13:07,This is what I noticed.
00:13:07,00:13:08,You had these big scientists.
00:13:08,00:13:12,Neil DeGrasse Tyson was the host of this big conference and a lot of scientists talking
00:13:12,00:13:13,about it.
00:13:13,00:13:18,And I realize the difference is that stoners say this stuff all the time.
00:13:18,00:13:19,No one takes it seriously.
00:13:19,00:13:23,"But if you're able to like say an equation at the end of your sentence, suddenly the world"
00:13:23,00:13:25,is really interested.
00:13:25,00:13:26,And that's what that was.
00:13:26,00:13:28,That was a stoner conference with maths.
00:13:28,00:13:33,"Maybe every time you say something stupid, if you just say, ""Why equals X squared?"""
00:13:33,00:13:34,Exactly.
00:13:34,00:13:37,Do you just only like conspiracy theories before they get mainstream?
00:13:37,00:13:41,I think you're kind of a hipster for nonsense.
00:13:41,00:13:42,Yeah.
00:13:42,00:13:45,The JFK assassination is so hack.
00:13:45,00:13:49,So one of the most basic ways of looking at this is we think it's probably possible for
00:13:49,00:13:54,us to make a simulation of the universe at some stage in the future it will be.
00:13:54,00:13:56,"And when that happens, it will be done."
00:13:56,00:13:58,And it will be done more than once.
00:13:58,00:14:01,And we wouldn't know if we're in here or if we're in the simulation.
00:14:01,00:14:04,And so likelihood is there's one reality and loads of simulations.
00:14:04,00:14:08,So statistically we're more likely to be in one of the simulations.
00:14:08,00:14:12,Although I have a problem with that slightly because I'm not quite sure how we know there's
00:14:12,00:14:13,any one reality.
00:14:13,00:14:16,And then there's like a kind of multiverse theory and a parallel universe theory.
00:14:16,00:14:17,Yeah.
00:14:17,00:14:20,So there could just be infinite numbers of simulations and realities.
00:14:20,00:14:21,That's true.
00:14:21,00:14:22,That's true.
00:14:22,00:14:25,Although it could be that each of the realities has a load of simulations.
00:14:25,00:14:26,Oh god.
00:14:26,00:14:27,Of course.
00:14:27,00:14:28,And you can have different levels of infinity.
00:14:28,00:14:30,You can have higher infinities and lower infinities.
00:14:30,00:14:36,"So I'm plugging the joint, handed over, man, give me a hit of that."
00:14:36,00:14:41,"Elon Musk, I think, says, and I know he's got, he's a bit wacky."
00:14:41,00:14:46,But he does say that that he thinks there's billions to one chance that we're not living
00:14:46,00:14:47,in a simulation.
00:14:47,00:14:48,"Yeah, I would."
00:14:48,00:14:49,So.
00:14:49,00:14:50,But you say that.
00:14:50,00:14:52,I don't know if people really believe it.
00:14:52,00:14:54,You know intellectually it's probably true.
00:14:54,00:14:56,But do you really think we're in someone's video game?
00:14:56,00:14:58,I think it's more likely than not.
00:14:58,00:15:01,But then I also think that it doesn't make any difference.
00:15:01,00:15:05,"Why was about to ask, what can I do?"
00:15:05,00:15:06,We're in a simulation.
00:15:06,00:15:08,What am I to do about it?
00:15:08,00:15:13,"You can hire, in Silicon Valley, to tech billionaires who have remained anonymous, have hired"
00:15:13,00:15:16,a bunch of scientists to try and work on breaking out of the simulation.
00:15:16,00:15:17,"It must be Musk, right?"
00:15:17,00:15:19,It must be him who's one of them.
00:15:19,00:15:20,They've remained anonymous.
00:15:20,00:15:22,I don't want to spread rumors about it.
00:15:22,00:15:25,I have people being given money to try and break us out of the simulation that we're
00:15:25,00:15:26,in.
00:15:26,00:15:29,"That was two sentences, I think, in a New Yorker's article, right?"
00:15:29,00:15:33,And no one has followed up on who these people are.
00:15:33,00:15:34,But it sounds like it's true.
00:15:34,00:15:35,"It's a good job, though, isn't it?"
00:15:35,00:15:36,What a job.
00:15:36,00:15:37,Yeah.
00:15:37,00:15:38,The scientist is just sorry.
00:15:38,00:15:39,"Yeah, still nothing."
00:15:39,00:15:40,So we'll need another grant.
00:15:40,00:15:41,I'm afraid.
00:15:41,00:15:44,"Yeah, we haven't been in the boss on level three yet, so do you think they would just play"
00:15:44,00:15:47,the Sims and try and work out how to get the Sims out of their simulation?
00:15:47,00:15:48,That's such a good idea.
00:15:48,00:15:49,Yeah.
00:15:49,00:15:52,Can you make the Sims play Sims when you're playing the Sims?
00:15:52,00:15:53,Ah.
00:15:53,00:15:54,"Don't know, mate."
00:15:54,00:15:55,"Because if you can do that, I'm with you and your theory."
00:15:55,00:15:59,"The only Alex Bell, who almost came on this podcast today, would know the answer to that"
00:15:59,00:16:01,because he's a Sims fanatic and he's not here.
00:16:01,00:16:02,Yeah.
00:16:02,00:16:03,"Oh, well."
00:16:03,00:16:07,There was an engineer from MIT who works out how much computer memory it would take up
00:16:07,00:16:09,to simulate the universe as it is now.
00:16:09,00:16:11,So the universe is massively complicated.
00:16:11,00:16:16,And he looked into the size of the computer that would be needed to get in all this information.
00:16:16,00:16:20,And he worked out that the computer itself that is running our simulation would have to
00:16:20,00:16:22,be bigger than the universe.
00:16:22,00:16:23,So that's impossible.
00:16:23,00:16:24,But then--
00:16:24,00:16:26,Using windows or--
00:16:26,00:16:27,Yeah.
00:16:27,00:16:29,Looks like you're trying to build a universe.
00:16:29,00:16:33,Then he upgraded his system and it turns out it's fine.
00:16:33,00:16:36,"Because you would just put on that little star screen saver with the stars, wouldn't you?"
00:16:36,00:16:37,Yeah.
00:16:37,00:16:39,That's basically good enough for a first step.
00:16:39,00:16:42,"See, I think a lot of people think that's not good enough and that there's more to the"
00:16:42,00:16:43,universe.
00:16:43,00:16:45,"No, maybe we're not even the computer game."
00:16:45,00:16:47,Maybe we're the screen saver.
00:16:47,00:16:50,How embarrassing.
00:16:50,00:16:55,The point is we don't require much computer memory because it's not like there's an entire
00:16:55,00:16:56,universe that's been simulated.
00:16:56,00:17:00,They've only simulated the bits that we're clever enough to spot.
00:17:00,00:17:04,So we're too stupid to see all the massive gaps in this computer system.
00:17:04,00:17:08,"So it's like every time we study the movement of stars or something, then in this computer simulation"
00:17:08,00:17:10,"they go, OK, the humans are looking at it now."
00:17:10,00:17:12,We better provide some information for them here.
00:17:12,00:17:14,"But the rest of the time, they don't have that information there."
00:17:14,00:17:16,And that saves on computer memory.
00:17:16,00:17:19,And that's why there is a computer that's the right size to run this simulation that
00:17:19,00:17:20,we're all in.
00:17:20,00:17:24,"And that's why in quantum physics, things only change when you actually observe them."
00:17:24,00:17:25,Yes.
00:17:25,00:17:27,Because we're all in a computer.
00:17:27,00:17:28,That's the thing.
00:17:28,00:17:33,"Like, you don't see the, you know, I haven't played Sims, but presumably there are people"
00:17:33,00:17:34,in it.
00:17:34,00:17:35,Are there people in it?
00:17:35,00:17:36,"Yeah, you build a family and they have jobs and lives."
00:17:36,00:17:39,"So you don't see the family suddenly sitting around dinner going, do you think we're in"
00:17:39,00:17:40,a simulation?
00:17:40,00:17:41,Of course.
00:17:41,00:17:44,"Because if we are, the simulation has started to question itself."
00:17:44,00:17:49,There is a philosophy expansion pack of the Sims where they do do that.
00:17:49,00:17:52,So it's really good.
00:17:52,00:17:56,So one way you might be able to tell if you're in the matrix is if there's a glitch in the
00:17:56,00:17:58,"matrix, this is a thing, isn't it?"
00:17:58,00:17:59,It's like a little meme.
00:17:59,00:18:03,"If you're going to read it, you can go on to reddit.com/glitch in the matrix."
00:18:03,00:18:04,"Oh, cool."
00:18:04,00:18:07,And you can see examples of when people have spotted it.
00:18:07,00:18:08,Spotted it.
00:18:08,00:18:09,Right.
00:18:09,00:18:13,"So some of them, I only read the headlines because they read a few of the actual explanations"
00:18:13,00:18:15,they were a bit boring.
00:18:15,00:18:21,"But someone said, three eggs have disappeared in my fridge."
00:18:21,00:18:24,"Glitch in the matrix, guys."
00:18:24,00:18:28,Where is my sandwich glitch in the matrix?
00:18:28,00:18:33,I think I heard perfect by Ed Sheeran in 2008 or 2009.
00:18:33,00:18:34,Wow.
00:18:34,00:18:35,"Come on, guys."
00:18:35,00:18:37,"If that isn't evidence, I don't know what it is."
00:18:37,00:18:38,It's irrefutable.
00:18:38,00:18:44,"There's a famous one as well, which I was told about by our buddy Joel, who is one of"
00:18:44,00:18:46,the writers of those ladybird books.
00:18:46,00:18:49,And he's very much convinced that this is the glitch.
00:18:49,00:18:53,"And it's that there used to be a series of kids books, which I used to read as a kid called"
00:18:53,00:18:54,the baronstein.
00:18:54,00:18:55,What's that?
00:18:55,00:18:57,We've never heard that before.
00:18:57,00:19:01,"Oh, we got a bit close to reality, guys."
00:19:01,00:19:02,Which alert?
00:19:02,00:19:03,Which alert?
00:19:03,00:19:06,They're coming for us.
00:19:06,00:19:09,"We're getting a man in black, I'm in there."
00:19:09,00:19:16,"Yeah, so the baronstein bears, it was a series of kid books, and the glitch is that everyone"
00:19:16,00:19:20,"seems to remember that they're called the baronstein bears, but in fact, they're called"
00:19:20,00:19:22,the baronstein bears.
00:19:22,00:19:24,The authors were baronstein.
00:19:24,00:19:28,"And genuinely, there's a whole thing on the internet of people talking about, ""I swear"
00:19:28,00:19:30,"to God, I grew up on these books."
00:19:30,00:19:34,"My whole childhood, it had an e, not an a, instein, not stay."""
00:19:34,00:19:35,Really?
00:19:35,00:19:39,"And the glitches, the books have suddenly just all changed themselves to a different"
00:19:39,00:19:40,name.
00:19:40,00:19:44,"That's like Walker's crisps, everyone thinks they remember Walker's cheese non-ion crisps"
00:19:44,00:19:48,being the blue flavor or whatever flavor they're not.
00:19:48,00:19:49,The green flavor.
00:19:49,00:19:50,They are the blue flavor.
00:19:50,00:19:52,"Yeah, they are the blue flavor, and everyone thinks that they used to be the green flavor,"
00:19:52,00:19:53,and they never were.
00:19:53,00:19:54,But that sounds like it's another glitch.
00:19:54,00:19:55,Yeah.
00:19:55,00:19:58,"And it's like, what happens to my sandwich, guys?"
00:19:58,00:20:02,So many glitches.
00:20:02,00:20:06,"In the Matrix, the creators of it were quite keen that everyone who was involved got"
00:20:06,00:20:08,"to grips with a philosophy, weren't they?"
00:20:08,00:20:13,"So it was the Wachowski brothers who are, in fact, both the Wachowski sisters now."
00:20:13,00:20:17,"So it was the Wachowski brothers who wrote the screenplay for and directed the Matrix,"
00:20:17,00:20:23,"and they are both transgender, and they are both now Lana and Lily Wachowski."
00:20:23,00:20:28,"But they, you know, cited as their influences for the Matrix, like Homer and Hitchcock and"
00:20:28,00:20:32,Dostoevsky in this whole array of kind of different sources.
00:20:32,00:20:34,"So I knew I was always going, ""Don't!"""
00:20:34,00:20:45,"You think it's the first part of the word ""Dostoevsky""?"
00:20:45,00:20:46,Wow!
00:20:46,00:20:51,"We're really on different planes aren't we, Dostoevsky?"
00:20:51,00:20:55,"Anyway, during the filming of it, everyone who worked in it, all the actors were made to"
00:20:55,00:20:56,read three books.
00:20:56,00:20:58,They were made to read three books of philosophy.
00:20:58,00:21:04,"So Simulacra and Simulation by Jean-Baudrillard, who's like a sociologist and philosopher, and"
00:21:04,00:21:08,"then they were made to read out of control by a next editor of Wired, and they were made"
00:21:08,00:21:10,to read introducing evolutionary psychology.
00:21:10,00:21:14,So they had to really come to terms with the philosophy that they were exploring.
00:21:14,00:21:15,"Yeah, that's interesting."
00:21:15,00:21:21,That's sort of coming very handy during the massive gun fight seen in the lobby.
00:21:21,00:21:25,"So the Warner Brothers, they didn't trust the Wachowski brothers at first, because the"
00:21:25,00:21:28,"Wachowski brothers had very little experience making films, and this was a very big idea."
00:21:28,00:21:31,So they told them they had to go away and direct another film first.
00:21:31,00:21:32,Okay.
00:21:32,00:21:35,"And just a go away and make a different film, and if that one's a success, we'll let you"
00:21:35,00:21:36,make the Matrix.
00:21:36,00:21:37,And what would see the other one?
00:21:37,00:21:40,"They went and made a film called ""Bound"", which is described by the New Yorker as a lesbian"
00:21:40,00:21:44,"thriller with a happy ending, which doesn't sound very close to the Matrix."
00:21:44,00:21:47,It doesn't seem like a perfect proof of concept.
00:21:47,00:21:50,"No, you mean they've set them sort of a bad job interview there?"
00:21:50,00:21:53,"Yeah, but it was a success, and then they said, all right, you can go away and make the"
00:21:53,00:21:54,Matrix.
00:21:54,00:21:59,"And did they do a sort of classic happy ending, or did they misinterpret it as a massage"
00:21:59,00:22:00,happy ending?
00:22:00,00:22:05,"Well, it was a scene bound, just curious, if I saw the make a movie with a happy ending."
00:22:05,00:22:06,You would do that.
00:22:06,00:22:07,Would you though?
00:22:07,00:22:12,"So it doesn't fit in with the plot, but they told me to do it."
00:22:12,00:22:17,"Every Disney fan would end in a masturbation scene, I've done this there."
00:22:17,00:22:18,"Well, we saved the day."
00:22:18,00:22:23,Just got to have a quick massage.
00:22:23,00:22:26,"It's very worth it you're happy ending, and that's the first thing you assume."
00:22:26,00:22:29,The Matrix would not have been made if you were the Wachowski brothers.
00:22:29,00:22:40,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chisinski."
00:22:40,00:22:45,My fact this week is that the longest ever kayak trip was completed by a man who couldn't
00:22:45,00:22:46,swim.
00:22:46,00:22:50,This was a really good article in Fantasy Fair over some time in the last couple of weeks.
00:22:50,00:22:53,"It's about a guy called Oscar Speck, who was just this amazing guy."
00:22:53,00:22:57,"He was German, and in 1932, he climbed into a kayak."
00:22:57,00:23:02,"His business wasn't going very well, like Germany was in the doldrums then, because of the"
00:23:02,00:23:06,"depression and because of the Versailles Treaty, combination of the two."
00:23:06,00:23:11,"He got in a kayak thought, sod this, got onto the Danube, and he kayaked for 30,000 miles"
00:23:11,00:23:16,"all the way to Australia, where he arrived in 1939, and when he arrived."
00:23:16,00:23:20,"And when he arrived, he was immediately put in prison because the World War II had started."
00:23:20,00:23:24,"He was German, but he enjoyed it so much that he decided he was going to go to Australia."
00:23:24,00:23:25,That was never the plan.
00:23:25,00:23:31,"So he would kayak during the day, and then he would dine in the evenings with ambassadors"
00:23:31,00:23:34,and the rich of every place that he was staying.
00:23:34,00:23:39,"In fact, he even, and this is maybe potentially why he was arrested when he got to Australia."
00:23:39,00:23:44,"He was German, obviously, but at one point, he met up with a Nazi officer who gave him money"
00:23:44,00:23:49,"funding the next leg of his kayak trip, and he had a Nazi flag on the front of the kayak"
00:23:49,00:23:50,as he was going.
00:23:50,00:23:56,They probably thought they were being invaded by the smallest ever German bosses.
00:23:56,00:23:59,You wait till the other guys get here.
00:23:59,00:24:02,"Yeah, he didn't think he was going to go to Australia, didn't he?"
00:24:02,00:24:06,He had a vague goal of reaching Cyprus to work in the copper mines.
00:24:06,00:24:08,"Yeah, that was his big dream, wasn't it?"
00:24:08,00:24:10,He wanted to work in a mine.
00:24:10,00:24:11,That was his...
00:24:11,00:24:12,And he realized it.
00:24:12,00:24:13,Yeah.
00:24:13,00:24:18,"So he ended up, by kind of coincidence, I guess, a kind of north of Sydney in a big,"
00:24:18,00:24:23,"opal mining area, and he really did make his living from then on with opal mining."
00:24:23,00:24:26,"So he had this fantasy about mining, and he was always sending random bits of rock home"
00:24:26,00:24:29,"to his family, and saying, ""I think this is really precious and they just go, it's a lump"
00:24:29,00:24:30,"of rock, mate."
00:24:30,00:24:31,"Keep kayaking."""
00:24:31,00:24:36,"But he really did make his fortune in opal mining, and he never went back home."
00:24:36,00:24:40,"I don't think, ""Oh, he didn't go back home until 1970, never sort of parents again,"
00:24:40,00:24:42,"spent the rest of his days out in Australia."""
00:24:42,00:24:46,"Well, seven of them were spent in prison of war."
00:24:46,00:24:51,"He was, we should add, he stayed in Australia post-war, but for the entirety of World War"
00:24:51,00:24:54,"II, he was in jail."
00:24:54,00:24:57,"So he was, he arrived, was arrested, and spent World War II."
00:24:57,00:24:58,Although he did escape twice.
00:24:58,00:25:03,Did he get recaptured because he insisted on going with his kayak?
00:25:03,00:25:08,"Just look for any waterways suitable for a kayak, could be on one of those."
00:25:08,00:25:10,He got arrested in India.
00:25:10,00:25:18,"On the theory, they believed that his kayak was also a submarine."
00:25:18,00:25:20,"And they thought they thought it was a spy, right?"
00:25:20,00:25:24,They thought he was a spy and that he was kind of scouting for the Nazis.
00:25:24,00:25:32,"I've been canoeing or kayaking, and for a lot of the time, my kayak was a submarine."
00:25:32,00:25:37,"I had the problem where I went, I think it was kayaking with my wife, both of us in the"
00:25:37,00:25:42,"same kayak, but I sat the back and she sat at the front, and I'm a lot heavier than she"
00:25:42,00:25:43,is.
00:25:43,00:25:49,"And so she was paddling in midair, and I was just sinking."
00:25:49,00:25:52,So the one thing that I didn't read in all of this stuff about him is that he couldn't
00:25:52,00:25:53,swim.
00:25:53,00:25:55,Did that change at all when he was...
00:25:55,00:25:56,"No, he never learned to swim."
00:25:56,00:25:57,He never learned to swim.
00:25:57,00:25:58,"No, I mean."
00:25:58,00:26:03,"Because there's huge stretches of just ocean, like dangerous, high wave ocean."
00:26:03,00:26:04,"Well, there wasn't."
00:26:04,00:26:06,"I mean, there were stretches where he'd go for like 15 miles or whatever."
00:26:06,00:26:10,"But actually, if you look at the route, he did hug the coast as much as he could, as you"
00:26:10,00:26:11,would.
00:26:11,00:26:13,"Also, he didn't really reach Australia."
00:26:13,00:26:19,He reached an island that the Australians had colonized and it wasn't mainland Australia.
00:26:19,00:26:20,But it still was.
00:26:20,00:26:21,But it still was Australia.
00:26:21,00:26:25,I would argue that you would have quite a journey to then get actually to the coast of
00:26:25,00:26:26,Oz.
00:26:26,00:26:29,He'd been all the way around Papua New Guinea and fell by that point and dropped down.
00:26:29,00:26:30,Yeah.
00:26:30,00:26:32,"He landed in Syby, which was Australia."
00:26:32,00:26:33,I'm impressed.
00:26:33,00:26:34,Like it's...
00:26:34,00:26:35,Yeah.
00:26:35,00:26:36,"You'd do it, Dan."
00:26:36,00:26:37,I'm just saying.
00:26:37,00:26:42,But it's interesting that the non- not being able to swim thing is extraordinary because as
00:26:42,00:26:46,"soon as you're even this far away in a pool from a ledge and you can't swim, that becomes"
00:26:46,00:26:47,dangerous.
00:26:47,00:26:48,Yeah.
00:26:48,00:26:50,A kilometer is dangerous if you can't swim.
00:26:50,00:26:51,"Yeah, it is mad."
00:26:51,00:26:52,Yeah.
00:26:52,00:26:53,He was probably a bit mad.
00:26:53,00:26:54,I'm big in the mouth here.
00:26:54,00:26:55,Yeah.
00:26:55,00:26:56,Yeah.
00:26:56,00:27:00,"So, Britain sells kayaks to the Inuits now."
00:27:00,00:27:01,Really?
00:27:01,00:27:06,"Yes, because a school trip went there a few years ago with a few kayaks and then by the"
00:27:06,00:27:07,end they didn't need the kayaks anymore.
00:27:07,00:27:08,They were going home.
00:27:08,00:27:11,"And so they said to those guys, ""Do you want these?"""
00:27:11,00:27:14,"And they were like, ""Oh yeah, we ran out a few decades ago."
00:27:14,00:27:15,"We'll take some back."""
00:27:15,00:27:17,And then the company that makes them now send a few over every year.
00:27:17,00:27:18,That's very cool.
00:27:18,00:27:19,That's very nice.
00:27:19,00:27:21,"Pope John Paul, the second loved kayaking."
00:27:21,00:27:22,To do.
00:27:22,00:27:23,Yeah.
00:27:23,00:27:24,He was in a race and he was winning it.
00:27:24,00:27:28,"And just before the finish line, he got a hole in his boat and he sunk just a holy"
00:27:28,00:27:29,boat.
00:27:29,00:27:31,That's so good.
00:27:31,00:27:40,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy."
00:27:40,00:27:45,My fact is that male butterflies use fake sperm to trick each other into thinking they're
00:27:45,00:27:46,extra fertile.
00:27:46,00:27:50,I'm glad we were going to have the ending to this podcast.
00:27:50,00:27:55,90% of butterflies sperm is fake.
00:27:55,00:27:56,What?
00:27:56,00:27:57,"So, what is it?"
00:27:57,00:27:59,Plaster of Paris.
00:27:59,00:28:04,It's...it's just filler.
00:28:04,00:28:05,Poly filler.
00:28:05,00:28:09,It's not poly...it's completely bogus sperm.
00:28:09,00:28:12,It's sperm lookalikes which have no nucleus.
00:28:12,00:28:17,They carry no proper genetic information that can be passed on in a mating sense.
00:28:17,00:28:18,90%.
00:28:18,00:28:19,Wow.
00:28:19,00:28:20,So a sperm without a nucleus.
00:28:20,00:28:21,Yeah.
00:28:21,00:28:22,So it's just a dummy.
00:28:22,00:28:23,It's a dummy.
00:28:23,00:28:25,Do they know that?
00:28:25,00:28:46,"They don't know what they're doing yet, because when they're mating, right?"
00:28:46,00:28:50,"Male butterflies, this is a bit gross, but they use their penis to measure inside the females"
00:28:50,00:28:54,"how fault she is, are you whether she's mated before?"
00:28:54,00:28:59,"And it's like using the dipstick in a car's oil tank, is the closest analogy, yeah?"
00:28:59,00:29:00,Okay.
00:29:00,00:29:01,"Yeah, they then decide how..."
00:29:01,00:29:02,"So sorry, do they pull it out and see where the line is?"
00:29:02,00:29:04,"I don't know what they do, but they..."
00:29:04,00:29:05,Okay.
00:29:05,00:29:08,"I don't know exactly how they do it, but they then decide how much sperm to deposit based"
00:29:08,00:29:13,"on the female's mating history, and it's much cheaper for them to produce non-fertile"
00:29:13,00:29:14,"sperm, right?"
00:29:14,00:29:18,"It's cheaper in form, as far as energy is concerned, it takes a lot less results."
00:29:18,00:29:19,Not money.
00:29:19,00:29:20,Yeah.
00:29:20,00:29:25,"If the female is nearly empty, then the male will inject lots of fertile sperm, but then loads"
00:29:25,00:29:28,"and loads of fake stuff, which is designed to put off future males who might mate with the"
00:29:28,00:29:29,female.
00:29:29,00:29:30,Because then they do the dipstick thing.
00:29:30,00:29:33,"They come along and they'll say, oh, then there's females mate with those of males, and"
00:29:33,00:29:38,"there's a less of a chance that my genetic material will get passed on to the next generation,"
00:29:38,00:29:40,so they might be deterred from mating.
00:29:40,00:29:41,Yeah.
00:29:41,00:29:42,Yeah.
00:29:42,00:29:45,So that's why they have these huge amounts of phony sperm.
00:29:45,00:29:46,They also...
00:29:46,00:29:51,"Maybe this is the same thing that they inject actually, it's something called methyl salicylate,"
00:29:51,00:29:55,"which is also called oil of wintergreen, which I think is that substance, and it smells"
00:29:55,00:30:00,"really, really strong, and that's what tells the males, don't mate with this one, she's"
00:30:00,00:30:01,already been mated with.
00:30:01,00:30:02,And it's the same.
00:30:02,00:30:03,Anti-affordiziac.
00:30:03,00:30:04,Yes.
00:30:04,00:30:05,Deodorant.
00:30:05,00:30:06,Exactly.
00:30:06,00:30:07,They spray all the female often.
00:30:07,00:30:08,It turns you off.
00:30:08,00:30:09,"Yeah, okay."
00:30:09,00:30:13,"But it's in mouthwash, and in chewing gum."
00:30:13,00:30:17,"And in various things that we use, that's why you never have butterflies trying to mate with"
00:30:17,00:30:18,your mouth.
00:30:18,00:30:19,Yeah.
00:30:19,00:30:20,And thank God.
00:30:20,00:30:24,"So, can I just get my head round this whole animal?"
00:30:24,00:30:28,Don't know what they're doing thing.
00:30:28,00:30:31,So they don't know that they've put the filler in.
00:30:31,00:30:33,I don't know that we know what they know.
00:30:33,00:30:34,"But, no, no."
00:30:34,00:30:40,"They don't know that they've put the filler in, because otherwise they would then put"
00:30:40,00:30:45,"the dipstick in to someone and be like, ""Oh, I reckon that's all filler."""
00:30:45,00:30:51,"No, because if they find that the female's tank is already full, they inject a more potent"
00:30:51,00:30:55,"mixture to compete more with the other males, so they have different tactics depending"
00:30:55,00:30:58,"on the mating situation, basically."
00:30:58,00:31:01,And why would you not just go for your most potent sperm?
00:31:01,00:31:03,Because it takes a lot of resources.
00:31:03,00:31:04,Okay.
00:31:04,00:31:07,So it's easier to use the fake stuff.
00:31:07,00:31:12,"I don't know what you mean, I don't understand why they haven't evolved to instinctively"
00:31:12,00:31:17,think when they go in and then they dip in and they realise that she's full up instinctively
00:31:17,00:31:21,"evolved to be like, ""Well, I do that a lot, and it's not real."""
00:31:21,00:31:22,That's my trick.
00:31:22,00:31:23,I'm afraid actually.
00:31:23,00:31:25,Maybe the other guys have caught on.
00:31:25,00:31:26,So they don't know.
00:31:26,00:31:28,They don't know that they're all filler.
00:31:28,00:31:29,Maybe some of them do.
00:31:29,00:31:31,Maybe they're not doing it as much as they were a few thousand years ago.
00:31:31,00:31:37,"So the females, if they don't want the sperm, they will eat it, because they have"
00:31:37,00:31:43,"a stomach next to their vaginas, which will eat the sperm."
00:31:43,00:31:46,So this is specifically to male cabbage whites.
00:31:46,00:31:51,"And when your male comes in, he might do a blockage in the vagina to stop anyone else coming"
00:31:51,00:31:52,in.
00:31:52,00:31:55,"But obviously that's not good for the female, because she wants as much genetic material"
00:31:55,00:31:56,as possible.
00:31:56,00:32:01,And so they found that she has something called a bursa copulatrix inside her reproductive
00:32:01,00:32:07,"tract, which is basically a second stomach, which means she can digest stuff that's"
00:32:07,00:32:08,in there.
00:32:08,00:32:11,So she can eat through her mouth and her vagina.
00:32:11,00:32:15,It's quite the party trick.
00:32:15,00:32:17,"No, but there are jaws."
00:32:17,00:32:21,"She's got jaws down there, because the stuff the male, the posits, is surrounded by an incredibly"
00:32:21,00:32:27,"hard shell, which is designed to block up the entire thing so that other males can't"
00:32:27,00:32:28,make with her.
00:32:28,00:32:32,So she has evolved incredibly tough jaws to chew through this thing.
00:32:32,00:32:36,"There's a film where jaws, yeah, with shells."
00:32:36,00:32:37,It's a few.
00:32:37,00:32:40,It's not the one I think he is.
00:32:40,00:32:44,It's a butterfly vagina.
00:32:44,00:32:47,It's a butterfly vagina.
00:32:47,00:32:48,It's a butterfly vagina.
00:32:48,00:32:49,"Yes, yeah."
00:32:49,00:32:50,I think it's a B movie.
00:32:50,00:32:52,I don't think it was a Spielberg issue.
00:32:52,00:32:57,"Obviously, when a B movie is opposed to a butterfly movie."
00:32:57,00:32:58,"But yeah, it is good to eat, isn't it?"
00:32:58,00:33:01,So the semen can actually contain useful stuff.
00:33:01,00:33:05,"And the men know that, and so they do this thing called puddling male butterflies, where"
00:33:05,00:33:07,they suck salts off the ground.
00:33:07,00:33:10,"So the way butterflies drink is, they drink through a straw in their mouth."
00:33:10,00:33:13,"There's long proboscis, which they encoyle."
00:33:13,00:33:18,"And the males will go along the ground, sucking up lots of salts, lots of sodium."
00:33:18,00:33:20,And then this goes into their sperm.
00:33:20,00:33:25,"And when the woman, the woman, when the female butterfly eats that, then that creates good"
00:33:25,00:33:26,offspring.
00:33:26,00:33:32,"So what happens when it's winter, and there's loads of ice, and we put loads of salt on"
00:33:32,00:33:36,"the roads, and the butterflies come down and eat loads of salt."
00:33:36,00:33:37,"What happens then, Anna?"
00:33:37,00:33:39,"You get super, super butterfly."
00:33:39,00:33:40,That's what you get.
00:33:40,00:33:41,Yeah.
00:33:41,00:33:42,Do you actually?
00:33:42,00:33:43,You do.
00:33:43,00:33:47,You get males with extra muscles and females with bigger eyes and bigger brains.
00:33:47,00:33:48,Wow.
00:33:48,00:33:51,I didn't see many butterflies in gyms.
00:33:51,00:33:52,Gyms.
00:33:52,00:33:53,Gyms.
00:33:53,00:33:56,"I thought they all, I didn't think you'd got many flying around in winter."
00:33:56,00:33:57,Yeah.
00:33:57,00:34:01,"So you can get, let's say, you might salt the roads when it's not winter, or you might"
00:34:01,00:34:05,salt them in the higher places when it's cold or whatever.
00:34:05,00:34:10,"But basically, they found out recently that if you salt the roads and the butterflies eat"
00:34:10,00:34:16,"the stuff, then the next summer, they have extra muscles, bigger eyes, bigger brains."
00:34:16,00:34:18,And they asked the scientist who's involved.
00:34:18,00:34:23,"So surely, that means that road salt is good for butterflies."
00:34:23,00:34:26,"And she said, I do not want that to be the take-home message."
00:34:26,00:34:27,Why not?
00:34:27,00:34:28,Why not?
00:34:28,00:34:34,"Yeah. Well, I think because, basically, you are changing nature in some way."
00:34:34,00:34:38,"And generally speaking, we think that doing that is probably not a good idea."
00:34:38,00:34:39,Oh.
00:34:39,00:34:40,"There's always something, isn't there?"
00:34:40,00:34:41,"Oh, right."
00:34:41,00:34:45,I would love to see muscular butterflies flying around with big arms.
00:34:45,00:34:50,"Did you, I didn't read more on this because I didn't think it would be a good topic to"
00:34:50,00:34:51,talk about.
00:34:51,00:34:56,"But in Fukushima, there were mutant butterflies off the back of the radiation that were super"
00:34:56,00:34:58,strength.
00:34:58,00:34:59,Yeah.
00:34:59,00:35:03,"Again, the take-home message is not that give a load of radiation to butterflies."
00:35:03,00:35:04,Yeah.
00:35:04,00:35:10,"Just quickly, on this burst of copulatrix that we're talking about, James, so it's the chewing"
00:35:10,00:35:15,"and digesting organ, it takes 36 hours of constant chewing by the female to get through"
00:35:15,00:35:16,it.
00:35:16,00:35:17,That's how tough the thing is.
00:35:17,00:35:19,"That's a lot of chewing, even with your mouth."
00:35:19,00:35:20,Exactly.
00:35:20,00:35:21,Yeah.
00:35:21,00:35:22,Exactly.
00:35:22,00:35:29,"When it's flunching, it's a whole new ball game."
00:35:29,00:35:31,Oh god.
00:35:31,00:35:36,"But no, a team of scientists looked into how the super strength spermatophore and they"
00:35:36,00:35:40,could only break it down by boiling it in concentrated sulfuric acid.
00:35:40,00:35:41,No.
00:35:41,00:35:42,Wow.
00:35:42,00:35:43,That is how tough this thing that the male produces is.
00:35:43,00:35:44,That's wild.
00:35:44,00:35:48,"And the males, the spermatophore, the actual package that they give to the female, is"
00:35:48,00:35:50,up to 13% of the male's weight.
00:35:50,00:35:52,"It's amazing, isn't it?"
00:35:52,00:35:53,It's all just a fight.
00:35:53,00:35:57,"Basically, the males are just going to make it harder and harder and more difficult to"
00:35:57,00:36:01,break down and the females are just going to learn more tricks to break it down.
00:36:01,00:36:02,Yeah.
00:36:02,00:36:03,Yeah.
00:36:03,00:36:04,Crazy.
00:36:04,00:36:05,It's amazing.
00:36:05,00:36:06,It's the battle of the sexes.
00:36:06,00:36:07,Mm-hmm.
00:36:07,00:36:08,We're all fighting it.
00:36:08,00:36:09,Yeah.
00:36:09,00:36:13,"We were at James and I were talking to our group, Buddy Leven Skyro, who's been on"
00:36:13,00:36:16,"the podcast a bunch of times, and he was saying there's a new report that just came"
00:36:16,00:36:23,"out, which showed that the butterfly mouth and tongue predate flowers."
00:36:23,00:36:28,"And so you kind of go, well, that's what were they eating beforehand if it wasn't that."
00:36:28,00:36:32,And the suggestion from this new study is dinosaur tears.
00:36:32,00:36:33,Yeah.
00:36:33,00:36:34,"I mean, that's very cool."
00:36:34,00:36:35,Isn't that amazing?
00:36:35,00:36:36,Yeah.
00:36:36,00:36:40,"So they dip into the, so they've got this rhomboscis that we think is evolved to go"
00:36:40,00:36:43,"into flowers, but actually it's evolved to dip into the dinosaur's eye sockets."
00:36:43,00:36:44,Yeah.
00:36:44,00:36:45,Yeah.
00:36:45,00:36:46,I guess these sockets themselves.
00:36:46,00:36:47,Yeah.
00:36:47,00:36:48,I didn't.
00:36:48,00:36:49,I'm just remembering.
00:36:49,00:36:50,"No, you're right."
00:36:50,00:36:51,James and I literally saw him yesterday.
00:36:51,00:36:52,Yeah.
00:36:52,00:36:54,"So even now, butterflies will eat the tears of animals."
00:36:54,00:36:56,I think we all probably knew that.
00:36:56,00:37:00,"But yeah, the idea is that because they existed before flowers, they must have been eaten"
00:37:00,00:37:03,the tears before they even the flowers came along.
00:37:03,00:37:08,"Well, you would think if you were trying to gain sustenance from drinking animals' tears,"
00:37:08,00:37:10,that you would be more subtle than a massive butterfly.
00:37:10,00:37:11,Yeah.
00:37:11,00:37:12,You know what I mean?
00:37:12,00:37:16,"It would be kind of a wings, if something like that landed on my eye, I would notice."
00:37:16,00:37:20,I suppose that you could say that I don't know what these animals are because I haven't seen
00:37:20,00:37:24,"the study, but I imagine that they didn't look exactly like butterflies, like with the"
00:37:24,00:37:25,bigger shape wings and stuff.
00:37:25,00:37:26,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:37:26,00:37:29,But do you think the butterflies had to evolve to make the dinosaurs cry?
00:37:29,00:37:30,"Like, develop."
00:37:30,00:37:32,"They evolved to say, ""Heartful comments."""
00:37:32,00:37:33,Yeah.
00:37:33,00:37:34,Yeah.
00:37:34,00:37:36,"Otherwise, how do they do it or to punch them?"
00:37:36,00:37:41,Maybe that's why they had the superhuman butterflies then.
00:37:41,00:37:42,I don't like a butterfly.
00:37:42,00:37:43,Sting like a butterfly.
00:37:43,00:37:48,Punch like a butterfly.
00:37:48,00:37:52,"Okay, that is it."
00:37:52,00:37:54,That is all of our facts.
