00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 My name is Dan Treiber. I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, James Harkin and Anichezinski.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact. My fact this week is that Guantanamo Bay has a gift shop.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Pretty inappropriate.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Do we know if the prisoners can buy gifts? Is it like they get let out once a week?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 They sell files and they sell wire cushers and things like that. Now I've got a list of some of the things I do sell. So Fidel Castro standing on a boom box with text reading rockin in Fidel's backyard.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 You can get golf balls, you can get candles, you can get a plush banana rat, which is a type of rat that they have on Guantanamo Bay.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 So there's banana rats everywhere on Guantanamo Bay. Otherwise known as Hutia, you would normally call them Hutia, but they call them banana rats.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 But you know why they're called banana rats? They're shaped like a banana.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 They eat bananas. They're radioactive. They're very easy to peel.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 What is it? They don't really have legs.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 No, the reason is that they are called banana rats because their feces look like small versions of the fruit.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 That's cool. That's very interesting. So I've been named after the shape of my poo.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Not after that. Well you just be called poo, wouldn't you?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 No, you could be like raisins or skyscraper.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 You could be anything, couldn't it? Well that's a cool fact. I really like that.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Also they have teddy bears that you have cropped T-shirts and they read it don't get more better than this.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 It's pretty crazy. They've got things like Baskin Robbins there, the ice cream shop, they've got McDonald's, there's a subway, KFC, Pizza Hut.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 I really like when you hear about military compounds or places, when you hear something out of place, Andy has a great fact about the CIA.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 It's the Starbucks in Langley, Virginia, the headquarters of the CIA. The baristas are not allowed to write customers names on the cups.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Actually if you went Starbucks and they said what name is it and you said skyscraper.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 That's an unusual name, where do you get that? So Quentano Bay is on Cuba, obviously.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 But it's rented from the Cuban government except that Fidel Castro says that he never cashes the checks.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 He says he's cashed one of them once and it was by mistake. It was $4,000 a month.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 He's holding them all up and then one day he's going to cash them all and hopefully bankrupt.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 He has, isn't there a rumor that he stores them all in a draw in his office desk?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Yes, he showed them off in a TV interview once.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 He says that the only one that got cash was in 1959 during the actual Cuban revolution when it was a bit confusing.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 A mistake in the payroll department or something like that.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Why is Fidel? I'm really confused on my bank run that time.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 He also claims that the checks are made out to the Treasury General of the Republic,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 which is apparently a position that ceased to exist after the revolution in 1959.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 So this is a pre-revolutionary arrangement that clearly they haven't updated them on.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Guantanamo also has an Irish bar.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 He has an Irish bar called O'Kelly's Irish Bar, which claims to be the only Irish bar on Communist soil.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 So I thought I'd see if I could find any other Irish bars on Communist soil.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 And there is Hoolie's Irish Bar in Guangzhou, China.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Gary's Irish pub in Vien Tien, in Lao.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 And Bernie's Irish Bar restaurant in Saigon.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 Well done, so it's lying. They're lying, yeah.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 A lie coming out of Guantanamo.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Who would have thought it?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 That's if that's what takes them down.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 You know there's a version of Guantanamo Bay on Second Life.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Is there a really?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Yeah, a couple of activists built it to show people what it is like there basically.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Because obviously you're not normally allowed to go there.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 It's forbidden for people who are not in the military or with very few exceptions.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 So they have constructed one.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 People can volunteer to experience virtual prison there to see what it's like.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Wow.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Is that, do you see what it's like, do you think?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 No, obviously, there's only so much you can really experience from your home.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 But it shows you the layout and it shows you what exactly what happens.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Can I tell you one more thing about Second Life?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Yeah, there's an actual prison on Second Life for people who, you know,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 hacking into the world itself or sort of into the game or being other, you know, digitally naughty, basically.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 And supposedly it consists of just a moonlit field full of corn which goes on forever.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 And the only things you can do in it, there's a tractor that you can ride slowly.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Or there's a black and white TV playing a film from 1940 as the only things you can do in Second Life prison.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Wow.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 How cool is that?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 That sounds great.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Jimmy Carr.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 So for any overseas listeners, a big comedian in Britain, he did a gig in Second Life.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Wow.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Yeah, and it was a live gig.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 And during it, he's just standing there as a Second Life Jimmy Carr.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Yeah.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 And you know, when you play those games like Golden Eye and you end up just running into the wall and bashing against the wall.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 A lot of his audience members don't quite know if they stay still.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 So while he's telling jokes, they're just walking past him, smashing into walls, flipping over in front of him.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 That's very funny.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Yeah.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 I was looking into, because I was just thinking of famous gift shops I know of.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 And one that I went to not too long ago.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 And I think you can qualify as a gift shop.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 It's the Sherlock Holmes shop.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 And it's in Baker Street.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 And I didn't realize that it's not at 221B Baker Street.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 When Conan Doyle wrote the Sherlock stories, that didn't exist.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 That the road didn't go that far up.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Right.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 And so they've since built this bigger road.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 There's a 20 there.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 It was Abby Nationals. So Abby Nationals was situated at 221B Baker Street.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 And as a result, they hired someone to answer all mail to Sherlock Holmes.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 I went for the gift.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 They just wrote back offering them very good personal works.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 I'm afraid I can't help you find your wife, but I can't help you find a great deal on your insurance.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 But so what ended up happening was in 1990, a blue plaque went up outside the museum saying that that was now 221B.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 And so mail started going there.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 And that started a 15 year dispute between Abby Nationals and the Sherlock Holmes Museum about who was 221B.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Right.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 And now Abby Nationals closed.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 And now 221B technically is the museum.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Despite the fact it's at 239.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 So are we 221B or not 221B?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 That's just a question.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Have you heard the thing about the souvenir coins they've just done for Waterloo?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 No.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 It is so cool.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 And so Belgium wanted to do these special commemorative coins for the Battle of Waterloo.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 There's a famous statue of a lion.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 And they wanted to have that on it.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 And they made 180,000 of these.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 But France forced them to stop because basically other EU countries get a veto over it.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 And France is a bit sensitive about Waterloo.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 So the French said that it will create a bad reaction in France and you shouldn't do this.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 But the Belgians found a rule, a tiny, tiny rule in the book, saying that any country can issue its own coins if they're in a regular denomination.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 And so they have just made 70,000, 2.5 euro coins.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 So wow.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 With the design they wanted.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Oh, cool.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Yeah. And you can spend them across Belgium.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 Can you actually?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Yeah.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 So they have monetary value. That's so cool.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 So when the Duke of Wellington died, all of his locks of hair were cut off to make souvenirs for people.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Including the Queen and loads and loads of people.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Ah, that's right.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Because people did use to just take weird souvenirs from all sorts of things, didn't they?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 It wasn't like in the olden days you wouldn't have gift shops.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 People would just go and nick stuff, basically.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 But Mark Twain wrote that when he went to Egypt, all he could hear was the tinkling sound of Tak Hammers as people chipped away at the monuments.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Wow.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 So he just go to the pyramids and people would just be taking bits off all the time.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 That's all you could hear.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Really?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Do you know what would be amazing is if the pyramids were actually square?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 (Laughter)

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 This is just what was left.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Ah, that's amazing.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Ah, that bet that's true.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Is it true that they were covered in marble?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 That is true.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Wow. That's astonishing.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 I'm just seeing them back then.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Yeah. So what we see now, that used to have a marble casing around it.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Yeah, they used to be really shiny.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 So it was like being pebble dashed.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Yeah.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 But more classy, I think.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 I have a thing about souvenirs that are being taken that shouldn't be taken.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 So lots of people when they go to Uluru, formerly as rock in Australia,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 will chip off a bit to take home as with Stonehenger or as with other places or as with the pyramids.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 But there's an increasing trend of people posting them back because they feel really apologetic.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Oh, wow.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 They suffer bad luck in their life.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 And they think, well, it must be because I took that rock from Uluru and so they post it back.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 And they get about one every day.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 But the thing is, they return to the National Park.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 But before they get back to the National Park, they are quarantined.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 Somewhere in Australia, there is a rock quarantine.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 In case they've caught a disease, well, they've been in broad.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Basically, in case they have, as they say on the website, they say the threat of micro pathogens

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 being introduced by contaminated rocks from elsewhere.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 The bacteria can affect rocks, don't they?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 Yeah, genetically.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 They can change the chemical composition of rocks, definitely.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 But what's the fallout if you introduced a rock to Australia?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 I don't know, maybe there's a spore or something which could wipe out a native plant.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Wow, okay.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 I mean, they're just being ultra careful.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 But I just think that's the funniest thing.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 I mean, it's a barren desert where Uluru is.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 Or if they don't like non-native species coming in.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Do they say, what if there's like a fox on the underside of the rocks?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Yeah.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 No one's seeing it.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 It's true.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 It's just like you know.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 You're going to be careful of these kind of things.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 I have just imagined they put the rock back on Uluru and then go home.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 And then the next day they come and it's disappeared.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 That's just a note saying, suck it in.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 Yours, Mr. Fox.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Time for fact number two and that is Chazinski.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Yeah, my fact is that the Natural History Museum is turning Moth's gay

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 to stop them destroying the exhibits.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Yeah.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 What?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 Well, they've got a Moth problem.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 They are destroying exhibits in the Natural History Museum.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 So they, in the Natural History Museum, a lot of like things that have fur or feathers

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 or things like that on it, I think Moth's are using it.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 So it's not a lot of these things they can't eat, but they like destroy it

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 and then make little nests out of it.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 And yeah, so it's a problem.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 It's destroying the exhibits.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 And so they are using female hormones.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 They're covering male, Moths and female hormones to try and make other male Moths attracted to them

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 so that they waste all their shagging time trying to shag another male.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 And they fail.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 They fail to release you.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Sorry, I've just spent an hour and a half on that other male.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 I was reading about, because it's not just a Natural History Museum that's had this problem.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 Lots of other museums have this problem.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 And it turns out that there's one man who they call in to sort out all of their issues

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 and he's known as Bug Man and his name is David Pinager.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 And I don't know if he's being brought in for the Natural History Museum in this case,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 but he is the man who you bring in when there's a Moth problem, when there's any kind of insect problem.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 And he's been giving talks for years.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 The VNA, he gave a talk a few years ago, which was called Bug, which stood for beating unwanted guests.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 So this goes back as far as--

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Sounds like a talk for the security guards in the museum.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 That was a talk given in 1993 at the VNA.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 So this has been a problem since 1993, and they've been trying to combat it in so many different ways.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 There are lots of fruit growing places, possibly orchards, actually, I think about it,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 which have had the same problem with Moths, and they've used the same solution.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 They've also tried turning them gay.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Or sort of, because it's not quite turning them gay, is it?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 They're still straight, but it's disguising males.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Disguised females.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 At the Pit Rivers Museum, they did a thing where they had a glue board,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 and they put the pheromones of equivalent 1,000 female moths onto this glue board.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 So all these moths were just going, "Whoa, ladies!"

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 And then they were flying that way and just getting stuck to it.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 He showed us 1,000 ladies, because it kind of looks a bit like a blue bottle.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Oh, he smelt them, oh my god.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 It's so-- it's such a-- it's really funny, isn't it?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Yeah, it is.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 I can't believe it.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Dover Castle, as well, sorry.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 Dover Castle, as well, had a thing, which was--

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 They realised that all these insects, all these moths were being attracted to certain wall hangings,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 because the dye that was used in the paintings were mainly crushed insects.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 And weirdly, that was an attraction to them.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Yeah, they smelt dead insects, basically, and so they were attracted to that.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 So they had an issue with that at Dover Castle.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Apparently, 85% of male insects engage in homosexual acts, but mostly it's accidental.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 They just mate in the hope that they're mating with a female, but it doesn't really matter.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 No.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 And there are loads of theories as to why.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 So some people think that it's to practice mating.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Or some people think it's to dominate other males.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 But flower beetles, they do this a lot, and they found that it doesn't improve their success rate with females.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 But if a male leaks semen on another male, and that other male later breeds with a female,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 the female's eggs can be fertilised by the sperm of the male that she never encountered.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 And it's called sex by proxy, isn't it?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And it's the article about it, so that males can inseminate females, quotes,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 "Without expending time or energy having sex with them, result."

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 But it doesn't fly that the males just really want to have sex with the other males.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 And so they'd rather...

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Because I was out, and I thought, "They're expending time and energy mating with a male."

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 Surely you might as well just do it directly.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 It seems a bit of a roundabout way of doing it.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Do you guys know the only other animal where a percentage chooses exclusively to have homosexual sex,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 even though there are members of the opposite sex available to them?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 And that's domestic sheep.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Oh!

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 And I think it is 8% of male domestic sheep.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 We'll choose to have sex with another male sheep rather than a female, which is weird, isn't it?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 What is weird about sheep is that if you're a female sheep and you're going to have sex,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 what you do is basically stand perfectly still, and then the ram comes and mounts you.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 But if you have two lesbian sheep and they both want to have sex with each other,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 they naturally will just stand perfectly still.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 So they're just kind of stuck there, kind of looking at each other going,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 "Well, are you going to do something or am I?"

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 That makes it very difficult to spot lesbian sheep.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 She's just not making the first move I've been wrong.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 Do they have to get a friend in the end to just lift them up and force them together?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Like, "Oh, guys, enough of this pussy fitting around."

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 I was reading about a moth, obviously, they're preyed on by bats.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 That's a thing you have to watch out for if you're a moth.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 They've learned to create a sound, which says that there were different, much more disgusting tasting moth.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Really?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Yeah, so they pretend to be the disgusting tasting moth that they know bats don't go for,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 and then the bats don't go for them as a result.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 So they mimic the sound, and as a result, yeah.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 It would be safer to mimic the sound of like a lion or something, wouldn't it?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 But if you do get a really hungry bat, that's taken that bit further.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 That means every animal in the whole world should sound like a lion, yes.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 Why don't they?

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 Okay, but you're from a lion which disguises itself as, you know, an offensive clump of grass.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 Or a bit of Uluru Rock.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 Here's a thing though.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 You've heard on something which is that there is an actual moth called the Asian Corn Borer

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 who mimics the sound of a bat to freak out females.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 And when they hear it, they freeze in fear.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 And because the Asian Corn Borer is terrible at sex, it uses this sound to freeze the female

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 so that he can use the opportunity to mate with her.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 It's for a Hypno in the moth world.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 It's the Hypno of the moth world, yeah.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 Yeah.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 So here's a thing.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 You know the word "gather rope" is like an old French word for a toilet.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 Okay.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 That's where the word "wildrobe" comes from.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 And one theory as to why that, why that change happened is because you would keep your clothes in a toilet

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 because a smell was so bad it would keep moths away.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Really?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Also, all your clothes would smell like a toilet all the time.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 Really?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 I mean, I think it's the theory I'm not sure it's true.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 You know how James, you insist on ordering a penino when you go into a cafe rather than penini?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 I do indeed.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 Right.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 In the same vein, do you also use the "gather rope" wardrobe thing to excuse the fact that you piss in the wardrobe all the time?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 I'm like, etymologically speaking, it's fine.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 Something wrong.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Okay, time for fact number three and that is James.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that the word "marveless" has fallen in use from 155 times per million 20 years ago to only 2 times per million today.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 So every 500,000 words you say one of them will be "marveless".

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Wow.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 If anyone says society isn't in decline, then I think we've just proved them here.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 Yeah, so just about language changing and stuff and it's a bit of a shame.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 I think the word "marveless" is quite a good word and I think it's a shame we're not using it anymore.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 With that kind of disappearance that it's like achieving right now, are we going to lose it?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 I don't think we'll lose it, but it's just become old fashioned really.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 But I think there is hope for "marveless" because words go up and down, don't they?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 So the use of the word "marveless" had its peak in 1886 and it's been declining pretty steadily since then I think, except 1918 to 1925 was looking at a graph, had a big peak suddenly.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 That was finished.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Things are a bit more "marveless" than they were.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 And then suddenly, "Oh, this Hitler guy is looking a little bit rowdy for my liking, he's not looking very "marveless".

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 So "marveless" used to be a lot stronger. It used to mean something that caused wonder.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 So it was a lot stronger than "marveless".

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 Yeah, don't steal the meaning of the word "wonderful" and it should be ticked to "marveless".

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 It's a war between the words.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 "Wonderful" used to mean "marveless" because you're "marvel".

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 So this all comes from a thing called the Spoken British National Corpus of 2014 and that's done by Cambridge University Press and Lancaster University.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 And they take a whole load of kind of books and conversations and all that kind of thing and they work out how often words are used.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 And then there's a load of press releases, one of which I saw this week.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 I'm really suspicious about this project that they're on because they're asking for people to donate recorded tapes of their conversations every day and stuff.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 So they say we're calling for people to send us MP3 files of their everyday informal conversations in exchange for a small payment.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 And is this just MI5 kind of being more obvious?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Can you record yourself talking about threats to Britain's national security?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 There's a lot of that vocabulary that's very specialised and we really need it.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 Send it in, we'll give you a fiver and a short stint in 'Grantanimo Bale' is an obligatory shot.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 So the other conclusions that they came to are the words that they said were going in an out of fashion.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 They said that the word 'chirio' has yet to appear in conversations from this decade which is a bit sad.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 They said that old people still use it but not young ones.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 So I was looking, you know, Google does has this amazing tool which I've just wasted so many hours of my life on where I can't even remember what the oral is.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 But look up Google word tracker and it tracks the use of words over the last 200 years in all Google books.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 And when they, you know, how often words are mentioned.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 So the word loser reached its peak in 1807.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Whatever made you think I'm looking at that one.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 You knew you were going to be hanging out with us.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 You know you looked for loser.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 A couple of other good, good spikes.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 So the word 'happy' has been in constant decline since the year 1800 until the year 2000.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 And then it's been increasing since then.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 And then the 'Forell' song came out.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Oh, that might have spiked it right up.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 And happy feet movie.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 I reckon it must bring words back just by popular movies and songs.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Yes, must be right.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 Penis has been in steep decline since 1996.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 Tell me about it.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 How have I used all my shagging time off in the early 80s?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Is it just that people are using other words?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 I assume so.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 It's probably that, yeah, maybe we've diversified in our synonyms.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 Although, actually, we probably haven't.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 We've always used countless synonyms for that.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 Yeah, true.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 The Jiner had a huge spike in 1880.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 When? In when? 1880.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 There was, so literally that one year it was used four times as much as sort of before or since.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 In headlines?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Or there would be no musical song, probably.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Oh, Mr. Johnson, words by vagina, I think it has come.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 Very much the Forels happy of it's time.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Does it say?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Does it say why it's by?

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 It doesn't, it can't say why.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 It's literally just a stats site that tracks uses in Google Books.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 Okay.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 So I have no idea why I put up, you know, if anyone's got any theories.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 In Google Books.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 Yeah, that was interesting.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 Okay.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 The Atlantic Beach Theatre and Comedy Club a couple of years ago was putting on the vagina monologues

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 but got complaints about using the word vagina.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 And so renamed it the Who-Hard number locks.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 That's amazing.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 Is there one word that you guys use that is not just used in day-to-day language

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 that you wish would come back, but you do actually use?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Andy, most of the words, Andy, is exactly.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 Well, there is a word, which is, I do really like.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And it's, you know, megalomania is sort of being, it's insanely thinking are all powerful.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 There is a corresponding word called micromania, which is a tendency to constantly belittle oneself.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Isn't that an incredible word?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Yeah, it's because it's a very common thing.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 A lot of people, you know, especially sort of supposedly English people are very, very self-deprecating.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 There is a word for it, micromania.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 I really like that.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 There are really, I've got some good words, if you like, from the M section of the Tictionary.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Actually, one related to Moths.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 So, macrolepidoptera, and this is in the OED.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 They are defined as the butterflies in Moths, which are large enough to be of interest to collectors.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 And there's also microlepidoptera, which is the numerous Moths, which are mostly smaller than those of interest to collectors.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 I don't know that collectors were so size-ist.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 Yeah.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 You were the thought that the smart ones might be more precious.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 Yeah.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 Thrall in 18th of an inch long, though, is a bit tiresome having to collect them, and you lose them in your pocket.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 Yeah.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 You could lie about your collection.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 Incredible, so I know you can't see them, but they're extraordinary.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 The Mile High Club in the OED is defined as an imaginary association of people who have had sexual intercourse on an aircraft.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 That's great.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 That is really good.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 That's written by someone who's tried and failed.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 I don't think I've got one more word that I really like.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 That's a babble event, and it means one who makes feeble jokes.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Yeah, that's good.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 Yeah, why'd you bring that up?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Yeah.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 Just thought you knew you would be talking to us.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 Okay, time for our final fact, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 My fact is that to prepare for China's national day, 100,000 pigeons have anal security checks to make sure they're not carrying anything suspicious.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Like rocks from Australia.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 China's national day is the first of October, and last year with a celebration involved releasing 100,000 pigeons in Tiananmen Square, and they all fly up and fly around.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 It's very beautiful.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 This is according to, I think, the people's daily, the sort of government-sponsored newspaper, and a security officer said that they all have to be checked and under their wings and their tail feathers and even their bottoms.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 And they are then loaded into sealed vehicles and to live to the square with their checked a second time.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Wow.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 And then sealed in the cages for the release.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 And supposedly they were all checked at the Uitan City Sports Centre in Beijing and the whole process was videotaped.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 So someone has a tape this event happened.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 Wow.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 Yeah.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Appigeons are big worry.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Are they prone to treachery in China?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 No idea.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 But we have covered on the podcast before that they were used to smuggle messages and...

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Wasn't it to steal grain as well?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Yes, and to steal grain.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 They used to steal grain from the imperial granary.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 Yeah, you fly them in.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 They eat the grain.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 You fly them out and then you squeeze them and they have to throw up the grain.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 I think you feed them like alamo or something and they throw it up.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Ah, okay.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 You just can't we use them.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 No, no, no.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 Yeah.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 So this is something that happens.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 So how many pigeons are they releasing on their national day?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 100,000.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 Okay, wow.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 I know that China is...

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 The military has been training up pigeons.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 It's been training up 10,000 pigeons to use as a reserve pigeon army.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 So that would be like by military communications and the event of an attack.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 And in the event of an invasion, apparently they want pigeons to carry stuff back and forth.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 So they can only carry 100 grams of stuff, I think.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 But if you put a...

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 If you put something on a USB, you can communicate a lot of stuff.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 Oh, you get 100 grams.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Really good point.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 That's true.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Really good point.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 So yeah, I wondered if those pigeons they were releasing were...

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Was that part of the training?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Yeah.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 But the interesting thing is, you know when you release pigeons and doves at weddings and things like that?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 Yeah, they're homing pigeons normally.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 So they fly around and when they're fluttering around, beautifully around the venue or whatever.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 They're actually just getting their bearings.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Where the hell am I?

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 And then they shoot off in one particular direction.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 That is them heading home.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 That's a good business model, isn't it?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 It's a really good business model.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 Because they're reusable.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 And you don't need to transport them home?

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 No, exactly.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 Yeah.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 Someone who released 100 white pigeons very recently turns out as a massive pigeon lover, Mike Tyson.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 No idea.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Mike Tyson loves pigeons.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 He actually says that the reason he became a boxer was as a result of one of his pigeons.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 Because his pigeon was killed by a local bully.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 And the local bully really like mauled one of his favorite pigeons.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 And so he got into a fight with him and that's where he discovered he was a great fighter.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Imagine killing a pigeon and finding out it belonged to Mike Tyson.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Oh, my God.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 By the time he didn't know that he was Mike Tyson.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 Mike Tyson didn't even know he was Mike Tyson.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Imagine that discovery.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 He don't want to be the one he discovers it on.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Exactly.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Public Picasso as well.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 He was a pigeon fancier.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 I'll see.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 And he named his daughter Paloma.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 And Paloma is the Spanish for pigeon.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 Really?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 Wow.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 So he named his daughter Pigeon.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 But he also named one of his pigeon's daughter.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 And then he got very confusing when his will was read.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 So Pigeons are so good at getting home.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 And we don't know how, really.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 But we do know they have amounts.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 They have a little bit of magnetic iron ore in their beaks.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 Cool.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 And that helps them to sense the earth's magnetic field.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 And they also use their eyesight for the final stages of a journey.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 And we know this because of a guy called Charlie Walcott.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 Who he has spent 40 years attaching radio transmitters to Pigeons

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 and then following them in a single engine plane to see them navigate.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 And to see them go.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 You can imagine this terrified Pigeon saying he's still coming up.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Wow.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 It sounds like that old cartoon with dastardly and muttly in his hands.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 And he puts frosted contact lenses on Pigeons.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 And then lets them fly home just to test whether they use their eyesight.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 And they get most of the way to all time using the magnetic field and other things

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 that we don't know about.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 But then towards the end they got confused.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 And that's how we know that they need visual landmarks.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Just for the end.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Like having an autopilot on for the main flight and then for the landing.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 Yeah, but they're also using some Pigeons have been found

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 to be observing the use of roads and roundabouts.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 It's amazing.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 It's so cool.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 So a Pigeon will be flying above a road.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 It'll hit around about.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 And if it was going to go left, it won't go left until it's gone around the roundabout.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 And then it takes the appropriate...

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 No, which way to go round the roundabout because I struggle if I'm driving in Italy for instance.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 No, which way to go round the roundabout.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Maybe it is to avoid Italy.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 But what I mean is they must be following the cars, right?

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Yeah, the cars go round.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Maybe it's the heat of the cars or something like that.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 Yeah.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Yeah.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 But the dove releases they day back to the middle ages because they used to have religious plays.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 And Noah would release a dove from the arc.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 Of course, yeah.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 And I read this in a book about medieval theatre.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 To stage the bit where the dove comes back.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 They'd either use a dummy bird or they'd just attach a string to the real bird.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 Just sort of put it back.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Oh my god.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 It's not going to look that natural, is it?

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 What are you up to?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 This flapping frantically dumb.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 Allid naturally returns.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 And it's got the olive branch, salutate to it.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 Pigeons are one of only three birds, aren't they?

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 They produce milk for their offspring.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 Wow.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 So pigeons, emperor penguins, I think, and flamingos.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 And they produce it in the, is it the cries called crop milk?

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 And the crop is like this pouch in the back of their throat, I think,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 where they, a few days before they give birth, they start making this milk.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 And they sometimes stop eating to make sure that there's not indigestible grain stuck in the milk

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 that the baby can't digest.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 But I really like the fact that they sort of adjust the milk and turn it into baby food

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 as the scrub gets a little bit older.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Is it actual milk?

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 I don't think it is.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 I'm not sure if it even contains lactose, it might do.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 But could you get pigeon cheese, is what I'm saying?

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Right.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 I read that the milk in quotation marks from pigeons contains more protein and fat than both human and cows.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 Oh, yeah, it does.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 So if we did get a cheese.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 On healthy cheese.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 Maybe that's where we haven't done it.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 I think of a whole range of reasons why we haven't made cheese from pigeons.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 I get a bit iffy about ghost cheese.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 Never mind pigeon cheese.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 The Pope has had to, since he often releases does.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 He's had to replace them now with balloons.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 Because birds kept attacking the doves.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 So in 2014 he did it.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 And a seagull and a crow attacked the doves very fiercely.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 And his children letting them go.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 So it's immensely traumatising for the children as well.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 And then also in 2013, this is when we had Pope Benedict.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 That release was also ruined when a seagull attacked the dove and pinned it against a window pane.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 And then the year before that, he was releasing two doves.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 And one of them perched beside the pope and didn't move.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 And then the second dove immediately flew back into his apartment.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 And the article I was reading about it just said to his credit,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 Pope Benedict seemed to shout "Mama Mia" in surprise.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 So this was Pope Benedict.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 Because Pope Benedict was German, right?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 It's like he's moved to the Vatican and picked up the lingo.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 Well, you know what they say?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 Wedding Rome.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 You know that all RAF bomber planes used to carry a pigeon as standard.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 How come?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 They crashed in the sea.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 They would release a pigeon.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 And they would attach the coordinates of where they had crashed into the sea.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 And loads and loads of pilots and other crew on the planes were saved.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 Well, they're really.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 That's really cool.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 I can't believe this. They were on submarines.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 Wow.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 And some paratroopers had a pigeon in a sling on their chest.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 Wow.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 Yeah.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 A lot of these pigeons were given the Dickon medal, which is no word for like brave animals

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 by the P.D.S.A.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 And I think more pigeons have had that award than anyone.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 Yeah.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 I have a list of medal-winning pigeons in the second world war.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 Okay.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 They included Tyke, Gustav, Paddy, Billy, Mary, Princess, Commando, Scotch Lass and William of Orange.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 It was Commando the naked one.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 It also sounds like William of Orange has got the wrong list of your things.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 I also have a list of Kings of England.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 It is Henry VIII.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 James II.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 No Minky.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 Okay. That's it.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 That's all of our facts.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
