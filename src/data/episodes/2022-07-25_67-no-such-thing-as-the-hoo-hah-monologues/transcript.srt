00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 My name is Dan Treiber. I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, James Harkin and Anichezinski.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact. My fact this week is that Guantanamo Bay has a gift shop.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Pretty inappropriate.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Do we know if the prisoners can buy gifts? Is it like they get let out once a week?

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 They sell files and they sell wire cushers and things like that. Now I've got a list of some of the things I do sell. So Fidel Castro standing on a boom box with text reading rockin in Fidel's backyard.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 You can get golf balls, you can get candles, you can get a plush banana rat, which is a type of rat that they have on Guantanamo Bay.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 So there's banana rats everywhere on Guantanamo Bay. Otherwise known as Hutia, you would normally call them Hutia, but they call them banana rats.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 But you know why they're called banana rats? They're shaped like a banana.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 They eat bananas. They're radioactive. They're very easy to peel.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 What is it? They don't really have legs.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 No, the reason is that they are called banana rats because their feces look like small versions of the fruit.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 That's cool. That's very interesting. So I've been named after the shape of my poo.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Not after that. Well you just be called poo, wouldn't you?

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 No, you could be like raisins or skyscraper.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 You could be anything, couldn't it? Well that's a cool fact. I really like that.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Also they have teddy bears that you have cropped T-shirts and they read it don't get more better than this.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 It's pretty crazy. They've got things like Baskin Robbins there, the ice cream shop, they've got McDonald's, there's a subway, KFC, Pizza Hut.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I really like when you hear about military compounds or places, when you hear something out of place, Andy has a great fact about the CIA.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 It's the Starbucks in Langley, Virginia, the headquarters of the CIA. The baristas are not allowed to write customers names on the cups.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Actually if you went Starbucks and they said what name is it and you said skyscraper.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 That's an unusual name, where do you get that? So Quentano Bay is on Cuba, obviously.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 But it's rented from the Cuban government except that Fidel Castro says that he never cashes the checks.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 He says he's cashed one of them once and it was by mistake. It was $4,000 a month.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 He's holding them all up and then one day he's going to cash them all and hopefully bankrupt.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 He has, isn't there a rumor that he stores them all in a draw in his office desk?

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Yes, he showed them off in a TV interview once.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 He says that the only one that got cash was in 1959 during the actual Cuban revolution when it was a bit confusing.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 A mistake in the payroll department or something like that.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Why is Fidel? I'm really confused on my bank run that time.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 He also claims that the checks are made out to the Treasury General of the Republic,

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 which is apparently a position that ceased to exist after the revolution in 1959.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 So this is a pre-revolutionary arrangement that clearly they haven't updated them on.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Guantanamo also has an Irish bar.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 He has an Irish bar called O'Kelly's Irish Bar, which claims to be the only Irish bar on Communist soil.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 So I thought I'd see if I could find any other Irish bars on Communist soil.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And there is Hoolie's Irish Bar in Guangzhou, China.

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Gary's Irish pub in Vien Tien, in Lao.

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And Bernie's Irish Bar restaurant in Saigon.

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Well done, so it's lying. They're lying, yeah.

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 A lie coming out of Guantanamo.

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Who would have thought it?

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 That's if that's what takes them down.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 You know there's a version of Guantanamo Bay on Second Life.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Is there a really?

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Yeah, a couple of activists built it to show people what it is like there basically.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Because obviously you're not normally allowed to go there.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 It's forbidden for people who are not in the military or with very few exceptions.

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 So they have constructed one.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 People can volunteer to experience virtual prison there to see what it's like.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Wow.

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Is that, do you see what it's like, do you think?

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 No, obviously, there's only so much you can really experience from your home.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 But it shows you the layout and it shows you what exactly what happens.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Can I tell you one more thing about Second Life?

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Yeah, there's an actual prison on Second Life for people who, you know,

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 hacking into the world itself or sort of into the game or being other, you know, digitally naughty, basically.

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And supposedly it consists of just a moonlit field full of corn which goes on forever.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And the only things you can do in it, there's a tractor that you can ride slowly.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Or there's a black and white TV playing a film from 1940 as the only things you can do in Second Life prison.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Wow.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 How cool is that?

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 That sounds great.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Jimmy Carr.

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So for any overseas listeners, a big comedian in Britain, he did a gig in Second Life.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Wow.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Yeah, and it was a live gig.

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And during it, he's just standing there as a Second Life Jimmy Carr.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Yeah.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And you know, when you play those games like Golden Eye and you end up just running into the wall and bashing against the wall.

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 A lot of his audience members don't quite know if they stay still.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 So while he's telling jokes, they're just walking past him, smashing into walls, flipping over in front of him.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 That's very funny.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Yeah.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I was looking into, because I was just thinking of famous gift shops I know of.

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And one that I went to not too long ago.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And I think you can qualify as a gift shop.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 It's the Sherlock Holmes shop.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And it's in Baker Street.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 And I didn't realize that it's not at 221B Baker Street.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 When Conan Doyle wrote the Sherlock stories, that didn't exist.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 That the road didn't go that far up.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Right.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And so they've since built this bigger road.

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 There's a 20 there.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 It was Abby Nationals. So Abby Nationals was situated at 221B Baker Street.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 And as a result, they hired someone to answer all mail to Sherlock Holmes.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 I went for the gift.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 They just wrote back offering them very good personal works.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 I'm afraid I can't help you find your wife, but I can't help you find a great deal on your insurance.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 But so what ended up happening was in 1990, a blue plaque went up outside the museum saying that that was now 221B.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And so mail started going there.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And that started a 15 year dispute between Abby Nationals and the Sherlock Holmes Museum about who was 221B.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Right.

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And now Abby Nationals closed.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And now 221B technically is the museum.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Despite the fact it's at 239.

100
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 So are we 221B or not 221B?

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 That's just a question.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Have you heard the thing about the souvenir coins they've just done for Waterloo?

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 No.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 It is so cool.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 And so Belgium wanted to do these special commemorative coins for the Battle of Waterloo.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 There's a famous statue of a lion.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And they wanted to have that on it.

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And they made 180,000 of these.

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 But France forced them to stop because basically other EU countries get a veto over it.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And France is a bit sensitive about Waterloo.

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 So the French said that it will create a bad reaction in France and you shouldn't do this.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 But the Belgians found a rule, a tiny, tiny rule in the book, saying that any country can issue its own coins if they're in a regular denomination.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 And so they have just made 70,000, 2.5 euro coins.

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 So wow.

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 With the design they wanted.

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Oh, cool.

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Yeah. And you can spend them across Belgium.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Can you actually?

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Yeah.

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 So they have monetary value. That's so cool.

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 So when the Duke of Wellington died, all of his locks of hair were cut off to make souvenirs for people.

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Including the Queen and loads and loads of people.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Ah, that's right.

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Because people did use to just take weird souvenirs from all sorts of things, didn't they?

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 It wasn't like in the olden days you wouldn't have gift shops.

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 People would just go and nick stuff, basically.

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 But Mark Twain wrote that when he went to Egypt, all he could hear was the tinkling sound of Tak Hammers as people chipped away at the monuments.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Wow.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 So he just go to the pyramids and people would just be taking bits off all the time.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 That's all you could hear.

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Really?

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Do you know what would be amazing is if the pyramids were actually square?

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 (Laughter)

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 This is just what was left.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Yeah, exactly.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Ah, that's amazing.

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Ah, that bet that's true.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Is it true that they were covered in marble?

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 That is true.

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Wow. That's astonishing.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I'm just seeing them back then.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Yeah. So what we see now, that used to have a marble casing around it.

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Yeah, they used to be really shiny.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 So it was like being pebble dashed.

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Yeah.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 But more classy, I think.

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I have a thing about souvenirs that are being taken that shouldn't be taken.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Oh, yeah.

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 So lots of people when they go to Uluru, formerly as rock in Australia,

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 will chip off a bit to take home as with Stonehenger or as with other places or as with the pyramids.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 But there's an increasing trend of people posting them back because they feel really apologetic.

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Oh, wow.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 They suffer bad luck in their life.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And they think, well, it must be because I took that rock from Uluru and so they post it back.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And they get about one every day.

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 But the thing is, they return to the National Park.

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 But before they get back to the National Park, they are quarantined.

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Somewhere in Australia, there is a rock quarantine.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 In case they've caught a disease, well, they've been in broad.

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Basically, in case they have, as they say on the website, they say the threat of micro pathogens

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 being introduced by contaminated rocks from elsewhere.

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 The bacteria can affect rocks, don't they?

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Yeah, genetically.

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 They can change the chemical composition of rocks, definitely.

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 But what's the fallout if you introduced a rock to Australia?

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 I don't know, maybe there's a spore or something which could wipe out a native plant.

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Wow, okay.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 I mean, they're just being ultra careful.

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 But I just think that's the funniest thing.

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 I mean, it's a barren desert where Uluru is.

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Or if they don't like non-native species coming in.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Do they say, what if there's like a fox on the underside of the rocks?

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Yeah.

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 No one's seeing it.

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 It's true.

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 It's just like you know.

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 You're going to be careful of these kind of things.

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I have just imagined they put the rock back on Uluru and then go home.

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And then the next day they come and it's disappeared.

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 That's just a note saying, suck it in.

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Yours, Mr. Fox.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Time for fact number two and that is Chazinski.

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Yeah, my fact is that the Natural History Museum is turning Moth's gay

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 to stop them destroying the exhibits.

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Yeah.

186
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 What?

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Well, they've got a Moth problem.

188
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 They are destroying exhibits in the Natural History Museum.

189
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 So they, in the Natural History Museum, a lot of like things that have fur or feathers

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 or things like that on it, I think Moth's are using it.

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 So it's not a lot of these things they can't eat, but they like destroy it

192
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 and then make little nests out of it.

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And yeah, so it's a problem.

194
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 It's destroying the exhibits.

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And so they are using female hormones.

196
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 They're covering male, Moths and female hormones to try and make other male Moths attracted to them

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 so that they waste all their shagging time trying to shag another male.

198
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And they fail.

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 They fail to release you.

200
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Sorry, I've just spent an hour and a half on that other male.

201
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 I was reading about, because it's not just a Natural History Museum that's had this problem.

202
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Lots of other museums have this problem.

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And it turns out that there's one man who they call in to sort out all of their issues

204
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 and he's known as Bug Man and his name is David Pinager.

205
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And I don't know if he's being brought in for the Natural History Museum in this case,

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 but he is the man who you bring in when there's a Moth problem, when there's any kind of insect problem.

207
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And he's been giving talks for years.

208
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 The VNA, he gave a talk a few years ago, which was called Bug, which stood for beating unwanted guests.

209
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 So this goes back as far as--

210
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Sounds like a talk for the security guards in the museum.

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 That was a talk given in 1993 at the VNA.

212
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 So this has been a problem since 1993, and they've been trying to combat it in so many different ways.

213
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 There are lots of fruit growing places, possibly orchards, actually, I think about it,

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 which have had the same problem with Moths, and they've used the same solution.

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 They've also tried turning them gay.

216
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Or sort of, because it's not quite turning them gay, is it?

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 They're still straight, but it's disguising males.

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Disguised females.

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 At the Pit Rivers Museum, they did a thing where they had a glue board,

220
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 and they put the pheromones of equivalent 1,000 female moths onto this glue board.

221
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 So all these moths were just going, "Whoa, ladies!"

222
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And then they were flying that way and just getting stuck to it.

223
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 He showed us 1,000 ladies, because it kind of looks a bit like a blue bottle.

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Oh, he smelt them, oh my god.

225
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 It's so-- it's such a-- it's really funny, isn't it?

226
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Yeah, it is.

227
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 I can't believe it.

228
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Dover Castle, as well, sorry.

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Oh, yeah.

230
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Dover Castle, as well, had a thing, which was--

231
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 They realised that all these insects, all these moths were being attracted to certain wall hangings,

232
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 because the dye that was used in the paintings were mainly crushed insects.

233
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And weirdly, that was an attraction to them.

234
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Yeah, they smelt dead insects, basically, and so they were attracted to that.

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 So they had an issue with that at Dover Castle.

236
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Apparently, 85% of male insects engage in homosexual acts, but mostly it's accidental.

237
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 They just mate in the hope that they're mating with a female, but it doesn't really matter.

238
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 No.

239
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And there are loads of theories as to why.

240
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 So some people think that it's to practice mating.

241
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Or some people think it's to dominate other males.

242
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 But flower beetles, they do this a lot, and they found that it doesn't improve their success rate with females.

243
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 But if a male leaks semen on another male, and that other male later breeds with a female,

244
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 the female's eggs can be fertilised by the sperm of the male that she never encountered.

245
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And it's called sex by proxy, isn't it?

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Yeah, exactly.

247
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And it's the article about it, so that males can inseminate females, quotes,

248
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 "Without expending time or energy having sex with them, result."

249
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 But it doesn't fly that the males just really want to have sex with the other males.

250
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And so they'd rather...

251
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Because I was out, and I thought, "They're expending time and energy mating with a male."

252
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Surely you might as well just do it directly.

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 It seems a bit of a roundabout way of doing it.

254
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Do you guys know the only other animal where a percentage chooses exclusively to have homosexual sex,

255
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 even though there are members of the opposite sex available to them?

256
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 And that's domestic sheep.

257
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Oh!

258
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 And I think it is 8% of male domestic sheep.

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 We'll choose to have sex with another male sheep rather than a female, which is weird, isn't it?

260
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 What is weird about sheep is that if you're a female sheep and you're going to have sex,

261
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 what you do is basically stand perfectly still, and then the ram comes and mounts you.

262
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 But if you have two lesbian sheep and they both want to have sex with each other,

263
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 they naturally will just stand perfectly still.

264
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 So they're just kind of stuck there, kind of looking at each other going,

265
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 "Well, are you going to do something or am I?"

266
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 That makes it very difficult to spot lesbian sheep.

267
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 She's just not making the first move I've been wrong.

268
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Do they have to get a friend in the end to just lift them up and force them together?

269
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Like, "Oh, guys, enough of this pussy fitting around."

270
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 I was reading about a moth, obviously, they're preyed on by bats.

271
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 That's a thing you have to watch out for if you're a moth.

272
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 They've learned to create a sound, which says that there were different, much more disgusting tasting moth.

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Really?

274
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Yeah, so they pretend to be the disgusting tasting moth that they know bats don't go for,

275
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 and then the bats don't go for them as a result.

276
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 So they mimic the sound, and as a result, yeah.

277
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 It would be safer to mimic the sound of like a lion or something, wouldn't it?

278
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 But if you do get a really hungry bat, that's taken that bit further.

279
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 That means every animal in the whole world should sound like a lion, yes.

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Why don't they?

281
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Okay, but you're from a lion which disguises itself as, you know, an offensive clump of grass.

282
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Or a bit of Uluru Rock.

283
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Here's a thing though.

284
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 You've heard on something which is that there is an actual moth called the Asian Corn Borer

285
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 who mimics the sound of a bat to freak out females.

286
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 And when they hear it, they freeze in fear.

287
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And because the Asian Corn Borer is terrible at sex, it uses this sound to freeze the female

288
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 so that he can use the opportunity to mate with her.

289
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It's for a Hypno in the moth world.

290
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 It's the Hypno of the moth world, yeah.

291
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Yeah.

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 So here's a thing.

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 You know the word "gather rope" is like an old French word for a toilet.

294
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Okay.

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 That's where the word "wildrobe" comes from.

296
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And one theory as to why that, why that change happened is because you would keep your clothes in a toilet

297
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 because a smell was so bad it would keep moths away.

298
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Really?

299
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Also, all your clothes would smell like a toilet all the time.

300
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Really?

301
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 I mean, I think it's the theory I'm not sure it's true.

302
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 You know how James, you insist on ordering a penino when you go into a cafe rather than penini?

303
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I do indeed.

304
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Right.

305
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 In the same vein, do you also use the "gather rope" wardrobe thing to excuse the fact that you piss in the wardrobe all the time?

306
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 I'm like, etymologically speaking, it's fine.

307
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Something wrong.

308
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Okay, time for fact number three and that is James.

309
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that the word "marveless" has fallen in use from 155 times per million 20 years ago to only 2 times per million today.

310
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 So every 500,000 words you say one of them will be "marveless".

311
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Wow.

312
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 If anyone says society isn't in decline, then I think we've just proved them here.

313
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Yeah, so just about language changing and stuff and it's a bit of a shame.

314
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I think the word "marveless" is quite a good word and I think it's a shame we're not using it anymore.

315
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Yeah, yeah.

316
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 With that kind of disappearance that it's like achieving right now, are we going to lose it?

317
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 I don't think we'll lose it, but it's just become old fashioned really.

318
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 But I think there is hope for "marveless" because words go up and down, don't they?

319
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 So the use of the word "marveless" had its peak in 1886 and it's been declining pretty steadily since then I think, except 1918 to 1925 was looking at a graph, had a big peak suddenly.

320
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 That was finished.

321
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Things are a bit more "marveless" than they were.

322
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And then suddenly, "Oh, this Hitler guy is looking a little bit rowdy for my liking, he's not looking very "marveless".

323
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 So "marveless" used to be a lot stronger. It used to mean something that caused wonder.

324
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 So it was a lot stronger than "marveless".

325
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Yeah, exactly.

326
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Yeah, don't steal the meaning of the word "wonderful" and it should be ticked to "marveless".

327
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 It's a war between the words.

328
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 "Wonderful" used to mean "marveless" because you're "marvel".

329
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 So this all comes from a thing called the Spoken British National Corpus of 2014 and that's done by Cambridge University Press and Lancaster University.

330
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And they take a whole load of kind of books and conversations and all that kind of thing and they work out how often words are used.

331
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 And then there's a load of press releases, one of which I saw this week.

332
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 I'm really suspicious about this project that they're on because they're asking for people to donate recorded tapes of their conversations every day and stuff.

333
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 So they say we're calling for people to send us MP3 files of their everyday informal conversations in exchange for a small payment.

334
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And is this just MI5 kind of being more obvious?

335
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Can you record yourself talking about threats to Britain's national security?

336
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 There's a lot of that vocabulary that's very specialised and we really need it.

337
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Send it in, we'll give you a fiver and a short stint in 'Grantanimo Bale' is an obligatory shot.

338
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 So the other conclusions that they came to are the words that they said were going in an out of fashion.

339
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 They said that the word 'chirio' has yet to appear in conversations from this decade which is a bit sad.

340
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 They said that old people still use it but not young ones.

341
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 So I was looking, you know, Google does has this amazing tool which I've just wasted so many hours of my life on where I can't even remember what the oral is.

342
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 But look up Google word tracker and it tracks the use of words over the last 200 years in all Google books.

343
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And when they, you know, how often words are mentioned.

344
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 So the word loser reached its peak in 1807.

345
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Whatever made you think I'm looking at that one.

346
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 You knew you were going to be hanging out with us.

347
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 You know you looked for loser.

348
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 A couple of other good, good spikes.

349
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 So the word 'happy' has been in constant decline since the year 1800 until the year 2000.

350
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 And then it's been increasing since then.

351
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And then the 'Forell' song came out.

352
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Oh, that might have spiked it right up.

353
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And happy feet movie.

354
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 I reckon it must bring words back just by popular movies and songs.

355
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Yes, must be right.

356
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Penis has been in steep decline since 1996.

357
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Tell me about it.

358
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 How have I used all my shagging time off in the early 80s?

359
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Is it just that people are using other words?

360
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 I assume so.

361
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 It's probably that, yeah, maybe we've diversified in our synonyms.

362
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Although, actually, we probably haven't.

363
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 We've always used countless synonyms for that.

364
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Yeah, true.

365
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 The Jiner had a huge spike in 1880.

366
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 When? In when? 1880.

367
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 There was, so literally that one year it was used four times as much as sort of before or since.

368
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 In headlines?

369
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Or there would be no musical song, probably.

370
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Oh, Mr. Johnson, words by vagina, I think it has come.

371
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Very much the Forels happy of it's time.

372
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Does it say?

373
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Does it say why it's by?

374
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 It doesn't, it can't say why.

375
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 It's literally just a stats site that tracks uses in Google Books.

376
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Okay.

377
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 So I have no idea why I put up, you know, if anyone's got any theories.

378
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 In Google Books.

379
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Yeah, that was interesting.

380
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Okay.

381
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 The Atlantic Beach Theatre and Comedy Club a couple of years ago was putting on the vagina monologues

382
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 but got complaints about using the word vagina.

383
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 And so renamed it the Who-Hard number locks.

384
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 That's amazing.

385
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Is there one word that you guys use that is not just used in day-to-day language

386
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 that you wish would come back, but you do actually use?

387
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Andy, most of the words, Andy, is exactly.

388
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Well, there is a word, which is, I do really like.

389
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 And it's, you know, megalomania is sort of being, it's insanely thinking are all powerful.

390
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 There is a corresponding word called micromania, which is a tendency to constantly belittle oneself.

391
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Isn't that an incredible word?

392
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Yeah, it's because it's a very common thing.

393
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 A lot of people, you know, especially sort of supposedly English people are very, very self-deprecating.

394
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 There is a word for it, micromania.

395
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 I really like that.

396
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 There are really, I've got some good words, if you like, from the M section of the Tictionary.

397
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Actually, one related to Moths.

398
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 So, macrolepidoptera, and this is in the OED.

399
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 They are defined as the butterflies in Moths, which are large enough to be of interest to collectors.

400
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And there's also microlepidoptera, which is the numerous Moths, which are mostly smaller than those of interest to collectors.

401
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 I don't know that collectors were so size-ist.

402
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Yeah.

403
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 You were the thought that the smart ones might be more precious.

404
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Yeah.

405
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Thrall in 18th of an inch long, though, is a bit tiresome having to collect them, and you lose them in your pocket.

406
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Yeah.

407
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 You could lie about your collection.

408
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Incredible, so I know you can't see them, but they're extraordinary.

409
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 The Mile High Club in the OED is defined as an imaginary association of people who have had sexual intercourse on an aircraft.

410
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 That's great.

411
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 That is really good.

412
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 That's written by someone who's tried and failed.

413
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 I don't think I've got one more word that I really like.

414
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 That's a babble event, and it means one who makes feeble jokes.

415
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Yeah, that's good.

416
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Yeah, why'd you bring that up?

417
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Yeah.

418
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Just thought you knew you would be talking to us.

419
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Okay, time for our final fact, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

420
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 My fact is that to prepare for China's national day, 100,000 pigeons have anal security checks to make sure they're not carrying anything suspicious.

421
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Like rocks from Australia.

422
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 China's national day is the first of October, and last year with a celebration involved releasing 100,000 pigeons in Tiananmen Square, and they all fly up and fly around.

423
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 It's very beautiful.

424
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 This is according to, I think, the people's daily, the sort of government-sponsored newspaper, and a security officer said that they all have to be checked and under their wings and their tail feathers and even their bottoms.

425
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And they are then loaded into sealed vehicles and to live to the square with their checked a second time.

426
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Wow.

427
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And then sealed in the cages for the release.

428
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 And supposedly they were all checked at the Uitan City Sports Centre in Beijing and the whole process was videotaped.

429
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 So someone has a tape this event happened.

430
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Wow.

431
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Yeah.

432
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Appigeons are big worry.

433
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Are they prone to treachery in China?

434
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 No idea.

435
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 But we have covered on the podcast before that they were used to smuggle messages and...

436
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Wasn't it to steal grain as well?

437
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Yes, and to steal grain.

438
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 They used to steal grain from the imperial granary.

439
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Yeah, you fly them in.

440
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 They eat the grain.

441
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 You fly them out and then you squeeze them and they have to throw up the grain.

442
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 I think you feed them like alamo or something and they throw it up.

443
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Ah, okay.

444
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 You just can't we use them.

445
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 No, no, no.

446
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Yeah.

447
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 So this is something that happens.

448
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 So how many pigeons are they releasing on their national day?

449
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 100,000.

450
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Okay, wow.

451
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 I know that China is...

452
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 The military has been training up pigeons.

453
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 It's been training up 10,000 pigeons to use as a reserve pigeon army.

454
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 So that would be like by military communications and the event of an attack.

455
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 And in the event of an invasion, apparently they want pigeons to carry stuff back and forth.

456
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 So they can only carry 100 grams of stuff, I think.

457
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 But if you put a...

458
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 If you put something on a USB, you can communicate a lot of stuff.

459
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Oh, you get 100 grams.

460
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Really good point.

461
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 That's true.

462
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Really good point.

463
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 So yeah, I wondered if those pigeons they were releasing were...

464
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Was that part of the training?

465
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Yeah.

466
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 But the interesting thing is, you know when you release pigeons and doves at weddings and things like that?

467
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Yeah, they're homing pigeons normally.

468
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 So they fly around and when they're fluttering around, beautifully around the venue or whatever.

469
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 They're actually just getting their bearings.

470
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Where the hell am I?

471
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 And then they shoot off in one particular direction.

472
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 That is them heading home.

473
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 That's a good business model, isn't it?

474
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 It's a really good business model.

475
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Because they're reusable.

476
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Yeah, exactly.

477
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

478
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And you don't need to transport them home?

479
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 No, exactly.

480
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Yeah.

481
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Someone who released 100 white pigeons very recently turns out as a massive pigeon lover, Mike Tyson.

482
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Oh, yeah.

483
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 No idea.

484
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Mike Tyson loves pigeons.

485
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 He actually says that the reason he became a boxer was as a result of one of his pigeons.

486
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Because his pigeon was killed by a local bully.

487
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 And the local bully really like mauled one of his favorite pigeons.

488
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And so he got into a fight with him and that's where he discovered he was a great fighter.

489
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Imagine killing a pigeon and finding out it belonged to Mike Tyson.

490
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Oh, my God.

491
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 By the time he didn't know that he was Mike Tyson.

492
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Mike Tyson didn't even know he was Mike Tyson.

493
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Imagine that discovery.

494
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 He don't want to be the one he discovers it on.

495
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Exactly.

496
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Public Picasso as well.

497
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 He was a pigeon fancier.

498
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I'll see.

499
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And he named his daughter Paloma.

500
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 And Paloma is the Spanish for pigeon.

501
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Really?

502
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Wow.

503
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 So he named his daughter Pigeon.

504
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 But he also named one of his pigeon's daughter.

505
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 And then he got very confusing when his will was read.

506
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 So Pigeons are so good at getting home.

507
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And we don't know how, really.

508
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 But we do know they have amounts.

509
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 They have a little bit of magnetic iron ore in their beaks.

510
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Cool.

511
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 And that helps them to sense the earth's magnetic field.

512
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 And they also use their eyesight for the final stages of a journey.

513
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 And we know this because of a guy called Charlie Walcott.

514
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Who he has spent 40 years attaching radio transmitters to Pigeons

515
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 and then following them in a single engine plane to see them navigate.

516
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 And to see them go.

517
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 You can imagine this terrified Pigeon saying he's still coming up.

518
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Wow.

519
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 It sounds like that old cartoon with dastardly and muttly in his hands.

520
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 And he puts frosted contact lenses on Pigeons.

521
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 And then lets them fly home just to test whether they use their eyesight.

522
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 And they get most of the way to all time using the magnetic field and other things

523
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 that we don't know about.

524
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 But then towards the end they got confused.

525
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And that's how we know that they need visual landmarks.

526
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Just for the end.

527
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Like having an autopilot on for the main flight and then for the landing.

528
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Yeah, but they're also using some Pigeons have been found

529
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 to be observing the use of roads and roundabouts.

530
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 It's amazing.

531
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 It's so cool.

532
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 So a Pigeon will be flying above a road.

533
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 It'll hit around about.

534
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 And if it was going to go left, it won't go left until it's gone around the roundabout.

535
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And then it takes the appropriate...

536
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 No, which way to go round the roundabout because I struggle if I'm driving in Italy for instance.

537
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 No, which way to go round the roundabout.

538
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Maybe it is to avoid Italy.

539
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 But what I mean is they must be following the cars, right?

540
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Yeah, the cars go round.

541
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Maybe it's the heat of the cars or something like that.

542
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Yeah.

543
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Yeah.

544
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 But the dove releases they day back to the middle ages because they used to have religious plays.

545
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 And Noah would release a dove from the arc.

546
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Of course, yeah.

547
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 And I read this in a book about medieval theatre.

548
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 To stage the bit where the dove comes back.

549
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 They'd either use a dummy bird or they'd just attach a string to the real bird.

550
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Just sort of put it back.

551
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Oh my god.

552
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 It's not going to look that natural, is it?

553
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 What are you up to?

554
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 This flapping frantically dumb.

555
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Allid naturally returns.

556
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And it's got the olive branch, salutate to it.

557
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Pigeons are one of only three birds, aren't they?

558
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 They produce milk for their offspring.

559
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Wow.

560
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 So pigeons, emperor penguins, I think, and flamingos.

561
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 And they produce it in the, is it the cries called crop milk?

562
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 And the crop is like this pouch in the back of their throat, I think,

563
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 where they, a few days before they give birth, they start making this milk.

564
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And they sometimes stop eating to make sure that there's not indigestible grain stuck in the milk

565
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 that the baby can't digest.

566
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 But I really like the fact that they sort of adjust the milk and turn it into baby food

567
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 as the scrub gets a little bit older.

568
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Is it actual milk?

569
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 I don't think it is.

570
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 I'm not sure if it even contains lactose, it might do.

571
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 But could you get pigeon cheese, is what I'm saying?

572
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Right.

573
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 I read that the milk in quotation marks from pigeons contains more protein and fat than both human and cows.

574
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Oh, yeah, it does.

575
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 So if we did get a cheese.

576
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 On healthy cheese.

577
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Maybe that's where we haven't done it.

578
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 I think of a whole range of reasons why we haven't made cheese from pigeons.

579
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I get a bit iffy about ghost cheese.

580
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Never mind pigeon cheese.

581
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 The Pope has had to, since he often releases does.

582
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 He's had to replace them now with balloons.

583
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Because birds kept attacking the doves.

584
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 So in 2014 he did it.

585
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 And a seagull and a crow attacked the doves very fiercely.

586
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 And his children letting them go.

587
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 So it's immensely traumatising for the children as well.

588
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And then also in 2013, this is when we had Pope Benedict.

589
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 That release was also ruined when a seagull attacked the dove and pinned it against a window pane.

590
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 And then the year before that, he was releasing two doves.

591
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And one of them perched beside the pope and didn't move.

592
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 And then the second dove immediately flew back into his apartment.

593
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And the article I was reading about it just said to his credit,

594
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Pope Benedict seemed to shout "Mama Mia" in surprise.

595
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 So this was Pope Benedict.

596
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Because Pope Benedict was German, right?

597
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 It's like he's moved to the Vatican and picked up the lingo.

598
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Well, you know what they say?

599
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Wedding Rome.

600
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 You know that all RAF bomber planes used to carry a pigeon as standard.

601
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 How come?

602
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 They crashed in the sea.

603
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 They would release a pigeon.

604
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 And they would attach the coordinates of where they had crashed into the sea.

605
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 And loads and loads of pilots and other crew on the planes were saved.

606
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Well, they're really.

607
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 That's really cool.

608
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 I can't believe this. They were on submarines.

609
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Wow.

610
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 And some paratroopers had a pigeon in a sling on their chest.

611
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Wow.

612
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Yeah.

613
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 A lot of these pigeons were given the Dickon medal, which is no word for like brave animals

614
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 by the P.D.S.A.

615
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 And I think more pigeons have had that award than anyone.

616
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Yeah.

617
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 I have a list of medal-winning pigeons in the second world war.

618
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Okay.

619
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 They included Tyke, Gustav, Paddy, Billy, Mary, Princess, Commando, Scotch Lass and William of Orange.

620
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 It was Commando the naked one.

621
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 It also sounds like William of Orange has got the wrong list of your things.

622
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 I also have a list of Kings of England.

623
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 It is Henry VIII.

624
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 James II.

625
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 No Minky.

626
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Okay. That's it.

627
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 That's all of our facts.

628
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
