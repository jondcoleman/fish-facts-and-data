00:00:12,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden."
00:00:20,00:00:25,"My name is Dan Treiber. I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, James Harkin and Anichezinski."
00:00:25,00:00:33,"And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:33,00:00:40,"Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact. My fact this week is that Guantanamo Bay has a gift shop."
00:00:40,00:00:42,Pretty inappropriate.
00:00:42,00:00:46,Do we know if the prisoners can buy gifts? Is it like they get let out once a week?
00:00:46,00:00:58,They sell files and they sell wire cushers and things like that. Now I've got a list of some of the things I do sell. So Fidel Castro standing on a boom box with text reading rockin in Fidel's backyard.
00:00:58,00:01:06,"You can get golf balls, you can get candles, you can get a plush banana rat, which is a type of rat that they have on Guantanamo Bay."
00:01:06,00:01:13,"So there's banana rats everywhere on Guantanamo Bay. Otherwise known as Hutia, you would normally call them Hutia, but they call them banana rats."
00:01:13,00:01:17,But you know why they're called banana rats? They're shaped like a banana.
00:01:17,00:01:21,They eat bananas. They're radioactive. They're very easy to peel.
00:01:21,00:01:28,What is it? They don't really have legs.
00:01:28,00:01:37,"No, the reason is that they are called banana rats because their feces look like small versions of the fruit."
00:01:37,00:01:45,That's cool. That's very interesting. So I've been named after the shape of my poo.
00:01:45,00:01:49,"Not after that. Well you just be called poo, wouldn't you?"
00:01:49,00:01:55,"No, you could be like raisins or skyscraper."
00:01:55,00:02:05,"You could be anything, couldn't it? Well that's a cool fact. I really like that."
00:02:05,00:02:13,Also they have teddy bears that you have cropped T-shirts and they read it don't get more better than this.
00:02:13,00:02:19,"It's pretty crazy. They've got things like Baskin Robbins there, the ice cream shop, they've got McDonald's, there's a subway, KFC, Pizza Hut."
00:02:19,00:02:27,"I really like when you hear about military compounds or places, when you hear something out of place, Andy has a great fact about the CIA."
00:02:27,00:02:37,"It's the Starbucks in Langley, Virginia, the headquarters of the CIA. The baristas are not allowed to write customers names on the cups."
00:02:37,00:02:43,Actually if you went Starbucks and they said what name is it and you said skyscraper.
00:02:43,00:02:51,"That's an unusual name, where do you get that? So Quentano Bay is on Cuba, obviously."
00:02:51,00:03:01,But it's rented from the Cuban government except that Fidel Castro says that he never cashes the checks.
00:03:01,00:03:07,"He says he's cashed one of them once and it was by mistake. It was $4,000 a month."
00:03:07,00:03:13,He's holding them all up and then one day he's going to cash them all and hopefully bankrupt.
00:03:13,00:03:17,"He has, isn't there a rumor that he stores them all in a draw in his office desk?"
00:03:17,00:03:21,"Yes, he showed them off in a TV interview once."
00:03:21,00:03:27,He says that the only one that got cash was in 1959 during the actual Cuban revolution when it was a bit confusing.
00:03:27,00:03:31,A mistake in the payroll department or something like that.
00:03:31,00:03:37,Why is Fidel? I'm really confused on my bank run that time.
00:03:37,00:03:41,"He also claims that the checks are made out to the Treasury General of the Republic,"
00:03:41,00:03:45,which is apparently a position that ceased to exist after the revolution in 1959.
00:03:45,00:03:49,So this is a pre-revolutionary arrangement that clearly they haven't updated them on.
00:03:49,00:03:53,Guantanamo also has an Irish bar.
00:03:53,00:03:59,"He has an Irish bar called O'Kelly's Irish Bar, which claims to be the only Irish bar on Communist soil."
00:03:59,00:04:03,So I thought I'd see if I could find any other Irish bars on Communist soil.
00:04:03,00:04:07,"And there is Hoolie's Irish Bar in Guangzhou, China."
00:04:07,00:04:11,"Gary's Irish pub in Vien Tien, in Lao."
00:04:11,00:04:15,And Bernie's Irish Bar restaurant in Saigon.
00:04:15,00:04:17,"Well done, so it's lying. They're lying, yeah."
00:04:17,00:04:19,A lie coming out of Guantanamo.
00:04:19,00:04:21,Who would have thought it?
00:04:21,00:04:23,That's if that's what takes them down.
00:04:23,00:04:27,You know there's a version of Guantanamo Bay on Second Life.
00:04:27,00:04:29,Is there a really?
00:04:29,00:04:33,"Yeah, a couple of activists built it to show people what it is like there basically."
00:04:33,00:04:35,Because obviously you're not normally allowed to go there.
00:04:35,00:04:39,It's forbidden for people who are not in the military or with very few exceptions.
00:04:39,00:04:41,So they have constructed one.
00:04:41,00:04:45,People can volunteer to experience virtual prison there to see what it's like.
00:04:45,00:04:46,Wow.
00:04:46,00:04:48,"Is that, do you see what it's like, do you think?"
00:04:48,00:04:51,"No, obviously, there's only so much you can really experience from your home."
00:04:51,00:04:55,But it shows you the layout and it shows you what exactly what happens.
00:04:55,00:04:57,Can I tell you one more thing about Second Life?
00:04:57,00:05:01,"Yeah, there's an actual prison on Second Life for people who, you know,"
00:05:01,00:05:07,"hacking into the world itself or sort of into the game or being other, you know, digitally naughty, basically."
00:05:07,00:05:13,And supposedly it consists of just a moonlit field full of corn which goes on forever.
00:05:13,00:05:17,"And the only things you can do in it, there's a tractor that you can ride slowly."
00:05:17,00:05:23,Or there's a black and white TV playing a film from 1940 as the only things you can do in Second Life prison.
00:05:23,00:05:24,Wow.
00:05:24,00:05:25,How cool is that?
00:05:25,00:05:26,That sounds great.
00:05:26,00:05:27,Jimmy Carr.
00:05:27,00:05:32,"So for any overseas listeners, a big comedian in Britain, he did a gig in Second Life."
00:05:32,00:05:33,Wow.
00:05:33,00:05:34,"Yeah, and it was a live gig."
00:05:34,00:05:37,"And during it, he's just standing there as a Second Life Jimmy Carr."
00:05:37,00:05:38,Yeah.
00:05:38,00:05:43,"And you know, when you play those games like Golden Eye and you end up just running into the wall and bashing against the wall."
00:05:43,00:05:46,A lot of his audience members don't quite know if they stay still.
00:05:46,00:05:52,"So while he's telling jokes, they're just walking past him, smashing into walls, flipping over in front of him."
00:05:52,00:05:53,That's very funny.
00:05:53,00:05:54,Yeah.
00:05:54,00:05:58,"I was looking into, because I was just thinking of famous gift shops I know of."
00:05:58,00:06:00,And one that I went to not too long ago.
00:06:00,00:06:02,And I think you can qualify as a gift shop.
00:06:02,00:06:04,It's the Sherlock Holmes shop.
00:06:04,00:06:06,And it's in Baker Street.
00:06:06,00:06:09,And I didn't realize that it's not at 221B Baker Street.
00:06:09,00:06:12,"When Conan Doyle wrote the Sherlock stories, that didn't exist."
00:06:12,00:06:14,That the road didn't go that far up.
00:06:14,00:06:15,Right.
00:06:15,00:06:17,And so they've since built this bigger road.
00:06:17,00:06:18,There's a 20 there.
00:06:18,00:06:22,It was Abby Nationals. So Abby Nationals was situated at 221B Baker Street.
00:06:22,00:06:27,"And as a result, they hired someone to answer all mail to Sherlock Holmes."
00:06:27,00:06:29,I went for the gift.
00:06:29,00:06:32,They just wrote back offering them very good personal works.
00:06:32,00:06:39,"I'm afraid I can't help you find your wife, but I can't help you find a great deal on your insurance."
00:06:39,00:06:47,"But so what ended up happening was in 1990, a blue plaque went up outside the museum saying that that was now 221B."
00:06:47,00:06:49,And so mail started going there.
00:06:49,00:06:55,And that started a 15 year dispute between Abby Nationals and the Sherlock Holmes Museum about who was 221B.
00:06:55,00:06:56,Right.
00:06:56,00:06:57,And now Abby Nationals closed.
00:06:57,00:07:00,And now 221B technically is the museum.
00:07:00,00:07:02,Despite the fact it's at 239.
00:07:02,00:07:05,So are we 221B or not 221B?
00:07:05,00:07:08,That's just a question.
00:07:08,00:07:12,Have you heard the thing about the souvenir coins they've just done for Waterloo?
00:07:12,00:07:13,No.
00:07:13,00:07:14,It is so cool.
00:07:14,00:07:19,And so Belgium wanted to do these special commemorative coins for the Battle of Waterloo.
00:07:19,00:07:22,There's a famous statue of a lion.
00:07:22,00:07:25,And they wanted to have that on it.
00:07:25,00:07:27,"And they made 180,000 of these."
00:07:27,00:07:31,But France forced them to stop because basically other EU countries get a veto over it.
00:07:31,00:07:33,And France is a bit sensitive about Waterloo.
00:07:33,00:07:37,So the French said that it will create a bad reaction in France and you shouldn't do this.
00:07:37,00:07:45,"But the Belgians found a rule, a tiny, tiny rule in the book, saying that any country can issue its own coins if they're in a regular denomination."
00:07:45,00:07:49,"And so they have just made 70,000, 2.5 euro coins."
00:07:49,00:07:51,So wow.
00:07:51,00:07:53,With the design they wanted.
00:07:53,00:07:54,"Oh, cool."
00:07:54,00:07:55,Yeah. And you can spend them across Belgium.
00:07:55,00:07:56,Can you actually?
00:07:56,00:07:57,Yeah.
00:07:57,00:07:59,So they have monetary value. That's so cool.
00:07:59,00:08:05,"So when the Duke of Wellington died, all of his locks of hair were cut off to make souvenirs for people."
00:08:05,00:08:08,Including the Queen and loads and loads of people.
00:08:08,00:08:09,"Ah, that's right."
00:08:09,00:08:14,"Because people did use to just take weird souvenirs from all sorts of things, didn't they?"
00:08:14,00:08:16,It wasn't like in the olden days you wouldn't have gift shops.
00:08:16,00:08:19,"People would just go and nick stuff, basically."
00:08:19,00:08:26,"But Mark Twain wrote that when he went to Egypt, all he could hear was the tinkling sound of Tak Hammers as people chipped away at the monuments."
00:08:26,00:08:27,Wow.
00:08:27,00:08:31,So he just go to the pyramids and people would just be taking bits off all the time.
00:08:31,00:08:32,That's all you could hear.
00:08:32,00:08:33,Really?
00:08:33,00:08:36,Do you know what would be amazing is if the pyramids were actually square?
00:08:36,00:08:39,(Laughter)
00:08:39,00:08:41,This is just what was left.
00:08:41,00:08:42,"Yeah, exactly."
00:08:42,00:08:43,"Ah, that's amazing."
00:08:43,00:08:44,"Ah, that bet that's true."
00:08:44,00:08:46,Is it true that they were covered in marble?
00:08:46,00:08:47,That is true.
00:08:47,00:08:48,Wow. That's astonishing.
00:08:48,00:08:49,I'm just seeing them back then.
00:08:49,00:08:52,"Yeah. So what we see now, that used to have a marble casing around it."
00:08:52,00:08:53,"Yeah, they used to be really shiny."
00:08:53,00:08:55,So it was like being pebble dashed.
00:08:55,00:08:56,Yeah.
00:08:56,00:08:58,"But more classy, I think."
00:08:58,00:09:02,I have a thing about souvenirs that are being taken that shouldn't be taken.
00:09:02,00:09:03,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:03,00:09:07,"So lots of people when they go to Uluru, formerly as rock in Australia,"
00:09:07,00:09:12,will chip off a bit to take home as with Stonehenger or as with other places or as with the pyramids.
00:09:12,00:09:16,But there's an increasing trend of people posting them back because they feel really apologetic.
00:09:16,00:09:17,"Oh, wow."
00:09:17,00:09:18,They suffer bad luck in their life.
00:09:18,00:09:21,"And they think, well, it must be because I took that rock from Uluru and so they post it back."
00:09:21,00:09:23,And they get about one every day.
00:09:23,00:09:26,"But the thing is, they return to the National Park."
00:09:26,00:09:30,"But before they get back to the National Park, they are quarantined."
00:09:30,00:09:33,"Somewhere in Australia, there is a rock quarantine."
00:09:33,00:09:36,"In case they've caught a disease, well, they've been in broad."
00:09:36,00:09:40,"Basically, in case they have, as they say on the website, they say the threat of micro pathogens"
00:09:40,00:09:42,being introduced by contaminated rocks from elsewhere.
00:09:42,00:09:45,"The bacteria can affect rocks, don't they?"
00:09:45,00:09:46,"Yeah, genetically."
00:09:46,00:09:49,"They can change the chemical composition of rocks, definitely."
00:09:49,00:09:55,But what's the fallout if you introduced a rock to Australia?
00:09:55,00:09:59,"I don't know, maybe there's a spore or something which could wipe out a native plant."
00:09:59,00:10:00,"Wow, okay."
00:10:00,00:10:02,"I mean, they're just being ultra careful."
00:10:02,00:10:03,But I just think that's the funniest thing.
00:10:03,00:10:06,"I mean, it's a barren desert where Uluru is."
00:10:06,00:10:09,Or if they don't like non-native species coming in.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"Do they say, what if there's like a fox on the underside of the rocks?"
00:10:11,00:10:12,Yeah.
00:10:12,00:10:13,No one's seeing it.
00:10:13,00:10:14,It's true.
00:10:14,00:10:16,It's just like you know.
00:10:16,00:10:18,You're going to be careful of these kind of things.
00:10:18,00:10:22,I have just imagined they put the rock back on Uluru and then go home.
00:10:22,00:10:25,And then the next day they come and it's disappeared.
00:10:25,00:10:28,"That's just a note saying, suck it in."
00:10:28,00:10:35,"Yours, Mr. Fox."
00:10:35,00:10:38,Time for fact number two and that is Chazinski.
00:10:38,00:10:42,"Yeah, my fact is that the Natural History Museum is turning Moth's gay"
00:10:42,00:10:46,to stop them destroying the exhibits.
00:10:46,00:10:47,Yeah.
00:10:47,00:10:48,What?
00:10:48,00:10:50,"Well, they've got a Moth problem."
00:10:50,00:10:52,They are destroying exhibits in the Natural History Museum.
00:10:52,00:10:56,"So they, in the Natural History Museum, a lot of like things that have fur or feathers"
00:10:56,00:10:58,"or things like that on it, I think Moth's are using it."
00:10:58,00:11:01,"So it's not a lot of these things they can't eat, but they like destroy it"
00:11:01,00:11:03,and then make little nests out of it.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"And yeah, so it's a problem."
00:11:05,00:11:06,It's destroying the exhibits.
00:11:06,00:11:09,And so they are using female hormones.
00:11:09,00:11:14,"They're covering male, Moths and female hormones to try and make other male Moths attracted to them"
00:11:14,00:11:17,so that they waste all their shagging time trying to shag another male.
00:11:17,00:11:18,And they fail.
00:11:18,00:11:22,They fail to release you.
00:11:22,00:11:27,"Sorry, I've just spent an hour and a half on that other male."
00:11:27,00:11:32,"I was reading about, because it's not just a Natural History Museum that's had this problem."
00:11:32,00:11:34,Lots of other museums have this problem.
00:11:34,00:11:40,And it turns out that there's one man who they call in to sort out all of their issues
00:11:40,00:11:44,and he's known as Bug Man and his name is David Pinager.
00:11:44,00:11:48,"And I don't know if he's being brought in for the Natural History Museum in this case,"
00:11:48,00:11:52,"but he is the man who you bring in when there's a Moth problem, when there's any kind of insect problem."
00:11:52,00:11:55,And he's been giving talks for years.
00:11:55,00:12:01,"The VNA, he gave a talk a few years ago, which was called Bug, which stood for beating unwanted guests."
00:12:01,00:12:03,So this goes back as far as--
00:12:03,00:12:08,Sounds like a talk for the security guards in the museum.
00:12:08,00:12:11,That was a talk given in 1993 at the VNA.
00:12:11,00:12:15,"So this has been a problem since 1993, and they've been trying to combat it in so many different ways."
00:12:15,00:12:21,"There are lots of fruit growing places, possibly orchards, actually, I think about it,"
00:12:21,00:12:24,"which have had the same problem with Moths, and they've used the same solution."
00:12:24,00:12:26,They've also tried turning them gay.
00:12:26,00:12:28,"Or sort of, because it's not quite turning them gay, is it?"
00:12:28,00:12:31,"They're still straight, but it's disguising males."
00:12:31,00:12:32,Disguised females.
00:12:32,00:12:36,"At the Pit Rivers Museum, they did a thing where they had a glue board,"
00:12:36,00:12:42,"and they put the pheromones of equivalent 1,000 female moths onto this glue board."
00:12:42,00:12:46,"So all these moths were just going, ""Whoa, ladies!"""
00:12:46,00:12:48,And then they were flying that way and just getting stuck to it.
00:12:48,00:12:52,"He showed us 1,000 ladies, because it kind of looks a bit like a blue bottle."
00:12:52,00:12:56,"Oh, he smelt them, oh my god."
00:12:56,00:12:58,"It's so-- it's such a-- it's really funny, isn't it?"
00:12:58,00:12:59,"Yeah, it is."
00:12:59,00:13:00,I can't believe it.
00:13:00,00:13:01,"Dover Castle, as well, sorry."
00:13:01,00:13:02,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:02,00:13:04,"Dover Castle, as well, had a thing, which was--"
00:13:04,00:13:10,"They realised that all these insects, all these moths were being attracted to certain wall hangings,"
00:13:10,00:13:14,because the dye that was used in the paintings were mainly crushed insects.
00:13:14,00:13:17,"And weirdly, that was an attraction to them."
00:13:17,00:13:21,"Yeah, they smelt dead insects, basically, and so they were attracted to that."
00:13:21,00:13:23,So they had an issue with that at Dover Castle.
00:13:23,00:13:28,"Apparently, 85% of male insects engage in homosexual acts, but mostly it's accidental."
00:13:28,00:13:33,"They just mate in the hope that they're mating with a female, but it doesn't really matter."
00:13:33,00:13:34,No.
00:13:34,00:13:36,And there are loads of theories as to why.
00:13:36,00:13:39,So some people think that it's to practice mating.
00:13:39,00:13:41,Or some people think it's to dominate other males.
00:13:41,00:13:48,"But flower beetles, they do this a lot, and they found that it doesn't improve their success rate with females."
00:13:48,00:13:54,"But if a male leaks semen on another male, and that other male later breeds with a female,"
00:13:54,00:13:58,the female's eggs can be fertilised by the sperm of the male that she never encountered.
00:13:58,00:14:00,"And it's called sex by proxy, isn't it?"
00:14:00,00:14:01,"Yeah, exactly."
00:14:01,00:14:04,"And it's the article about it, so that males can inseminate females, quotes,"
00:14:04,00:14:09,"""Without expending time or energy having sex with them, result."""
00:14:09,00:14:13,But it doesn't fly that the males just really want to have sex with the other males.
00:14:13,00:14:14,And so they'd rather...
00:14:14,00:14:18,"Because I was out, and I thought, ""They're expending time and energy mating with a male."""
00:14:18,00:14:21,Surely you might as well just do it directly.
00:14:21,00:14:24,It seems a bit of a roundabout way of doing it.
00:14:24,00:14:29,"Do you guys know the only other animal where a percentage chooses exclusively to have homosexual sex,"
00:14:29,00:14:33,even though there are members of the opposite sex available to them?
00:14:33,00:14:34,And that's domestic sheep.
00:14:34,00:14:35,Oh!
00:14:35,00:14:40,And I think it is 8% of male domestic sheep.
00:14:40,00:14:45,"We'll choose to have sex with another male sheep rather than a female, which is weird, isn't it?"
00:14:45,00:14:50,"What is weird about sheep is that if you're a female sheep and you're going to have sex,"
00:14:50,00:14:55,"what you do is basically stand perfectly still, and then the ram comes and mounts you."
00:14:55,00:15:00,"But if you have two lesbian sheep and they both want to have sex with each other,"
00:15:00,00:15:02,they naturally will just stand perfectly still.
00:15:02,00:15:05,"So they're just kind of stuck there, kind of looking at each other going,"
00:15:05,00:15:07,"""Well, are you going to do something or am I?"""
00:15:07,00:15:09,That makes it very difficult to spot lesbian sheep.
00:15:09,00:15:12,She's just not making the first move I've been wrong.
00:15:12,00:15:17,Do they have to get a friend in the end to just lift them up and force them together?
00:15:17,00:15:21,"Like, ""Oh, guys, enough of this pussy fitting around."""
00:15:21,00:15:26,"I was reading about a moth, obviously, they're preyed on by bats."
00:15:26,00:15:28,That's a thing you have to watch out for if you're a moth.
00:15:28,00:15:34,"They've learned to create a sound, which says that there were different, much more disgusting tasting moth."
00:15:34,00:15:35,Really?
00:15:35,00:15:39,"Yeah, so they pretend to be the disgusting tasting moth that they know bats don't go for,"
00:15:39,00:15:42,and then the bats don't go for them as a result.
00:15:42,00:15:45,"So they mimic the sound, and as a result, yeah."
00:15:45,00:15:48,"It would be safer to mimic the sound of like a lion or something, wouldn't it?"
00:15:48,00:15:52,"But if you do get a really hungry bat, that's taken that bit further."
00:15:52,00:15:56,"That means every animal in the whole world should sound like a lion, yes."
00:15:56,00:15:57,Why don't they?
00:15:57,00:16:02,"Okay, but you're from a lion which disguises itself as, you know, an offensive clump of grass."
00:16:02,00:16:06,Or a bit of Uluru Rock.
00:16:06,00:16:08,Here's a thing though.
00:16:08,00:16:13,You've heard on something which is that there is an actual moth called the Asian Corn Borer
00:16:13,00:16:17,who mimics the sound of a bat to freak out females.
00:16:17,00:16:20,"And when they hear it, they freeze in fear."
00:16:20,00:16:25,"And because the Asian Corn Borer is terrible at sex, it uses this sound to freeze the female"
00:16:25,00:16:28,so that he can use the opportunity to mate with her.
00:16:28,00:16:30,It's for a Hypno in the moth world.
00:16:30,00:16:32,"It's the Hypno of the moth world, yeah."
00:16:32,00:16:33,Yeah.
00:16:33,00:16:34,So here's a thing.
00:16:34,00:16:40,"You know the word ""gather rope"" is like an old French word for a toilet."
00:16:40,00:16:41,Okay.
00:16:41,00:16:44,"That's where the word ""wildrobe"" comes from."
00:16:44,00:16:51,"And one theory as to why that, why that change happened is because you would keep your clothes in a toilet"
00:16:51,00:16:54,because a smell was so bad it would keep moths away.
00:16:54,00:16:55,Really?
00:16:55,00:16:59,"Also, all your clothes would smell like a toilet all the time."
00:16:59,00:17:00,Really?
00:17:00,00:17:02,"I mean, I think it's the theory I'm not sure it's true."
00:17:02,00:17:06,"You know how James, you insist on ordering a penino when you go into a cafe rather than penini?"
00:17:06,00:17:07,I do indeed.
00:17:07,00:17:08,Right.
00:17:08,00:17:13,"In the same vein, do you also use the ""gather rope"" wardrobe thing to excuse the fact that you piss in the wardrobe all the time?"
00:17:13,00:17:20,"I'm like, etymologically speaking, it's fine."
00:17:20,00:17:25,Something wrong.
00:17:25,00:17:29,"Okay, time for fact number three and that is James."
00:17:29,00:17:40,"Okay, my fact this week is that the word ""marveless"" has fallen in use from 155 times per million 20 years ago to only 2 times per million today."
00:17:40,00:17:45,"So every 500,000 words you say one of them will be ""marveless""."
00:17:45,00:17:46,Wow.
00:17:46,00:17:51,"If anyone says society isn't in decline, then I think we've just proved them here."
00:17:51,00:17:55,"Yeah, so just about language changing and stuff and it's a bit of a shame."
00:17:55,00:17:59,"I think the word ""marveless"" is quite a good word and I think it's a shame we're not using it anymore."
00:17:59,00:18:00,"Yeah, yeah."
00:18:00,00:18:06,"With that kind of disappearance that it's like achieving right now, are we going to lose it?"
00:18:06,00:18:09,"I don't think we'll lose it, but it's just become old fashioned really."
00:18:09,00:18:13,"But I think there is hope for ""marveless"" because words go up and down, don't they?"
00:18:13,00:18:26,"So the use of the word ""marveless"" had its peak in 1886 and it's been declining pretty steadily since then I think, except 1918 to 1925 was looking at a graph, had a big peak suddenly."
00:18:26,00:18:29,That was finished.
00:18:29,00:18:32,"Things are a bit more ""marveless"" than they were."
00:18:32,00:18:40,"And then suddenly, ""Oh, this Hitler guy is looking a little bit rowdy for my liking, he's not looking very ""marveless""."
00:18:40,00:18:44,"So ""marveless"" used to be a lot stronger. It used to mean something that caused wonder."
00:18:44,00:18:47,"So it was a lot stronger than ""marveless""."
00:18:47,00:18:48,"Yeah, exactly."
00:18:48,00:18:53,"Yeah, don't steal the meaning of the word ""wonderful"" and it should be ticked to ""marveless""."
00:18:53,00:18:54,It's a war between the words.
00:18:54,00:18:58,"""Wonderful"" used to mean ""marveless"" because you're ""marvel""."
00:18:58,00:19:08,So this all comes from a thing called the Spoken British National Corpus of 2014 and that's done by Cambridge University Press and Lancaster University.
00:19:08,00:19:16,And they take a whole load of kind of books and conversations and all that kind of thing and they work out how often words are used.
00:19:16,00:19:19,"And then there's a load of press releases, one of which I saw this week."
00:19:19,00:19:29,I'm really suspicious about this project that they're on because they're asking for people to donate recorded tapes of their conversations every day and stuff.
00:19:29,00:19:34,So they say we're calling for people to send us MP3 files of their everyday informal conversations in exchange for a small payment.
00:19:34,00:19:38,And is this just MI5 kind of being more obvious?
00:19:38,00:19:41,Can you record yourself talking about threats to Britain's national security?
00:19:41,00:19:46,There's a lot of that vocabulary that's very specialised and we really need it.
00:19:46,00:19:52,"Send it in, we'll give you a fiver and a short stint in 'Grantanimo Bale' is an obligatory shot."
00:19:52,00:19:56,So the other conclusions that they came to are the words that they said were going in an out of fashion.
00:19:56,00:20:02,They said that the word 'chirio' has yet to appear in conversations from this decade which is a bit sad.
00:20:02,00:20:05,They said that old people still use it but not young ones.
00:20:05,00:20:13,"So I was looking, you know, Google does has this amazing tool which I've just wasted so many hours of my life on where I can't even remember what the oral is."
00:20:13,00:20:20,But look up Google word tracker and it tracks the use of words over the last 200 years in all Google books.
00:20:20,00:20:23,"And when they, you know, how often words are mentioned."
00:20:23,00:20:27,So the word loser reached its peak in 1807.
00:20:27,00:20:30,Whatever made you think I'm looking at that one.
00:20:30,00:20:32,You knew you were going to be hanging out with us.
00:20:32,00:20:34,You know you looked for loser.
00:20:34,00:20:37,"A couple of other good, good spikes."
00:20:37,00:20:42,So the word 'happy' has been in constant decline since the year 1800 until the year 2000.
00:20:42,00:20:44,And then it's been increasing since then.
00:20:44,00:20:46,And then the 'Forell' song came out.
00:20:46,00:20:48,"Oh, that might have spiked it right up."
00:20:48,00:20:50,And happy feet movie.
00:20:50,00:20:54,I reckon it must bring words back just by popular movies and songs.
00:20:54,00:20:55,"Yes, must be right."
00:20:55,00:20:58,Penis has been in steep decline since 1996.
00:20:58,00:21:00,Tell me about it.
00:21:00,00:21:06,How have I used all my shagging time off in the early 80s?
00:21:06,00:21:11,Is it just that people are using other words?
00:21:11,00:21:12,I assume so.
00:21:12,00:21:15,"It's probably that, yeah, maybe we've diversified in our synonyms."
00:21:15,00:21:17,"Although, actually, we probably haven't."
00:21:17,00:21:19,We've always used countless synonyms for that.
00:21:19,00:21:20,"Yeah, true."
00:21:20,00:21:23,The Jiner had a huge spike in 1880.
00:21:23,00:21:25,When? In when? 1880.
00:21:25,00:21:30,"There was, so literally that one year it was used four times as much as sort of before or since."
00:21:30,00:21:31,In headlines?
00:21:31,00:21:34,"Or there would be no musical song, probably."
00:21:34,00:21:38,"Oh, Mr. Johnson, words by vagina, I think it has come."
00:21:38,00:21:41,Very much the Forels happy of it's time.
00:21:41,00:21:42,Does it say?
00:21:42,00:21:43,Does it say why it's by?
00:21:43,00:21:44,"It doesn't, it can't say why."
00:21:44,00:21:47,It's literally just a stats site that tracks uses in Google Books.
00:21:47,00:21:48,Okay.
00:21:48,00:21:50,"So I have no idea why I put up, you know, if anyone's got any theories."
00:21:50,00:21:51,In Google Books.
00:21:51,00:21:52,"Yeah, that was interesting."
00:21:52,00:21:53,Okay.
00:21:53,00:21:59,The Atlantic Beach Theatre and Comedy Club a couple of years ago was putting on the vagina monologues
00:21:59,00:22:02,but got complaints about using the word vagina.
00:22:02,00:22:09,And so renamed it the Who-Hard number locks.
00:22:09,00:22:10,That's amazing.
00:22:10,00:22:15,Is there one word that you guys use that is not just used in day-to-day language
00:22:15,00:22:18,"that you wish would come back, but you do actually use?"
00:22:18,00:22:22,"Andy, most of the words, Andy, is exactly."
00:22:22,00:22:25,"Well, there is a word, which is, I do really like."
00:22:25,00:22:30,"And it's, you know, megalomania is sort of being, it's insanely thinking are all powerful."
00:22:30,00:22:36,"There is a corresponding word called micromania, which is a tendency to constantly belittle oneself."
00:22:36,00:22:38,Isn't that an incredible word?
00:22:38,00:22:40,"Yeah, it's because it's a very common thing."
00:22:40,00:22:44,"A lot of people, you know, especially sort of supposedly English people are very, very self-deprecating."
00:22:44,00:22:46,"There is a word for it, micromania."
00:22:46,00:22:47,I really like that.
00:22:47,00:22:52,"There are really, I've got some good words, if you like, from the M section of the Tictionary."
00:22:52,00:22:54,"Actually, one related to Moths."
00:22:54,00:22:56,"So, macrolepidoptera, and this is in the OED."
00:22:56,00:23:02,"They are defined as the butterflies in Moths, which are large enough to be of interest to collectors."
00:23:02,00:23:09,"And there's also microlepidoptera, which is the numerous Moths, which are mostly smaller than those of interest to collectors."
00:23:09,00:23:12,I don't know that collectors were so size-ist.
00:23:12,00:23:13,Yeah.
00:23:13,00:23:15,You were the thought that the smart ones might be more precious.
00:23:15,00:23:16,Yeah.
00:23:16,00:23:21,"Thrall in 18th of an inch long, though, is a bit tiresome having to collect them, and you lose them in your pocket."
00:23:21,00:23:22,Yeah.
00:23:22,00:23:24,You could lie about your collection.
00:23:24,00:23:29,"Incredible, so I know you can't see them, but they're extraordinary."
00:23:29,00:23:39,The Mile High Club in the OED is defined as an imaginary association of people who have had sexual intercourse on an aircraft.
00:23:39,00:23:40,That's great.
00:23:40,00:23:42,That is really good.
00:23:42,00:23:47,That's written by someone who's tried and failed.
00:23:47,00:23:50,I don't think I've got one more word that I really like.
00:23:50,00:23:56,"That's a babble event, and it means one who makes feeble jokes."
00:23:56,00:23:57,"Yeah, that's good."
00:23:57,00:23:58,"Yeah, why'd you bring that up?"
00:23:58,00:23:59,Yeah.
00:23:59,00:24:02,Just thought you knew you would be talking to us.
00:24:02,00:24:10,"Okay, time for our final fact, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:24:10,00:24:18,"My fact is that to prepare for China's national day, 100,000 pigeons have anal security checks to make sure they're not carrying anything suspicious."
00:24:18,00:24:23,Like rocks from Australia.
00:24:23,00:24:33,"China's national day is the first of October, and last year with a celebration involved releasing 100,000 pigeons in Tiananmen Square, and they all fly up and fly around."
00:24:33,00:24:34,It's very beautiful.
00:24:34,00:24:46,"This is according to, I think, the people's daily, the sort of government-sponsored newspaper, and a security officer said that they all have to be checked and under their wings and their tail feathers and even their bottoms."
00:24:46,00:24:53,And they are then loaded into sealed vehicles and to live to the square with their checked a second time.
00:24:53,00:24:54,Wow.
00:24:54,00:24:56,And then sealed in the cages for the release.
00:24:56,00:25:02,And supposedly they were all checked at the Uitan City Sports Centre in Beijing and the whole process was videotaped.
00:25:02,00:25:04,So someone has a tape this event happened.
00:25:04,00:25:05,Wow.
00:25:05,00:25:06,Yeah.
00:25:06,00:25:07,Appigeons are big worry.
00:25:07,00:25:09,Are they prone to treachery in China?
00:25:09,00:25:10,No idea.
00:25:10,00:25:15,But we have covered on the podcast before that they were used to smuggle messages and...
00:25:15,00:25:16,Wasn't it to steal grain as well?
00:25:16,00:25:17,"Yes, and to steal grain."
00:25:17,00:25:19,They used to steal grain from the imperial granary.
00:25:19,00:25:20,"Yeah, you fly them in."
00:25:20,00:25:21,They eat the grain.
00:25:21,00:25:23,You fly them out and then you squeeze them and they have to throw up the grain.
00:25:23,00:25:27,I think you feed them like alamo or something and they throw it up.
00:25:27,00:25:28,"Ah, okay."
00:25:28,00:25:29,You just can't we use them.
00:25:29,00:25:30,"No, no, no."
00:25:30,00:25:31,Yeah.
00:25:31,00:25:34,So this is something that happens.
00:25:34,00:25:36,So how many pigeons are they releasing on their national day?
00:25:36,00:25:37,"100,000."
00:25:37,00:25:40,"Okay, wow."
00:25:40,00:25:41,I know that China is...
00:25:41,00:25:43,The military has been training up pigeons.
00:25:43,00:25:47,"It's been training up 10,000 pigeons to use as a reserve pigeon army."
00:25:47,00:25:51,So that would be like by military communications and the event of an attack.
00:25:51,00:25:55,"And in the event of an invasion, apparently they want pigeons to carry stuff back and forth."
00:25:55,00:25:57,"So they can only carry 100 grams of stuff, I think."
00:25:57,00:25:58,But if you put a...
00:25:58,00:26:01,"If you put something on a USB, you can communicate a lot of stuff."
00:26:01,00:26:02,"Oh, you get 100 grams."
00:26:02,00:26:03,Really good point.
00:26:03,00:26:04,That's true.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Really good point.
00:26:05,00:26:08,"So yeah, I wondered if those pigeons they were releasing were..."
00:26:08,00:26:09,Was that part of the training?
00:26:09,00:26:10,Yeah.
00:26:10,00:26:14,"But the interesting thing is, you know when you release pigeons and doves at weddings and things like that?"
00:26:14,00:26:16,"Yeah, they're homing pigeons normally."
00:26:16,00:26:21,"So they fly around and when they're fluttering around, beautifully around the venue or whatever."
00:26:21,00:26:23,They're actually just getting their bearings.
00:26:23,00:26:24,Where the hell am I?
00:26:24,00:26:26,And then they shoot off in one particular direction.
00:26:26,00:26:27,That is them heading home.
00:26:27,00:26:29,"That's a good business model, isn't it?"
00:26:29,00:26:30,It's a really good business model.
00:26:30,00:26:32,Because they're reusable.
00:26:32,00:26:33,"Yeah, exactly."
00:26:33,00:26:34,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:26:34,00:26:36,And you don't need to transport them home?
00:26:36,00:26:37,"No, exactly."
00:26:37,00:26:38,Yeah.
00:26:38,00:26:45,"Someone who released 100 white pigeons very recently turns out as a massive pigeon lover, Mike Tyson."
00:26:45,00:26:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:46,00:26:47,No idea.
00:26:47,00:26:48,Mike Tyson loves pigeons.
00:26:48,00:26:53,He actually says that the reason he became a boxer was as a result of one of his pigeons.
00:26:53,00:26:57,Because his pigeon was killed by a local bully.
00:26:57,00:27:01,And the local bully really like mauled one of his favorite pigeons.
00:27:01,00:27:05,And so he got into a fight with him and that's where he discovered he was a great fighter.
00:27:05,00:27:08,Imagine killing a pigeon and finding out it belonged to Mike Tyson.
00:27:08,00:27:09,"Oh, my God."
00:27:09,00:27:12,By the time he didn't know that he was Mike Tyson.
00:27:12,00:27:14,Mike Tyson didn't even know he was Mike Tyson.
00:27:14,00:27:15,Imagine that discovery.
00:27:15,00:27:17,He don't want to be the one he discovers it on.
00:27:17,00:27:18,Exactly.
00:27:18,00:27:19,Public Picasso as well.
00:27:19,00:27:22,He was a pigeon fancier.
00:27:22,00:27:23,I'll see.
00:27:23,00:27:25,And he named his daughter Paloma.
00:27:25,00:27:27,And Paloma is the Spanish for pigeon.
00:27:27,00:27:28,Really?
00:27:28,00:27:29,Wow.
00:27:29,00:27:30,So he named his daughter Pigeon.
00:27:30,00:27:32,But he also named one of his pigeon's daughter.
00:27:32,00:27:35,And then he got very confusing when his will was read.
00:27:35,00:27:39,So Pigeons are so good at getting home.
00:27:39,00:27:41,"And we don't know how, really."
00:27:41,00:27:42,But we do know they have amounts.
00:27:42,00:27:44,They have a little bit of magnetic iron ore in their beaks.
00:27:44,00:27:45,Cool.
00:27:45,00:27:48,And that helps them to sense the earth's magnetic field.
00:27:48,00:27:51,And they also use their eyesight for the final stages of a journey.
00:27:51,00:27:54,And we know this because of a guy called Charlie Walcott.
00:27:54,00:27:59,Who he has spent 40 years attaching radio transmitters to Pigeons
00:27:59,00:28:03,and then following them in a single engine plane to see them navigate.
00:28:03,00:28:04,And to see them go.
00:28:04,00:28:07,You can imagine this terrified Pigeon saying he's still coming up.
00:28:07,00:28:08,Wow.
00:28:08,00:28:12,It sounds like that old cartoon with dastardly and muttly in his hands.
00:28:12,00:28:16,And he puts frosted contact lenses on Pigeons.
00:28:16,00:28:20,And then lets them fly home just to test whether they use their eyesight.
00:28:20,00:28:23,And they get most of the way to all time using the magnetic field and other things
00:28:23,00:28:24,that we don't know about.
00:28:24,00:28:26,But then towards the end they got confused.
00:28:26,00:28:29,And that's how we know that they need visual landmarks.
00:28:29,00:28:30,Just for the end.
00:28:30,00:28:33,Like having an autopilot on for the main flight and then for the landing.
00:28:33,00:28:37,"Yeah, but they're also using some Pigeons have been found"
00:28:37,00:28:41,to be observing the use of roads and roundabouts.
00:28:41,00:28:42,It's amazing.
00:28:42,00:28:43,It's so cool.
00:28:43,00:28:45,So a Pigeon will be flying above a road.
00:28:45,00:28:46,It'll hit around about.
00:28:46,00:28:50,"And if it was going to go left, it won't go left until it's gone around the roundabout."
00:28:50,00:28:53,And then it takes the appropriate...
00:28:53,00:28:57,"No, which way to go round the roundabout because I struggle if I'm driving in Italy for instance."
00:28:57,00:28:59,"No, which way to go round the roundabout."
00:28:59,00:29:01,Maybe it is to avoid Italy.
00:29:01,00:29:04,"But what I mean is they must be following the cars, right?"
00:29:04,00:29:05,"Yeah, the cars go round."
00:29:05,00:29:08,Maybe it's the heat of the cars or something like that.
00:29:08,00:29:09,Yeah.
00:29:09,00:29:10,Yeah.
00:29:10,00:29:14,But the dove releases they day back to the middle ages because they used to have religious plays.
00:29:14,00:29:17,And Noah would release a dove from the arc.
00:29:17,00:29:18,"Of course, yeah."
00:29:18,00:29:21,And I read this in a book about medieval theatre.
00:29:21,00:29:23,To stage the bit where the dove comes back.
00:29:23,00:29:26,They'd either use a dummy bird or they'd just attach a string to the real bird.
00:29:26,00:29:27,Just sort of put it back.
00:29:27,00:29:28,Oh my god.
00:29:28,00:29:30,"It's not going to look that natural, is it?"
00:29:30,00:29:31,What are you up to?
00:29:31,00:29:33,This flapping frantically dumb.
00:29:33,00:29:35,Allid naturally returns.
00:29:35,00:29:41,"And it's got the olive branch, salutate to it."
00:29:41,00:29:46,"Pigeons are one of only three birds, aren't they?"
00:29:46,00:29:49,They produce milk for their offspring.
00:29:49,00:29:50,Wow.
00:29:50,00:29:52,"So pigeons, emperor penguins, I think, and flamingos."
00:29:52,00:29:56,"And they produce it in the, is it the cries called crop milk?"
00:29:56,00:29:58,"And the crop is like this pouch in the back of their throat, I think,"
00:29:58,00:30:02,"where they, a few days before they give birth, they start making this milk."
00:30:02,00:30:06,And they sometimes stop eating to make sure that there's not indigestible grain stuck in the milk
00:30:06,00:30:08,that the baby can't digest.
00:30:08,00:30:11,But I really like the fact that they sort of adjust the milk and turn it into baby food
00:30:11,00:30:13,as the scrub gets a little bit older.
00:30:13,00:30:14,Is it actual milk?
00:30:14,00:30:15,I don't think it is.
00:30:15,00:30:18,"I'm not sure if it even contains lactose, it might do."
00:30:18,00:30:21,"But could you get pigeon cheese, is what I'm saying?"
00:30:21,00:30:22,Right.
00:30:22,00:30:30,I read that the milk in quotation marks from pigeons contains more protein and fat than both human and cows.
00:30:30,00:30:31,"Oh, yeah, it does."
00:30:31,00:30:32,So if we did get a cheese.
00:30:32,00:30:33,On healthy cheese.
00:30:33,00:30:35,Maybe that's where we haven't done it.
00:30:35,00:30:40,I think of a whole range of reasons why we haven't made cheese from pigeons.
00:30:40,00:30:43,I get a bit iffy about ghost cheese.
00:30:43,00:30:45,Never mind pigeon cheese.
00:30:45,00:30:48,"The Pope has had to, since he often releases does."
00:30:48,00:30:50,He's had to replace them now with balloons.
00:30:50,00:30:53,Because birds kept attacking the doves.
00:30:53,00:30:57,So in 2014 he did it.
00:30:57,00:31:00,And a seagull and a crow attacked the doves very fiercely.
00:31:00,00:31:02,And his children letting them go.
00:31:02,00:31:04,So it's immensely traumatising for the children as well.
00:31:04,00:31:08,"And then also in 2013, this is when we had Pope Benedict."
00:31:08,00:31:14,That release was also ruined when a seagull attacked the dove and pinned it against a window pane.
00:31:14,00:31:17,"And then the year before that, he was releasing two doves."
00:31:17,00:31:20,And one of them perched beside the pope and didn't move.
00:31:20,00:31:23,And then the second dove immediately flew back into his apartment.
00:31:23,00:31:26,"And the article I was reading about it just said to his credit,"
00:31:26,00:31:29,"Pope Benedict seemed to shout ""Mama Mia"" in surprise."
00:31:29,00:31:31,So this was Pope Benedict.
00:31:31,00:31:33,"Because Pope Benedict was German, right?"
00:31:33,00:31:36,It's like he's moved to the Vatican and picked up the lingo.
00:31:36,00:31:38,"Well, you know what they say?"
00:31:38,00:31:40,Wedding Rome.
00:31:40,00:31:45,You know that all RAF bomber planes used to carry a pigeon as standard.
00:31:45,00:31:46,How come?
00:31:46,00:31:47,They crashed in the sea.
00:31:47,00:31:48,They would release a pigeon.
00:31:48,00:31:51,And they would attach the coordinates of where they had crashed into the sea.
00:31:51,00:31:56,And loads and loads of pilots and other crew on the planes were saved.
00:31:56,00:31:57,"Well, they're really."
00:31:57,00:31:58,That's really cool.
00:31:58,00:32:01,I can't believe this. They were on submarines.
00:32:01,00:32:02,Wow.
00:32:02,00:32:05,And some paratroopers had a pigeon in a sling on their chest.
00:32:05,00:32:06,Wow.
00:32:06,00:32:07,Yeah.
00:32:07,00:32:12,"A lot of these pigeons were given the Dickon medal, which is no word for like brave animals"
00:32:12,00:32:14,by the P.D.S.A.
00:32:14,00:32:16,And I think more pigeons have had that award than anyone.
00:32:16,00:32:17,Yeah.
00:32:17,00:32:19,I have a list of medal-winning pigeons in the second world war.
00:32:19,00:32:20,Okay.
00:32:20,00:32:28,"They included Tyke, Gustav, Paddy, Billy, Mary, Princess, Commando, Scotch Lass and William of Orange."
00:32:28,00:32:31,It was Commando the naked one.
00:32:31,00:32:38,It also sounds like William of Orange has got the wrong list of your things.
00:32:38,00:32:41,I also have a list of Kings of England.
00:32:41,00:32:42,It is Henry VIII.
00:32:42,00:32:43,James II.
00:32:43,00:32:44,No Minky.
00:32:44,00:32:51,Okay. That's it.
00:32:51,00:32:52,That's all of our facts.
