00:00:00,00:00:01,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"And which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,And it's not such thing as a fish.
00:00:05,00:00:10,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:10,00:00:11,"It says it right there, first paragraph."
00:00:11,00:00:12,No such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:15,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:00:15,00:00:28,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish."
00:00:28,00:00:32,"This is a special episode in which, rather than having strictly"
00:00:32,00:00:34,"just the QILs sitting around the microphone this week,"
00:00:34,00:00:36,we've got two special guests.
00:00:36,00:00:38,"We have a comedian from Brooklyn, New York, originally"
00:00:38,00:00:43,"from Boston, Alex Edelman, who amongst interesting things"
00:00:43,00:00:45,"you've got going on, it's you've got a current text"
00:00:45,00:00:48,relationship with Lindsey Lohan.
00:00:48,00:00:52,You once severely angered Neil Armstrong and a lift.
00:00:52,00:00:53,Yep.
00:00:53,00:00:54,What else is there?
00:00:54,00:00:55,There's plenty more of this stuff.
00:00:55,00:00:59,And we're also joined by the historical consultant
00:00:59,00:01:02,"from the Horrible History's TV series, Greg Jenner."
00:01:02,00:01:05,"Who outside of that, if you hang out with Greg Jenner,"
00:01:05,00:01:08,"as Alex will know, at any kind of social event"
00:01:08,00:01:10,"is mod, like a rock star, basically."
00:01:10,00:01:11,You just have groupies.
00:01:11,00:01:13,"Yes, fans coming up to him."
00:01:13,00:01:16,Are you having a relationship with any American celebrity
00:01:16,00:01:17,females?
00:01:17,00:01:18,Sadly not.
00:01:18,00:01:20,George Washington's the person I get.
00:01:20,00:01:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:22,00:01:25,"So also joining us, we have James Harkin."
00:01:25,00:01:28,"And doing all the fact checking, as we go along today,"
00:01:28,00:01:31,"is Anna Chazinski, oh, and I'm Dan."
00:01:31,00:01:33,So we should start by saying that this is the first time
00:01:33,00:01:36,"you've been to the office, Greg, to the QI offices."
00:01:36,00:01:39,This is not the first time Alex has been.
00:01:39,00:01:41,Alex is-- you're almost like a part of the family now.
00:01:41,00:01:44,"I'm going to try to cut down, because I--"
00:01:44,00:01:45,"Well, and you're going back to America tomorrow."
00:01:45,00:01:46,Yeah.
00:01:46,00:01:47,I don't think that counts.
00:01:47,00:01:48,I'm trying to cut down.
00:01:48,00:01:49,But I'll be back.
00:01:49,00:01:52,I'll be back at the end of this month.
00:01:52,00:01:53,"Basically, as soon as Alex comes in the office,"
00:01:53,00:01:56,that's the end of work for the dressing room.
00:01:56,00:01:58,"Well, you know, the thing is, this office is like the--"
00:01:58,00:02:01,is like what I would like the inside of my mind to look like.
00:02:01,00:02:04,"Just neatly ordered and filled with facts, all categorized."
00:02:04,00:02:06,"Like, literally, I feel like you could find any fact"
00:02:06,00:02:07,"in this office, because there's a lot--"
00:02:07,00:02:11,"Well, there is just a lot of books, there's a lot of folders."
00:02:11,00:02:12,There's-- we've got the internet.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"And everyone's like, yeah, I'm going to say--"
00:02:14,00:02:15,"I'm going to say, technically, it can just be a closet"
00:02:15,00:02:18,"with a laptop, and that would still hold true."
00:02:18,00:02:22,"So OK, well, so as this is a special one,"
00:02:22,00:02:25,"maybe we'll start with-- yeah, we'll start with you, Greg."
00:02:25,00:02:26,"Oh, good, at least we'll say one."
00:02:26,00:02:29,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's begin with the sort of rambling"
00:02:29,00:02:30,you can go here and--
00:02:30,00:02:31,"Yeah, I read the excerpt."
00:02:31,00:02:32,That's what I would say.
00:02:32,00:02:32,The excerpt.
00:02:32,00:02:33,"Well, just give us what--"
00:02:33,00:02:36,It's your favorite thing that's kind of on your mind
00:02:36,00:02:38,"this week, the thing that you've learned."
00:02:38,00:02:40,"This is my first week off after writing my book,"
00:02:40,00:02:41,my first of a book.
00:02:41,00:02:43,So I'll just try and pull up.
00:02:43,00:02:44,I think it comes up next year.
00:02:44,00:02:45,Are you allowed to say anything about the book?
00:02:45,00:02:47,"Yeah, I can tell you the title."
00:02:47,00:02:48,Yes.
00:02:48,00:02:50,It's called One Million Years in a Day.
00:02:50,00:02:52,Stone Age to Phone Age is the range.
00:02:52,00:02:53,And it's sort of structured around a modern age.
00:02:53,00:02:54,That's the range.
00:02:54,00:02:55,That's the range.
00:02:55,00:02:56,That's the range to Phone Age to Phone Age.
00:02:56,00:02:59,That's the group is just the medium.
00:02:59,00:03:02,"No, I thought-- I just-- something I just--"
00:03:02,00:03:03,"I put in the book and I thought it was quite an interesting fact,"
00:03:03,00:03:08,"really, that the earliest known dentistry is 9,000 years"
00:03:08,00:03:08,up.
00:03:08,00:03:11,"This is back in theolithic, really."
00:03:11,00:03:14,"So like, mammoths were walking the earth with sensors."
00:03:14,00:03:15,"Like, yeah, he's--"
00:03:15,00:03:17,[GROANS]
00:03:17,00:03:19,So we're talking here in--
00:03:19,00:03:20,"I suppose, modern day Pakistan."
00:03:20,00:03:21,That's what we call it.
00:03:21,00:03:23,"It's a place called Miggard, I suppose."
00:03:23,00:03:25,"It's not my pronunciation, it's not great."
00:03:25,00:03:28,But archaeologists have found teeth which have been drilled.
00:03:28,00:03:30,"And they've been sort of, you know,"
00:03:30,00:03:31,"it's the earliest, really, sort of fillings"
00:03:31,00:03:34,"or or early drilling technique using a bow drill, which"
00:03:34,00:03:37,"is, you know, just a sort of wiggling bit of sharp stick,"
00:03:37,00:03:40,"which is a technique used, really, for jewelry."
00:03:40,00:03:42,So not even teeth cleaning because I knew
00:03:42,00:03:44,that the Egyptians had a foreshare toothbrushes.
00:03:44,00:03:45,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:45,00:03:47,Even reparative dentistry goes back there.
00:03:47,00:03:48,So this would be medicinal dentistry.
00:03:48,00:03:50,This would be pain relief.
00:03:50,00:03:51,"Yeah, I guess it's an obvious thing."
00:03:51,00:03:53,"Because their people would have been in so much pain, wouldn't they?"
00:03:53,00:03:54,Yeah.
00:03:54,00:03:57,"Although I remember reading that, like sugar cane sugar"
00:03:57,00:03:58,came in relatively late.
00:03:58,00:04:01,So people didn't have as bad teeth in the early time
00:04:01,00:04:02,as they have today.
00:04:02,00:04:04,"It's interesting, actually, there's been a couple of major studies"
00:04:04,00:04:06,"in past couple years that are shown that's not really true, actually."
00:04:06,00:04:09,There's an awful lot of dental wear and tear.
00:04:09,00:04:11,"Wear and tear, but also it's sugar based, actually,"
00:04:11,00:04:14,because there's quite a lot of sugar in natural fruits and so forth.
00:04:14,00:04:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:14,00:04:16,"And obviously, if you're not brushing your teeth every day,"
00:04:16,00:04:17,it will build up.
00:04:17,00:04:20,Is it complex sugars that really do harm you?
00:04:20,00:04:22,"Yeah, I mean, the worst dentistry in history,"
00:04:22,00:04:25,"I think, if you were to sort of elect an era,"
00:04:25,00:04:27,"I would say probably the 18th century, the Georgians."
00:04:27,00:04:30,"The 18th century's where dentistry begins as a modern discipline,"
00:04:30,00:04:35,but it's also where really dentistry teeth were at that worst.
00:04:35,00:04:37,"If you look at portraits, no one smiles."
00:04:37,00:04:37,Yes.
00:04:37,00:04:39,"And so all the first ever smile, I can't remember"
00:04:39,00:04:42,"as a female artist, a French female artist."
00:04:42,00:04:43,"I think it's in Le Brant, I think maybe."
00:04:43,00:04:44,Could you check that out?
00:04:44,00:04:45,"Marie Le Brant, perhaps."
00:04:45,00:04:47,"It's a really famous painting, and it's very controversial,"
00:04:47,00:04:49,because I think it's a self-portrait.
00:04:49,00:04:49,I think she's grinning.
00:04:49,00:04:50,Wow.
00:04:50,00:04:52,"And it's the reason you didn't grin before,"
00:04:52,00:04:53,because your teeth were so bad.
00:04:53,00:04:54,Your teeth were all fun.
00:04:54,00:04:57,"Who is it who you're in for mouthwash, was that?"
00:04:57,00:04:57,The Romans.
00:04:57,00:04:58,The Romans.
00:04:58,00:04:59,Wow.
00:04:59,00:05:00,Wow.
00:05:00,00:05:01,Who's that just me?
00:05:01,00:05:04,"Romans brush their teeth, to send its dentists."
00:05:04,00:05:05,They use rides.
00:05:05,00:05:09,"I mean, the Egyptians didn't do dental surgery, particularly."
00:05:09,00:05:10,They were very good dentists.
00:05:10,00:05:13,"They were the first known dentists in human history,"
00:05:13,00:05:16,the first named dentists are Egyptian.
00:05:16,00:05:16,They were.
00:05:16,00:05:18,"They found, I think, in 2006, I think they found a tomb"
00:05:18,00:05:22,"with three named dentists on the wall, sort of written in."
00:05:22,00:05:23,So they were like a company name.
00:05:23,00:05:25,You should be a scientist for shulmen.
00:05:25,00:05:28,"Yeah, like dentists of the Pharaohs."
00:05:28,00:05:29,And they were royal dentists.
00:05:29,00:05:31,"So they were sort of official dentists to a Pharaoh,"
00:05:31,00:05:35,and these three guys were clearly sort of official tooth
00:05:35,00:05:36,products.
00:05:36,00:05:38,There was a recent meta-study done on Egyptian mummies.
00:05:38,00:05:40,I think 40% of them might be wrong.
00:05:40,00:05:43,I think 40% had serious dental disease.
00:05:43,00:05:43,Wow.
00:05:43,00:05:44,And dental disease could kill you.
00:05:44,00:05:46,My father's a physician.
00:05:46,00:05:47,"And he says something really interesting,"
00:05:47,00:05:51,"that historically, the people who get the worst care"
00:05:51,00:05:53,are the famous and the wealthy.
00:05:53,00:05:58,"Because what he's being ironic, what he's saying is typically"
00:05:58,00:06:03,famous people have been killed by over-medicating or over-operating
00:06:03,00:06:06,"or too much complex treatment, like as soon as the body"
00:06:06,00:06:07,will repair itself.
00:06:07,00:06:09,"We talked in an earlier podcast about James Gaffield,"
00:06:09,00:06:13,"who was a pro-deter, a lot of dirty fingers,"
00:06:13,00:06:14,"and the moon, and stuff like that."
00:06:14,00:06:16,"My father gave a TED talk on it, which"
00:06:16,00:06:17,is actually really interesting.
00:06:17,00:06:18,His name is Eliza Adelman.
00:06:18,00:06:21,So I wonder if those pharaohs were receiving
00:06:21,00:06:25,a lot of dental attention or a big getting such rich food
00:06:25,00:06:26,that they were in there?
00:06:26,00:06:28,"Well, that's the big question, so the quality of food,"
00:06:28,00:06:30,"obviously, is going to affect things."
00:06:30,00:06:31,"I mean, let's see."
00:06:31,00:06:34,The iceman found in North Teruvian Alps.
00:06:34,00:06:36,"He had really, really messed up teeth."
00:06:36,00:06:40,What was the fact that you were saying about the baseball player?
00:06:40,00:06:42,"I can't remember his name, but he was a baseball player"
00:06:42,00:06:45,who had to be taken out of the game
00:06:45,00:06:47,because he bit himself on his own ass.
00:06:47,00:06:50,"And what happened was he slid into the final base,"
00:06:50,00:06:53,and his false teeth fell out and learned about it.
00:06:53,00:06:54,I'm sure you know about it.
00:06:54,00:06:56,"So what we were saying, though, is that he"
00:06:56,00:06:57,"must have been in his 20s, right?"
00:06:57,00:07:00,"But yeah, there he was with a full set of false teeth,"
00:07:00,00:07:01,because that was a thing that happened.
00:07:01,00:07:02,Had his teeth been knocked out?
00:07:02,00:07:03,It was in the 1920s.
00:07:03,00:07:06,"Apparently, he was called Clarence Blethan,"
00:07:06,00:07:09,and he's now called Clarence Climax Blethan.
00:07:09,00:07:11,I don't really understand how it was born there.
00:07:11,00:07:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:13,00:07:15,"Yeah, in a really particular gimmick."
00:07:15,00:07:17,Yeah.
00:07:17,00:07:18,No teeth you say.
00:07:18,00:07:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:20,00:07:24,"Oh, Alex, I have to tell you, just as an American and a baseball fan,"
00:07:24,00:07:26,"if you don't know this, it's my favorite baseball fact."
00:07:26,00:07:27,"So, you know, Lou Gehrig?"
00:07:27,00:07:28,"What, and a disease?"
00:07:28,00:07:29,Exactly.
00:07:29,00:07:31,You really should have seen that one coming.
00:07:31,00:07:32,"Yeah, yeah, absolutely."
00:07:32,00:07:33,So this is what's fantastic about it.
00:07:33,00:07:38,Turns out that Lou Gehrig didn't die of Lou Gehrig's disease.
00:07:38,00:07:40,"So the disease named after him, you didn't have--"
00:07:40,00:07:41,There's an interesting Wikipedia list
00:07:41,00:07:45,that people have been killed by already deceased people.
00:07:45,00:07:48,"My favorite one is someone killed, not by a deceased person,"
00:07:48,00:07:51,"but by deceased animal, a really notorious poacher in Montana."
00:07:51,00:07:53,This is a story that people in Montana like to tell.
00:07:53,00:07:55,"And like, this poacher outside of Helena,"
00:07:55,00:07:58,"he was really famous for shooting deer,"
00:07:58,00:08:00,and people told him that there was one particular deer
00:08:00,00:08:01,that he'd never be able to get.
00:08:01,00:08:03,And he wounded it a whole bunch of times.
00:08:03,00:08:05,"And finally, he spotted on a bluff"
00:08:05,00:08:07,"across over over him, and he shot it,"
00:08:07,00:08:09,and he turned around and celebrated.
00:08:09,00:08:12,"And the deer bounced all the way down and landed on him, and killed him."
00:08:12,00:08:13,And the deer survived.
00:08:13,00:08:14,"Oh, wow."
00:08:14,00:08:15,That's fun.
00:08:15,00:08:17,"Yeah, the guy didn't."
00:08:17,00:08:18,We should move on to another fact.
00:08:18,00:08:19,Yeah.
00:08:19,00:08:19,Just quickly.
00:08:19,00:08:20,Yes.
00:08:20,00:08:22,"So it's by, obviously, Greg was right."
00:08:22,00:08:25,"I mean, he's a historian about the first ever smile"
00:08:25,00:08:28,"in a portrait was in 1787, but it was quite funny."
00:08:28,00:08:30,"The corp gossip sheet, at the time,"
00:08:30,00:08:33,"said, ""An affectation which artists, art lovers,"
00:08:33,00:08:36,"and persons of taste have been united in condemning,"
00:08:36,00:08:38,and which finds no precedent among the ancients
00:08:38,00:08:41,"is that in smiling, she shows her teeth."""
00:08:41,00:08:43,"So, you know, pretty outrageous."
00:08:43,00:08:46,I found an amazing collection of photos
00:08:46,00:08:49,"from a period pre-smile, where they did all the grim, kind of,"
00:08:49,00:08:51,straight face-looking.
00:08:51,00:08:55,"And it's outtake photos, where the families crack up,"
00:08:55,00:08:56,and they're laughing.
00:08:56,00:08:58,"And it's so interesting, because it's the first time"
00:08:58,00:09:00,where you see the real personalities.
00:09:00,00:09:02,"And that's so interesting, I'm going through, yeah."
00:09:02,00:09:04,"Where they're just, they're properly laughing out loud."
00:09:04,00:09:07,"And clearly, the person's like, ""Well, this is unusable."""
00:09:07,00:09:08,Yeah.
00:09:08,00:09:10,"Like, you don't look creepy, and you don't look solid."
00:09:10,00:09:11,Yeah.
00:09:11,00:09:13,Like a smile.
00:09:13,00:09:14,Yeah.
00:09:14,00:09:16,"This is rather a dip, Michael."
00:09:16,00:09:17,I'm not as if you were looking.
00:09:17,00:09:19,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:09:19,00:09:24,"All right, let's move on to our second fact."
00:09:24,00:09:27,"I want to throw in my fact here, particularly,"
00:09:27,00:09:30,"because I want to hear your thoughts on this, Craig."
00:09:30,00:09:33,"It's a theory from a guy called Dr. Hans Ulrich Neymitz,"
00:09:33,00:09:37,which is that the Middle Ages never happened.
00:09:37,00:09:38,"Oh, wow."
00:09:38,00:09:41,So it's a thing called phantom time theory.
00:09:41,00:09:45,It's basically his alleges that it was just made up.
00:09:45,00:09:47,Are you sure that the guy is Dr. Hans Ulrich?
00:09:47,00:09:48,"Yeah, I know."
00:09:48,00:09:49,A lot of people believe it.
00:09:49,00:09:51,"You know, obviously, a lot of idiots believe it."
00:09:51,00:09:58,"But according to them, 614 to 911 AD did not happen."
00:09:58,00:09:58,Did not happen.
00:09:58,00:10:00,We're going through it now.
00:10:00,00:10:01,What is the basis for this theory?
00:10:01,00:10:02,This is not the case.
00:10:02,00:10:04,It thinks it's a conspiracy of the calendar.
00:10:04,00:10:05,Brilliant.
00:10:05,00:10:05,Yeah.
00:10:05,00:10:07,"And so what his suggestion is, as well,"
00:10:07,00:10:09,is that the things that were supposed to have happened
00:10:09,00:10:11,"in the Middle Ages, people at the time"
00:10:11,00:10:13,removed them from that bit of history
00:10:13,00:10:16,and created a fiction of these 300 years.
00:10:16,00:10:18,I think he said Charlemagne just never existed.
00:10:18,00:10:20,What was a fictional character?
00:10:20,00:10:23,"So basically, half of the things that you do for a living"
00:10:23,00:10:23,just--
00:10:23,00:10:25,"My mouth is degraded, yeah."
00:10:25,00:10:27,It's a fictional-- yeah.
00:10:27,00:10:29,I'll give you some direct sort of from this article.
00:10:29,00:10:31,It seems that historians are plagued by plethora
00:10:31,00:10:33,of falsified documents from the Middle Ages.
00:10:33,00:10:36,Some documents forged by the Roman Catholic Church
00:10:36,00:10:38,during the Middle Ages were created hundreds of years
00:10:38,00:10:40,"before their great moments arrived,"
00:10:40,00:10:43,"after which they were embraced by medieval society,"
00:10:43,00:10:45,this implying that whoever produced these fraudaries
00:10:45,00:10:49,must have very skillfully anticipated the future.
00:10:49,00:10:51,Or there was some discrepancy in calculating days.
00:10:51,00:10:51,"Well, houses."
00:10:51,00:10:53,So where does he stand on the Vikings?
00:10:53,00:10:55,[SIGHS]
00:10:55,00:10:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:56,00:10:57,One Vikings.
00:10:57,00:10:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:59,00:11:01,"They did not burn their limits, but they didn't know what happened."
00:11:01,00:11:04,"In this one, it wasn't a fact that it was just he just didn't"
00:11:04,00:11:05,happen and--
00:11:05,00:11:05,Yeah.
00:11:05,00:11:08,"And I was shot in a man, and I was shot in a man."
00:11:08,00:11:09,Alfred the Great was just--
00:11:09,00:11:10,"No, I didn't say it."
00:11:10,00:11:12,He says that maybe Alfred the Great was
00:11:12,00:11:13,in a different period of time.
00:11:13,00:11:16,"Maybe the Vikings, you know, maybe they were just"
00:11:16,00:11:17,the year before.
00:11:17,00:11:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:19,00:11:21,So he stops at 9/11 to see--
00:11:21,00:11:21,9/11 to see--
00:11:21,00:11:22,He stops at 9/11.
00:11:22,00:11:23,9/11?
00:11:23,00:11:23,"No, he stops at 9/11."
00:11:23,00:11:25,No one likes his various theories.
00:11:25,00:11:27,9/11 is the year that the Vikings conquer Normandy
00:11:27,00:11:28,and become the Normans.
00:11:28,00:11:31,"It's Rolo, King Rolo, who found the Normandy"
00:11:31,00:11:33,on the levels that the Vikings become Normans.
00:11:33,00:11:34,"And the Normans, of course, become"
00:11:34,00:11:36,"William the Conqueror, and that becomes our first dynasty"
00:11:36,00:11:37,of English medieval kings.
00:11:37,00:11:39,So 9/11 to good year.
00:11:39,00:11:41,"But this goes with the thing that you like, Dan, which"
00:11:41,00:11:44,"is that if you come up with an idea or a conspiracy,"
00:11:44,00:11:46,then you can always seem to fit in--
00:11:46,00:11:50,You can find facts into whatever your theory is.
00:11:50,00:11:53,"And you can imagine, if you said to him, what about the Vikings?"
00:11:53,00:11:54,He would have announced--
00:11:54,00:11:55,"He won't have an answer, yeah."
00:11:55,00:11:56,But if I know--
00:11:56,00:11:57,"If I know the analogy in the Bible, isn't it?"
00:11:57,00:11:59,People sort of try to find patterns in the Bible.
00:11:59,00:12:00,"And you sort of go, you do realize it's"
00:12:00,00:12:03,been re-translated in loans of time.
00:12:03,00:12:05,"So all right, final question, then."
00:12:05,00:12:08,Is there any truth that the militias didn't happen?
00:12:08,00:12:11,"I would be deeply, deeply absurd."
00:12:11,00:12:12,"I mean, you're going to say--"
00:12:12,00:12:14,"Well, I mean, say, do you really?"
00:12:14,00:12:15,"Yeah, I would, actually."
00:12:15,00:12:20,I'm just going to stick with my life when it makes this thing.
00:12:20,00:12:21,"No, I'd be, I'd be intrigued."
00:12:21,00:12:22,"I mean, it's true."
00:12:22,00:12:25,"We should be very deeply suspicious and skeptical of the past,"
00:12:25,00:12:26,and one of the things that historians do
00:12:26,00:12:29,is we rigorously interrogate documents.
00:12:29,00:12:31,And we'd always try to disprove them.
00:12:31,00:12:33,We're trying to apply that sort of scientific methodology
00:12:33,00:12:35,"of saying, how do we know this is true?"
00:12:35,00:12:36,And that's what great scholarship is.
00:12:36,00:12:38,But you don't destroy all things.
00:12:38,00:12:40,"You're just trying to question them and say, OK."
00:12:40,00:12:42,"And obviously, there were problems with forgeries."
00:12:42,00:12:44,"A monastery, for example, would be given land,"
00:12:44,00:12:45,and they would lose the document.
00:12:45,00:12:46,"And then a king would turn up going,"
00:12:46,00:12:47,"great, I'm having a land back."
00:12:47,00:12:49,"And they'd be like, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:12:49,00:12:50,"This is ours, we've always had it."
00:12:50,00:12:51,So they'd forge a document.
00:12:51,00:12:52,And then we get the forgery.
00:12:52,00:12:53,Great.
00:12:53,00:12:56,"I read that, you know, Andara, the country."
00:12:56,00:12:58,They have a constitution.
00:12:58,00:13:00,But it's in a safe in Andara somewhere.
00:13:00,00:13:03,And a lot of historians think that it's fake.
00:13:03,00:13:03,Really?
00:13:03,00:13:04,You heard that from them?
00:13:04,00:13:05,"No, I haven't."
00:13:05,00:13:07,"Breaking what's in, like, it doesn't exist at all."
00:13:07,00:13:09,"As in, yeah, it's a modern reproduction"
00:13:09,00:13:13,because they don't have the historical basis
00:13:13,00:13:14,that they think they have.
00:13:14,00:13:16,Because it was one of those states
00:13:16,00:13:20,that came in to buffer from the 15th century laws.
00:13:20,00:13:21,"Yeah, the Italian laws."
00:13:21,00:13:25,"If it were to be true, this phantom times thing,"
00:13:25,00:13:29,"which is 110% not, yeah."
00:13:29,00:13:31,"Then what it would mean is, I mean,"
00:13:31,00:13:33,no new scholarship is emerging.
00:13:33,00:13:35,A new scholarship is emerging all the time.
00:13:35,00:13:35,"Yeah, it is."
00:13:35,00:13:38,So it would be insane.
00:13:38,00:13:41,But it would also kick off a really interrupt
00:13:41,00:13:42,with a carbon date.
00:13:42,00:13:43,"Yeah, I was just thinking about that."
00:13:43,00:13:44,"Yeah, yeah."
00:13:44,00:13:47,We use historical documents to try and ally up
00:13:47,00:13:48,with carbon dating.
00:13:48,00:13:50,And you use carbon dating to try and ally up with historical
00:13:50,00:13:51,documents.
00:13:51,00:13:52,You try and play them off against each other
00:13:52,00:13:53,and try and find a cross-reference.
00:13:53,00:13:54,"And that way, if they go to agree,"
00:13:54,00:13:57,"you kind of go, all right, maybe that's legit."
00:13:57,00:13:59,"With Richard III discovering the car part recently,"
00:13:59,00:14:02,the carbon dating there can sort of give you
00:14:02,00:14:04,"that specificity scientifically,"
00:14:04,00:14:06,which then legitimizes the documents
00:14:06,00:14:07,that told us he was there.
00:14:07,00:14:07,"Yes, OK."
00:14:07,00:14:10,"So then we can kind of go, ah, these are OK."
00:14:10,00:14:11,Maybe we can look at them closely for something else.
00:14:11,00:14:12,So that's a way of verifying.
00:14:12,00:14:13,It's a way of verifying.
00:14:13,00:14:15,Because you're using the scientific method
00:14:15,00:14:17,"to sort of say, OK, this is the archaeology's legit."
00:14:17,00:14:19,So maybe the history's OK.
00:14:19,00:14:21,Physicists like to use really old lead
00:14:21,00:14:24,for their experiments because it's quite--
00:14:24,00:14:26,"it doesn't react with as many things,"
00:14:26,00:14:28,but that means they're trying to use a lot of archaeological
00:14:28,00:14:30,items to make their experiments.
00:14:30,00:14:32,"Yeah, I've heard about it briefly."
00:14:32,00:14:33,I don't know if that's--
00:14:33,00:14:35,"I mean, it just makes sense, wouldn't it, maybe?"
00:14:35,00:14:36,Yeah.
00:14:36,00:14:39,"But then, yeah, it's not really great to feel"
00:14:39,00:14:40,as someone else's stuff.
00:14:40,00:14:41,It's Richard III.
00:14:41,00:14:42,Can I borrow that from someone?
00:14:42,00:14:44,"I've got an experiment on, just, you know,"
00:14:44,00:14:46,and even all King.
00:14:46,00:14:48,"Yeah, so I should imagine that James was right,"
00:14:48,00:14:50,"that er, though, is a theory, which, in fact,"
00:14:50,00:14:53,sounds quite well-founded that the Andoran Constitution
00:14:53,00:14:55,"is a forgery, although this isn't a book."
00:14:55,00:14:56,"So apparently, it came from Charlemagne."
00:14:56,00:14:59,It was signed at the Independence of Andoros.
00:14:59,00:15:00,This document--
00:15:00,00:15:01,"Oh, we all know Charlemagne, didn't it?"
00:15:01,00:15:02,I think we've established that.
00:15:02,00:15:03,I think we've established that.
00:15:03,00:15:05,"Otherwise, I'm reading it in a book where they've"
00:15:05,00:15:06,spelled-- it's a book.
00:15:06,00:15:07,"It's Andorra Business Law Handbook,"
00:15:07,00:15:10,"but they've spelled Charlemagne, Charlemagne."
00:15:10,00:15:10,He's a dog.
00:15:10,00:15:12,He was a dog with a therapist.
00:15:12,00:15:13,I don't know.
00:15:13,00:15:15,I don't know if Charles's worthy though.
00:15:15,00:15:15,OK.
00:15:15,00:15:18,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:15:20,00:15:22,"All right, so we're going to go on to--"
00:15:22,00:15:23,We'll do Alex's respect now.
00:15:23,00:15:24,Alex?
00:15:24,00:15:29,"My fact is, it's about the most medically indispensable"
00:15:29,00:15:33,sea creature in the United States is the horseshoe crab.
00:15:33,00:15:34,Are you aware of the--
00:15:34,00:15:35,"No, go on."
00:15:35,00:15:37,"It's a wide, wide claim to make, isn't it?"
00:15:37,00:15:38,"Yeah, how does that work?"
00:15:38,00:15:40,"Well, so the horseshoe crab lives"
00:15:40,00:15:45,in the very bacteria-rich coastline shallow waters
00:15:45,00:15:46,in the ocean.
00:15:46,00:15:48,"So in the early '20s, they were sort of seen"
00:15:48,00:15:52,"as a nuisance, and they were ground up, and used as fertilizer"
00:15:52,00:15:53,"and stuff, in fact, to pegs."
00:15:53,00:15:58,"And now, every year, a half million horseshoe crabs"
00:15:58,00:16:01,"are harvested, and they're brought into factories"
00:16:01,00:16:04,by one of five companies all along the eastern coast
00:16:04,00:16:05,of the United States.
00:16:05,00:16:07,And they're blood alive.
00:16:07,00:16:09,And their blood is baby blue.
00:16:09,00:16:13,"And if you can find a picture, it's incredibly interesting."
00:16:13,00:16:17,"And this blood-- it detects any malignant, dangerous bacterial"
00:16:17,00:16:21,"undertoxins, even at a concentration of one part per trillion."
00:16:21,00:16:23,"So the FDA requires that all drugs,"
00:16:23,00:16:25,all new drugs that are brought to market
00:16:25,00:16:28,be run through this horseshoe crab blood.
00:16:28,00:16:30,So every single person in the United States
00:16:30,00:16:33,who's ever had an injection of any kind
00:16:33,00:16:36,has had a drug that's been tested in this LAL test.
00:16:36,00:16:37,"Oh, that's amazing."
00:16:37,00:16:37,"That is incredible, yeah."
00:16:37,00:16:38,It's unbelievable.
00:16:38,00:16:42,"And the blood per quart is $15,000."
00:16:42,00:16:44,So they don't kill the crabs.
00:16:44,00:16:44,So that's like--
00:16:44,00:16:45,So people love that.
00:16:45,00:16:46,"Yeah, they just leave them."
00:16:46,00:16:49,And then they take them on a boat all the way out to sea
00:16:49,00:16:52,so they don't reharvest crabs that they've already taken.
00:16:52,00:16:55,They look like a great holiday crew.
00:16:55,00:16:57,They make us have done a really good thing.
00:16:57,00:16:59,But they dumped these guys really far out.
00:16:59,00:17:00,And they noticed that less and less of them
00:17:00,00:17:01,are coming back.
00:17:01,00:17:03,"Well, you don't kill something when you take a lot of its blood."
00:17:03,00:17:06,It does make it more lethargic and less likely to make.
00:17:06,00:17:07,"But yeah, so that's to me."
00:17:07,00:17:08,That's very exciting.
00:17:08,00:17:09,Then that's really cool.
00:17:09,00:17:10,Yeah.
00:17:10,00:17:13,That they have basically the best immune system of anyone.
00:17:13,00:17:13,They do.
00:17:13,00:17:14,We can use--
00:17:14,00:17:16,"Yeah, my favorite crab."
00:17:16,00:17:18,Have you heard of the samurai crab?
00:17:18,00:17:19,"No, but it sounds like a movie."
00:17:19,00:17:21,"No, it's very exciting."
00:17:21,00:17:22,It's very exciting.
00:17:22,00:17:23,So it's--
00:17:23,00:17:24,"Basically, black and black sideways."
00:17:24,00:17:27,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:27,00:17:30,"There was a superstition that samurai warriors,"
00:17:30,00:17:34,"when they died, were reincarnated as these crabs."
00:17:34,00:17:36,Because a lot of these crabs that came up
00:17:36,00:17:39,had the pattern on their shell of a samurai face.
00:17:39,00:17:40,That's brilliant.
00:17:40,00:17:42,And it became an evolutionary thing.
00:17:42,00:17:44,So it's the samurai pattern that became the--
00:17:44,00:17:45,That is brilliant.
00:17:45,00:17:46,Wow.
00:17:46,00:17:49,And so they would throw the ones that looked like a samurai
00:17:49,00:17:50,back into the ocean.
00:17:50,00:17:51,That's brilliant.
00:17:51,00:17:53,Are there other stories of animals
00:17:53,00:17:54,selectively surviving like that?
00:17:54,00:17:55,So I was wondering--
00:17:55,00:17:58,Why do dogs are supposed to be a bit like that in cats?
00:17:58,00:17:59,In cats?
00:17:59,00:18:00,Cats domesticated themselves.
00:18:00,00:18:02,"Because cats, when they me out, they"
00:18:02,00:18:03,don't me out to other cats.
00:18:03,00:18:04,They only do it to humans.
00:18:04,00:18:05,"Oh, really?"
00:18:05,00:18:07,They've selected to me out just so that we
00:18:07,00:18:09,would think they're little babies.
00:18:09,00:18:10,We domesticated dogs.
00:18:10,00:18:12,We deliberately took wolves.
00:18:12,00:18:13,And when-- please stop biting me.
00:18:13,00:18:14,I like it when you're dog please.
00:18:14,00:18:16,And the amazing thing is that you can domesticate an animal
00:18:16,00:18:17,"really, really quickly."
00:18:17,00:18:20,There's a Russian scientist who did it in the '50s with foxes.
00:18:20,00:18:21,I think he was-- what was his name?
00:18:21,00:18:22,"Things would be, I think."
00:18:22,00:18:23,"Beardina, for some reason."
00:18:23,00:18:26,"He took foxes, feral, wild, angry foxes,"
00:18:26,00:18:27,trying to eat his face.
00:18:27,00:18:29,And he just bred them and bred them and bred them.
00:18:29,00:18:31,I was always taking the most docile cubs
00:18:31,00:18:32,and bringing together.
00:18:32,00:18:33,Belli-ai.
00:18:33,00:18:34,Belli-ai-ai.
00:18:34,00:18:34,Belli-ai-ai-ai.
00:18:34,00:18:35,Belli-ai-ai.
00:18:35,00:18:35,Belli-ai-ai-ai.
00:18:35,00:18:37,That's one of the brilliant answers.
00:18:37,00:18:39,Belli-ai-ai-ai.
00:18:39,00:18:41,But he bred them together so that you
00:18:41,00:18:43,ended up with these sort of more increasingly docile creatures.
00:18:43,00:18:45,The only thing that he discovered was that when
00:18:45,00:18:47,"you breed for physical characteristics,"
00:18:47,00:18:49,it also creates a personality chain.
00:18:49,00:18:52,"They became more sort of dog-like, more sort of fluffy-tailed"
00:18:52,00:18:54,and more sort of willing to follow around.
00:18:54,00:18:55,But they also changed--
00:18:55,00:18:56,Or sequious.
00:18:56,00:18:57,"But they did, yes."
00:18:57,00:18:58,But they sequious foxes.
00:18:58,00:19:01,They're sequious foxes.
00:19:01,00:19:03,But they will also change their personality and demeanor
00:19:03,00:19:05,and the fact they'll respond to calls and so on.
00:19:05,00:19:06,And they did that in like 10 generations.
00:19:06,00:19:07,That's all it took.
00:19:07,00:19:09,"There's been awful lot of genetic testing recently,"
00:19:09,00:19:11,because we can now do DNA analysis on animals.
00:19:11,00:19:14,And we found that actually dogs are much older than we thought.
00:19:14,00:19:18,So do we think that we got them for companionship or fighting
00:19:18,00:19:21,or it's probably hunting companionship?
00:19:21,00:19:22,Because we had pet bear.
00:19:22,00:19:24,There was definitely at least one pet bear to be
00:19:24,00:19:25,found in the Stone Age.
00:19:25,00:19:26,"Well, Byron had a pet bear."
00:19:26,00:19:27,Byron did have a pet bear.
00:19:27,00:19:28,Byron had a pet bear?
00:19:28,00:19:29,He took it to Cambridge.
00:19:29,00:19:29,We took it to Cambridge.
00:19:29,00:19:30,Because he wasn't allowed a dog.
00:19:30,00:19:32,"So he was vivid in it, and he said,"
00:19:32,00:19:34,I can have a bear.
00:19:34,00:19:37,This is before after he sounded the hamburger chainers.
00:19:37,00:19:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:40,00:19:41,Is that the most ridiculous?
00:19:41,00:19:42,I'll wait.
00:19:42,00:19:45,Someone kept a pet scorpion in a jar on his desk.
00:19:45,00:19:46,I read this in one of your boxes.
00:19:46,00:19:46,Yeah.
00:19:46,00:19:49,"I read that in one of the QI books, which are available"
00:19:49,00:19:50,in fine-box stores everywhere.
00:19:50,00:19:52,Yeah.
00:19:52,00:19:54,Probably the same books as Greg's book
00:19:54,00:19:56,will be available in next year.
00:19:56,00:19:56,Yeah.
00:19:56,00:19:58,"Oh, they have all the workshops."
00:19:58,00:19:58,"Yeah, I think."
00:19:58,00:19:59,Talk about them sequestries.
00:19:59,00:20:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:01,00:20:03,An extraordinary effect of this sort of dog thing
00:20:03,00:20:04,to be an extraordinary thing is we obviously
00:20:04,00:20:06,"domesticated dogs because to do that,"
00:20:06,00:20:08,"you have to sort of take a wild, feral wolf"
00:20:08,00:20:09,that is trying to kill you.
00:20:09,00:20:10,And gradually tame it.
00:20:10,00:20:11,But it's not taming.
00:20:11,00:20:13,It's breeding it.
00:20:13,00:20:14,"You take your runt of a litter, and the runt of a litter,"
00:20:14,00:20:16,"you bring this together, and gradually you breed them,"
00:20:16,00:20:17,and you create a new animal.
00:20:17,00:20:18,And that is the dog.
00:20:18,00:20:21,The amazing thing is that the oldest dog breed in the world
00:20:21,00:20:22,"is only a sort of 1,000 years old or something."
00:20:22,00:20:24,Roman dogs don't exist anymore.
00:20:24,00:20:26,"So when you find a Roman dog at Pompeii,"
00:20:26,00:20:28,"which we have found one, that breed no longer exists."
00:20:28,00:20:29,Doesn't exist anymore.
00:20:29,00:20:30,Wow.
00:20:30,00:20:30,But--
00:20:30,00:20:32,Is it because they die out?
00:20:32,00:20:34,"Well, the breeding program has changed,"
00:20:34,00:20:35,and you have sort of different needs of them.
00:20:35,00:20:37,"And animals are constantly evolving and changing,"
00:20:37,00:20:38,and we breed them in different ways.
00:20:38,00:20:40,And George Washington bred dogs.
00:20:40,00:20:42,George Washington bred the American fox sound.
00:20:42,00:20:45,"He took a French fox sound from the monkey to the fiat,"
00:20:45,00:20:47,"and an English fox sound, and he bred them together"
00:20:47,00:20:48,and created the American fox sound.
00:20:48,00:20:49,Wow.
00:20:49,00:20:50,And he was really obsessed with this.
00:20:50,00:20:52,He was sort of typical 18th century gentleman.
00:20:52,00:20:53,"And I'm like, I'm going to breed an animal."
00:20:53,00:20:55,But the amazing thing is cats domesticated themselves.
00:20:55,00:20:57,"The oldest known cat, I think, is from the Shaila Boros,"
00:20:57,00:20:59,I think in Cyprus.
00:20:59,00:21:00,"I think it's about 9,000 years old."
00:21:00,00:21:04,Is there any truth to the story when people attach cats
00:21:04,00:21:05,to their shields to the Egyptians?
00:21:05,00:21:06,Yes.
00:21:06,00:21:07,"I love business, the battle."
00:21:07,00:21:09,"I think Pallucian, I think, is top of my head,"
00:21:09,00:21:12,because the Egyptians believed cats to be holy and revered.
00:21:12,00:21:14,They had huge cat funeral monuments
00:21:14,00:21:15,with like millions of buried cats.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"If your cat died, you shaved with your eyebrows,"
00:21:17,00:21:20,and you would take your cat to this holy city of cats.
00:21:20,00:21:21,"They found a lot of mummies, didn't they?"
00:21:21,00:21:23,"Mummified cats, like a million of them."
00:21:23,00:21:24,A million of them.
00:21:24,00:21:25,"A huge one, yeah."
00:21:25,00:21:27,"And the city, I think, was called Bubastis."
00:21:27,00:21:29,"Named after the, I think, might have made that up."
00:21:29,00:21:30,There was a definite city.
00:21:30,00:21:32,And they would bury the cats and they'd shave off their eyes.
00:21:32,00:21:33,"It was working out for a time, by the way."
00:21:33,00:21:34,It was all right.
00:21:34,00:21:37,Then they'd never want to interrupt such a thousand tabs up.
00:21:37,00:21:40,"But it was a great, and they'd hear what they'd say."
00:21:40,00:21:41,And they'd hear what they'd say.
00:21:41,00:21:42,It's called Bubastis.
00:21:42,00:21:43,It's a good idea.
00:21:43,00:21:44,Good idea.
00:21:44,00:21:45,I wanted to make up some random natives.
00:21:45,00:21:46,But they worship cats.
00:21:46,00:21:48,"And there's a famous story that a Roman soldier,"
00:21:48,00:21:50,"who's in his chariot, and he ran over a cat."
00:21:50,00:21:51,And he was killed by an angry mob.
00:21:51,00:21:54,"But then in the middle ages, people thought that cats were evil,"
00:21:54,00:21:55,didn't they?
00:21:55,00:21:57,And they thought they thought they were witches' familiars.
00:21:57,00:21:58,But they used to be burned alive as well.
00:21:58,00:21:59,"Louis XIV, for think."
00:21:59,00:22:01,"Yeah, he did want to burn himself, didn't he?"
00:22:01,00:22:02,"No, they didn't."
00:22:02,00:22:04,And he used to be ceremony through the monsters' pie out.
00:22:04,00:22:05,They used to be stoned.
00:22:05,00:22:06,They were eaten alive.
00:22:06,00:22:07,He's not alive.
00:22:07,00:22:08,He's eaten alive.
00:22:08,00:22:09,How do you eat cats?
00:22:09,00:22:10,I eat cats.
00:22:10,00:22:11,You keep a lot of decoying them all.
00:22:11,00:22:12,"Man, you just grab it."
00:22:12,00:22:14,I guess you hold out the legs and just start tromping.
00:22:14,00:22:15,I don't know.
00:22:15,00:22:17,They've gone from gods to being evil.
00:22:17,00:22:18,Yeah.
00:22:18,00:22:19,And now we just put them on the internet and laugh at them.
00:22:19,00:22:20,We'll be gods against them.
00:22:20,00:22:21,We'll be gods against them.
00:22:21,00:22:22,We'll be gods against them.
00:22:22,00:22:23,We'll be gods against them.
00:22:23,00:22:24,We'll be gods against them.
00:22:24,00:22:31,"Okay, listen to that."
00:22:31,00:22:33,I'm going to quickly do my last effect.
00:22:33,00:22:38,I found that we have 28 people that we know slept with Queen Elizabeth for first.
00:22:38,00:22:40,And that they were all women.
00:22:40,00:22:41,Whoa!
00:22:41,00:22:42,What?
00:22:42,00:22:44,"It's when you say ""slept with""?"
00:22:44,00:22:45,"You mean ""slept in the same bedroom""?"
00:22:45,00:22:46,Yes.
00:22:46,00:22:47,Yeah.
00:22:47,00:22:48,"Well, it did not sound right to you."
00:22:48,00:22:49,Same bedroom.
00:22:49,00:22:50,In the same bedroom?
00:22:50,00:22:51,"Yes, same bedroom."
00:22:51,00:22:53,"The interesting thing about Queen Elizabeth, I actually made a documentary"
00:22:53,00:22:54,for two out of five years together.
00:22:54,00:22:55,It was awfully ridiculous.
00:22:55,00:22:57,"Well, we sort of went, ""Did she have a lot of child?"""
00:22:57,00:22:58,Yeah.
00:22:58,00:22:59,I did she or...
00:22:59,00:23:00,"Well, no."
00:23:00,00:23:02,There was a remiss she did.
00:23:02,00:23:04,"Spanish used it, it's propaganda."
00:23:04,00:23:05,"Obviously, I don't think she did."
00:23:05,00:23:07,But you can't listen to her first.
00:23:07,00:23:10,She probably didn't spend more than five minutes of her life alone.
00:23:10,00:23:13,She was constantly surrounded by people everywhere she went.
00:23:13,00:23:14,She was born on princess.
00:23:14,00:23:15,She was always going to be a princess.
00:23:15,00:23:17,And then she blew the coin and then she died.
00:23:17,00:23:19,"So, you have ladies in waiting who, of course,"
00:23:19,00:23:21,would sleep in the same room as her.
00:23:21,00:23:23,You'd have sort of trouble beds at the bottom of the bed usually.
00:23:23,00:23:24,They would sleep in or maybe...
00:23:24,00:23:25,"By beds, like..."
00:23:25,00:23:27,More of a sort of a pull out little...
00:23:27,00:23:28,"Oh, like the cupboard."
00:23:28,00:23:30,"Yeah, like under beds, like, you know."
00:23:30,00:23:33,But these people didn't really have any kind of private space.
00:23:33,00:23:36,"But the queen can never go like, ""I want some alone time."""
00:23:36,00:23:38,"Maybe, but we don't only records for that."
00:23:38,00:23:39,And you know what else?
00:23:39,00:23:41,I don't think this time period ever existed so far then.
00:23:41,00:23:43,"So, what does this fact mean then?"
00:23:43,00:23:45,Does it mean that she slept with way more than that?
00:23:45,00:23:48,"Basically, it's a way of bringing up this interesting fact"
00:23:48,00:23:50,that the monarchs would have sleeping partners
00:23:50,00:23:53,before companionship and for safety and whatever.
00:23:53,00:23:59,"I read that Gandhi used to sleep with naked, female virgins"
00:23:59,00:24:01,to test his chastity.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"So, they would lay next to him in bed."
00:24:03,00:24:04,Wow.
00:24:04,00:24:07,"Yeah, and just so he could be like, ""Mmm, look how awesome I am."""
00:24:07,00:24:08,Look at nothing.
00:24:08,00:24:10,"I don't want to knock Gandhi on our show, but..."
00:24:10,00:24:11,"Oh, not Gandhi."
00:24:11,00:24:12,That's weird.
00:24:12,00:24:16,"No, but maybe he was caught the first time by his wife."
00:24:16,00:24:18,"He's like, ""Oh, my God, you're having a ferry."""
00:24:18,00:24:21,"He's like, ""No, no, honey, hey, I am testing my chastity."""
00:24:21,00:24:22,Yeah.
00:24:22,00:24:23,You're going to...
00:24:23,00:24:24,"Yeah, I'll do it every night."
00:24:24,00:24:25,Right?
00:24:25,00:24:26,But there's a nice story.
00:24:26,00:24:27,I think it's in the Bible.
00:24:27,00:24:30,"You might be able to help us more here on ""Resonant Jew."""
00:24:30,00:24:31,But it's...
00:24:31,00:24:33,"King David, I think, has a woman called..."
00:24:33,00:24:34,Is it Abishag?
00:24:34,00:24:35,Who...
00:24:35,00:24:36,Abishag.
00:24:36,00:24:37,I think she's...
00:24:37,00:24:39,She's the official human water bottle.
00:24:39,00:24:40,He gets really old.
00:24:40,00:24:41,Wow.
00:24:41,00:24:43,"Yeah, and just the woman that he cuddles with."
00:24:43,00:24:44,Exactly.
00:24:44,00:24:46,"And she's a young, beautiful, beautiful virgin"
00:24:46,00:24:47,and she gets in the bed with him
00:24:47,00:24:49,and her job is to warm him up at night.
00:24:49,00:24:51,And the whole time.
00:24:51,00:24:53,It has an interesting translation
00:24:53,00:24:56,to 20th century care of U.S. presidents.
00:24:56,00:24:57,Yeah.
00:24:57,00:25:00,"And this is mentioned in my father's Ted Med talk,"
00:25:00,00:25:02,which I didn't mean applied to much.
00:25:02,00:25:05,Considering it's probably only got like 20 views
00:25:05,00:25:06,'cause it's a Ted Med talk.
00:25:06,00:25:07,We'll post that.
00:25:07,00:25:08,We'll post this talk.
00:25:08,00:25:09,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:09,00:25:10,It's almost the top.
00:25:10,00:25:13,But Eisenhower had a lot of heart attacks.
00:25:13,00:25:15,Just like constantly having heart attacks.
00:25:15,00:25:17,"Like, you wake up and you go to a doctor"
00:25:17,00:25:18,"and the doctor's like, ""Hey, you had a heart attack, wasn't it?"""
00:25:18,00:25:22,"And like, he was prescribed a prescription"
00:25:22,00:25:24,that he snuggled with Mamie Eisenhower.
00:25:24,00:25:27,"But that basically was his, like,"
00:25:27,00:25:29,it was a fair prescription for a long time
00:25:29,00:25:31,that literally to have like a cuddle buddy
00:25:31,00:25:32,would calm him down.
00:25:32,00:25:33,Would calm anybody down.
00:25:33,00:25:34,Yeah.
00:25:34,00:25:36,"But like, it was, it was, it's been prevailing knowledge"
00:25:36,00:25:39,"up until pretty recently that having someone to like snuggle,"
00:25:39,00:25:41,"like Teddy bears, there was, there are some papers"
00:25:41,00:25:43,"that in New England, they used to circulate a lot"
00:25:43,00:25:46,'cause I guess New England is where I'm from Boston
00:25:46,00:25:49,"is like, I guess Teddy bear sort of started in Vermont."
00:25:49,00:25:51,"And again, I'm sure a QI question is where I'm from."
00:25:51,00:25:52,Teddy Roosevelt.
00:25:52,00:25:53,"Yeah, we think so."
00:25:53,00:25:54,Do you really?
00:25:54,00:25:56,"Yeah, do you think the Teddy bear Teddy Roosevelt?"
00:25:56,00:25:57,Yeah.
00:25:57,00:25:58,"Yeah, it's 1903, isn't it?"
00:25:58,00:25:59,It infuses the shooter bear.
00:25:59,00:26:00,Is that right?
00:26:00,00:26:01,He's hunting and he refuses to shoot.
00:26:01,00:26:02,Yeah.
00:26:02,00:26:04,And Kermit Roosevelt was the first westerner to shoot a panda
00:26:04,00:26:05,or something.
00:26:05,00:26:06,Really?
00:26:06,00:26:07,Really?
00:26:07,00:26:08,"I might be wrong about that, so."
00:26:08,00:26:09,I'm just an interject.
00:26:09,00:26:10,I'm just Kermit.
00:26:10,00:26:11,It was Kermit and Theodore.
00:26:11,00:26:12,Teddy's son.
00:26:12,00:26:14,And they shot the panda together.
00:26:14,00:26:15,So they both agreed.
00:26:15,00:26:16,They both shot.
00:26:16,00:26:19,"Yeah, they both shot with their separate guns."
00:26:19,00:26:22,They both claimed to be the first westerners to kill giant panda.
00:26:22,00:26:23,The kill giant panda.
00:26:23,00:26:24,Isn't that touching?
00:26:24,00:26:25,Yeah.
00:26:25,00:26:26,"Oh, not notes."
00:26:26,00:26:27,And then it's home.
00:26:27,00:26:34,"Yeah, we should wrap up now."
00:26:34,00:26:37,"But if you want to ask any one of us any questions about things we've spoken out today,"
