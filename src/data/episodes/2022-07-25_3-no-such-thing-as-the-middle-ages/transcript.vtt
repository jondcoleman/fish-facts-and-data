WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.160
 Yeah.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.360
 And which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.680
 And it's not such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.080
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.720
 No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:28.800
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.400
 This is a special episode in which, rather than having strictly

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.760
 just the QILs sitting around the microphone this week,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.240
 we've got two special guests.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.880
 We have a comedian from Brooklyn, New York, originally

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.040
 from Boston, Alex Edelman, who amongst interesting things

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.320
 you've got going on, it's you've got a current text

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.040
 relationship with Lindsey Lohan.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.400
 You once severely angered Neil Armstrong and a lift.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.400
 Yep.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.200
 What else is there?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.680
 There's plenty more of this stuff.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.600
 And we're also joined by the historical consultant

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.680
 from the Horrible History's TV series, Greg Jenner.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.360
 Who outside of that, if you hang out with Greg Jenner,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.240
 as Alex will know, at any kind of social event

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.520
 is mod, like a rock star, basically.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.720
 You just have groupies.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.320
 Yes, fans coming up to him.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.600
 Are you having a relationship with any American celebrity

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.320
 females?

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.480
 Sadly not.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.240
 George Washington's the person I get.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.520
 So also joining us, we have James Harkin.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.480
 And doing all the fact checking, as we go along today,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.240
 is Anna Chazinski, oh, and I'm Dan.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.840
 So we should start by saying that this is the first time

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.960
 you've been to the office, Greg, to the QI offices.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.000
 This is not the first time Alex has been.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.520
 Alex is-- you're almost like a part of the family now.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.080
 I'm going to try to cut down, because I--

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.640
 Well, and you're going back to America tomorrow.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.160
 Yeah.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.160
 I don't think that counts.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.760
 I'm trying to cut down.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.520
 But I'll be back.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.120
 I'll be back at the end of this month.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.960
 Basically, as soon as Alex comes in the office,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.040
 that's the end of work for the dressing room.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.600
 Well, you know, the thing is, this office is like the--

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.200
 is like what I would like the inside of my mind to look like.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.160
 Just neatly ordered and filled with facts, all categorized.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.440
 Like, literally, I feel like you could find any fact

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.880
 in this office, because there's a lot--

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.000
 Well, there is just a lot of books, there's a lot of folders.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.160
 There's-- we've got the internet.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.080
 And everyone's like, yeah, I'm going to say--

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.880
 I'm going to say, technically, it can just be a closet

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.880
 with a laptop, and that would still hold true.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.360
 So OK, well, so as this is a special one,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.360
 maybe we'll start with-- yeah, we'll start with you, Greg.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.480
 Oh, good, at least we'll say one.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's begin with the sort of rambling

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.720
 you can go here and--

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.720
 Yeah, I read the excerpt.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.360
 That's what I would say.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.880
 The excerpt.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.920
 Well, just give us what--

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.760
 It's your favorite thing that's kind of on your mind

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.320
 this week, the thing that you've learned.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.680
 This is my first week off after writing my book,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.440
 my first of a book.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.160
 So I'll just try and pull up.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.520
 I think it comes up next year.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.920
 Are you allowed to say anything about the book?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.320
 Yeah, I can tell you the title.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.440
 Yes.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.280
 It's called One Million Years in a Day.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.040
 Stone Age to Phone Age is the range.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.720
 And it's sort of structured around a modern age.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.320
 That's the range.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.320
 That's the range.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.960
 That's the range to Phone Age to Phone Age.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.480
 That's the group is just the medium.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.000
 No, I thought-- I just-- something I just--

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.640
 I put in the book and I thought it was quite an interesting fact,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.120
 really, that the earliest known dentistry is 9,000 years

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.640
 up.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.880
 This is back in theolithic, really.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.240
 So like, mammoths were walking the earth with sensors.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.240
 Like, yeah, he's--

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.760
 [GROANS]

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.800
 So we're talking here in--

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.880
 I suppose, modern day Pakistan.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.400
 That's what we call it.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.520
 It's a place called Miggard, I suppose.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.120
 It's not my pronunciation, it's not great.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.720
 But archaeologists have found teeth which have been drilled.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.040
 And they've been sort of, you know,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.360
 it's the earliest, really, sort of fillings

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.520
 or or early drilling technique using a bow drill, which

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.880
 is, you know, just a sort of wiggling bit of sharp stick,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.040
 which is a technique used, really, for jewelry.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.520
 So not even teeth cleaning because I knew

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.480
 that the Egyptians had a foreshare toothbrushes.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.160
 Even reparative dentistry goes back there.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.880
 So this would be medicinal dentistry.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.120
 This would be pain relief.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.360
 Yeah, I guess it's an obvious thing.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.800
 Because their people would have been in so much pain, wouldn't they?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.400
 Yeah.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.520
 Although I remember reading that, like sugar cane sugar

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.720
 came in relatively late.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.560
 So people didn't have as bad teeth in the early time

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.360
 as they have today.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.680
 It's interesting, actually, there's been a couple of major studies

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.840
 in past couple years that are shown that's not really true, actually.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.000
 There's an awful lot of dental wear and tear.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.120
 Wear and tear, but also it's sugar based, actually,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.040
 because there's quite a lot of sugar in natural fruits and so forth.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.560
 And obviously, if you're not brushing your teeth every day,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.760
 it will build up.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.840
 Is it complex sugars that really do harm you?

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.920
 Yeah, I mean, the worst dentistry in history,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.360
 I think, if you were to sort of elect an era,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.920
 I would say probably the 18th century, the Georgians.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.400
 The 18th century's where dentistry begins as a modern discipline,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.600
 but it's also where really dentistry teeth were at that worst.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.040
 If you look at portraits, no one smiles.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.560
 Yes.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.680
 And so all the first ever smile, I can't remember

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.120
 as a female artist, a French female artist.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.640
 I think it's in Le Brant, I think maybe.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.440
 Could you check that out?

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.680
 Marie Le Brant, perhaps.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.960
 It's a really famous painting, and it's very controversial,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.000
 because I think it's a self-portrait.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.960
 I think she's grinning.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.800
 Wow.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.480
 And it's the reason you didn't grin before,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.480
 because your teeth were so bad.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.880
 Your teeth were all fun.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.000
 Who is it who you're in for mouthwash, was that?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.840
 The Romans.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.840
 The Romans.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.840
 Wow.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.680
 Wow.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.480
 Who's that just me?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.240
 Romans brush their teeth, to send its dentists.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.560
 They use rides.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.160
 I mean, the Egyptians didn't do dental surgery, particularly.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.560
 They were very good dentists.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.040
 They were the first known dentists in human history,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.040
 the first named dentists are Egyptian.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.840
 They were.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.840
 They found, I think, in 2006, I think they found a tomb

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.040
 with three named dentists on the wall, sort of written in.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.720
 So they were like a company name.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.600
 You should be a scientist for shulmen.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.400
 Yeah, like dentists of the Pharaohs.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.640
 And they were royal dentists.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.520
 So they were sort of official dentists to a Pharaoh,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.360
 and these three guys were clearly sort of official tooth

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.040
 products.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.680
 There was a recent meta-study done on Egyptian mummies.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.680
 I think 40% of them might be wrong.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.000
 I think 40% had serious dental disease.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.520
 Wow.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.920
 And dental disease could kill you.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.680
 My father's a physician.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.880
 And he says something really interesting,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.520
 that historically, the people who get the worst care

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.000
 are the famous and the wealthy.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.160
 Because what he's being ironic, what he's saying is typically

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.040
 famous people have been killed by over-medicating or over-operating

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.160
 or too much complex treatment, like as soon as the body

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.520
 will repair itself.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.920
 We talked in an earlier podcast about James Gaffield,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.120
 who was a pro-deter, a lot of dirty fingers,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.720
 and the moon, and stuff like that.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.320
 My father gave a TED talk on it, which

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.400
 is actually really interesting.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.760
 His name is Eliza Adelman.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.440
 So I wonder if those pharaohs were receiving

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.400
 a lot of dental attention or a big getting such rich food

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.000
 that they were in there?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.760
 Well, that's the big question, so the quality of food,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.120
 obviously, is going to affect things.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.200
 I mean, let's see.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.160
 The iceman found in North Teruvian Alps.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.640
 He had really, really messed up teeth.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.640
 What was the fact that you were saying about the baseball player?

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.800
 I can't remember his name, but he was a baseball player

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.520
 who had to be taken out of the game

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.800
 because he bit himself on his own ass.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.400
 And what happened was he slid into the final base,

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.200
 and his false teeth fell out and learned about it.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.280
 I'm sure you know about it.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.160
 So what we were saying, though, is that he

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.720
 must have been in his 20s, right?

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.080
 But yeah, there he was with a full set of false teeth,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.520
 because that was a thing that happened.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.440
 Had his teeth been knocked out?

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.720
 It was in the 1920s.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.560
 Apparently, he was called Clarence Blethan,

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.000
 and he's now called Clarence Climax Blethan.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.080
 I don't really understand how it was born there.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.200
 Yeah, in a really particular gimmick.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.200
 Yeah.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.200
 No teeth you say.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.080
 Oh, Alex, I have to tell you, just as an American and a baseball fan,

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.680
 if you don't know this, it's my favorite baseball fact.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.960
 So, you know, Lou Gehrig?

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.960
 What, and a disease?

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.800
 Exactly.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.480
 You really should have seen that one coming.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.520
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.920
 So this is what's fantastic about it.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.400
 Turns out that Lou Gehrig didn't die of Lou Gehrig's disease.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.480
 So the disease named after him, you didn't have--

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.920
 There's an interesting Wikipedia list

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.680
 that people have been killed by already deceased people.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.280
 My favorite one is someone killed, not by a deceased person,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.520
 but by deceased animal, a really notorious poacher in Montana.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.920
 This is a story that people in Montana like to tell.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.760
 And like, this poacher outside of Helena,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.200
 he was really famous for shooting deer,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.320
 and people told him that there was one particular deer

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.440
 that he'd never be able to get.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.360
 And he wounded it a whole bunch of times.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.120
 And finally, he spotted on a bluff

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.480
 across over over him, and he shot it,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.080
 and he turned around and celebrated.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.160
 And the deer bounced all the way down and landed on him, and killed him.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.640
 And the deer survived.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.800
 Oh, wow.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.720
 That's fun.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.120
 Yeah, the guy didn't.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.520
 We should move on to another fact.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.020
 Yeah.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.920
 Just quickly.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.420
 Yes.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.600
 So it's by, obviously, Greg was right.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.960
 I mean, he's a historian about the first ever smile

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.600
 in a portrait was in 1787, but it was quite funny.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.680
 The corp gossip sheet, at the time,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.560
 said, "An affectation which artists, art lovers,

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.400
 and persons of taste have been united in condemning,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.800
 and which finds no precedent among the ancients

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.400
 is that in smiling, she shows her teeth."

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.200
 So, you know, pretty outrageous.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.160
 I found an amazing collection of photos

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.760
 from a period pre-smile, where they did all the grim, kind of,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.120
 straight face-looking.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.240
 And it's outtake photos, where the families crack up,

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.160
 and they're laughing.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.600
 And it's so interesting, because it's the first time

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.200
 where you see the real personalities.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.680
 And that's so interesting, I'm going through, yeah.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.600
 Where they're just, they're properly laughing out loud.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.160
 And clearly, the person's like, "Well, this is unusable."

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.320
 Yeah.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.520
 Like, you don't look creepy, and you don't look solid.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.840
 Yeah.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.320
 Like a smile.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.640
 Yeah.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.040
 This is rather a dip, Michael.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.560
 I'm not as if you were looking.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.560
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.960
 All right, let's move on to our second fact.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.640
 I want to throw in my fact here, particularly,

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.040
 because I want to hear your thoughts on this, Craig.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.760
 It's a theory from a guy called Dr. Hans Ulrich Neymitz,

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.600
 which is that the Middle Ages never happened.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.920
 Oh, wow.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.520
 So it's a thing called phantom time theory.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.600
 It's basically his alleges that it was just made up.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.840
 Are you sure that the guy is Dr. Hans Ulrich?

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.560
 Yeah, I know.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.760
 A lot of people believe it.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.520
 You know, obviously, a lot of idiots believe it.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:58.280
 But according to them, 614 to 911 AD did not happen.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:58.920
 Did not happen.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.160
 We're going through it now.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.560
 What is the basis for this theory?

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.080
 This is not the case.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.520
 It thinks it's a conspiracy of the calendar.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.040
 Brilliant.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.840
 Yeah.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.680
 And so what his suggestion is, as well,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.920
 is that the things that were supposed to have happened

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.680
 in the Middle Ages, people at the time

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.080
 removed them from that bit of history

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.600
 and created a fiction of these 300 years.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.800
 I think he said Charlemagne just never existed.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.320
 What was a fictional character?

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.080
 So basically, half of the things that you do for a living

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.720
 just--

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.920
 My mouth is degraded, yeah.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.320
 It's a fictional-- yeah.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.800
 I'll give you some direct sort of from this article.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.720
 It seems that historians are plagued by plethora

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.880
 of falsified documents from the Middle Ages.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.400
 Some documents forged by the Roman Catholic Church

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.560
 during the Middle Ages were created hundreds of years

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.800
 before their great moments arrived,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.680
 after which they were embraced by medieval society,

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.920
 this implying that whoever produced these fraudaries

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.040
 must have very skillfully anticipated the future.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.160
 Or there was some discrepancy in calculating days.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:51.720
 Well, houses.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.720
 So where does he stand on the Vikings?

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.720
 [SIGHS]

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.720
 One Vikings.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.720
 They did not burn their limits, but they didn't know what happened.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.440
 In this one, it wasn't a fact that it was just he just didn't

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.440
 happen and--

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:05.940
 Yeah.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.280
 And I was shot in a man, and I was shot in a man.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.240
 Alfred the Great was just--

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.160
 No, I didn't say it.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.800
 He says that maybe Alfred the Great was

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.760
 in a different period of time.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.840
 Maybe the Vikings, you know, maybe they were just

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.760
 the year before.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.280
 So he stops at 9/11 to see--

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:21.800
 9/11 to see--

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.680
 He stops at 9/11.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.200
 9/11?

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.800
 No, he stops at 9/11.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.000
 No one likes his various theories.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.640
 9/11 is the year that the Vikings conquer Normandy

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:28.560
 and become the Normans.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.480
 It's Rolo, King Rolo, who found the Normandy

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.680
 on the levels that the Vikings become Normans.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.480
 And the Normans, of course, become

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.720
 William the Conqueror, and that becomes our first dynasty

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.680
 of English medieval kings.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.000
 So 9/11 to good year.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.080
 But this goes with the thing that you like, Dan, which

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.880
 is that if you come up with an idea or a conspiracy,

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.760
 then you can always seem to fit in--

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.160
 You can find facts into whatever your theory is.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.760
 And you can imagine, if you said to him, what about the Vikings?

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.480
 He would have announced--

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.680
 He won't have an answer, yeah.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.180
 But if I know--

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.320
 If I know the analogy in the Bible, isn't it?

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.400
 People sort of try to find patterns in the Bible.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.320
 And you sort of go, you do realize it's

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.360
 been re-translated in loans of time.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.080
 So all right, final question, then.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.480
 Is there any truth that the militias didn't happen?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.440
 I would be deeply, deeply absurd.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.960
 I mean, you're going to say--

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.480
 Well, I mean, say, do you really?

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.480
 Yeah, I would, actually.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:20.080
 I'm just going to stick with my life when it makes this thing.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.240
 No, I'd be, I'd be intrigued.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.000
 I mean, it's true.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.160
 We should be very deeply suspicious and skeptical of the past,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.320
 and one of the things that historians do

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.920
 is we rigorously interrogate documents.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.480
 And we'd always try to disprove them.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.520
 We're trying to apply that sort of scientific methodology

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.080
 of saying, how do we know this is true?

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.560
 And that's what great scholarship is.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.400
 But you don't destroy all things.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.880
 You're just trying to question them and say, OK.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.600
 And obviously, there were problems with forgeries.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.520
 A monastery, for example, would be given land,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.880
 and they would lose the document.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.880
 And then a king would turn up going,

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.880
 great, I'm having a land back.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.120
 And they'd be like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.000
 This is ours, we've always had it.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.360
 So they'd forge a document.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.520
 And then we get the forgery.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.520
 Great.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.080
 I read that, you know, Andara, the country.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.680
 They have a constitution.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.920
 But it's in a safe in Andara somewhere.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.240
 And a lot of historians think that it's fake.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:03.840
 Really?

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.640
 You heard that from them?

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.520
 No, I haven't.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.600
 Breaking what's in, like, it doesn't exist at all.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.560
 As in, yeah, it's a modern reproduction

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.240
 because they don't have the historical basis

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.240
 that they think they have.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.120
 Because it was one of those states

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.040
 that came in to buffer from the 15th century laws.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.640
 Yeah, the Italian laws.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.400
 If it were to be true, this phantom times thing,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.960
 which is 110% not, yeah.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.680
 Then what it would mean is, I mean,

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.200
 no new scholarship is emerging.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.160
 A new scholarship is emerging all the time.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:35.680
 Yeah, it is.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.320
 So it would be insane.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.160
 But it would also kick off a really interrupt

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.280
 with a carbon date.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.880
 Yeah, I was just thinking about that.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.800
 We use historical documents to try and ally up

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.480
 with carbon dating.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.520
 And you use carbon dating to try and ally up with historical

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.040
 documents.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.400
 You try and play them off against each other

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.640
 and try and find a cross-reference.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.600
 And that way, if they go to agree,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.040
 you kind of go, all right, maybe that's legit.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.400
 With Richard III discovering the car part recently,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.600
 the carbon dating there can sort of give you

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.640
 that specificity scientifically,

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.200
 which then legitimizes the documents

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.200
 that told us he was there.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:07.720
 Yes, OK.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.000
 So then we can kind of go, ah, these are OK.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.760
 Maybe we can look at them closely for something else.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.640
 So that's a way of verifying.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.480
 It's a way of verifying.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.200
 Because you're using the scientific method

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.720
 to sort of say, OK, this is the archaeology's legit.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.280
 So maybe the history's OK.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.640
 Physicists like to use really old lead

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.800
 for their experiments because it's quite--

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.280
 it doesn't react with as many things,

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.680
 but that means they're trying to use a lot of archaeological

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.600
 items to make their experiments.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.840
 Yeah, I've heard about it briefly.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.680
 I don't know if that's--

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.400
 I mean, it just makes sense, wouldn't it, maybe?

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.400
 Yeah.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.120
 But then, yeah, it's not really great to feel

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.680
 as someone else's stuff.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.200
 It's Richard III.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.760
 Can I borrow that from someone?

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.640
 I've got an experiment on, just, you know,

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.320
 and even all King.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.440
 Yeah, so I should imagine that James was right,

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.960
 that er, though, is a theory, which, in fact,

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.680
 sounds quite well-founded that the Andoran Constitution

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.560
 is a forgery, although this isn't a book.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.920
 So apparently, it came from Charlemagne.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.520
 It was signed at the Independence of Andoros.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.040
 This document--

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.320
 Oh, we all know Charlemagne, didn't it?

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.400
 I think we've established that.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.720
 I think we've established that.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.360
 Otherwise, I'm reading it in a book where they've

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.400
 spelled-- it's a book.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.960
 It's Andorra Business Law Handbook,

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.320
 but they've spelled Charlemagne, Charlemagne.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:10.920
 He's a dog.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.560
 He was a dog with a therapist.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.640
 I don't know.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.080
 I don't know if Charles's worthy though.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:15.600
 OK.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.400
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.320
 All right, so we're going to go on to--

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.800
 We'll do Alex's respect now.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.280
 Alex?

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.320
 My fact is, it's about the most medically indispensable

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.320
 sea creature in the United States is the horseshoe crab.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.680
 Are you aware of the--

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.200
 No, go on.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.360
 It's a wide, wide claim to make, isn't it?

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.680
 Yeah, how does that work?

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.480
 Well, so the horseshoe crab lives

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.120
 in the very bacteria-rich coastline shallow waters

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.280
 in the ocean.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.280
 So in the early '20s, they were sort of seen

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.280
 as a nuisance, and they were ground up, and used as fertilizer

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.640
 and stuff, in fact, to pegs.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:58.760
 And now, every year, a half million horseshoe crabs

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.920
 are harvested, and they're brought into factories

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.680
 by one of five companies all along the eastern coast

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.880
 of the United States.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.520
 And they're blood alive.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.600
 And their blood is baby blue.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.120
 And if you can find a picture, it's incredibly interesting.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.360
 And this blood-- it detects any malignant, dangerous bacterial

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.360
 undertoxins, even at a concentration of one part per trillion.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.920
 So the FDA requires that all drugs,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.640
 all new drugs that are brought to market

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.680
 be run through this horseshoe crab blood.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.600
 So every single person in the United States

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.040
 who's ever had an injection of any kind

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.160
 has had a drug that's been tested in this LAL test.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.040
 Oh, that's amazing.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.800
 That is incredible, yeah.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.480
 It's unbelievable.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.760
 And the blood per quart is $15,000.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.040
 So they don't kill the crabs.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.560
 So that's like--

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.560
 So people love that.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.800
 Yeah, they just leave them.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.880
 And then they take them on a boat all the way out to sea

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.120
 so they don't reharvest crabs that they've already taken.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.120
 They look like a great holiday crew.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.520
 They make us have done a really good thing.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.000
 But they dumped these guys really far out.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.360
 And they noticed that less and less of them

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.240
 are coming back.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.480
 Well, you don't kill something when you take a lot of its blood.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.000
 It does make it more lethargic and less likely to make.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.720
 But yeah, so that's to me.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.640
 That's very exciting.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.640
 Then that's really cool.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.480
 Yeah.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.040
 That they have basically the best immune system of anyone.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.560
 They do.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.240
 We can use--

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.080
 Yeah, my favorite crab.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.040
 Have you heard of the samurai crab?

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.680
 No, but it sounds like a movie.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.120
 No, it's very exciting.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.120
 It's very exciting.

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.120
 So it's--

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.920
 Basically, black and black sideways.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.720
 There was a superstition that samurai warriors,

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.480
 when they died, were reincarnated as these crabs.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.040
 Because a lot of these crabs that came up

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.400
 had the pattern on their shell of a samurai face.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.080
 That's brilliant.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.040
 And it became an evolutionary thing.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.640
 So it's the samurai pattern that became the--

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.720
 That is brilliant.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.220
 Wow.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.160
 And so they would throw the ones that looked like a samurai

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.280
 back into the ocean.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.320
 That's brilliant.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.080
 Are there other stories of animals

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.880
 selectively surviving like that?

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.880
 So I was wondering--

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.080
 Why do dogs are supposed to be a bit like that in cats?

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.080
 In cats?

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.880
 Cats domesticated themselves.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.440
 Because cats, when they me out, they

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.680
 don't me out to other cats.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.760
 They only do it to humans.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.560
 Oh, really?

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.680
 They've selected to me out just so that we

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.000
 would think they're little babies.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.200
 We domesticated dogs.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.080
 We deliberately took wolves.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.480
 And when-- please stop biting me.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.560
 I like it when you're dog please.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.720
 And the amazing thing is that you can domesticate an animal

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.480
 really, really quickly.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.040
 There's a Russian scientist who did it in the '50s with foxes.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.280
 I think he was-- what was his name?

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.000
 Things would be, I think.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.320
 Beardina, for some reason.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.200
 He took foxes, feral, wild, angry foxes,

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.280
 trying to eat his face.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.080
 And he just bred them and bred them and bred them.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.280
 I was always taking the most docile cubs

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.080
 and bringing together.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.240
 Belli-ai.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.080
 Belli-ai-ai.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:34.600
 Belli-ai-ai-ai.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.080
 Belli-ai-ai.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:35.600
 Belli-ai-ai-ai.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.080
 That's one of the brilliant answers.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.640
 Belli-ai-ai-ai.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.240
 But he bred them together so that you

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.840
 ended up with these sort of more increasingly docile creatures.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.920
 The only thing that he discovered was that when

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.960
 you breed for physical characteristics,

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.760
 it also creates a personality chain.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.640
 They became more sort of dog-like, more sort of fluffy-tailed

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.240
 and more sort of willing to follow around.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.240
 But they also changed--

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.000
 Or sequious.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.200
 But they did, yes.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.440
 But they sequious foxes.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.640
 They're sequious foxes.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.960
 But they will also change their personality and demeanor

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.400
 and the fact they'll respond to calls and so on.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.680
 And they did that in like 10 generations.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.600
 That's all it took.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.520
 There's been awful lot of genetic testing recently,

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.840
 because we can now do DNA analysis on animals.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.800
 And we found that actually dogs are much older than we thought.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.440
 So do we think that we got them for companionship or fighting

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.080
 or it's probably hunting companionship?

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.200
 Because we had pet bear.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.400
 There was definitely at least one pet bear to be

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.400
 found in the Stone Age.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.440
 Well, Byron had a pet bear.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.280
 Byron did have a pet bear.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.280
 Byron had a pet bear?

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.040
 He took it to Cambridge.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.880
 We took it to Cambridge.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.920
 Because he wasn't allowed a dog.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.840
 So he was vivid in it, and he said,

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.120
 I can have a bear.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.080
 This is before after he sounded the hamburger chainers.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.680
 Is that the most ridiculous?

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.200
 I'll wait.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.040
 Someone kept a pet scorpion in a jar on his desk.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.240
 I read this in one of your boxes.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:46.760
 Yeah.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.200
 I read that in one of the QI books, which are available

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.560
 in fine-box stores everywhere.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.760
 Yeah.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.840
 Probably the same books as Greg's book

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.160
 will be available in next year.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.680
 Yeah.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.040
 Oh, they have all the workshops.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:58.720
 Yeah, I think.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.800
 Talk about them sequestries.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.400
 An extraordinary effect of this sort of dog thing

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.880
 to be an extraordinary thing is we obviously

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.320
 domesticated dogs because to do that,

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.400
 you have to sort of take a wild, feral wolf

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400
 that is trying to kill you.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.800
 And gradually tame it.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.920
 But it's not taming.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.000
 It's breeding it.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.560
 You take your runt of a litter, and the runt of a litter,

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.200
 you bring this together, and gradually you breed them,

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.160
 and you create a new animal.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.640
 And that is the dog.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.000
 The amazing thing is that the oldest dog breed in the world

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.640
 is only a sort of 1,000 years old or something.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.520
 Roman dogs don't exist anymore.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.000
 So when you find a Roman dog at Pompeii,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.760
 which we have found one, that breed no longer exists.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.320
 Doesn't exist anymore.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.240
 Wow.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:30.760
 But--

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.480
 Is it because they die out?

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.080
 Well, the breeding program has changed,

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.800
 and you have sort of different needs of them.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.760
 And animals are constantly evolving and changing,

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.880
 and we breed them in different ways.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.360
 And George Washington bred dogs.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.120
 George Washington bred the American fox sound.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.560
 He took a French fox sound from the monkey to the fiat,

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.360
 and an English fox sound, and he bred them together

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.840
 and created the American fox sound.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.920
 Wow.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.920
 And he was really obsessed with this.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.440
 He was sort of typical 18th century gentleman.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.680
 And I'm like, I'm going to breed an animal.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.840
 But the amazing thing is cats domesticated themselves.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.840
 The oldest known cat, I think, is from the Shaila Boros,

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.000
 I think in Cyprus.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.560
 I think it's about 9,000 years old.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.280
 Is there any truth to the story when people attach cats

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.800
 to their shields to the Egyptians?

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.320
 Yes.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.120
 I love business, the battle.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.560
 I think Pallucian, I think, is top of my head,

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.160
 because the Egyptians believed cats to be holy and revered.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.040
 They had huge cat funeral monuments

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.560
 with like millions of buried cats.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.800
 If your cat died, you shaved with your eyebrows,

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.240
 and you would take your cat to this holy city of cats.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.840
 They found a lot of mummies, didn't they?

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.480
 Mummified cats, like a million of them.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.480
 A million of them.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.480
 A huge one, yeah.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.320
 And the city, I think, was called Bubastis.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.360
 Named after the, I think, might have made that up.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.520
 There was a definite city.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.440
 And they would bury the cats and they'd shave off their eyes.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.880
 It was working out for a time, by the way.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.880
 It was all right.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.840
 Then they'd never want to interrupt such a thousand tabs up.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.080
 But it was a great, and they'd hear what they'd say.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.240
 And they'd hear what they'd say.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.240
 It's called Bubastis.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240
 It's a good idea.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.240
 Good idea.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.240
 I wanted to make up some random natives.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.240
 But they worship cats.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.520
 And there's a famous story that a Roman soldier,

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.120
 who's in his chariot, and he ran over a cat.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.680
 And he was killed by an angry mob.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.640
 But then in the middle ages, people thought that cats were evil,

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.640
 didn't they?

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.120
 And they thought they thought they were witches' familiars.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.320
 But they used to be burned alive as well.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.320
 Louis XIV, for think.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.320
 Yeah, he did want to burn himself, didn't he?

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.320
 No, they didn't.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.320
 And he used to be ceremony through the monsters' pie out.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.320
 They used to be stoned.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.320
 They were eaten alive.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.320
 He's not alive.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.320
 He's eaten alive.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.320
 How do you eat cats?

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.320
 I eat cats.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.320
 You keep a lot of decoying them all.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.320
 Man, you just grab it.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.320
 I guess you hold out the legs and just start tromping.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.320
 I don't know.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.320
 They've gone from gods to being evil.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.320
 Yeah.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.320
 And now we just put them on the internet and laugh at them.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.320
 We'll be gods against them.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.320
 We'll be gods against them.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.320
 We'll be gods against them.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.320
 We'll be gods against them.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.320
 We'll be gods against them.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:31.320
 Okay, listen to that.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.320
 I'm going to quickly do my last effect.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:38.320
 I found that we have 28 people that we know slept with Queen Elizabeth for first.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.320
 And that they were all women.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.320
 Whoa!

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.320
 What?

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.320
 It's when you say "slept with"?

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.320
 You mean "slept in the same bedroom"?

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.320
 Yes.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.320
 Yeah.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.320
 Well, it did not sound right to you.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.320
 Same bedroom.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.320
 In the same bedroom?

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.320
 Yes, same bedroom.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.320
 The interesting thing about Queen Elizabeth, I actually made a documentary

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.320
 for two out of five years together.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.320
 It was awfully ridiculous.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.320
 Well, we sort of went, "Did she have a lot of child?"

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.320
 Yeah.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.320
 I did she or...

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.320
 Well, no.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.320
 There was a remiss she did.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.320
 Spanish used it, it's propaganda.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.320
 Obviously, I don't think she did.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.320
 But you can't listen to her first.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.320
 She probably didn't spend more than five minutes of her life alone.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.320
 She was constantly surrounded by people everywhere she went.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.320
 She was born on princess.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.320
 She was always going to be a princess.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.320
 And then she blew the coin and then she died.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.320
 So, you have ladies in waiting who, of course,

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.320
 would sleep in the same room as her.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.320
 You'd have sort of trouble beds at the bottom of the bed usually.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.320
 They would sleep in or maybe...

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.320
 By beds, like...

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.320
 More of a sort of a pull out little...

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.320
 Oh, like the cupboard.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.320
 Yeah, like under beds, like, you know.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.320
 But these people didn't really have any kind of private space.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.320
 But the queen can never go like, "I want some alone time."

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.320
 Maybe, but we don't only records for that.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.320
 And you know what else?

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.320
 I don't think this time period ever existed so far then.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.320
 So, what does this fact mean then?

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.320
 Does it mean that she slept with way more than that?

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.320
 Basically, it's a way of bringing up this interesting fact

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.320
 that the monarchs would have sleeping partners

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.320
 before companionship and for safety and whatever.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:59.320
 I read that Gandhi used to sleep with naked, female virgins

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.320
 to test his chastity.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.320
 So, they would lay next to him in bed.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.320
 Wow.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.320
 Yeah, and just so he could be like, "Mmm, look how awesome I am."

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.320
 Look at nothing.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.320
 I don't want to knock Gandhi on our show, but...

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.320
 Oh, not Gandhi.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.320
 That's weird.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.320
 No, but maybe he was caught the first time by his wife.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.320
 He's like, "Oh, my God, you're having a ferry."

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.320
 He's like, "No, no, honey, hey, I am testing my chastity."

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.320
 Yeah.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.320
 You're going to...

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.320
 Yeah, I'll do it every night.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.320
 Right?

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.320
 But there's a nice story.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.320
 I think it's in the Bible.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.320
 You might be able to help us more here on "Resonant Jew."

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.320
 But it's...

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.320
 King David, I think, has a woman called...

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.320
 Is it Abishag?

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.320
 Who...

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.320
 Abishag.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.320
 I think she's...

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.320
 She's the official human water bottle.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.320
 He gets really old.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.320
 Wow.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.320
 Yeah, and just the woman that he cuddles with.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.320
 Exactly.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.320
 And she's a young, beautiful, beautiful virgin

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.320
 and she gets in the bed with him

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.320
 and her job is to warm him up at night.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.320
 And the whole time.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.320
 It has an interesting translation

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.320
 to 20th century care of U.S. presidents.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.320
 Yeah.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.320
 And this is mentioned in my father's Ted Med talk,

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.320
 which I didn't mean applied to much.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.320
 Considering it's probably only got like 20 views

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.320
 'cause it's a Ted Med talk.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.320
 We'll post that.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.320
 We'll post this talk.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.320
 It's almost the top.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.320
 But Eisenhower had a lot of heart attacks.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.320
 Just like constantly having heart attacks.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.320
 Like, you wake up and you go to a doctor

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.320
 and the doctor's like, "Hey, you had a heart attack, wasn't it?"

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.320
 And like, he was prescribed a prescription

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.320
 that he snuggled with Mamie Eisenhower.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.320
 But that basically was his, like,

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.320
 it was a fair prescription for a long time

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.320
 that literally to have like a cuddle buddy

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.320
 would calm him down.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.320
 Would calm anybody down.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.320
 Yeah.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.320
 But like, it was, it was, it's been prevailing knowledge

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.320
 up until pretty recently that having someone to like snuggle,

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.320
 like Teddy bears, there was, there are some papers

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.320
 that in New England, they used to circulate a lot

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.320
 'cause I guess New England is where I'm from Boston

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.320
 is like, I guess Teddy bear sort of started in Vermont.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.320
 And again, I'm sure a QI question is where I'm from.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.320
 Teddy Roosevelt.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.320
 Yeah, we think so.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.320
 Do you really?

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.320
 Yeah, do you think the Teddy bear Teddy Roosevelt?

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.320
 Yeah.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.320
 Yeah, it's 1903, isn't it?

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.320
 It infuses the shooter bear.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.320
 Is that right?

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.320
 He's hunting and he refuses to shoot.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.320
 Yeah.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.320
 And Kermit Roosevelt was the first westerner to shoot a panda

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.320
 or something.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.320
 Really?

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.320
 Really?

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.320
 I might be wrong about that, so.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.320
 I'm just an interject.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.320
 I'm just Kermit.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.320
 It was Kermit and Theodore.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.320
 Teddy's son.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.320
 And they shot the panda together.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.320
 So they both agreed.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.320
 They both shot.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.320
 Yeah, they both shot with their separate guns.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.320
 They both claimed to be the first westerners to kill giant panda.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.320
 The kill giant panda.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.320
 Isn't that touching?

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.320
 Yeah.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.320
 Oh, not notes.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.320
 And then it's home.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:34.320
 Yeah, we should wrap up now.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.320
 But if you want to ask any one of us any questions about things we've spoken out today,

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.320
 you can get me on and try and learn things.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.320
 Yeah.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.320
 I'm on @XShakes.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.320
 And Alex will be on.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.320
 I'm Alex Underscore Edelman.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.320
 And this was all Twitter talking about by the way.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320
 Grace.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.320
 I shot it into the end.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.320
 Alex Underscore Edelman.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.320
 He will appear.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.320
 Yeah.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.320
 Oh, Greg.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.320
 Greg.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.320
 We're on the store, Jenna.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.320
 Yeah.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.320
 Okay.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.320
 And there's not on Twitter, but she can be got on @Clikipedia, which is the main UI Twitter page.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.320
 We're going to have a bunch of photos, I guess.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.320
 And a Ted Med clip up on the QI.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.320
 Oh, my father's going to kill me.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.320
 Dotcom/podcasts.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.320

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.320
 Thanks so much for joining us, guys.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.320
 So that was another edition of No Such Thing as a Fitch.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.320
 I'm going to call it a special title, No Such Thing as the Middle Ages.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.320
 That's going to be the...

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.320
 Oh, but that'll be like on the iTunes thing.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.320

 Alright.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.320
