1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,160
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,360
 And which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,680
 And it's not such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,080
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,720
 No such thing as a fish.

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:28,800
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,400
 This is a special episode in which, rather than having strictly

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,760
 just the QILs sitting around the microphone this week,

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,240
 we've got two special guests.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,880
 We have a comedian from Brooklyn, New York, originally

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,040
 from Boston, Alex Edelman, who amongst interesting things

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,320
 you've got going on, it's you've got a current text

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,040
 relationship with Lindsey Lohan.

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,400
 You once severely angered Neil Armstrong and a lift.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
 Yep.

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,200
 What else is there?

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,680
 There's plenty more of this stuff.

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,600
 And we're also joined by the historical consultant

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,680
 from the Horrible History's TV series, Greg Jenner.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,360
 Who outside of that, if you hang out with Greg Jenner,

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,240
 as Alex will know, at any kind of social event

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,520
 is mod, like a rock star, basically.

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,720
 You just have groupies.

27
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,320
 Yes, fans coming up to him.

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,600
 Are you having a relationship with any American celebrity

29
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,320
 females?

30
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,480
 Sadly not.

31
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,240
 George Washington's the person I get.

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,800
 [LAUGHTER]

33
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,520
 So also joining us, we have James Harkin.

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,480
 And doing all the fact checking, as we go along today,

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,240
 is Anna Chazinski, oh, and I'm Dan.

36
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,840
 So we should start by saying that this is the first time

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,960
 you've been to the office, Greg, to the QI offices.

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,000
 This is not the first time Alex has been.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,520
 Alex is-- you're almost like a part of the family now.

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,080
 I'm going to try to cut down, because I--

41
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,640
 Well, and you're going back to America tomorrow.

42
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,160
 Yeah.

43
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
 I don't think that counts.

44
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,760
 I'm trying to cut down.

45
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,520
 But I'll be back.

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,120
 I'll be back at the end of this month.

47
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,960
 Basically, as soon as Alex comes in the office,

48
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,040
 that's the end of work for the dressing room.

49
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,600
 Well, you know, the thing is, this office is like the--

50
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,200
 is like what I would like the inside of my mind to look like.

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,160
 Just neatly ordered and filled with facts, all categorized.

52
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,440
 Like, literally, I feel like you could find any fact

53
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,880
 in this office, because there's a lot--

54
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,000
 Well, there is just a lot of books, there's a lot of folders.

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,160
 There's-- we've got the internet.

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,080
 And everyone's like, yeah, I'm going to say--

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,880
 I'm going to say, technically, it can just be a closet

58
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,880
 with a laptop, and that would still hold true.

59
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,360
 So OK, well, so as this is a special one,

60
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,360
 maybe we'll start with-- yeah, we'll start with you, Greg.

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,480
 Oh, good, at least we'll say one.

62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's begin with the sort of rambling

63
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,720
 you can go here and--

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
 Yeah, I read the excerpt.

65
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,360
 That's what I would say.

66
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,880
 The excerpt.

67
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,920
 Well, just give us what--

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,760
 It's your favorite thing that's kind of on your mind

69
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,320
 this week, the thing that you've learned.

70
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,680
 This is my first week off after writing my book,

71
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,440
 my first of a book.

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,160
 So I'll just try and pull up.

73
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,520
 I think it comes up next year.

74
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,920
 Are you allowed to say anything about the book?

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,320
 Yeah, I can tell you the title.

76
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,440
 Yes.

77
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,280
 It's called One Million Years in a Day.

78
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,040
 Stone Age to Phone Age is the range.

79
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,720
 And it's sort of structured around a modern age.

80
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,320
 That's the range.

81
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,320
 That's the range.

82
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,960
 That's the range to Phone Age to Phone Age.

83
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,480
 That's the group is just the medium.

84
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,000
 No, I thought-- I just-- something I just--

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,640
 I put in the book and I thought it was quite an interesting fact,

86
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,120
 really, that the earliest known dentistry is 9,000 years

87
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,640
 up.

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,880
 This is back in theolithic, really.

89
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,240
 So like, mammoths were walking the earth with sensors.

90
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,240
 Like, yeah, he's--

91
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,760
 [GROANS]

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,800
 So we're talking here in--

93
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,880
 I suppose, modern day Pakistan.

94
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,400
 That's what we call it.

95
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,520
 It's a place called Miggard, I suppose.

96
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,120
 It's not my pronunciation, it's not great.

97
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,720
 But archaeologists have found teeth which have been drilled.

98
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,040
 And they've been sort of, you know,

99
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,360
 it's the earliest, really, sort of fillings

100
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,520
 or or early drilling technique using a bow drill, which

101
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,880
 is, you know, just a sort of wiggling bit of sharp stick,

102
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,040
 which is a technique used, really, for jewelry.

103
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,520
 So not even teeth cleaning because I knew

104
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,480
 that the Egyptians had a foreshare toothbrushes.

105
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,040
 Oh, yeah.

106
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,160
 Even reparative dentistry goes back there.

107
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,880
 So this would be medicinal dentistry.

108
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,120
 This would be pain relief.

109
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,360
 Yeah, I guess it's an obvious thing.

110
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,800
 Because their people would have been in so much pain, wouldn't they?

111
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,400
 Yeah.

112
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,520
 Although I remember reading that, like sugar cane sugar

113
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,720
 came in relatively late.

114
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,560
 So people didn't have as bad teeth in the early time

115
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,360
 as they have today.

116
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,680
 It's interesting, actually, there's been a couple of major studies

117
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,840
 in past couple years that are shown that's not really true, actually.

118
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,000
 There's an awful lot of dental wear and tear.

119
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,120
 Wear and tear, but also it's sugar based, actually,

120
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,040
 because there's quite a lot of sugar in natural fruits and so forth.

121
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,920
 Oh, yeah.

122
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,560
 And obviously, if you're not brushing your teeth every day,

123
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,760
 it will build up.

124
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,840
 Is it complex sugars that really do harm you?

125
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,920
 Yeah, I mean, the worst dentistry in history,

126
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,360
 I think, if you were to sort of elect an era,

127
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,920
 I would say probably the 18th century, the Georgians.

128
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,400
 The 18th century's where dentistry begins as a modern discipline,

129
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,600
 but it's also where really dentistry teeth were at that worst.

130
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,040
 If you look at portraits, no one smiles.

131
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,560
 Yes.

132
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,680
 And so all the first ever smile, I can't remember

133
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,120
 as a female artist, a French female artist.

134
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,640
 I think it's in Le Brant, I think maybe.

135
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,440
 Could you check that out?

136
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,680
 Marie Le Brant, perhaps.

137
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,960
 It's a really famous painting, and it's very controversial,

138
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,000
 because I think it's a self-portrait.

139
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,960
 I think she's grinning.

140
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,800
 Wow.

141
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,480
 And it's the reason you didn't grin before,

142
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
 because your teeth were so bad.

143
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,880
 Your teeth were all fun.

144
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,000
 Who is it who you're in for mouthwash, was that?

145
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,840
 The Romans.

146
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
 The Romans.

147
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
 Wow.

148
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,680
 Wow.

149
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,480
 Who's that just me?

150
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,240
 Romans brush their teeth, to send its dentists.

151
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,560
 They use rides.

152
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,160
 I mean, the Egyptians didn't do dental surgery, particularly.

153
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
 They were very good dentists.

154
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,040
 They were the first known dentists in human history,

155
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,040
 the first named dentists are Egyptian.

156
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,840
 They were.

157
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,840
 They found, I think, in 2006, I think they found a tomb

158
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,040
 with three named dentists on the wall, sort of written in.

159
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,720
 So they were like a company name.

160
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,600
 You should be a scientist for shulmen.

161
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,400
 Yeah, like dentists of the Pharaohs.

162
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,640
 And they were royal dentists.

163
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,520
 So they were sort of official dentists to a Pharaoh,

164
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,360
 and these three guys were clearly sort of official tooth

165
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,040
 products.

166
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,680
 There was a recent meta-study done on Egyptian mummies.

167
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
 I think 40% of them might be wrong.

168
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,000
 I think 40% had serious dental disease.

169
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,520
 Wow.

170
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,920
 And dental disease could kill you.

171
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,680
 My father's a physician.

172
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,880
 And he says something really interesting,

173
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,520
 that historically, the people who get the worst care

174
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,000
 are the famous and the wealthy.

175
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,160
 Because what he's being ironic, what he's saying is typically

176
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,040
 famous people have been killed by over-medicating or over-operating

177
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,160
 or too much complex treatment, like as soon as the body

178
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,520
 will repair itself.

179
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,920
 We talked in an earlier podcast about James Gaffield,

180
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,120
 who was a pro-deter, a lot of dirty fingers,

181
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,720
 and the moon, and stuff like that.

182
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,320
 My father gave a TED talk on it, which

183
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,400
 is actually really interesting.

184
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,760
 His name is Eliza Adelman.

185
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,440
 So I wonder if those pharaohs were receiving

186
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,400
 a lot of dental attention or a big getting such rich food

187
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,000
 that they were in there?

188
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,760
 Well, that's the big question, so the quality of food,

189
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,120
 obviously, is going to affect things.

190
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,200
 I mean, let's see.

191
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,160
 The iceman found in North Teruvian Alps.

192
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,640
 He had really, really messed up teeth.

193
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,640
 What was the fact that you were saying about the baseball player?

194
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,800
 I can't remember his name, but he was a baseball player

195
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,520
 who had to be taken out of the game

196
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,800
 because he bit himself on his own ass.

197
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,400
 And what happened was he slid into the final base,

198
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,200
 and his false teeth fell out and learned about it.

199
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,280
 I'm sure you know about it.

200
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,160
 So what we were saying, though, is that he

201
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,720
 must have been in his 20s, right?

202
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,080
 But yeah, there he was with a full set of false teeth,

203
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,520
 because that was a thing that happened.

204
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,440
 Had his teeth been knocked out?

205
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,720
 It was in the 1920s.

206
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,560
 Apparently, he was called Clarence Blethan,

207
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,000
 and he's now called Clarence Climax Blethan.

208
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,080
 I don't really understand how it was born there.

209
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,360
 [LAUGHTER]

210
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,200
 Yeah, in a really particular gimmick.

211
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
 Yeah.

212
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
 No teeth you say.

213
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,880
 [LAUGHTER]

214
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,080
 Oh, Alex, I have to tell you, just as an American and a baseball fan,

215
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,680
 if you don't know this, it's my favorite baseball fact.

216
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,960
 So, you know, Lou Gehrig?

217
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
 What, and a disease?

218
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,800
 Exactly.

219
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,480
 You really should have seen that one coming.

220
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,520
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

221
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,920
 So this is what's fantastic about it.

222
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,400
 Turns out that Lou Gehrig didn't die of Lou Gehrig's disease.

223
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,480
 So the disease named after him, you didn't have--

224
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,920
 There's an interesting Wikipedia list

225
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,680
 that people have been killed by already deceased people.

226
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,280
 My favorite one is someone killed, not by a deceased person,

227
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,520
 but by deceased animal, a really notorious poacher in Montana.

228
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,920
 This is a story that people in Montana like to tell.

229
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,760
 And like, this poacher outside of Helena,

230
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,200
 he was really famous for shooting deer,

231
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,320
 and people told him that there was one particular deer

232
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,440
 that he'd never be able to get.

233
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
 And he wounded it a whole bunch of times.

234
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,120
 And finally, he spotted on a bluff

235
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,480
 across over over him, and he shot it,

236
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,080
 and he turned around and celebrated.

237
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,160
 And the deer bounced all the way down and landed on him, and killed him.

238
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,640
 And the deer survived.

239
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,800
 Oh, wow.

240
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,720
 That's fun.

241
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,120
 Yeah, the guy didn't.

242
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,520
 We should move on to another fact.

243
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,020
 Yeah.

244
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,920
 Just quickly.

245
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,420
 Yes.

246
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,600
 So it's by, obviously, Greg was right.

247
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,960
 I mean, he's a historian about the first ever smile

248
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,600
 in a portrait was in 1787, but it was quite funny.

249
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,680
 The corp gossip sheet, at the time,

250
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,560
 said, "An affectation which artists, art lovers,

251
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,400
 and persons of taste have been united in condemning,

252
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,800
 and which finds no precedent among the ancients

253
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,400
 is that in smiling, she shows her teeth."

254
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,200
 So, you know, pretty outrageous.

255
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,160
 I found an amazing collection of photos

256
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,760
 from a period pre-smile, where they did all the grim, kind of,

257
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,120
 straight face-looking.

258
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,240
 And it's outtake photos, where the families crack up,

259
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,160
 and they're laughing.

260
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,600
 And it's so interesting, because it's the first time

261
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,200
 where you see the real personalities.

262
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,680
 And that's so interesting, I'm going through, yeah.

263
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,600
 Where they're just, they're properly laughing out loud.

264
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,160
 And clearly, the person's like, "Well, this is unusable."

265
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,320
 Yeah.

266
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,520
 Like, you don't look creepy, and you don't look solid.

267
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,840
 Yeah.

268
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,320
 Like a smile.

269
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,640
 Yeah.

270
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,040
 This is rather a dip, Michael.

271
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,560
 I'm not as if you were looking.

272
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

273
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,960
 All right, let's move on to our second fact.

274
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,640
 I want to throw in my fact here, particularly,

275
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,040
 because I want to hear your thoughts on this, Craig.

276
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,760
 It's a theory from a guy called Dr. Hans Ulrich Neymitz,

277
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,600
 which is that the Middle Ages never happened.

278
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,920
 Oh, wow.

279
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,520
 So it's a thing called phantom time theory.

280
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,600
 It's basically his alleges that it was just made up.

281
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,840
 Are you sure that the guy is Dr. Hans Ulrich?

282
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,560
 Yeah, I know.

283
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,760
 A lot of people believe it.

284
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,520
 You know, obviously, a lot of idiots believe it.

285
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:58,280
 But according to them, 614 to 911 AD did not happen.

286
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,920
 Did not happen.

287
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,160
 We're going through it now.

288
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,560
 What is the basis for this theory?

289
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,080
 This is not the case.

290
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,520
 It thinks it's a conspiracy of the calendar.

291
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,040
 Brilliant.

292
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,840
 Yeah.

293
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,680
 And so what his suggestion is, as well,

294
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,920
 is that the things that were supposed to have happened

295
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
 in the Middle Ages, people at the time

296
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,080
 removed them from that bit of history

297
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,600
 and created a fiction of these 300 years.

298
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,800
 I think he said Charlemagne just never existed.

299
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,320
 What was a fictional character?

300
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,080
 So basically, half of the things that you do for a living

301
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,720
 just--

302
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,920
 My mouth is degraded, yeah.

303
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,320
 It's a fictional-- yeah.

304
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,800
 I'll give you some direct sort of from this article.

305
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,720
 It seems that historians are plagued by plethora

306
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,880
 of falsified documents from the Middle Ages.

307
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,400
 Some documents forged by the Roman Catholic Church

308
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,560
 during the Middle Ages were created hundreds of years

309
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,800
 before their great moments arrived,

310
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,680
 after which they were embraced by medieval society,

311
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,920
 this implying that whoever produced these fraudaries

312
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,040
 must have very skillfully anticipated the future.

313
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,160
 Or there was some discrepancy in calculating days.

314
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,720
 Well, houses.

315
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
 So where does he stand on the Vikings?

316
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,720
 [SIGHS]

317
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
 [LAUGHTER]

318
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
 One Vikings.

319
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,520
 [LAUGHTER]

320
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,720
 They did not burn their limits, but they didn't know what happened.

321
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,440
 In this one, it wasn't a fact that it was just he just didn't

322
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
 happen and--

323
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,940
 Yeah.

324
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,280
 And I was shot in a man, and I was shot in a man.

325
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,240
 Alfred the Great was just--

326
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,160
 No, I didn't say it.

327
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,800
 He says that maybe Alfred the Great was

328
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,760
 in a different period of time.

329
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,840
 Maybe the Vikings, you know, maybe they were just

330
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,760
 the year before.

331
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,520
 [LAUGHTER]

332
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,280
 So he stops at 9/11 to see--

333
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,800
 9/11 to see--

334
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,680
 He stops at 9/11.

335
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,200
 9/11?

336
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,800
 No, he stops at 9/11.

337
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
 No one likes his various theories.

338
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,640
 9/11 is the year that the Vikings conquer Normandy

339
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,560
 and become the Normans.

340
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,480
 It's Rolo, King Rolo, who found the Normandy

341
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,680
 on the levels that the Vikings become Normans.

342
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,480
 And the Normans, of course, become

343
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,720
 William the Conqueror, and that becomes our first dynasty

344
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,680
 of English medieval kings.

345
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,000
 So 9/11 to good year.

346
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,080
 But this goes with the thing that you like, Dan, which

347
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,880
 is that if you come up with an idea or a conspiracy,

348
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,760
 then you can always seem to fit in--

349
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,160
 You can find facts into whatever your theory is.

350
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,760
 And you can imagine, if you said to him, what about the Vikings?

351
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,480
 He would have announced--

352
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,680
 He won't have an answer, yeah.

353
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,180
 But if I know--

354
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,320
 If I know the analogy in the Bible, isn't it?

355
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,400
 People sort of try to find patterns in the Bible.

356
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,320
 And you sort of go, you do realize it's

357
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,360
 been re-translated in loans of time.

358
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,080
 So all right, final question, then.

359
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,480
 Is there any truth that the militias didn't happen?

360
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,440
 I would be deeply, deeply absurd.

361
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,960
 I mean, you're going to say--

362
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,480
 Well, I mean, say, do you really?

363
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
 Yeah, I would, actually.

364
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,080
 I'm just going to stick with my life when it makes this thing.

365
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,240
 No, I'd be, I'd be intrigued.

366
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,000
 I mean, it's true.

367
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,160
 We should be very deeply suspicious and skeptical of the past,

368
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,320
 and one of the things that historians do

369
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,920
 is we rigorously interrogate documents.

370
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,480
 And we'd always try to disprove them.

371
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,520
 We're trying to apply that sort of scientific methodology

372
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,080
 of saying, how do we know this is true?

373
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,560
 And that's what great scholarship is.

374
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,400
 But you don't destroy all things.

375
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,880
 You're just trying to question them and say, OK.

376
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,600
 And obviously, there were problems with forgeries.

377
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,520
 A monastery, for example, would be given land,

378
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,880
 and they would lose the document.

379
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
 And then a king would turn up going,

380
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
 great, I'm having a land back.

381
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,120
 And they'd be like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

382
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,000
 This is ours, we've always had it.

383
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
 So they'd forge a document.

384
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,520
 And then we get the forgery.

385
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
 Great.

386
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,080
 I read that, you know, Andara, the country.

387
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,680
 They have a constitution.

388
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,920
 But it's in a safe in Andara somewhere.

389
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,240
 And a lot of historians think that it's fake.

390
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,840
 Really?

391
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,640
 You heard that from them?

392
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,520
 No, I haven't.

393
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,600
 Breaking what's in, like, it doesn't exist at all.

394
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,560
 As in, yeah, it's a modern reproduction

395
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,240
 because they don't have the historical basis

396
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
 that they think they have.

397
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,120
 Because it was one of those states

398
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,040
 that came in to buffer from the 15th century laws.

399
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,640
 Yeah, the Italian laws.

400
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,400
 If it were to be true, this phantom times thing,

401
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,960
 which is 110% not, yeah.

402
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,680
 Then what it would mean is, I mean,

403
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,200
 no new scholarship is emerging.

404
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,160
 A new scholarship is emerging all the time.

405
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,680
 Yeah, it is.

406
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,320
 So it would be insane.

407
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,160
 But it would also kick off a really interrupt

408
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,280
 with a carbon date.

409
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,880
 Yeah, I was just thinking about that.

410
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,720
 Yeah, yeah.

411
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,800
 We use historical documents to try and ally up

412
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,480
 with carbon dating.

413
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,520
 And you use carbon dating to try and ally up with historical

414
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,040
 documents.

415
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,400
 You try and play them off against each other

416
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,640
 and try and find a cross-reference.

417
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,600
 And that way, if they go to agree,

418
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,040
 you kind of go, all right, maybe that's legit.

419
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,400
 With Richard III discovering the car part recently,

420
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,600
 the carbon dating there can sort of give you

421
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,640
 that specificity scientifically,

422
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,200
 which then legitimizes the documents

423
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
 that told us he was there.

424
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,720
 Yes, OK.

425
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,000
 So then we can kind of go, ah, these are OK.

426
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,760
 Maybe we can look at them closely for something else.

427
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,640
 So that's a way of verifying.

428
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,480
 It's a way of verifying.

429
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,200
 Because you're using the scientific method

430
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,720
 to sort of say, OK, this is the archaeology's legit.

431
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,280
 So maybe the history's OK.

432
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,640
 Physicists like to use really old lead

433
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,800
 for their experiments because it's quite--

434
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,280
 it doesn't react with as many things,

435
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,680
 but that means they're trying to use a lot of archaeological

436
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,600
 items to make their experiments.

437
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,840
 Yeah, I've heard about it briefly.

438
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,680
 I don't know if that's--

439
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,400
 I mean, it just makes sense, wouldn't it, maybe?

440
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
 Yeah.

441
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,120
 But then, yeah, it's not really great to feel

442
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,680
 as someone else's stuff.

443
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,200
 It's Richard III.

444
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,760
 Can I borrow that from someone?

445
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,640
 I've got an experiment on, just, you know,

446
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,320
 and even all King.

447
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,440
 Yeah, so I should imagine that James was right,

448
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,960
 that er, though, is a theory, which, in fact,

449
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,680
 sounds quite well-founded that the Andoran Constitution

450
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,560
 is a forgery, although this isn't a book.

451
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,920
 So apparently, it came from Charlemagne.

452
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,520
 It was signed at the Independence of Andoros.

453
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,040
 This document--

454
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,320
 Oh, we all know Charlemagne, didn't it?

455
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,400
 I think we've established that.

456
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,720
 I think we've established that.

457
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,360
 Otherwise, I'm reading it in a book where they've

458
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,400
 spelled-- it's a book.

459
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,960
 It's Andorra Business Law Handbook,

460
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,320
 but they've spelled Charlemagne, Charlemagne.

461
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,920
 He's a dog.

462
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,560
 He was a dog with a therapist.

463
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,640
 I don't know.

464
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,080
 I don't know if Charles's worthy though.

465
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,600
 OK.

466
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,400
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

467
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,320
 All right, so we're going to go on to--

468
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,800
 We'll do Alex's respect now.

469
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,280
 Alex?

470
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,320
 My fact is, it's about the most medically indispensable

471
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,320
 sea creature in the United States is the horseshoe crab.

472
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,680
 Are you aware of the--

473
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,200
 No, go on.

474
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,360
 It's a wide, wide claim to make, isn't it?

475
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,680
 Yeah, how does that work?

476
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,480
 Well, so the horseshoe crab lives

477
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,120
 in the very bacteria-rich coastline shallow waters

478
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,280
 in the ocean.

479
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
 So in the early '20s, they were sort of seen

480
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,280
 as a nuisance, and they were ground up, and used as fertilizer

481
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,640
 and stuff, in fact, to pegs.

482
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,760
 And now, every year, a half million horseshoe crabs

483
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,920
 are harvested, and they're brought into factories

484
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,680
 by one of five companies all along the eastern coast

485
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,880
 of the United States.

486
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,520
 And they're blood alive.

487
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,600
 And their blood is baby blue.

488
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,120
 And if you can find a picture, it's incredibly interesting.

489
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,360
 And this blood-- it detects any malignant, dangerous bacterial

490
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,360
 undertoxins, even at a concentration of one part per trillion.

491
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,920
 So the FDA requires that all drugs,

492
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,640
 all new drugs that are brought to market

493
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,680
 be run through this horseshoe crab blood.

494
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,600
 So every single person in the United States

495
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,040
 who's ever had an injection of any kind

496
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,160
 has had a drug that's been tested in this LAL test.

497
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,040
 Oh, that's amazing.

498
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,800
 That is incredible, yeah.

499
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,480
 It's unbelievable.

500
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,760
 And the blood per quart is $15,000.

501
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,040
 So they don't kill the crabs.

502
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,560
 So that's like--

503
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
 So people love that.

504
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,800
 Yeah, they just leave them.

505
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,880
 And then they take them on a boat all the way out to sea

506
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,120
 so they don't reharvest crabs that they've already taken.

507
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,120
 They look like a great holiday crew.

508
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,520
 They make us have done a really good thing.

509
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,000
 But they dumped these guys really far out.

510
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,360
 And they noticed that less and less of them

511
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,240
 are coming back.

512
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,480
 Well, you don't kill something when you take a lot of its blood.

513
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,000
 It does make it more lethargic and less likely to make.

514
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,720
 But yeah, so that's to me.

515
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,640
 That's very exciting.

516
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
 Then that's really cool.

517
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,480
 Yeah.

518
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,040
 That they have basically the best immune system of anyone.

519
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,560
 They do.

520
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,240
 We can use--

521
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,080
 Yeah, my favorite crab.

522
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,040
 Have you heard of the samurai crab?

523
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,680
 No, but it sounds like a movie.

524
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,120
 No, it's very exciting.

525
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
 It's very exciting.

526
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
 So it's--

527
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,920
 Basically, black and black sideways.

528
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,920
 Yeah, yeah.

529
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,720
 There was a superstition that samurai warriors,

530
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,480
 when they died, were reincarnated as these crabs.

531
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,040
 Because a lot of these crabs that came up

532
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,400
 had the pattern on their shell of a samurai face.

533
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,080
 That's brilliant.

534
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,040
 And it became an evolutionary thing.

535
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,640
 So it's the samurai pattern that became the--

536
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,720
 That is brilliant.

537
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,220
 Wow.

538
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,160
 And so they would throw the ones that looked like a samurai

539
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,280
 back into the ocean.

540
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,320
 That's brilliant.

541
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,080
 Are there other stories of animals

542
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,880
 selectively surviving like that?

543
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
 So I was wondering--

544
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,080
 Why do dogs are supposed to be a bit like that in cats?

545
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
 In cats?

546
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,880
 Cats domesticated themselves.

547
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,440
 Because cats, when they me out, they

548
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,680
 don't me out to other cats.

549
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,760
 They only do it to humans.

550
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,560
 Oh, really?

551
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,680
 They've selected to me out just so that we

552
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,000
 would think they're little babies.

553
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,200
 We domesticated dogs.

554
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,080
 We deliberately took wolves.

555
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,480
 And when-- please stop biting me.

556
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,560
 I like it when you're dog please.

557
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,720
 And the amazing thing is that you can domesticate an animal

558
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,480
 really, really quickly.

559
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,040
 There's a Russian scientist who did it in the '50s with foxes.

560
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,280
 I think he was-- what was his name?

561
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,000
 Things would be, I think.

562
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,320
 Beardina, for some reason.

563
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,200
 He took foxes, feral, wild, angry foxes,

564
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,280
 trying to eat his face.

565
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,080
 And he just bred them and bred them and bred them.

566
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,280
 I was always taking the most docile cubs

567
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,080
 and bringing together.

568
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,240
 Belli-ai.

569
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,080
 Belli-ai-ai.

570
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,600
 Belli-ai-ai-ai.

571
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,080
 Belli-ai-ai.

572
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,600
 Belli-ai-ai-ai.

573
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,080
 That's one of the brilliant answers.

574
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,640
 Belli-ai-ai-ai.

575
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,240
 But he bred them together so that you

576
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,840
 ended up with these sort of more increasingly docile creatures.

577
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,920
 The only thing that he discovered was that when

578
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,960
 you breed for physical characteristics,

579
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,760
 it also creates a personality chain.

580
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,640
 They became more sort of dog-like, more sort of fluffy-tailed

581
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,240
 and more sort of willing to follow around.

582
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
 But they also changed--

583
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,000
 Or sequious.

584
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
 But they did, yes.

585
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,440
 But they sequious foxes.

586
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,640
 They're sequious foxes.

587
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,960
 But they will also change their personality and demeanor

588
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,400
 and the fact they'll respond to calls and so on.

589
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,680
 And they did that in like 10 generations.

590
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,600
 That's all it took.

591
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,520
 There's been awful lot of genetic testing recently,

592
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,840
 because we can now do DNA analysis on animals.

593
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,800
 And we found that actually dogs are much older than we thought.

594
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,440
 So do we think that we got them for companionship or fighting

595
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,080
 or it's probably hunting companionship?

596
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,200
 Because we had pet bear.

597
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,400
 There was definitely at least one pet bear to be

598
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
 found in the Stone Age.

599
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,440
 Well, Byron had a pet bear.

600
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,280
 Byron did have a pet bear.

601
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
 Byron had a pet bear?

602
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,040
 He took it to Cambridge.

603
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,880
 We took it to Cambridge.

604
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,920
 Because he wasn't allowed a dog.

605
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,840
 So he was vivid in it, and he said,

606
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,120
 I can have a bear.

607
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,080
 This is before after he sounded the hamburger chainers.

608
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,080
 [LAUGHTER]

609
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,680
 Is that the most ridiculous?

610
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,200
 I'll wait.

611
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,040
 Someone kept a pet scorpion in a jar on his desk.

612
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,240
 I read this in one of your boxes.

613
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,760
 Yeah.

614
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,200
 I read that in one of the QI books, which are available

615
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,560
 in fine-box stores everywhere.

616
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,760
 Yeah.

617
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,840
 Probably the same books as Greg's book

618
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,160
 will be available in next year.

619
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,680
 Yeah.

620
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,040
 Oh, they have all the workshops.

621
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,720
 Yeah, I think.

622
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,800
 Talk about them sequestries.

623
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,880
 [LAUGHTER]

624
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,400
 An extraordinary effect of this sort of dog thing

625
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,880
 to be an extraordinary thing is we obviously

626
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,320
 domesticated dogs because to do that,

627
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,400
 you have to sort of take a wild, feral wolf

628
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
 that is trying to kill you.

629
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,800
 And gradually tame it.

630
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,920
 But it's not taming.

631
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,000
 It's breeding it.

632
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,560
 You take your runt of a litter, and the runt of a litter,

633
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,200
 you bring this together, and gradually you breed them,

634
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,160
 and you create a new animal.

635
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,640
 And that is the dog.

636
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,000
 The amazing thing is that the oldest dog breed in the world

637
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,640
 is only a sort of 1,000 years old or something.

638
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,520
 Roman dogs don't exist anymore.

639
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,000
 So when you find a Roman dog at Pompeii,

640
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,760
 which we have found one, that breed no longer exists.

641
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,320
 Doesn't exist anymore.

642
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,240
 Wow.

643
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,760
 But--

644
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,480
 Is it because they die out?

645
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,080
 Well, the breeding program has changed,

646
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,800
 and you have sort of different needs of them.

647
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,760
 And animals are constantly evolving and changing,

648
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,880
 and we breed them in different ways.

649
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,360
 And George Washington bred dogs.

650
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,120
 George Washington bred the American fox sound.

651
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,560
 He took a French fox sound from the monkey to the fiat,

652
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,360
 and an English fox sound, and he bred them together

653
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,840
 and created the American fox sound.

654
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,920
 Wow.

655
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
 And he was really obsessed with this.

656
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,440
 He was sort of typical 18th century gentleman.

657
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,680
 And I'm like, I'm going to breed an animal.

658
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,840
 But the amazing thing is cats domesticated themselves.

659
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
 The oldest known cat, I think, is from the Shaila Boros,

660
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,000
 I think in Cyprus.

661
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,560
 I think it's about 9,000 years old.

662
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,280
 Is there any truth to the story when people attach cats

663
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,800
 to their shields to the Egyptians?

664
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,320
 Yes.

665
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,120
 I love business, the battle.

666
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,560
 I think Pallucian, I think, is top of my head,

667
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,160
 because the Egyptians believed cats to be holy and revered.

668
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,040
 They had huge cat funeral monuments

669
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,560
 with like millions of buried cats.

670
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,800
 If your cat died, you shaved with your eyebrows,

671
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,240
 and you would take your cat to this holy city of cats.

672
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,840
 They found a lot of mummies, didn't they?

673
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,480
 Mummified cats, like a million of them.

674
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
 A million of them.

675
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
 A huge one, yeah.

676
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,320
 And the city, I think, was called Bubastis.

677
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,360
 Named after the, I think, might have made that up.

678
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,520
 There was a definite city.

679
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,440
 And they would bury the cats and they'd shave off their eyes.

680
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,880
 It was working out for a time, by the way.

681
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
 It was all right.

682
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,840
 Then they'd never want to interrupt such a thousand tabs up.

683
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,080
 But it was a great, and they'd hear what they'd say.

684
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,240
 And they'd hear what they'd say.

685
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
 It's called Bubastis.

686
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
 It's a good idea.

687
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
 Good idea.

688
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
 I wanted to make up some random natives.

689
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
 But they worship cats.

690
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,520
 And there's a famous story that a Roman soldier,

691
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,120
 who's in his chariot, and he ran over a cat.

692
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,680
 And he was killed by an angry mob.

693
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,640
 But then in the middle ages, people thought that cats were evil,

694
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,640
 didn't they?

695
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,120
 And they thought they thought they were witches' familiars.

696
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,320
 But they used to be burned alive as well.

697
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
 Louis XIV, for think.

698
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,320
 Yeah, he did want to burn himself, didn't he?

699
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
 No, they didn't.

700
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
 And he used to be ceremony through the monsters' pie out.

701
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
 They used to be stoned.

702
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
 They were eaten alive.

703
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
 He's not alive.

704
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,320
 He's eaten alive.

705
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
 How do you eat cats?

706
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,320
 I eat cats.

707
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
 You keep a lot of decoying them all.

708
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
 Man, you just grab it.

709
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
 I guess you hold out the legs and just start tromping.

710
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
 I don't know.

711
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,320
 They've gone from gods to being evil.

712
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
 Yeah.

713
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
 And now we just put them on the internet and laugh at them.

714
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
 We'll be gods against them.

715
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,320
 We'll be gods against them.

716
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,320
 We'll be gods against them.

717
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
 We'll be gods against them.

718
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
 We'll be gods against them.

719
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,320
 Okay, listen to that.

720
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
 I'm going to quickly do my last effect.

721
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,320
 I found that we have 28 people that we know slept with Queen Elizabeth for first.

722
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
 And that they were all women.

723
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
 Whoa!

724
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
 What?

725
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
 It's when you say "slept with"?

726
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,320
 You mean "slept in the same bedroom"?

727
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
 Yes.

728
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
 Yeah.

729
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
 Well, it did not sound right to you.

730
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
 Same bedroom.

731
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
 In the same bedroom?

732
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
 Yes, same bedroom.

733
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
 The interesting thing about Queen Elizabeth, I actually made a documentary

734
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
 for two out of five years together.

735
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
 It was awfully ridiculous.

736
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
 Well, we sort of went, "Did she have a lot of child?"

737
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
 Yeah.

738
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
 I did she or...

739
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
 Well, no.

740
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
 There was a remiss she did.

741
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
 Spanish used it, it's propaganda.

742
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
 Obviously, I don't think she did.

743
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,320
 But you can't listen to her first.

744
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,320
 She probably didn't spend more than five minutes of her life alone.

745
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,320
 She was constantly surrounded by people everywhere she went.

746
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
 She was born on princess.

747
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
 She was always going to be a princess.

748
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
 And then she blew the coin and then she died.

749
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,320
 So, you have ladies in waiting who, of course,

750
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
 would sleep in the same room as her.

751
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
 You'd have sort of trouble beds at the bottom of the bed usually.

752
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
 They would sleep in or maybe...

753
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,320
 By beds, like...

754
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,320
 More of a sort of a pull out little...

755
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
 Oh, like the cupboard.

756
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
 Yeah, like under beds, like, you know.

757
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,320
 But these people didn't really have any kind of private space.

758
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,320
 But the queen can never go like, "I want some alone time."

759
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
 Maybe, but we don't only records for that.

760
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
 And you know what else?

761
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
 I don't think this time period ever existed so far then.

762
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
 So, what does this fact mean then?

763
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
 Does it mean that she slept with way more than that?

764
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,320
 Basically, it's a way of bringing up this interesting fact

765
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
 that the monarchs would have sleeping partners

766
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,320
 before companionship and for safety and whatever.

767
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,320
 I read that Gandhi used to sleep with naked, female virgins

768
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
 to test his chastity.

769
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
 So, they would lay next to him in bed.

770
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
 Wow.

771
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,320
 Yeah, and just so he could be like, "Mmm, look how awesome I am."

772
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
 Look at nothing.

773
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
 I don't want to knock Gandhi on our show, but...

774
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
 Oh, not Gandhi.

775
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
 That's weird.

776
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,320
 No, but maybe he was caught the first time by his wife.

777
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
 He's like, "Oh, my God, you're having a ferry."

778
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,320
 He's like, "No, no, honey, hey, I am testing my chastity."

779
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
 Yeah.

780
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
 You're going to...

781
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
 Yeah, I'll do it every night.

782
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
 Right?

783
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
 But there's a nice story.

784
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
 I think it's in the Bible.

785
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,320
 You might be able to help us more here on "Resonant Jew."

786
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
 But it's...

787
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,320
 King David, I think, has a woman called...

788
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,320
 Is it Abishag?

789
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
 Who...

790
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
 Abishag.

791
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,320
 I think she's...

792
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,320
 She's the official human water bottle.

793
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
 He gets really old.

794
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
 Wow.

795
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
 Yeah, and just the woman that he cuddles with.

796
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
 Exactly.

797
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
 And she's a young, beautiful, beautiful virgin

798
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
 and she gets in the bed with him

799
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
 and her job is to warm him up at night.

800
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,320
 And the whole time.

801
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
 It has an interesting translation

802
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,320
 to 20th century care of U.S. presidents.

803
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
 Yeah.

804
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
 And this is mentioned in my father's Ted Med talk,

805
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
 which I didn't mean applied to much.

806
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,320
 Considering it's probably only got like 20 views

807
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
 'cause it's a Ted Med talk.

808
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
 We'll post that.

809
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,320
 We'll post this talk.

810
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

811
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
 It's almost the top.

812
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,320
 But Eisenhower had a lot of heart attacks.

813
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
 Just like constantly having heart attacks.

814
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,320
 Like, you wake up and you go to a doctor

815
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
 and the doctor's like, "Hey, you had a heart attack, wasn't it?"

816
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,320
 And like, he was prescribed a prescription

817
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,320
 that he snuggled with Mamie Eisenhower.

818
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,320
 But that basically was his, like,

819
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,320
 it was a fair prescription for a long time

820
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,320
 that literally to have like a cuddle buddy

821
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
 would calm him down.

822
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
 Would calm anybody down.

823
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
 Yeah.

824
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
 But like, it was, it was, it's been prevailing knowledge

825
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,320
 up until pretty recently that having someone to like snuggle,

826
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
 like Teddy bears, there was, there are some papers

827
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
 that in New England, they used to circulate a lot

828
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,320
 'cause I guess New England is where I'm from Boston

829
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,320
 is like, I guess Teddy bear sort of started in Vermont.

830
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,320
 And again, I'm sure a QI question is where I'm from.

831
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
 Teddy Roosevelt.

832
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
 Yeah, we think so.

833
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
 Do you really?

834
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
 Yeah, do you think the Teddy bear Teddy Roosevelt?

835
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
 Yeah.

836
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
 Yeah, it's 1903, isn't it?

837
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
 It infuses the shooter bear.

838
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
 Is that right?

839
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
 He's hunting and he refuses to shoot.

840
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
 Yeah.

841
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
 And Kermit Roosevelt was the first westerner to shoot a panda

842
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
 or something.

843
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,320
 Really?

844
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
 Really?

845
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
 I might be wrong about that, so.

846
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
 I'm just an interject.

847
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
 I'm just Kermit.

848
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
 It was Kermit and Theodore.

849
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
 Teddy's son.

850
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
 And they shot the panda together.

851
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
 So they both agreed.

852
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
 They both shot.

853
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,320
 Yeah, they both shot with their separate guns.

854
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,320
 They both claimed to be the first westerners to kill giant panda.

855
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
 The kill giant panda.

856
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
 Isn't that touching?

857
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
 Yeah.

858
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,320
 Oh, not notes.

859
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
 And then it's home.

860
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:34,320
 Yeah, we should wrap up now.

861
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,320
 But if you want to ask any one of us any questions about things we've spoken out today,

862
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,320
 you can get me on and try and learn things.

863
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,320
 Yeah.

864
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,320
 I'm on @XShakes.

865
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
 And Alex will be on.

866
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
 I'm Alex Underscore Edelman.

867
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,320
 And this was all Twitter talking about by the way.

868
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
 Grace.

869
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,320
 I shot it into the end.

870
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
 Alex Underscore Edelman.

871
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
 He will appear.

872
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
 Yeah.

873
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
 Oh, Greg.

874
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
 Greg.

875
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
 We're on the store, Jenna.

876
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320
 Yeah.

877
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
 Okay.

878
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,320
 And there's not on Twitter, but she can be got on @Clikipedia, which is the main UI Twitter page.

879
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
 We're going to have a bunch of photos, I guess.

880
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,320
 And a Ted Med clip up on the QI.

881
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
 Oh, my father's going to kill me.

882
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
 Dotcom/podcasts.

883
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
 That's where you can find it.

884
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
 Thanks so much for joining us, guys.

885
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
 So that was another edition of No Such Thing as a Fitch.

886
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,320
 I'm going to call it a special title, No Such Thing as the Middle Ages.

887
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
 That's going to be the...

888
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
 Oh, but that'll be like on the iTunes thing.

889
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
 Yeah.

890
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
 Alright.

891
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
