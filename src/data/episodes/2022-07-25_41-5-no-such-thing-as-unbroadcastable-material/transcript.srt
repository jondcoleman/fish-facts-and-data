1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 Hey everyone, it's Alex here. You know, Alex Bell? No, you don't, because I'm never allowed on the podcast.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,080
 Anyway, Dan James, Andy and Anna have all gone over Christmas, but I'm still stuck in the Kiwi office.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,720
 They've told me to edit together a BEST of 2014 episode for no such thing as a fish,

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,160
 but screw them, I've decided to put together a WORST of 2014.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,280
 So here's some of the most crude, inane and ludicrous nonsense they've come up with over the past year

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,440
 that they never wanted you to hear. Enjoy.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,560
 We run it on QI a few years ago, which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,840
 You didn't know such thing as a fish.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,600
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,640
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:51,040
 Hello, welcome to another episode, and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:01:01,200
 from the KiI offices in Coffent Garden. Sorry, it's covered. I can't say it, Coffent, Coffent, Coffent.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:07,920
 To be kind of health and safety, this is not quite related, but there's a guy called Hilleur

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:16,560
 Purgric, he's like an eco warrior, and he tried to live in a cave in Brighton, but then his cave got

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,320
 checked by the local fire brigade, and the council saw an injunction banning him from entering it,

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,840
 because it didn't have enough fire exits. Just had one exit. Just one big one.

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,200
 I think basically he's had like a running battle with the council, because they shut down his

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,160
 vegetable shop in 1999, but they shut it down even though he only had one customer, a pregnant woman

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:49,200
 who bought his sprouts. He all went to give birth and stopped craving sprouts. He's exactly the end of it.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:58,160
 We were talking about how to become an astronaut, and it was an interview last year with Dwayne Ross,

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:05,360
 who was the manager of the astronaut selection office. And they asked him, this is Popsie,

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,080
 any entertaining interview moments come to mind. And he said, one of my favourers was we had this one

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,400
 person say when we asked him why he wanted to be an astronaut, well, my grandfather was an astronaut,

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,040
 my father was an astronaut, and now I want to be an astronaut. We knew that wasn't true,

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,360
 but we didn't mind a little lightheartedness in the interview.

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,120
 That's very sweet. That's quite funny. I think I would have employed him, however,

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
 under qualified he was. I don't think they look for funny though.

28
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,840
 I wouldn't that get annoying after a year of an incessant joke. It might change his bad puns,

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,200
 but yeah, it's totally, you can't escape. I don't even like him for half an hour.

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:49,360
 It's just a mere pun. That was amazing. I was planning on demand. It's like those people who

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,160
 can burp on demand. It's like a super power. It's like people who can burp on demand on the

32
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:05,280
 little bit more irritating. I think Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan once can have

33
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,880
 all done a lawsuit against a man with a barrel organ who was playing outside his house at all hours.

34
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,320
 I think you're right. I remember that happened, and I think they went to court and I think he lost.

35
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,320
 I think he got really irate and smashed up the barrel organ and then had to pay for a new one.

36
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,040
 He was working, wasn't he, and he kept hearing this music all the time and he couldn't do his job.

37
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,680
 You think that's what was inspiring him? Yeah, you'd think that he would be grave

38
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,080
 with a free music. Apparently not. I wish there was someone outside my flat shouting out facts all

39
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,800
 the time, but I could just write it out. That would be amazing. If anyone has any facts that Andy

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:46,640
 lives on 27. I read that they found not too long ago the oldest spider web ever.

41
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,360
 It was in East Sussex, I think. It was in Amber. I was trying to come up with a really good joke

42
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,040
 for that and I haven't done. Just giving up, dated. How the podcast's going for me.

43
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:07,040
 I was going to go say, "Hey, I'm casting like George Osborne's wallet or you know Ming Campbell's."

44
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,160
 I didn't know the circumstances under which George Harrison lost his virginity and I find

45
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,040
 it hard to believe, but it's straight from the horse's mouth. He lost his virginity to a horse.

46
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,400
 Not a horse, a prostitute. Oh, sorry, that's funny.

47
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,000
 George Harrison, did you say? Yeah, they were on tour in Hamburg, the four of them. He lost

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 his virginity to a prostitute while he was in bunk beds in the same room as the other three Beatles.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
 They stayed quiet throughout the whole thing, but then they cheered as soon as he was finished.

50
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,040
 Yeah, they used to live in a- They were residents- Yeah, lots of marine in here, lots of marine.

51
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,440
 No, they had a residency at this bar in Hamburg and so they had to live in the back in these bunk beds,

52
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,360
 so everything. They all- They didn't have to have sex with prostitutes in the back, though.

53
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,560
 No, but I mean, yeah, they did kind of there and nowhere else to go.

54
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,480
 And that's what I'm saying is. What I'm saying is that's just what they all did. They all did it.

55
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,640
 Mr. Shriver, can you tell us why you had sex with that prostitute in the back of Tesco?

56
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,920
 I had to do it. Yeah, the others had blocked up all the good spots in the Kiwis.

57
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:23,840
 Can I quickly talk about just running generally? I was thinking about in sports because I remember

58
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,400
 someone saying how much David Beckham runs per match, which is a lot. I didn't remember the exact

59
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,920
 amount, but then I thought, I wonder in other sports, I wonder which sport you run the most in

60
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,640
 outside of running. And it's quite surprising. Someone's done a list of what happens. So with basketball,

61
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,920
 there's quite a lot of running that goes. It's something like 2.4 kilometers or something per match

62
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:56,080
 that you end up running. Soccer is about 9 for the high end. It's roughly around 7. American football.

63
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,680
 What do you think it is for American football? Less. About 500 metres. Are you counting walking off

64
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,440
 an odd again? Are you counting walking off an odd again? Yeah, counting everything. It depends which

65
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,400
 player you are. The running backs would run a long way. That's a thing. It's really tiny. There's

66
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,600
 only average per match, 11 minutes of movement. Isn't that insane? How long is a match? Three hours.

67
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,080
 Three hours, and there's only 11 minutes worth of movement for the whole match. Yeah, but what in

68
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:31,200
 the number 11 hours? Couldn't they just do the 11 minutes and get it over with? No, it's much better

69
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:38,000
 than that. It's like cricket. It's nuanced, let's say. And tennis. Tennis, they run a lot. Yeah, they do.

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,240
 Yeah, but it's surprising, I guess, when you consider the length of the field in comparison to say

71
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,280
 like American football, you just think it's the higher end. It's just behind football. Do you have

72
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:57,520
 figures for the 400 metres? No. I should have... Sorry. That's all right. I have a question for you all,

73
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:07,440
 okay? Yeah, it's a question. In the last Olympics, you same bolt one, ran 100 metres in under 9.3 seconds,

74
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,400
 but he didn't get a world record. Why? Is this work outable? Yeah. Okay, and it was during an

75
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,480
 Olympic contest. It wasn't a practice or anything. Wasn't a full start. Nope. He had his shoelaces untied.

76
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,960
 Nope, although he did have one shoelace untied when he broke the world record. Was he disqualified

77
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,560
 for some reason for it? Nope. Was he just running for a bus? No, the answer is because it was part of

78
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,600
 his 200 metre race. The second half of his 200 metre race, he did it in nine years. He took away

79
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,280
 the recording cost. He had, you have a running start, don't you? Yeah. So whereas like a 100 metres,

80
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,280
 you have to get up to that speed and 200 metres, you're already at that speed. That's fantastic.

81
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,120
 Yeah, that's good. That's really good. Good fact. We probably won't use this, but I just want to

82
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,960
 just... It was just when I was looking into smells and space and the the farting thing came up. I

83
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:09,120
 discovered a video. It's a sort of audio extract from the 1972 Apollo 16 mission, which John Young

84
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:18,320
 is on the moon talking about farting, not knowing that his microphone is on. And he also swears.

85
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,960
 And it was a big deal because if you remember on a previous podcast, no such thing as a swearword

86
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,520
 on the moon, they've done so much work to make sure astronauts don't swear on the moon. And this guy

87
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,320
 just let one go as he was talking about farting. And I've got it here. Let one go as he was talking about

88
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,960
 letting one go. Exactly. Yeah, so there is a swearword on the moon. It was John Young while talking about

89
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:47,200
 farting. And he swore twice. God. What a piece of shit. So basically this fact is pretty much

90
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,080
 just an excuse to talk about Serenol Finds. Well, he was expelled from the S.A.S. He calls it that

91
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,600
 Castlecomb business, which is where he plotted to blow up bits of the set of Dr. Do Little.

92
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,400
 And it was being filmed in Wiltshire and he was plotting to blow it up with some flares and plastic

93
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,560
 explosive. And he got 500 quip for that. He got busted, though, because some local squirrels saw him

94
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:21,760
 doing it and reported it to Dr. Do Little. Yeah. Since we're on explorers, my new favourite explorer is

95
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,640
 Joseph Banks, who was the botanist on Cook's expeditions. But he's so great. So he was this really

96
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,040
 charming guy who always befriended the locals wherever he went. So they landed on Tahiti and within

97
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,760
 days he was picking up bits of the language and he was sleeping with them, sometimes actually

98
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,080
 copulating with them and sometimes just sleeping next to them. And on the first day they arrived in

99
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,440
 Tahiti, picture the most cliched, like if you're watching a cartoon of discovering Tahiti.

100
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,960
 And that's basically what happened. So they climbed ashore and they ended up on their first night

101
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,080
 dining deliciously on fish and bread fruit. Joseph Banks sitting next to a Tahitian queen.

102
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,960
 He spotted a really beautiful Tahitian lady at the opposite end of the dining

103
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,920
 area, beckoned to her. She came and sat on his other side. And they spent the whole evening

104
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,840
 eating delicious tropical fruits and hanging out with beautiful Tahitian, soon they all went and

105
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,600
 slept with over the next few days. It just sounds like the dream explorer. Yeah, it sounds like

106
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,480
 they made it up. Didn't cook end up being killed in Ethan. Yeah, he did. And it sounds like there's

107
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,160
 a lot of theories about why that happened and it sounds like it was a miscommunication.

108
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,360
 Am I making it up? Was it on the sandwich islands? Sandwich islands are now Hawaii aren't they?

109
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,800
 I think it might have been the sandwich islands. I think I've just conflated two different stories

110
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,200
 in my head. One thing you've made in the Earl of Sandwich with Captain Kirk. Yeah, it didn't

111
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,440
 the other sandwich. The meat, Captain Kirk. Between two slices of bread fruit.

112
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:52,000
 At the glorious Tahitian party, the thing that broke it up was that Tahitians didn't understand

113
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,920
 property so they kept on stealing cook stuff without quite realizing that it was stealing.

114
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,080
 And the party was broken up on the first night they were there because two of the guys from the

115
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,440
 expedition that had come on to land had a snuff box and their opera glasses pickpocketed.

116
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,840
 Now what were these people doing bringing opera glasses onto a newly discovered Tahitian island?

117
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:19,280
 Into the South Pacific. Oh, into the South Pacific. You claim you didn't like musical theatre.

118
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:28,400
 Can I just do something about haunted genitals? Yeah. There was a guy in the medical literature

119
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,640
 who had a haunted scrotum and he went to the doctor because he had an undecided right testicle.

120
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,800
 And when they did a scan on him, they saw his left testicle and they said the left side of his

121
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,720
 scrotum seemed to be occupied by a screaming ghost-like apparition. Were these doctors?

122
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,480
 Yeah. And in the in the report that I read it said, "But what of the undecended right testis?

123
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,080
 None was found. If you were a right testis, would you want to share the scrotum with that?"

124
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,400
 The idea is this ghost-like left testicle scared away the right testicle.

125
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,360
 I'm not sure they were being entirely serious about that reason.

126
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,840
 Yeah, this medical literature sounds very...

127
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,760
 Have we talked, haven't we, before, about the African somewhere in Africa? There was a panic recently

128
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,960
 where people believe that their testicles were disappearing, all that mean is that there's a lot of people.

129
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,000
 Yeah. People, this is a common cultural trope, yeah. And a bit of a South Asia.

130
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,920
 Yeah, we've all had Asia, it's a bit...

131
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,760
 Don't feel bad, it happens to everyone.

132
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,240
 I was trying to think of stuff that we think is on one date, but actually it's on another.

133
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,640
 Oh, yeah. Obviously there's American Independence Day, which I think John Adams, at the time,

134
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,280
 famously said, because Independence was voted for on the second of July.

135
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,000
 And John Adams famously wrote to his wife, didn't he? He's saying the second day of July,

136
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,520
 1776 will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America, and was entirely wrong.

137
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,160
 It was obviously the 4th of July, which was when it went through.

138
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,480
 But also I read about a 106-year-old woman who just discovered that she's been celebrating her birthday

139
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,680
 on the wrong day for more than a hundred years. It was the previous day. They just found her

140
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,920
 birth certificate, and we're, that's weird. So technically now she's only six years old.

141
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,480
 Yes. That's how it works. Yeah.

142
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,680
 Very, very quickly, because I think this is really cool. In 15th century Germany, speaking of vampires,

143
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,320
 there was a biting epidemic that broke out, and one none in a convent fell to biting her companions,

144
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,760
 and that spread throughout the convent, and then from one convent to the next, and it went from

145
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,560
 Germany up to Holland and as far as Rome, and convent throughout the land, none's were just biting

146
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,720
 each other. Wow. That's amazing. That's hysteria, I guess. Yeah, that's hysteria.

147
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,040
 The same thing happens with non-meowing around the same time. What was the how did the meowing stop?

148
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,480
 It was a soldier who came, and it said that he would hit them, unless they stopped meowing.

149
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,800
 He'd beat them with a pull. Did they work?

150
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:04,640
 Do you know in the book Dracula, how to kill a vampire?

151
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,680
 Stake through the heart. And got off the head?

152
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,520
 Yes, there's one other thing. Do you have sex with it, or is that just in modern adaptations?

153
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,760
 I don't remember reading that in my edition, but I did get the penguin classics.

154
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:27,520
 I was thinking of the the rays of sunlight. Oh yeah. So that never appeared in the original Dracula book.

155
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,160
 Oh, that's why I didn't know it. Yeah, it's exactly that. I just thought that that was the classic

156
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,160
 thing that everyone knew about it. That was in the movie, the very very first movie. And the reason

157
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,920
 it was put in the movie is because they didn't actually have the rights to use Dracula as an adaptation,

158
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,080
 so they created this other false ending to be able to say that this is a different vibe.

159
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:55,920
 I've got one last thing that I want to throw in before we move on, which is that there's been a

160
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,000
 study that's shown that male kangaroos can attract the opposite of sex. What's the opposite of sex?

161
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,600
 Oh, the opposite sex. What I normally end up having, mate.

162
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:17,520
 They aren't cool. Their genus is pongo, isn't it, which I quite like, the pongo genus. And I also

163
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,560
 love reading about gorillas when you're reading it, like the new scientists, because they put their

164
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,400
 scientific name after it. And obviously for gorilla, their scientific name is gorilla, gorilla,

165
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,840
 gorilla. So they just, they'll refer to a gorilla and then in brackets, it just sounds like

166
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:34,640
 they're chanting. Gorilla, gorilla, gorilla. I only think of pongo as being a name for extremely

167
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:41,120
 posh people. Yeah. I've never heard that as a name. Oh, wow. Well, this is the secret clubs. I'm a member

168
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,840
 of, you know, they tell you the secret names that really posh people have. I'm sure we think that

169
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,480
 we have nicknames for posh people, but actually those posh people have nicknames for people, posh people.

170
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:59,120
 nicknames for people, the people at the top are just calling the queen pongo. Speaking of myths and

171
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:09,440
 legends, who here is heard of the snow yeti of whales. Whales have their own yeti. Yeah, it's a

172
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,240
 really lovely story. This is the description of it by the locals. He has a repellent beast that

173
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:21,280
 has razor sharp teeth, a matted coat and eyes of flames. He has blue ear wax that trickles down his

174
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:31,360
 chin. He lives alone in an igloo at the top of Mount Snowden. And yeah, he, he beneath his heart of

175
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,800
 stone, he has someone who he cared about. So that's why he's angry. I don't know so many people who

176
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,880
 have climbed Mount Snowden. It's bizarre that none of them has ever mentioned it. Popped an igloo. Yeah.

177
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,920
 Maybe that's something I could go and look for. When we tell you all our facts for the week,

178
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,120
 so we can all look them up. Do you just type them plus yesi into google?

179
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,680
 Seduantly yes.

180
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:06,000
 Daniel, quite her shoes are like. Yeah, I can grow a beard quite well. Have you done it?

181
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,480
 Yeah, I have. It doesn't work. What do you mean?

182
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,360
 It just doesn't work on a function as it's supposed to be. Well, he was aiming to look like Brian

183
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,400
 Blessed. Yeah. Well, it's meant to suit your face, isn't it? It's meant to, you know, if you grow a bit,

184
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,160
 you know, whatever you have on your face, you want it to suit it. And it doesn't really suit it.

185
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:30,160
 I'm speaking of Brian Blessed. He told me that when he was in Tibet last, a lot of the encounters

186
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,320
 that a lot of the Tibetans and the stories that come out about the idea that there are these

187
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:41,040
 ginormous yetis, I'm going with the yetis for a second, it turns out that the majority of people or yetis

188
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,640
 that they thought they were seeing actually turned out to be Westerners because most explorers,

189
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,360
 when they go out into these icy cold regions, they don't shower from months on end, they

190
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,160
 can't shave or anything, their beards grow even thicker up there. I guess because of the climate,

191
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,680
 I don't know if there is an actual science behind that, but they just by the time they see anyone

192
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,040
 who's a local, they look like this weird-ass creature because they're wearing fur clothes, their faces,

193
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,800
 furry as hell. So the majority of Westerners who have been killed by locals is because they mistaken

194
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:17,440
 them for a Yeti or a brown bear. The majority of Westerners. Explorers who would go into these

195
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,440
 kind of uncharted territories. Really? This is so much more than Brian Blessed. Yeah, no, I believe.

196
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,480
 Brian, the most plausible fact I've heard about Yeti from you yet, but that's all right.

197
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,600
 When Thomas Moore was beheaded, he moved his beard out of the way and famously said,

198
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,120
 "My beard has not committed treason." Which? Those were his last words.

199
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,240
 My poor beard doesn't deserve this. Nor did his neck, though. Well, indeed, I think surely all your

200
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:56,800
 whole body has done it or none of it. Maybe the beard grew outpost treason. There are some cars

201
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,720
 that are too quiet. Some of the hybrid cars, the comics had to put artificial machines into the

202
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,240
 engines to make them loud so that people can hear them coming because people aren't ready yet for

203
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,480
 quiet cars. Also, the BMW M5 engine is so quiet that

204
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:19,440
 they've had to get the car to... The BMW M5 engine is so quiet that artificially plays car

205
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,840
 noises and engine noises inside the car on the stereo system so that people feel like they're

206
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,280
 driving a proper car with a rear end. Wow. In case they forget they're driving pretty much.

207
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,920
 They don't feel right because it's so quiet. It must be hard to know when a thing is on or off

208
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,720
 if the noise that you're used to hearing what it was happening. They say that the ATMs have that,

209
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,520
 don't they? I don't know if that's true even, but they say that if you get money out of an ATM it

210
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,440
 makes this worrying noise and they don't need to make that worrying noise, but they put that in so

211
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,880
 that you feel like it's actually doing something like it's counting your cash. Yeah, I don't know if

212
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,560
 that's true. I still love the ones when you ask for money. The fax noise still curved out.

213
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,920
 They're like in corner shops when they have the separate kind of you know, it'll charge you two

214
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:07,280
 pounds to take out. Yeah, you hear this dial up fax noise. And you're the only person you know

215
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,960
 is about that because you're the only person who uses cash machines that charge you. I do, but I

216
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,400
 always get out like 500 pounds because I think I want to get my money. It's weird psychologically,

217
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,200
 you have to justify that two pounds. It's true. It's like two pounds to 500 pounds. It's only like what,

218
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:30,240
 0.5% or something? 0.75%. Yeah, you're basically making money. I found something great thing about

219
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,880
 temperature and the sex of an alligator and some other reptiles like lizards and turtles is

220
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,520
 determined by how warm the nest is that they're laden. So for alligators, if the egg is kept in a

221
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,360
 nest at 30 degrees, it turns out female. And if it's 34 degrees, it turns out male. Really? How cool is that?

222
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,880
 That sounds like the kind of nonsense that Aristotle sort of amazed at. Yeah, I thought you were going to

223
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:02,880
 say my name. You have a new Aristotle. That nonsense. Because that feeling is true. Wow, because Aristotle

224
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,720
 thought that if we had a man had a warm right testicle at the time of sex and it would be a boy

225
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,960
 and vice versa, didn't he? No, that was bad. And that's why I continue to wear a hot water bottle

226
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:20,080
 around my right testicle. Strap time every time I'm trying for babies. Unfortunately, no one wants

227
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:27,760
 to have sex with me, so it could be the whole one of us. There was also the female Pope, wasn't there? No,

228
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,240
 did that never, she never existed? Oh, good because the stories were just so conflicting.

229
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,840
 What I read about. Is that it? Pope Jones, she, um, she died either by being mauled by an angry mob

230
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:45,600
 or of natural causes like that. That's a hell of an inquest. These wounds are consistent with one

231
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:55,200
 of two possible deaths. I have a question for you this week and it is about technology and it goes

232
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:02,240
 thus. In 1860, a new technology entered European life. Women who used it complained that it caused

233
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:11,120
 Was it a telephone? It was a telephone. Okay, come on, team. Let's hold this together. Okay,

234
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,440
 I have a question for you. It is about technology from the 19th century and it goes like this.

235
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,600
 In 1860, a new technology entered European life. Women who used it complained that it caused

236
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,560
 extreme genital excitement. What technology am I talking about? Tom Jones, Tom Jones, was it Tom Jones?

237
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:38,000
 I think he's a bit older than that. Oh, was it the, um, was it the saddle on a bicycle?

238
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,760
 Ah, that is about the right time. I like the saddle option because bicycles were strongly

239
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,440
 disapproved of for women because they were thought to be a turn on, wasn't they? Yes, yeah, yeah.

240
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,120
 Women should be a rouse. When you go over the cobbles. Yes. It's going to do it. Was it the

241
00:22:53,120 --> 00:23:00,320
 portable bath which was also invented in 1860, 1861 I think, which is like a bath on wheels,

242
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,000
 but it was also like a four-posted bed so you had those curtains around it and then you could

243
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,240
 be pushed all about the house. I saw that in the last of the summer line. Really? People used to go

244
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,360
 around the streets with portable baths I think and then you could have one. I think that's true.

245
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,480
 Like a bath merchant. Yeah, yeah. I used to have papier-mache bath as well. Some people

246
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,120
 invented those. Isn't that an incredible, because it was really light and it was actually also not

247
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,480
 water proof. Well, papier-mache is waterproof, is it? That must have been so hard to locate people

248
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,920
 you're looking for like in your home at the time. It's like, where's Dad? He's in the back. Is that the

249
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:44,960
 kitchen or is it? No, it's that the street. I'm afraid none of you are right. It was the sewing

250
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,840
 machine and French women who worked in sewing machine places from Don until dusk would do it all day

251
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,080
 and then complain to their husbands at the end of the day that they'd had extreme genital

252
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:07,600
 assignments. Wow. I think they're using it wrong. George Elliott, her real name was Mary Anne Evans.

253
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,440
 Yeah, that's right. Right. I think the first thing she wrote under the name George Elliott was an essay

254
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,600
 called Silly Novels by Lady Novelists. Oh, that's great. And it was basically slacking off all the

255
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,480
 women writers of the time saying these women are shit. It sounds like she was trying to get people off

256
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,160
 the scents, doesn't it? A little bit. This person could never be a woman. They're so misogynistic.

257
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,640
 I don't know. The Bronties also, they all did writing under soon enough. They've been really weird names.

258
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,240
 Kura Bell, Ellis Bell and Axon Bell. None of which is actually a name. If you look at them. They

259
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,040
 did Ellis is a name. Ellis is. Oh, I suppose so. Yeah. Maybe they're red names that we don't have anymore.

260
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:52,400
 But that's not so much. More apart of London. Yeah. Yeah. I want to open a studio in Axon called

261
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,960
 Light's Camera Acton. Oh, that's a very good idea. But we can start a German club that gets

262
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,440
 things done. It's called Acton Acton. I'm going to be fun. I'm going to go have some acting classes.

263
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,120
 Acting classes. No, no, no. No, acting classes. Learning about acting.

264
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,160
 Acton was founded in 1834. Oh, you are. Someone said that's an act of class.

265
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:29,520
 There was a study done in 2005 of 100 academics, critics and writers. And they found that of the men,

266
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,040
 four out of every five said the last novel they read was by a man. Yeah. I think the last novel

267
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,960
 I read was by a woman. Was it? Well done, you, you're such a modern man.

268
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,960
 Well, it was by George Elliott. I actually thought it was a man. There was a thing that was done

269
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,160
 recently by the BBC History magazine, which was to find the most stylish, fashionable,

270
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,840
 Britain of all time. Did I play?

271
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:03,840
 Okay, I have one more thing, which is about it's not directly related, but I found it in the course

272
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,480
 of my researching, which is about appearance and sexuality. And it's a recent study shows that

273
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,960
 men who watched sexy videos or handled lingerie sort immediate gratification, even when they were

274
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,960
 making decisions about completely different things about money and or sweets or whatever.

275
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,360
 So they tested your sort of delayed gratification ability and it declines. But the way that the

276
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,040
 three things they tested men out for were looking at pictures of beautiful women, watching video clips

277
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:38,240
 of young women in bikinis running through a park or touching bras. Apparently, that's what men

278
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,040
 are like. If you just let them touch a bra, not attached to someone, just a bra that they're all

279
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:52,240
 self-control out of the window. Have you guys seen the sniper outfits for the Iranian army?

280
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,560
 No, yes. The whole point of snipers are not meant to see them. So I thought they'll only have an outfit.

281
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,880
 So they've given the game away? Well, it's a camouflage. Oh, it's not, like, very colourful. No,

282
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,160
 but they look like. So they basically dress up their snipers as giant compost tapes. They look exactly

283
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,800
 like that character, Chewbacca. You know, that's what's he called, that wiki. A wiki. They look like

284
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,680
 wiki. It's extraordinary. And you see them on parade and they're these huge green haystacks.

285
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,440
 And it's obviously meant so you can hide in a bush and then snipe your hair. But also you want to move

286
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,160
 your arms quite easily. If you're dressed up as a haystack. I think you could just sit there and watch

287
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,440
 phrases. And what point do you put that on? Like you wouldn't get on the tube and leave your nose kind of. No

288
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,720
 one will know I'm here. That haystack, the rides are district-like. Yeah. And maybe when you enter the bush.

289
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,400
 Also, there's enough bush around you. Why do you need to disguise yourself as a bush? If you're in a

290
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,000
 bush, that is your disguise. You're a bush within a bush within a bush. You are a whole bush.

291
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,720
 Yeah, the bush. Be the bush. Which is the motto of Josh W. Bush. That's a whole bush family motto.

292
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,120
 Yeah. Is that why you're on and so much beef with him? You stole their catchphrase. Yeah.

293
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,960
 Be the bush. Does that sound like a fun quiz show that we should make?

294
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,160
 Oh, sorry. That is why I like it. It's just a lot of bushes and you have to guess which one is a person.

295
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:12,720
 That's a really nice idea. Camouflage the TV series. You just, which of these is not a tree?

296
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,320
 It's very, very hard to find the TV series Camouflage and the listings.

297
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,600
 Guys, it's up with other names. We should be the radio time. We should just claim that we're

298
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,280
 a six series in. Yeah. You never won, see that yet.

299
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,000
 It's a unique successful TV show ever, which is exactly what we hope to do.

300
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,520
 We're in thrill with the results.

301
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:42,240
 We need to pick up that laugh where we're left off. We just, ha ha ha, no.

302
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,040
 Well, now you can see what they are at the podcast, so heavily. Dan, James, Andy,

303
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,120
 and Anna will be back again next week. I won't. Happy new year.

304
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
 Yeah.

305
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
 Yeah.

306
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,840
 And this time, there's no escape.
