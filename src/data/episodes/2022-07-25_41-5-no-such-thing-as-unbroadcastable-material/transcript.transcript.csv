00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hey everyone, it's Alex here. You know, Alex Bell? No, you don't, because I'm never allowed on the podcast."
00:00:06,00:00:12,"Anyway, Dan James, Andy and Anna have all gone over Christmas, but I'm still stuck in the Kiwi office."
00:00:12,00:00:16,"They've told me to edit together a BEST of 2014 episode for no such thing as a fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:20,"but screw them, I've decided to put together a WORST of 2014."
00:00:20,00:00:25,"So here's some of the most crude, inane and ludicrous nonsense they've come up with over the past year"
00:00:25,00:00:27,that they never wanted you to hear. Enjoy.
00:00:27,00:00:32,"We run it on QI a few years ago, which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:32,00:00:33,You didn't know such thing as a fish.
00:00:33,00:00:37,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:37,00:00:40,"It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."
00:00:40,00:00:51,"Hello, welcome to another episode, and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:51,00:01:01,"from the KiI offices in Coffent Garden. Sorry, it's covered. I can't say it, Coffent, Coffent, Coffent."
00:01:01,00:01:07,"To be kind of health and safety, this is not quite related, but there's a guy called Hilleur"
00:01:07,00:01:16,"Purgric, he's like an eco warrior, and he tried to live in a cave in Brighton, but then his cave got"
00:01:16,00:01:22,"checked by the local fire brigade, and the council saw an injunction banning him from entering it,"
00:01:22,00:01:27,because it didn't have enough fire exits. Just had one exit. Just one big one.
00:01:27,00:01:33,"I think basically he's had like a running battle with the council, because they shut down his"
00:01:33,00:01:40,"vegetable shop in 1999, but they shut it down even though he only had one customer, a pregnant woman"
00:01:40,00:01:49,who bought his sprouts. He all went to give birth and stopped craving sprouts. He's exactly the end of it.
00:01:49,00:01:58,"We were talking about how to become an astronaut, and it was an interview last year with Dwayne Ross,"
00:01:58,00:02:05,"who was the manager of the astronaut selection office. And they asked him, this is Popsie,"
00:02:05,00:02:10,"any entertaining interview moments come to mind. And he said, one of my favourers was we had this one"
00:02:10,00:02:14,"person say when we asked him why he wanted to be an astronaut, well, my grandfather was an astronaut,"
00:02:14,00:02:19,"my father was an astronaut, and now I want to be an astronaut. We knew that wasn't true,"
00:02:19,00:02:21,but we didn't mind a little lightheartedness in the interview.
00:02:21,00:02:27,"That's very sweet. That's quite funny. I think I would have employed him, however,"
00:02:27,00:02:29,under qualified he was. I don't think they look for funny though.
00:02:29,00:02:33,"I wouldn't that get annoying after a year of an incessant joke. It might change his bad puns,"
00:02:33,00:02:41,"but yeah, it's totally, you can't escape. I don't even like him for half an hour."
00:02:41,00:02:49,It's just a mere pun. That was amazing. I was planning on demand. It's like those people who
00:02:49,00:02:54,can burp on demand. It's like a super power. It's like people who can burp on demand on the
00:02:54,00:03:05,little bit more irritating. I think Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan once can have
00:03:05,00:03:10,all done a lawsuit against a man with a barrel organ who was playing outside his house at all hours.
00:03:10,00:03:16,"I think you're right. I remember that happened, and I think they went to court and I think he lost."
00:03:16,00:03:20,I think he got really irate and smashed up the barrel organ and then had to pay for a new one.
00:03:20,00:03:25,"He was working, wasn't he, and he kept hearing this music all the time and he couldn't do his job."
00:03:25,00:03:27,"You think that's what was inspiring him? Yeah, you'd think that he would be grave"
00:03:27,00:03:32,with a free music. Apparently not. I wish there was someone outside my flat shouting out facts all
00:03:32,00:03:36,"the time, but I could just write it out. That would be amazing. If anyone has any facts that Andy"
00:03:36,00:03:46,lives on 27. I read that they found not too long ago the oldest spider web ever.
00:03:46,00:03:53,"It was in East Sussex, I think. It was in Amber. I was trying to come up with a really good joke"
00:03:53,00:03:59,"for that and I haven't done. Just giving up, dated. How the podcast's going for me."
00:03:59,00:04:07,"I was going to go say, ""Hey, I'm casting like George Osborne's wallet or you know Ming Campbell's."""
00:04:13,00:04:18,I didn't know the circumstances under which George Harrison lost his virginity and I find
00:04:18,00:04:23,"it hard to believe, but it's straight from the horse's mouth. He lost his virginity to a horse."
00:04:23,00:04:28,"Not a horse, a prostitute. Oh, sorry, that's funny."
00:04:28,00:04:32,"George Harrison, did you say? Yeah, they were on tour in Hamburg, the four of them. He lost"
00:04:32,00:04:36,his virginity to a prostitute while he was in bunk beds in the same room as the other three Beatles.
00:04:36,00:04:40,"They stayed quiet throughout the whole thing, but then they cheered as soon as he was finished."
00:04:40,00:04:45,"Yeah, they used to live in a- They were residents- Yeah, lots of marine in here, lots of marine."
00:04:45,00:04:51,"No, they had a residency at this bar in Hamburg and so they had to live in the back in these bunk beds,"
00:04:51,00:04:55,"so everything. They all- They didn't have to have sex with prostitutes in the back, though."
00:04:55,00:04:58,"No, but I mean, yeah, they did kind of there and nowhere else to go."
00:04:58,00:05:04,And that's what I'm saying is. What I'm saying is that's just what they all did. They all did it.
00:05:04,00:05:08,"Mr. Shriver, can you tell us why you had sex with that prostitute in the back of Tesco?"
00:05:09,00:05:13,"I had to do it. Yeah, the others had blocked up all the good spots in the Kiwis."
00:05:13,00:05:23,Can I quickly talk about just running generally? I was thinking about in sports because I remember
00:05:23,00:05:30,"someone saying how much David Beckham runs per match, which is a lot. I didn't remember the exact"
00:05:30,00:05:33,"amount, but then I thought, I wonder in other sports, I wonder which sport you run the most in"
00:05:33,00:05:40,"outside of running. And it's quite surprising. Someone's done a list of what happens. So with basketball,"
00:05:40,00:05:45,there's quite a lot of running that goes. It's something like 2.4 kilometers or something per match
00:05:45,00:05:56,that you end up running. Soccer is about 9 for the high end. It's roughly around 7. American football.
00:05:56,00:06:01,What do you think it is for American football? Less. About 500 metres. Are you counting walking off
00:06:01,00:06:07,"an odd again? Are you counting walking off an odd again? Yeah, counting everything. It depends which"
00:06:07,00:06:12,player you are. The running backs would run a long way. That's a thing. It's really tiny. There's
00:06:12,00:06:19,"only average per match, 11 minutes of movement. Isn't that insane? How long is a match? Three hours."
00:06:19,00:06:24,"Three hours, and there's only 11 minutes worth of movement for the whole match. Yeah, but what in"
00:06:24,00:06:31,"the number 11 hours? Couldn't they just do the 11 minutes and get it over with? No, it's much better"
00:06:31,00:06:38,"than that. It's like cricket. It's nuanced, let's say. And tennis. Tennis, they run a lot. Yeah, they do."
00:06:38,00:06:42,"Yeah, but it's surprising, I guess, when you consider the length of the field in comparison to say"
00:06:42,00:06:47,"like American football, you just think it's the higher end. It's just behind football. Do you have"
00:06:47,00:06:57,"figures for the 400 metres? No. I should have... Sorry. That's all right. I have a question for you all,"
00:06:57,00:07:07,"okay? Yeah, it's a question. In the last Olympics, you same bolt one, ran 100 metres in under 9.3 seconds,"
00:07:07,00:07:14,"but he didn't get a world record. Why? Is this work outable? Yeah. Okay, and it was during an"
00:07:14,00:07:20,Olympic contest. It wasn't a practice or anything. Wasn't a full start. Nope. He had his shoelaces untied.
00:07:20,00:07:24,"Nope, although he did have one shoelace untied when he broke the world record. Was he disqualified"
00:07:24,00:07:32,"for some reason for it? Nope. Was he just running for a bus? No, the answer is because it was part of"
00:07:32,00:07:37,"his 200 metre race. The second half of his 200 metre race, he did it in nine years. He took away"
00:07:37,00:07:43,"the recording cost. He had, you have a running start, don't you? Yeah. So whereas like a 100 metres,"
00:07:43,00:07:47,"you have to get up to that speed and 200 metres, you're already at that speed. That's fantastic."
00:07:47,00:07:53,"Yeah, that's good. That's really good. Good fact. We probably won't use this, but I just want to"
00:07:53,00:07:58,just... It was just when I was looking into smells and space and the the farting thing came up. I
00:07:58,00:08:09,"discovered a video. It's a sort of audio extract from the 1972 Apollo 16 mission, which John Young"
00:08:10,00:08:18,"is on the moon talking about farting, not knowing that his microphone is on. And he also swears."
00:08:18,00:08:22,"And it was a big deal because if you remember on a previous podcast, no such thing as a swearword"
00:08:22,00:08:27,"on the moon, they've done so much work to make sure astronauts don't swear on the moon. And this guy"
00:08:27,00:08:32,just let one go as he was talking about farting. And I've got it here. Let one go as he was talking about
00:08:32,00:08:36,"letting one go. Exactly. Yeah, so there is a swearword on the moon. It was John Young while talking about"
00:08:36,00:08:47,farting. And he swore twice. God. What a piece of shit. So basically this fact is pretty much
00:08:47,00:08:52,"just an excuse to talk about Serenol Finds. Well, he was expelled from the S.A.S. He calls it that"
00:08:52,00:08:59,"Castlecomb business, which is where he plotted to blow up bits of the set of Dr. Do Little."
00:08:59,00:09:04,And it was being filmed in Wiltshire and he was plotting to blow it up with some flares and plastic
00:09:04,00:09:10,"explosive. And he got 500 quip for that. He got busted, though, because some local squirrels saw him"
00:09:10,00:09:21,"doing it and reported it to Dr. Do Little. Yeah. Since we're on explorers, my new favourite explorer is"
00:09:21,00:09:26,"Joseph Banks, who was the botanist on Cook's expeditions. But he's so great. So he was this really"
00:09:26,00:09:31,charming guy who always befriended the locals wherever he went. So they landed on Tahiti and within
00:09:31,00:09:35,"days he was picking up bits of the language and he was sleeping with them, sometimes actually"
00:09:35,00:09:40,copulating with them and sometimes just sleeping next to them. And on the first day they arrived in
00:09:40,00:09:45,"Tahiti, picture the most cliched, like if you're watching a cartoon of discovering Tahiti."
00:09:45,00:09:50,And that's basically what happened. So they climbed ashore and they ended up on their first night
00:09:50,00:09:56,dining deliciously on fish and bread fruit. Joseph Banks sitting next to a Tahitian queen.
00:09:56,00:10:00,He spotted a really beautiful Tahitian lady at the opposite end of the dining
00:10:00,00:10:05,"area, beckoned to her. She came and sat on his other side. And they spent the whole evening"
00:10:05,00:10:09,"eating delicious tropical fruits and hanging out with beautiful Tahitian, soon they all went and"
00:10:09,00:10:15,"slept with over the next few days. It just sounds like the dream explorer. Yeah, it sounds like"
00:10:15,00:10:22,"they made it up. Didn't cook end up being killed in Ethan. Yeah, he did. And it sounds like there's"
00:10:22,00:10:26,a lot of theories about why that happened and it sounds like it was a miscommunication.
00:10:26,00:10:31,Am I making it up? Was it on the sandwich islands? Sandwich islands are now Hawaii aren't they?
00:10:31,00:10:34,I think it might have been the sandwich islands. I think I've just conflated two different stories
00:10:34,00:10:39,"in my head. One thing you've made in the Earl of Sandwich with Captain Kirk. Yeah, it didn't"
00:10:39,00:10:43,"the other sandwich. The meat, Captain Kirk. Between two slices of bread fruit."
00:10:43,00:10:52,"At the glorious Tahitian party, the thing that broke it up was that Tahitians didn't understand"
00:10:52,00:10:55,property so they kept on stealing cook stuff without quite realizing that it was stealing.
00:10:55,00:11:00,And the party was broken up on the first night they were there because two of the guys from the
00:11:00,00:11:05,expedition that had come on to land had a snuff box and their opera glasses pickpocketed.
00:11:05,00:11:11,Now what were these people doing bringing opera glasses onto a newly discovered Tahitian island?
00:11:11,00:11:19,"Into the South Pacific. Oh, into the South Pacific. You claim you didn't like musical theatre."
00:11:20,00:11:28,Can I just do something about haunted genitals? Yeah. There was a guy in the medical literature
00:11:28,00:11:34,who had a haunted scrotum and he went to the doctor because he had an undecided right testicle.
00:11:34,00:11:40,"And when they did a scan on him, they saw his left testicle and they said the left side of his"
00:11:40,00:11:46,scrotum seemed to be occupied by a screaming ghost-like apparition. Were these doctors?
00:11:46,00:11:52,"Yeah. And in the in the report that I read it said, ""But what of the undecended right testis?"
00:11:52,00:11:58,"None was found. If you were a right testis, would you want to share the scrotum with that?"""
00:11:58,00:12:04,The idea is this ghost-like left testicle scared away the right testicle.
00:12:04,00:12:09,I'm not sure they were being entirely serious about that reason.
00:12:09,00:12:11,"Yeah, this medical literature sounds very..."
00:12:11,00:12:17,"Have we talked, haven't we, before, about the African somewhere in Africa? There was a panic recently"
00:12:17,00:12:20,"where people believe that their testicles were disappearing, all that mean is that there's a lot of people."
00:12:20,00:12:24,"Yeah. People, this is a common cultural trope, yeah. And a bit of a South Asia."
00:12:24,00:12:25,"Yeah, we've all had Asia, it's a bit..."
00:12:25,00:12:27,"Don't feel bad, it happens to everyone."
00:12:27,00:12:34,"I was trying to think of stuff that we think is on one date, but actually it's on another."
00:12:34,00:12:38,"Oh, yeah. Obviously there's American Independence Day, which I think John Adams, at the time,"
00:12:38,00:12:43,"famously said, because Independence was voted for on the second of July."
00:12:43,00:12:48,"And John Adams famously wrote to his wife, didn't he? He's saying the second day of July,"
00:12:48,00:12:53,"1776 will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America, and was entirely wrong."
00:12:53,00:12:56,"It was obviously the 4th of July, which was when it went through."
00:12:56,00:13:02,But also I read about a 106-year-old woman who just discovered that she's been celebrating her birthday
00:13:02,00:13:07,on the wrong day for more than a hundred years. It was the previous day. They just found her
00:13:07,00:13:11,"birth certificate, and we're, that's weird. So technically now she's only six years old."
00:13:11,00:13:14,Yes. That's how it works. Yeah.
00:13:14,00:13:21,"Very, very quickly, because I think this is really cool. In 15th century Germany, speaking of vampires,"
00:13:21,00:13:28,"there was a biting epidemic that broke out, and one none in a convent fell to biting her companions,"
00:13:28,00:13:31,"and that spread throughout the convent, and then from one convent to the next, and it went from"
00:13:31,00:13:36,"Germany up to Holland and as far as Rome, and convent throughout the land, none's were just biting"
00:13:36,00:13:40,"each other. Wow. That's amazing. That's hysteria, I guess. Yeah, that's hysteria."
00:13:40,00:13:47,The same thing happens with non-meowing around the same time. What was the how did the meowing stop?
00:13:47,00:13:50,"It was a soldier who came, and it said that he would hit them, unless they stopped meowing."
00:13:50,00:13:52,He'd beat them with a pull. Did they work?
00:13:52,00:14:04,"Do you know in the book Dracula, how to kill a vampire?"
00:14:05,00:14:07,Stake through the heart. And got off the head?
00:14:07,00:14:13,"Yes, there's one other thing. Do you have sex with it, or is that just in modern adaptations?"
00:14:13,00:14:17,"I don't remember reading that in my edition, but I did get the penguin classics."
00:14:17,00:14:27,I was thinking of the the rays of sunlight. Oh yeah. So that never appeared in the original Dracula book.
00:14:27,00:14:32,"Oh, that's why I didn't know it. Yeah, it's exactly that. I just thought that that was the classic"
00:14:32,00:14:36,"thing that everyone knew about it. That was in the movie, the very very first movie. And the reason"
00:14:36,00:14:41,"it was put in the movie is because they didn't actually have the rights to use Dracula as an adaptation,"
00:14:41,00:14:48,so they created this other false ending to be able to say that this is a different vibe.
00:14:48,00:14:55,"I've got one last thing that I want to throw in before we move on, which is that there's been a"
00:14:55,00:15:02,study that's shown that male kangaroos can attract the opposite of sex. What's the opposite of sex?
00:15:02,00:15:05,"Oh, the opposite sex. What I normally end up having, mate."
00:15:05,00:15:17,"They aren't cool. Their genus is pongo, isn't it, which I quite like, the pongo genus. And I also"
00:15:17,00:15:20,"love reading about gorillas when you're reading it, like the new scientists, because they put their"
00:15:20,00:15:24,"scientific name after it. And obviously for gorilla, their scientific name is gorilla, gorilla,"
00:15:24,00:15:27,"gorilla. So they just, they'll refer to a gorilla and then in brackets, it just sounds like"
00:15:27,00:15:34,"they're chanting. Gorilla, gorilla, gorilla. I only think of pongo as being a name for extremely"
00:15:34,00:15:41,"posh people. Yeah. I've never heard that as a name. Oh, wow. Well, this is the secret clubs. I'm a member"
00:15:41,00:15:45,"of, you know, they tell you the secret names that really posh people have. I'm sure we think that"
00:15:45,00:15:50,"we have nicknames for posh people, but actually those posh people have nicknames for people, posh people."
00:15:50,00:15:59,"nicknames for people, the people at the top are just calling the queen pongo. Speaking of myths and"
00:15:59,00:16:09,"legends, who here is heard of the snow yeti of whales. Whales have their own yeti. Yeah, it's a"
00:16:09,00:16:14,really lovely story. This is the description of it by the locals. He has a repellent beast that
00:16:14,00:16:21,"has razor sharp teeth, a matted coat and eyes of flames. He has blue ear wax that trickles down his"
00:16:21,00:16:31,"chin. He lives alone in an igloo at the top of Mount Snowden. And yeah, he, he beneath his heart of"
00:16:31,00:16:36,"stone, he has someone who he cared about. So that's why he's angry. I don't know so many people who"
00:16:36,00:16:40,have climbed Mount Snowden. It's bizarre that none of them has ever mentioned it. Popped an igloo. Yeah.
00:16:40,00:16:45,"Maybe that's something I could go and look for. When we tell you all our facts for the week,"
00:16:45,00:16:51,so we can all look them up. Do you just type them plus yesi into google?
00:16:51,00:16:55,Seduantly yes.
00:16:55,00:17:06,"Daniel, quite her shoes are like. Yeah, I can grow a beard quite well. Have you done it?"
00:17:06,00:17:10,"Yeah, I have. It doesn't work. What do you mean?"
00:17:10,00:17:13,"It just doesn't work on a function as it's supposed to be. Well, he was aiming to look like Brian"
00:17:13,00:17:18,"Blessed. Yeah. Well, it's meant to suit your face, isn't it? It's meant to, you know, if you grow a bit,"
00:17:18,00:17:22,"you know, whatever you have on your face, you want it to suit it. And it doesn't really suit it."
00:17:22,00:17:30,"I'm speaking of Brian Blessed. He told me that when he was in Tibet last, a lot of the encounters"
00:17:30,00:17:34,that a lot of the Tibetans and the stories that come out about the idea that there are these
00:17:34,00:17:41,"ginormous yetis, I'm going with the yetis for a second, it turns out that the majority of people or yetis"
00:17:41,00:17:44,"that they thought they were seeing actually turned out to be Westerners because most explorers,"
00:17:44,00:17:49,"when they go out into these icy cold regions, they don't shower from months on end, they"
00:17:49,00:17:54,"can't shave or anything, their beards grow even thicker up there. I guess because of the climate,"
00:17:54,00:17:59,"I don't know if there is an actual science behind that, but they just by the time they see anyone"
00:17:59,00:18:05,"who's a local, they look like this weird-ass creature because they're wearing fur clothes, their faces,"
00:18:05,00:18:10,furry as hell. So the majority of Westerners who have been killed by locals is because they mistaken
00:18:10,00:18:17,them for a Yeti or a brown bear. The majority of Westerners. Explorers who would go into these
00:18:17,00:18:23,"kind of uncharted territories. Really? This is so much more than Brian Blessed. Yeah, no, I believe."
00:18:23,00:18:30,"Brian, the most plausible fact I've heard about Yeti from you yet, but that's all right."
00:18:30,00:18:35,"When Thomas Moore was beheaded, he moved his beard out of the way and famously said,"
00:18:35,00:18:41,"""My beard has not committed treason."" Which? Those were his last words."
00:18:41,00:18:46,"My poor beard doesn't deserve this. Nor did his neck, though. Well, indeed, I think surely all your"
00:18:46,00:18:56,whole body has done it or none of it. Maybe the beard grew outpost treason. There are some cars
00:18:56,00:19:02,"that are too quiet. Some of the hybrid cars, the comics had to put artificial machines into the"
00:19:02,00:19:06,engines to make them loud so that people can hear them coming because people aren't ready yet for
00:19:06,00:19:10,"quiet cars. Also, the BMW M5 engine is so quiet that"
00:19:10,00:19:19,they've had to get the car to... The BMW M5 engine is so quiet that artificially plays car
00:19:19,00:19:23,noises and engine noises inside the car on the stereo system so that people feel like they're
00:19:23,00:19:29,driving a proper car with a rear end. Wow. In case they forget they're driving pretty much.
00:19:29,00:19:33,They don't feel right because it's so quiet. It must be hard to know when a thing is on or off
00:19:33,00:19:38,"if the noise that you're used to hearing what it was happening. They say that the ATMs have that,"
00:19:38,00:19:43,"don't they? I don't know if that's true even, but they say that if you get money out of an ATM it"
00:19:43,00:19:47,"makes this worrying noise and they don't need to make that worrying noise, but they put that in so"
00:19:47,00:19:50,"that you feel like it's actually doing something like it's counting your cash. Yeah, I don't know if"
00:19:50,00:19:56,that's true. I still love the ones when you ask for money. The fax noise still curved out.
00:19:56,00:20:01,"They're like in corner shops when they have the separate kind of you know, it'll charge you two"
00:20:01,00:20:07,"pounds to take out. Yeah, you hear this dial up fax noise. And you're the only person you know"
00:20:07,00:20:10,"is about that because you're the only person who uses cash machines that charge you. I do, but I"
00:20:10,00:20:16,"always get out like 500 pounds because I think I want to get my money. It's weird psychologically,"
00:20:16,00:20:21,"you have to justify that two pounds. It's true. It's like two pounds to 500 pounds. It's only like what,"
00:20:21,00:20:30,"0.5% or something? 0.75%. Yeah, you're basically making money. I found something great thing about"
00:20:30,00:20:34,temperature and the sex of an alligator and some other reptiles like lizards and turtles is
00:20:34,00:20:41,"determined by how warm the nest is that they're laden. So for alligators, if the egg is kept in a"
00:20:41,00:20:47,"nest at 30 degrees, it turns out female. And if it's 34 degrees, it turns out male. Really? How cool is that?"
00:20:47,00:20:52,"That sounds like the kind of nonsense that Aristotle sort of amazed at. Yeah, I thought you were going to"
00:20:52,00:21:02,"say my name. You have a new Aristotle. That nonsense. Because that feeling is true. Wow, because Aristotle"
00:21:02,00:21:06,thought that if we had a man had a warm right testicle at the time of sex and it would be a boy
00:21:06,00:21:12,"and vice versa, didn't he? No, that was bad. And that's why I continue to wear a hot water bottle"
00:21:12,00:21:20,"around my right testicle. Strap time every time I'm trying for babies. Unfortunately, no one wants"
00:21:20,00:21:27,"to have sex with me, so it could be the whole one of us. There was also the female Pope, wasn't there? No,"
00:21:27,00:21:32,"did that never, she never existed? Oh, good because the stories were just so conflicting."
00:21:32,00:21:37,"What I read about. Is that it? Pope Jones, she, um, she died either by being mauled by an angry mob"
00:21:37,00:21:45,or of natural causes like that. That's a hell of an inquest. These wounds are consistent with one
00:21:45,00:21:55,of two possible deaths. I have a question for you this week and it is about technology and it goes
00:21:55,00:22:02,"thus. In 1860, a new technology entered European life. Women who used it complained that it caused"
00:22:02,00:22:11,"Was it a telephone? It was a telephone. Okay, come on, team. Let's hold this together. Okay,"
00:22:11,00:22:17,I have a question for you. It is about technology from the 19th century and it goes like this.
00:22:17,00:22:23,"In 1860, a new technology entered European life. Women who used it complained that it caused"
00:22:23,00:22:30,"extreme genital excitement. What technology am I talking about? Tom Jones, Tom Jones, was it Tom Jones?"
00:22:30,00:22:38,"I think he's a bit older than that. Oh, was it the, um, was it the saddle on a bicycle?"
00:22:38,00:22:43,"Ah, that is about the right time. I like the saddle option because bicycles were strongly"
00:22:43,00:22:47,"disapproved of for women because they were thought to be a turn on, wasn't they? Yes, yeah, yeah."
00:22:47,00:22:53,Women should be a rouse. When you go over the cobbles. Yes. It's going to do it. Was it the
00:22:53,00:23:00,"portable bath which was also invented in 1860, 1861 I think, which is like a bath on wheels,"
00:23:00,00:23:04,but it was also like a four-posted bed so you had those curtains around it and then you could
00:23:04,00:23:10,be pushed all about the house. I saw that in the last of the summer line. Really? People used to go
00:23:10,00:23:15,around the streets with portable baths I think and then you could have one. I think that's true.
00:23:15,00:23:20,"Like a bath merchant. Yeah, yeah. I used to have papier-mache bath as well. Some people"
00:23:20,00:23:25,"invented those. Isn't that an incredible, because it was really light and it was actually also not"
00:23:25,00:23:30,"water proof. Well, papier-mache is waterproof, is it? That must have been so hard to locate people"
00:23:30,00:23:35,"you're looking for like in your home at the time. It's like, where's Dad? He's in the back. Is that the"
00:23:35,00:23:44,"kitchen or is it? No, it's that the street. I'm afraid none of you are right. It was the sewing"
00:23:44,00:23:51,machine and French women who worked in sewing machine places from Don until dusk would do it all day
00:23:51,00:23:56,and then complain to their husbands at the end of the day that they'd had extreme genital
00:23:56,00:24:07,"assignments. Wow. I think they're using it wrong. George Elliott, her real name was Mary Anne Evans."
00:24:07,00:24:11,"Yeah, that's right. Right. I think the first thing she wrote under the name George Elliott was an essay"
00:24:11,00:24:17,"called Silly Novels by Lady Novelists. Oh, that's great. And it was basically slacking off all the"
00:24:17,00:24:22,women writers of the time saying these women are shit. It sounds like she was trying to get people off
00:24:22,00:24:28,"the scents, doesn't it? A little bit. This person could never be a woman. They're so misogynistic."
00:24:28,00:24:34,"I don't know. The Bronties also, they all did writing under soon enough. They've been really weird names."
00:24:34,00:24:40,"Kura Bell, Ellis Bell and Axon Bell. None of which is actually a name. If you look at them. They"
00:24:40,00:24:45,"did Ellis is a name. Ellis is. Oh, I suppose so. Yeah. Maybe they're red names that we don't have anymore."
00:24:45,00:24:52,But that's not so much. More apart of London. Yeah. Yeah. I want to open a studio in Axon called
00:24:52,00:24:58,"Light's Camera Acton. Oh, that's a very good idea. But we can start a German club that gets"
00:24:58,00:25:05,things done. It's called Acton Acton. I'm going to be fun. I'm going to go have some acting classes.
00:25:05,00:25:09,"Acting classes. No, no, no. No, acting classes. Learning about acting."
00:25:12,00:25:16,"Acton was founded in 1834. Oh, you are. Someone said that's an act of class."
00:25:16,00:25:29,"There was a study done in 2005 of 100 academics, critics and writers. And they found that of the men,"
00:25:29,00:25:35,four out of every five said the last novel they read was by a man. Yeah. I think the last novel
00:25:35,00:25:38,"I read was by a woman. Was it? Well done, you, you're such a modern man."
00:25:39,00:25:46,"Well, it was by George Elliott. I actually thought it was a man. There was a thing that was done"
00:25:46,00:25:52,"recently by the BBC History magazine, which was to find the most stylish, fashionable,"
00:25:52,00:25:55,Britain of all time. Did I play?
00:25:55,00:26:03,"Okay, I have one more thing, which is about it's not directly related, but I found it in the course"
00:26:03,00:26:08,"of my researching, which is about appearance and sexuality. And it's a recent study shows that"
00:26:08,00:26:14,"men who watched sexy videos or handled lingerie sort immediate gratification, even when they were"
00:26:14,00:26:18,making decisions about completely different things about money and or sweets or whatever.
00:26:18,00:26:25,So they tested your sort of delayed gratification ability and it declines. But the way that the
00:26:25,00:26:31,"three things they tested men out for were looking at pictures of beautiful women, watching video clips"
00:26:31,00:26:38,"of young women in bikinis running through a park or touching bras. Apparently, that's what men"
00:26:38,00:26:43,"are like. If you just let them touch a bra, not attached to someone, just a bra that they're all"
00:26:43,00:26:52,self-control out of the window. Have you guys seen the sniper outfits for the Iranian army?
00:26:52,00:26:58,"No, yes. The whole point of snipers are not meant to see them. So I thought they'll only have an outfit."
00:26:58,00:27:02,"So they've given the game away? Well, it's a camouflage. Oh, it's not, like, very colourful. No,"
00:27:02,00:27:08,but they look like. So they basically dress up their snipers as giant compost tapes. They look exactly
00:27:08,00:27:12,"like that character, Chewbacca. You know, that's what's he called, that wiki. A wiki. They look like"
00:27:12,00:27:17,wiki. It's extraordinary. And you see them on parade and they're these huge green haystacks.
00:27:17,00:27:21,And it's obviously meant so you can hide in a bush and then snipe your hair. But also you want to move
00:27:21,00:27:26,your arms quite easily. If you're dressed up as a haystack. I think you could just sit there and watch
00:27:26,00:27:31,phrases. And what point do you put that on? Like you wouldn't get on the tube and leave your nose kind of. No
00:27:31,00:27:36,"one will know I'm here. That haystack, the rides are district-like. Yeah. And maybe when you enter the bush."
00:27:36,00:27:40,"Also, there's enough bush around you. Why do you need to disguise yourself as a bush? If you're in a"
00:27:40,00:27:46,"bush, that is your disguise. You're a bush within a bush within a bush. You are a whole bush."
00:27:46,00:27:52,"Yeah, the bush. Be the bush. Which is the motto of Josh W. Bush. That's a whole bush family motto."
00:27:52,00:27:57,Yeah. Is that why you're on and so much beef with him? You stole their catchphrase. Yeah.
00:27:57,00:28:00,Be the bush. Does that sound like a fun quiz show that we should make?
00:28:00,00:28:06,"Oh, sorry. That is why I like it. It's just a lot of bushes and you have to guess which one is a person."
00:28:06,00:28:12,"That's a really nice idea. Camouflage the TV series. You just, which of these is not a tree?"
00:28:12,00:28:16,"It's very, very hard to find the TV series Camouflage and the listings."
00:28:16,00:28:21,"Guys, it's up with other names. We should be the radio time. We should just claim that we're"
00:28:21,00:28:25,"a six series in. Yeah. You never won, see that yet."
00:28:25,00:28:30,"It's a unique successful TV show ever, which is exactly what we hope to do."
00:28:30,00:28:31,We're in thrill with the results.
00:28:31,00:28:42,"We need to pick up that laugh where we're left off. We just, ha ha ha, no."
00:28:48,00:28:53,"Well, now you can see what they are at the podcast, so heavily. Dan, James, Andy,"
00:28:53,00:28:57,and Anna will be back again next week. I won't. Happy new year.
00:28:57,00:28:59,Yeah.
00:28:59,00:29:01,Yeah.
00:29:01,00:29:05,"And this time, there's no escape."
