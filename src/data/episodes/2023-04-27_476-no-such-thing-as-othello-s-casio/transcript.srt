00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's episode of Fish, we wanted to

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,540
 let you know that our special guest this week is none other than Cariad Lloyd. Cariad has

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,560
 been on the show before, of course, you may remember her very funny previous appearances.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,120
 This time she's back and she's better than ever. And the good news for those of you who

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,600
 are Cariad fans is that she has just written a new book. Cariad is the host of the Grief

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,920
 cast and the book that she's written is all about grief. It's about her grief, about

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,960
 other peoples, about what we do when someone we love dies and it's brilliant. It's full

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,200
 of interesting facts for those of you who like facts and if you are listening to this

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,400
 you probably do. And it's also very heartfelt, it's very personal, it's very moving, it's

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,560
 very funny, it's all of these things and more so do check it out, it's called You Are

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,680
 Not Alone. And if you'd like to see Cariad in a live setting she is also part of the

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,960
 brilliant Jane Austen themed improvised comedy group, Ostentatious. And they are on every

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,520
 Monday at the moment at the Arts Theatre just near Leicester Square in London. It's a very

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,520
 funny show, I can personally attest to that. Do book first. Okay, that's it. On with the

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:20,520
 show.

16
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,760
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,140
 to you from the relocated QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

18
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,820
 with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Cariad Lloyd and once again we have gathered

19
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,120
 around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in a particular

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,160
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Cariad.

21
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,280
 Hello, my fact is that if you are having trouble with your grief it might be Bill Murray's

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
 fault.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,360
 Oh, because he kills again.

24
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,320
 And then he finds people who are grieving and he hits them, that's his thing. No, because

25
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,360
 I should backtrack this and say that the reason it might be Bill Murray's fault is the very

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,960
 famous film Groundhog Day which is based on the five stages of grief theory. The five stages

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,120
 of grief theory is a very, very famous theory, began in 1969, created by Elizabeth Kubler-Ross

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,160
 in her book On Death and Dying and it really has been the most famous grief theory since

29
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,820
 then. It has now contested heavily, it's considered not to be that helpful or useful, but it's

30
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,560
 still the grief that most people encounter when they enter the world of grief. It's the

31
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,960
 thing that people will come up to me still and say, "Oh, you know, I'm trying to do the

32
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,080
 five stages, it's not really working." And it makes me want to scream because it's, I

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,280
 can swear, I can't, yeah. It's bullshit. But the film Groundhog Day is based on the five

34
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,080
 stages which I think helps to promote this idea that the five stages of grief is something

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,000
 that you can work through. Grief is something that will end.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,400
 Can you give us the five stages?

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,000
 I can, man, give you the five stages.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,040
 You wake up, you wake up, they're playing the same song as they were yesterday.

39
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,160
 Something about a weather report, I haven't seen this film. James, genuinely, have you

40
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
 not seen Groundhog Day?

41
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
 I'm afraid not.

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,120
 Oh, you know what? It is worth, it is one of those that does stand up to watching.

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
 Yeah, no.

44
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,680
 James hasn't seen any films before about 2000 and...

45
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
 Something like that. Well, I've seen some.

46
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,200
 There's a few that make it through.

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,840
 Normally, I'm absolutely fine when you say you haven't seen a particular film and sometimes

48
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,440
 you'll say, "You want that? I'm shocked."

49
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
 Groundhog Day.

50
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
 Groundhog Day's one of these.

51
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,400
 I don't think it's like, I haven't seen that on TV much. Is it on TV all the time?

52
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,320
 In my childhood it was a classic. It was one of those ones that would be on all the time.

53
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,160
 That was in Australia. So, okay, I reckon it's Denial.

54
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,280
 Oh, yeah, Acceptance.

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,760
 Denial of the next subject.

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,520
 And that is where people struggle.

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,800
 No, the five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance or the

58
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,400
 worst boy band in your life, basically.

59
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,800
 Yeah. And so that was Elizabeth Kubleros who defined these five stages of grief.

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,120
 But isn't she, I thought that when she came up with it, first off, it was to relate to

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,640
 the dying as opposed to grief.

62
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
 Yes, yes.

63
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,320
 But then secondly, she also said this doesn't happen in any particular order. It's much

64
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,760
 like the facts on our podcast.

65
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
 Yes.

66
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,560
 You can have acceptance, but then later have denial.

67
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,560
 Well, they always start with the celebrity, don't they?

68
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
 Yes, sir.

69
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,920
 So, on her book on Death and Dying, written in 1969, written in 10 weeks, she had something

70
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,920
 like an article in Time magazine where they were like, "Wow, this woman's doing amazing

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,800
 work." And then someone was like, "You should write a book." And she wrote the book and

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,080
 it became the best seller that it is.

73
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
 Yeah.

74
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,640
 I mean, you can write a book fast. It doesn't mean it will be bad. It's just like, it's

75
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,400
 very of its moment, of its time.

76
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,240
 She was an amazing woman. She was a founder of the hospice movement. She was working with

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,320
 people with AIDS in the 80s before that was considered safe. She was incredible. And at

78
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,840
 this time, she was working in hospitals where people were terminally ill, mainly with cancer.

79
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,200
 And this was a time when they didn't even use the C word. They were just saying malignancy.

80
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,480
 And they would also not tell people. So, for example, if a wife was sick, they would tell

81
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,600
 the husband, not the wife. So, she would be being told, she'd be having like radiotherapy

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320
 and she'd be told, "It's to make you better." But they'd all be going to her husband. She's

83
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
 not going to live.

84
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,520
 So, she came into this situation and was like, "Hmm, this isn't great." If you told people

85
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,560
 that they were dying, she observed when she did that and helped them through it, that

86
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,920
 they would go through five distinct stages and they would reach an acceptance. And it

87
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,280
 would, I mean, that makes no sense. They would deny it first of all, like, "Oh, no, I'm not

88
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,000
 really ill. I'm fine. I can't believe it's me. Why am I dying? Oh, God, why did you do

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,560
 this to me? This is the worst thing. Actually, okay, I'm dying. I'm going to pay off my debts

90
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,000
 and apologize to all those people." So, she was talking about people dying. And I honestly,

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 in my research for my book, couldn't find the moment that it became about grieving. It

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,880
 just became about grieving because it was like, "Well, it's death. It's same room." And

93
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,960
 it makes no sense for a grieving person. Like, anyone who's been through any loss will tell

94
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,840
 you, like, "You don't go through five distinct stages. You get them pretty much all at once

95
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,040
 all the time and it can, you know, hit you five years later, two years later, 10 years

96
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,560
 later." So, I meet so many people who are like, "Oh, God, I feel so bad. Like, I need

97
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,920
 to get to acceptance. I haven't done it." And I'm always raging because I'm like, "That

98
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,920
 isn't what grief looks like." But the reason it works in a film is that's how films work.

99
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,000
 They need to end and we all need to walk away thinking.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,360
 I mean, not all films. No, good films will do that. I'm fingering a few mental suspects.

101
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,520
 What? I haven't seen that film.

102
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
 Hello.

103
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,760
 Although, Andy McDowell is in that as well.

104
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,080
 I think we're in a few mental suspects.

105
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,680
 She plays the doctor. She's really good.

106
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,160
 We should just quickly say, because James hasn't seen "Groundhog Day." So Bill Murray

107
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,920
 is a journalist. He goes to this town to do "Groundhog Day."

108
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
 The weatherman.

109
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,720
 He's the weatherman. He wakes up in the morning and the day has begun again. He's conscious

110
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,520
 of it. No one else is. And then the day has begun.

111
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
 Yeah.

112
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
 So he's...

113
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
 Like a Russian doll at a TV show.

114
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
 Yes.

115
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

116
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,520
 Happy Death Day is like...

117
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

118
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,920
 But he reacts differently. So, first of all, he's like, "This isn't happening." Then he

119
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,000
 gets furious. And he starts experimenting with his day. Like, "Well, if I do this, will

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,040
 I be here tomorrow?" And it doesn't matter what he does.

121
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,920
 He tries literally everything. It's a weird moment where he starts fingering.

122
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
 But...

123
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:23,640
 And he's trying to woo Andy McDowell's character. And eventually, he learns everything about

124
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,840
 her becomes perfect and it still doesn't work.

125
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,040
 That's a bit creepy, isn't it?

126
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,640
 It's really creepy. It's creepy. That doesn't really stand up to today's standards.

127
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
 No.

128
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
 But it is a...

129
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
 It is a great film.

130
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
 It is a brilliant film.

131
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

132
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
 Kubler Ross.

133
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
 Oh, yeah. Cubs.

134
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
 Cubs.

135
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
 Cubs.

136
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
 She has a cool phrase.

137
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,240
 "There's no such thing as..." Any guesses?

138
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
 Death.

139
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
 Yeah, death.

140
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
 Oh, did she?

141
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
 Yeah, she said like she became...

142
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
 Her podcast is great.

143
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
 Yeah.

144
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,440
 It's like a mixture of our podcast and your podcast.

145
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,040
 Yeah, yeah. My God, yeah.

146
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,600
 She basically became so convinced there was an afterlife that she said, "We don't need

147
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,760
 to worry about death. There's no such thing as death."

148
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,320
 That's why she was great at getting people into acceptance. It's just like, "Don't worry

149
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
 about it, guys. It's fine."

150
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,360
 But the weird thing is, in her original book, the 1969 one, she called the belief in life

151
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,200
 after death a form of denial. So she actually thought that life after death was complete

152
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,120
 bullshit, and then she went through a change in her life.

153
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
 Wow.

154
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
 So she became like...

155
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,000
 Yeah, so she met a patient in a hospital who was called Mrs. Schwartz, and Mrs. Schwartz

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,480
 had been pronounced dead, and then hours later, she was found alive by a nurse.

157
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
 So...

158
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
 Wondering the story.

159
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,480
 Yeah. So she went to interview her to say what happened, and she recounted that she said,

160
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,240
 "I remember everything that happened. I remember being above my body. I remember a joke that

161
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,920
 the doctor told in the room when I was laying there dead." All that stuff. And that is what

162
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
 made...

163
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
 In appropriate, report that.

164
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
 Exactly.

165
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,440
 So Kubla Ross basically went, "Ah, this is interesting," and became obsessed with it.

166
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,640
 And she even went to have, as it were, out-of-body experiences through a guy called Robert Monroe.

167
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,120
 And then as she got further into it, she believed that she had spirit guides that she was contacting,

168
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,120
 one of whom was Mrs. Schwartz, who did later die, and then came back to sort of instruct

169
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,840
 Kubla Ross about her ideas about the afterlife.

170
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,640
 And this woman is in charge of most known grief theory, known to humanity, like Western

171
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
 culture, yeah.

172
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,160
 So one thing you write about in the Bookabit Carrier is the Victorian mourning rituals,

173
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,960
 and how, although they were very starchy and very formal, they did give you a kind of structure.

174
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,640
 And then you mention all the different paraphernalia of mourning.

175
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
 Yeah, they were mad.

176
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,440
 Yeah, I mean, it was really a culture highly focused on that. I can't remember if you

177
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,000
 remember, but there's mourning stationery. Yeah, so yeah, that's really common. Yeah,

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 mourning stationery.

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,560
 You get a black edged card, and when you receive that, you know that the person who sent it

180
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
 to you is...

181
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,480
 I was thinking like rulers and charlatans and stuff.

182
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,640
 They had, in Regent Street, Jay's of Regent Street, was basically like the prime arc of

183
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
 grief and death.

184
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,160
 So where you went and got all your clothes from, and all your hats, and like gentlemen's

185
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,440
 funeral scarves had to be a certain length.

186
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,160
 There was like a book that told you everything, like from the length of the bow around your

187
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,360
 hat to the staff, to the colour of the ribbon on your door, to your mourning jellies.

188
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,960
 They kind of like made an industry of it as a Victorian...

189
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
 So what is mourning jellies?

190
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,120
 The jellies that you have when you're mourning.

191
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
 Would they be like black?

192
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,640
 I don't know, actually. I never saw one. I just read about it in the book.

193
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,880
 But is it for serving at a wake or something like that?

194
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,960
 I guess serving after a funeral, yeah. Or maybe you have it like on a Sunday when you're

195
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
 feeling gloomy.

196
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:28,680
 Well, jelly used to be, I mean, if we're talking London, there used to be pubs where if you

197
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:35,200
 saw someone eating jelly, a woman, that would mean that she was available for sexual experiences.

198
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,720
 I didn't know that. I need to stop eating jelly in public.

199
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
 Purchase sexual experiences.

200
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,920
 Yeah, yeah, it wasn't like a traffic light party.

201
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
 No, but...

202
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,920
 If you're eating strawberry jelly, you're not up for it.

203
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,040
 It's like handkerchief culture in the...

204
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
 Muffa knuckle...

205
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
 Knock a muffling?

206
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
 One of those?

207
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
 Say it again.

208
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
 Knock a muffling.

209
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
 What's a knock a muffling?

210
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,920
 It's loud to upset people at the house.

211
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
 A door knocker on your house?

212
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
 Oh.

213
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
 You'd muffle it if someone's died.

214
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
 Yeah, and you'd also...

215
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
 To respect.

216
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
 You'd have different colors as well.

217
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,840
 So, like, there was a black crate ribbon outside, it meant adult and it meant a child

218
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,600
 had died in this house and it would be muffled and there was...

219
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,960
 Yeah, there was like...

220
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,280
 It would cost you so much money to do a proper considered funeral.

221
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,560
 Like, I think they read even a middle-class funeral at the time would have been like a

222
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
 thousand pounds.

223
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
 Like, it was really...

224
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
 Right.

225
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,760
 And they had funeral clubs where you'd all put money in every week so that you could

226
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,360
 get like the funeral you like that person deserves because if they didn't, they considered

227
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
 their soul would wander around forever, basically.

228
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
 Oh, really?

229
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,880
 So, it's like your pension, you know, you'll put in every week and then when you need the

230
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
 money you can take it.

231
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
 Like a turkey club?

232
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,880
 Like a turkey club, but for the dead.

233
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
 Yeah, turkey's dead, I suppose.

234
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,600
 But they don't get anything after that.

235
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
 No, you're right.

236
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
 Well, they don't pay, I suppose.

237
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,640
 Would you have like, you know, for a wedding you have like a present list.

238
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,600
 Was there a similar thing where I'd like this at my funeral and I'll take care of it?

239
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
 I think it was pretty set.

240
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
 It was...

241
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
 Yeah.

242
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
 You just go.

243
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
 Can I just tell you one very tangential thing about knockers, door knockers?

244
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,760
 You told me it was tangential, here we go.

245
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,600
 So, I was reading about knocker muffling and then I just sort of went around the rabbit

246
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:15,740
 hole of door knockers, you know that in old Tehran, houses would have two door knockers,

247
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,960
 one was square and heavier and the other was more rounded.

248
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
 Can you guess why?

249
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
 One for the ladies?

250
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
 It's one for the ladies.

251
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
 No!

252
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
 It's one for the men.

253
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,640
 It's a big square one and women use the rounded one and then you know who's knocking at the

254
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,440
 door and so then the woman of the house might not answer the door to a man for kind of cultural

255
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
 reasons.

256
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,120
 They might also, I read this, they might disguise their voice behind the door to ask the business

257
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,720
 of who's coming around.

258
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,960
 Oh, is that like saying, "Oh, I've got some big men here that are going to beat you up

259
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
 if you come in."

260
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
 Is that how you do...

261
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
 Is that what you do?

262
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,680
 That's what I say every time someone knocks.

263
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
 Just in case they might be coming in to attack.

264
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

265
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,680
 It's good to let people know what's happening inside.

266
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
 At an imaginary dog.

267
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
 "You're done!

268
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,680
 Brute us down!"

269
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
 That kind of thing, you know, that really works.

270
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,680
 That's when Julia Caesar's coming around, isn't it?

271
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,980
 That's that great machine, quantity routine and she did it in her sitcom where you order

272
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,680
 too many pizzas and the pizza guy's done it with six and you go, "Yeah, it's here, it's

273
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,680
 here!"

274
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,680
 "I'll bring it in a minute."

275
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
 And then they're like, "It's just for you."

276
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,920
 You could make it bigger, couldn't you, Andy, and have lots of different knockers, like a

277
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,920
 knocker for your delivery guy and a knocker for a Jehovah's Witness person or whatever.

278
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
 Don't come in!

279
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
 I've got some big men in here!

280
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,920
 I don't want to know about eternal salvation!

281
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,920
 And so, how long was mourning in that?

282
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,920
 Depends.

283
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
 So, they had a rule for every single situation.

284
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,920
 So, like, rule for like your second cousin, your second cousin's child, your sister, your...

285
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,920
 But for the most common people know, it's like for a partner.

286
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,520
 So, a widow would have a year in mourning where she had to wear black and then you go

287
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
 into half-morning and quarter-morning.

288
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,520
 And if you, in that year, got married, you're allowed to, like, not wear black for the day

289
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
 and then back in your black dress the next day.

290
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,520
 So, you could have a new husband and be like, "Sorry, babes, do you remember Alfred?"

291
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
 He was great, wasn't he?

292
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
 I'm still pretty sad.

293
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
 When did we drop?

294
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
 It was like a moment where we dropped this for some reason.

295
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,520
 Well, that's really interesting, because I don't think we have dropped it.

296
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,520
 Because I think we still have an expectation that we expect people to be over things by about

297
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
 a year.

298
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,520
 We've passed a year to two years, and with grief, we're a bit like, "Oh, gosh, three years.

299
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
 Like, she's still upset."

300
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,520
 And then, of course, you get the black armbands, which were still going up.

301
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,520
 Like, my mum wore a black armband when her granny died in the '60s.

302
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,520
 But I would say she's like the last person I've spoken to who...

303
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,520
 But you still get soccer players doing that, right?

304
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
 Yeah, so soccer...

305
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,520
 I'm sorry, my brain went football in my head.

306
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,520
 Sports people and, like, military stuff still wear them.

307
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,520
 But other than that, obviously, you used to just wear it day to day.

308
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,520
 And that comes up on my podcast that people wished there was still a thing you could have

309
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
 that would mean, like, sort of handle with care.

310
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,520
 Because it's like, you don't want to be a society that says you have to wear a black armband.

311
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,520
 But for some people, you know, if you're going to a shop, you're on a tube.

312
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
 It's a bit like baby on board.

313
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
 It's like, "I'm in grief.

314
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
 Like, just be careful with me.

315
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
 Like, if I'm in a shop or like..."

316
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
 You have badges, don't you?

317
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,520
 I did sell badges.

318
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,520
 Yeah, but I couldn't keep up with the demand.

319
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
 What did it say?

320
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
 It said, "Please be kind.

321
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
 I'm grieving."

322
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
 And it had two little hands.

323
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
 And then one said, "DDC member."

324
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
 It was in Dead Dad Club with DMC.

325
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,520
 And there was a little amazing artist called Camille Bersini who designed them.

326
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,520
 And it was like a little purple ghost with a hat with a flower.

327
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
 Oh, Dead Mom's Club.

328
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
 No, I was thinking Ron DMC.

329
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
 That can't be.

330
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
 I thought you...

331
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
 They're dead.

332
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
 They're dead.

333
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
 It's like that.

334
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
 And that's the way it is.

335
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
 Yeah, yeah.

336
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,520
 So, yeah, it's a shame in a way that we don't have.

337
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
 Yeah, I agree.

338
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,520
 Because you never know what anyone's going through at any time.

339
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
 Yeah, yeah.

340
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,520
 Although I can see why the Victorians were very strict, obviously, like you had to do it.

341
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
 And if a woman couldn't...

342
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,520
 You would know where you'd be allowed to walk around in like, you know, a bright yellow dress the next day.

343
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,520
 I think we'd have to draw a line on where, what kind of badges you'd have.

344
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,520
 Because I definitely would have like, "Be gentle, lost an eBay purchase."

345
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
 Like, you know...

346
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,520
 I feel a small badge, isn't it?

347
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,520
 I've only got facts about groundhogs now.

348
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
 Let's talk about groundhogs.

349
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
 Oh, groundhogs, yeah.

350
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
 You mind?

351
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
 No.

352
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
 Groundhog Day.

353
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
 Yeah.

354
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
 It's about groundhogs, is it?

355
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,520
 Because there's a special groundhog who comes up and if he can see his shadow, it's going to snow for a month or so.

356
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
 Have you seen the film Groundhog Day?

357
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
 All this stuff.

358
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
 They get him out of his little nest.

359
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
 Punctutaniville, isn't he?

360
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
 Punctutaniville.

361
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
 But there are loads of groundhogs.

362
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
 That's an interesting thing.

363
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,520
 I mean, all over, lots of places have a groundhog celebration.

364
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,520
 I was just wondering if punctutani is the most difficult word that everyone knows how to pronounce.

365
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,520
 Yes, from the film Groundhog Day.

366
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,520
 But basically, if they get him out and if he turns around and sees his shadow, then there'll be another six weeks of winter.

367
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
 And if he doesn't, then the spring will come.

368
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
 How do they know if he sees it?

369
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:56,520
 Well, what I read was, in real Punctutani, there are two scrolls, and if Phil picks the scroll that says he sees a shadow,

370
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
 that's how they know he's seen a shadow.

371
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
 So there's these secret scrolls.

372
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,520
 Do they look up the long-range weather forecast and lace one of them with groundhog food or whatever?

373
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
 They must do, right?

374
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
 They must do.

375
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

376
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,520
 It takes place on Gobler's Knob, I read.

377
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,520
 Do you know where the name Gobler's Knob comes from?

378
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
 There's two theories.

379
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,520
 If you get either of them, you can have a point.

380
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
 Goblin's Knob?

381
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
 No.

382
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:31,520
 Was it somebody was gobbling a man's knob and they said, "We should call this Gobler's Knob,"

383
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
 because she's always there, she's always doing that.

384
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
 What, Jelly Sue? Yeah, Jelly Sue.

385
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,520
 And Jelly Sue didn't stick with me.

386
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
 That's not one of the two theories that I have.

387
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
 Okay, sure, fine.

388
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,520
 You stick with your theories, I'll stick with mine.

389
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
 Oh, is it where people ate on mountains?

390
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,520
 Yeah, like a knob is just like a hillock.

391
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,520
 Well, that's why I thought Goblin's Knob, because it looks like a goblin's.

392
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
 No, no, no, your theory was not bad.

393
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
 Oh, he's going to get it.

394
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,520
 So it's where the old shoe mender used to buy his trade, Gobler's Knob, and slowly it became Goblin's Knob.

395
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
 Why? Why did they start going?

396
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
 Because he gave a lot of blowjobs.

397
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
 Yeah, yeah, I'm going to call it Goblin.

398
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
 It's an offer to sell shoes.

399
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,520
 Is that like a happy ending for massages, but in the shoe cleaning trade?

400
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,520
 You know when he comes down to measure your feet?

401
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
 He's bending down.

402
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
 Well, I'm down here.

403
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,520
 No, it's because a group of turkeys might have lived there.

404
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:34,520
 And then another theory is like Dan said, maybe there were hunters and then that's where they would eat their food after the hunt.

405
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,520
 So they would gobble up the food, but I think the turkeys are the most likely ones.

406
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
 Yeah, that is good.

407
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
 I didn't know groundhogs.

408
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
 The groundhogs are amazing.

409
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
 Yeah, sure.

410
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
 No, they really are.

411
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,520
 So I didn't know they were the same as a woodchuck and it's the largest member of the squirrel family.

412
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,520
 What?

413
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
 Oh, no, and they're brilliant diggers.

414
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,520
 So they dig, they'll dig several feet down in a row.

415
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,520
 They live in burrows several feet down, then a few feet up, and then they level out and go along.

416
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,520
 And then off the side of that main tunnel, they'll dig several different rooms, one of which is the toilet room.

417
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
 And they only go to the loo in there.

418
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,520
 And then when it's full, they just seal it up and they dig a new toilet elsewhere.

419
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,520
 They're very clean.

420
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,520
 Yeah, I was going to say the first thing that you said they got down and up is that so they got drowned.

421
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:22,520
 They go to dig another room and they're like, oh no, that's three years ago's toilet.

422
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
 Close up, close up, close up.

423
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
 You have to hit it eventually.

424
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
 There's how many rooms, how long is, I guess you keep moving the tunnel down.

425
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,520
 You really have to hide that when selling it, wouldn't you, to the next Grand Old Family?

426
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
 Oh, don't, don't.

427
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
 What's that on these walls?

428
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

429
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
 We want to extend, no, you can't.

430
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,520
 You can't extend that.

431
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:48,520
 Okay, it's time for fact number one and that is Carriette.

432
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
 Boom.

433
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
 Brilliant.

434
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,520
 It's actually time for fact number two and that is James.

435
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,520
 Okay, my fact this week is that there's a bus tower in Hong Kong,

436
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,520
 which is specifically run for people to sleep all the way through.

437
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
 Lovely.

438
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
 Lovely, lovely idea.

439
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
 Sounds great, doesn't it?

440
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
 Is it because people are tired in Hong Kong?

441
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
 That's part of the reason.

442
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
 What do you think, Andy?

443
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,520
 Otherwise, it'd be a terrible place to do this.

444
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,520
 You just get people out and they're all like, no, I'm wide awake.

445
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
 We're not sleeping in Hong Kong.

446
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,520
 Why can't they get a normal bus?

447
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
 I love sleeping on the bus.

448
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
 Why can't they just get a bus?

449
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
 Well, they could.

450
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
 It stops, doesn't it?

451
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
 And so they might wake you up and kick you off the bus.

452
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,520
 The idea came from this guy, Kenneth Kong.

453
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,520
 He worked for a bus tour organizer and he was chatting to one of his friends

454
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
 and his friends said he was really stressed, you know,

455
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,520
 he's got a really busy job, couldn't sleep at night.

456
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
 But whenever he traveled to work on the bus,

457
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
 he would always kind of fall asleep.

458
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
 And Kenneth Kong thought this is amazing.

459
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
 This is such a good idea.

460
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,520
 I'm going to do a bus tour where people are just encouraged to sleep.

461
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,520
 And unlike a normal bus ride,

462
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,520
 we're going to give you a goodie bag with an eye mask, some ear plugs.

463
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,520
 Maybe we'll get a very soporific tour guide or something.

464
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
 That's a good idea.

465
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
 But actually the first time they did it,

466
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
 they had the upper deck for people who wanted to sleep

467
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,520
 and the lower deck was for people who wanted to have a tour guide chat into them.

468
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,520
 Which feels like the wrong way around because if you want to see the site,

469
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
 you want to be on the top.

470
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
 Exactly. Really good point.

471
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,520
 But anyway, they noticed that a lot of people found that more difficult

472
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
 and didn't sleep, so now they're making two separate bus tours.

473
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
 One for sleepers and one for not sleepers.

474
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,520
 I also read as well that I don't know if they do this every single time,

475
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,520
 but they might start with a huge two hour long lunch.

476
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,520
 So that's a very good idea.

477
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,520
 You go into a food coma as you're getting on the bus.

478
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
 Oh, nice.

479
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
 You could do this for lots of things

480
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,520
 because there are lots of activities where you're put in a...

481
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,520
 Like the cinema, for example, or theatre, or an opera.

482
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,520
 Are you suggesting that you go to sleep in a...

483
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
 I'm saying that it's very easy to fall asleep,

484
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
 especially if the thing is not good.

485
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,520
 I once went to a Bach concert, which is, you know...

486
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,520
 It's really sort of deep and sort of quite long notes and stuff,

487
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
 and about halfway through I looked around and literally half.

488
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,520
 The men mostly, I must say, but they were mostly asleep.

489
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
 Yeah, yeah.

490
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,520
 I used to go to lunchtime concerts at Wigmore Hall,

491
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,520
 and I thought, "Oh, this is an exciting London thing to do,"

492
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
 but it was full of people head nodding,

493
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
 just like, "Oh, this is so nice. I'm on my lunch break."

494
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
 It's very hard to do this.

495
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
 Yeah, you could get like 15 minutes, couldn't you?

496
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,520
 That's headbangers, you know, at metal concerts.

497
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
 Actually, I'm just about to fall asleep.

498
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
 Time to wake it up.

499
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
 Wake up, Gary. It's just about to stop.

500
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
 I once went to Brian Blessed's house,

501
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
 and I was hanging out with him,

502
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
 and he tells stories that go on and on,

503
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,520
 and it was just me and him sitting in his adventurous shed that he has.

504
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,520
 And I was so tired, and he was telling me stories,

505
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
 and I fell asleep.

506
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
 And I remember waking up with that sudden start,

507
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
 and I looked up, and he was still talking at me.

508
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
 Amazing.

509
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
 He just did, and we would definitely way further away

510
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
 than where the story was when I fell asleep.

511
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
 That's great.

512
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
 We could hire Brian Blessed to go around to people's houses.

513
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
 Oh, yeah.

514
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
 Well, he must have some audiobooks you can listen to.

515
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
 Oh, yeah.

516
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
 I was looking up good bus tours.

517
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
 Yeah.

518
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
 Oh, okay.

519
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,520
 There was a tour bus for dogs in 2017 in London.

520
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
 Oh.

521
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
 But it was a bit of a...

522
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
 Well, okay, it was the Rootmaster K9.

523
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,520
 And there was a live commentary of Dog Trivia from around London.

524
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
 Okay.

525
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
 Fine.

526
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,520
 And the route was between places where you could go for walkies.

527
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,520
 But wait, so the owners were the dogs?

528
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
 Yeah, that's the thing.

529
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
 There are dogs in Moscow who get on the tube,

530
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,520
 who live kind of down on the tube and sort of jump on between stops.

531
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
 Wow.

532
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
 Like the pigeons do.

533
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
 I don't believe the pigeons.

534
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
 I've seen them.

535
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
 I've seen them.

536
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
 I've seen them.

537
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
 I've read it.

538
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
 Okay.

539
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
 I've seen them.

540
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
 Okay, guys, pipe down.

541
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
 I've done research on this.

542
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
 I didn't get to read out a few weeks ago on the podcast.

543
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
 The pigeons get the tube.

544
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
 Do they know they're doing it?

545
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
 And I literally saw the pigeon do it, though.

546
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
 No, no, we didn't, because he read a research thing.

547
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
 We didn't see it.

548
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
 A pigeon can be on the tube,

549
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,520
 but it does not have a conception of the map of my pigeon.

550
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
 Oh, okay.

551
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
 But I've seen a pigeon on the tube.

552
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
 But you know, there's also the pigeon on the tube.

553
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
 No, but listen.

554
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
 Let me talk.

555
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
 There's the tube bit that's overground.

556
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
 So then it's getting on at one stop and going two stops

557
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
 and literally walking on, waiting by the door

558
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
 and then walking on.

559
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
 That's what I saw as well.

560
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
 Yeah, so it's like, it's not doing underground tube.

561
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
 It's like, oh, if I get on at East Finchley.

562
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,520
 I'd be more impressed to see a pigeon on the underground tube.

563
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,520
 That would be dangerous and upsetting for the pigeon

564
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
 and distressing.

565
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
 It'll be fine.

566
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
 It sort of slides down the escalator.

567
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,520
 What we've seen is much more normal.

568
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,520
 An outdoor platform, pigeon gets on, rides and stops, gets on.

569
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
 For me, it's so normal.

570
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
 It's banal.

571
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,520
 It's actually come round to banal.

572
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
 I can't even accept it.

573
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,520
 I wonder what you think, Andy, now that you've read this research.

574
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,520
 Are you trusting your own research

575
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,520
 or are you believing the eyewitness reports?

576
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
 I've literally seen it.

577
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
 I just want to clear this up.

578
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
 I believe what you've both seen.

579
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
 You've both seen a pigeon hop onto a train.

580
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,520
 The train girl stop or do the pigeon hop off.

581
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
 Wait by the doors.

582
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
 Wait by the doors.

583
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,520
 No distress, no panic.

584
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
 I did the gap.

585
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
 Pressing that button when it's the open button.

586
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
 That's what makes it clear that the pigeon's stupid.

587
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
 The doors operate anyway.

588
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
 Not on the overground.

589
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
 Not on the overground.

590
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
 I didn't see over.

591
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
 I saw underground.

592
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
 Underground chain.

593
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
 What's the point is, I don't think,

594
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,520
 I think they might be hopping on looking for food or something.

595
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
 I don't think they're--

596
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,520
 But it didn't do any food.

597
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
 They're not commuting home.

598
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
 Andy, this is what I saw.

599
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
 It just waited by the door.

600
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
 It was playing Candy Crush.

601
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,520
 It literally got on, stood and faced the doors like a commuter.

602
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
 Everyone was like, oh my god, pigeon.

603
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
 Doors closed and then it went two stops.

604
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
 So it didn't have to do--

605
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
 The two is more convincing.

606
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
 Yeah, no, it did two.

607
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,520
 It did East Finchley to Finchley Central,

608
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
 like to West Finchley.

609
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
 So it went out to North London and it got out.

610
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,520
 Mine had a baby on board back then.

611
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
 If it's the several days in a row,

612
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
 within the same half an hour period,

613
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
 I will believe you've got a commuting pigeon.

614
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
 OK.

615
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
 What were we talking about?

616
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
 Bassist.

617
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
 Bassist.

618
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
 Oh, Bassist or Dogtar.

619
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
 Dogtar.

620
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
 You started this, Jase.

621
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
 You said there are dogs on the Bosco jeans.

622
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
 Sorry.

623
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,520
 Can I just ask on your Dogtar?

624
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,520
 It's basically a way for dog walkers

625
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,520
 to get from one walkies area to another one,

626
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,520
 and they gave them stuff in the meantime.

627
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
 I think so.

628
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
 I think it was around for a few days

629
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,520
 as a kind of to promote the firm.

630
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,520
 Are your Russian dogs commuting there?

631
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,520
 We're just living there.

632
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,520
 I think that's the idea, is that they do go from one place

633
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
 to another where they know they can get food

634
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
 from different places.

635
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
 But I can't really quite remember.

636
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
 Yeah, I believe that.

637
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
 You believe that.

638
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
 Oh, that's fine.

639
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,520
 James has never seen it.

640
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,520
 I was going to say, when I went to Moscow,

641
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,520
 I've been a few times, but whenever I've gone,

642
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,520
 I've tried to look on the underground for these dogs

643
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
 and I've never seen them.

644
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
 Well, Andy still believes you.

645
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,520
 I was reading about the bus drivers of history.

646
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,520
 One significant and very controversial bus driver

647
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,520
 was a guy called James Blake.

648
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
 Yeah, of course, Rosa Parks.

649
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
 He was the Rosa Parks bus driver.

650
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,520
 Here's the thing I didn't know.

651
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
 So he was called James Blake.

652
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,520
 It was 1955, this happened.

653
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,520
 The most famous incident.

654
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
 But she and Blake had beef already.

655
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,520
 Oh, I had read this somewhere because she was like a known activist.

656
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,520
 Wasn't she?

657
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
 That was the big thing.

658
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,520
 12 years earlier in 1943, she got on a bus, paid,

659
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,520
 but she'd got on the front entrance and Blake was the driver.

660
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,520
 And he said, no, you've got to get off and get on the sort of back doors of the bus

661
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
 because that was the rules, segregated buses.

662
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,520
 And she got off to, God's sake, all right.

663
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,520
 She got off to get on the other entrance and he drove off,

664
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,520
 which was a thing they would do sometimes as a kind of prank.

665
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,520
 So she avoided his buses for years.

666
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
 You know, when she saw he was a driver and then that day,

667
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
 she didn't notice that he was the driver.

668
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
 She was tired.

669
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
 She was preoccupied.

670
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
 And so that's, that's what happened.

671
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,520
 He was a bus driver for 19 more years.

672
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,520
 19 more years.

673
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
 Yeah.

674
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
 Wow.

675
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,520
 Because it was quite, she, her story was one that sort of hit the right moment at the right time.

676
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,520
 There were quite a lot of stories of, of people who were refusing to step up from their seats and go to the back.

677
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,520
 I think even Rosa Parks' story is slightly distorted.

678
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,520
 Yeah, I was going to say, she wasn't tight.

679
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,520
 She knew it was all planned and they used her because she looked quite mild-mannered

680
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,520
 and they thought that it would be like, you know, a way for it to get on the bus

681
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,520
 and look like she wasn't going to cause trouble, but they absolutely,

682
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,520
 she was a super intelligent, brilliant part of the organization.

683
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,520
 And it was very, very well, they knew like they were going to do this incident.

684
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
 The King was part of that.

685
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

686
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,520
 Genuinely, actually only know that because of a Doctor Who episode from the Jodie Whitaker period.

687
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
 So that probably needs a fact check.

688
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,520
 I think they would have got that right.

689
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
 Yeah, yeah.

690
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
 Yeah, a lot of, a lot of seminal moments have happened on buses.

691
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,520
 So George Harrison joined the Beatles on a bus.

692
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
 Did he?

693
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
 He was sitting on top, top deck of a bus.

694
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
 Not on top of Paul McCartney's head.

695
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
 He was giving him a shoulder's ride.

696
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,520
 Yeah, Paul already knew him and that's where he introduced properly to John Lennon

697
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
 and John said, can you play a song?

698
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
 That was a very difficult song to play on guitar.

699
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
 He played it, nailed it and that's when they said, you're in the band.

700
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
 So that's important.

701
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,520
 George Michael wrote Careless Whisper on the bus.

702
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
 I'm never going to dance again.

703
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,520
 Guilty feet have got no N17.

704
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
 No, zero to no.

705
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
 No, zero lyric.

706
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
 I was a tour bus guide.

707
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
 Tour bus guide?

708
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
 That sounded wrong.

709
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
 No, I was, that's the right.

710
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
 You were a tour guide who was on the bus.

711
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
 Thank you, thank you.

712
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
 I was like, tour bus guide is the right.

713
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
 Here's another tour bus.

714
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,520
 If you look over there, another tour bus is going past.

715
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
 So many tour buses.

716
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,520
 I was a tour guide on an open top bus for some time in London

717
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
 and I got in trouble a lot, yes.

718
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
 For what?

719
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
 Making stuff up?

720
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
 No, I never made stuff up.

721
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,520
 I made a joke about the Royal Family and someone wrote and complained

722
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,520
 and said I should be ashamed of myself and I disgraced my country.

723
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,520
 Wow, it was about Prince Andrew.

724
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,520
 It wasn't, at the time, that sort of thing wasn't known.

725
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,520
 It was about Prince Harry taking drugs, which was absolutely known

726
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,520
 and it was a really crap joke that every tour guide did on St James's.

727
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,520
 So the shops have Royal warrants.

728
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,520
 So that's where they have a crest in the window.

729
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,520
 That means the Royal Family shop there.

730
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
 And the whole of St James's, there's like,

731
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,520
 oh, Berry Brothers, Lob and Coases.

732
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,520
 There's all like the boot makers, the hat makers

733
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,520
 and there's also a pharmacy on St James's

734
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,520
 and you say that's where the Royal Family get their drugs

735
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,520
 although I think Prince Harry probably gets his from somewhere else.

736
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
 It's a terrible joke.

737
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
 It's fine.

738
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
 Have you got your first comedy review?

739
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
 Two stars.

740
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,520
 We got up at Bucking, I said,

741
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,520
 this is Bucking Palace and a couple marched up to me and they said,

742
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,520
 "We're getting off."

743
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
 I said, "Oh, okay."

744
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,520
 They said, "We don't want to."

745
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,520
 I said, "Oh, what's happening?"

746
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,520
 And I said, "It's you.

747
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
 We're getting off because of you."

748
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
 And I was like, "Oh, what?"

749
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,520
 I said, "What you just said about the Royal Family was so disgraceful."

750
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,520
 And then when the letter, they said I had disgraced Prince William.

751
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,520
 So they hadn't even been listening to my joke.

752
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
 You wouldn't make that joke about Prince William.

753
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
 That's the most annoying thing.

754
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,520
 It was so annoying, but I got in quite big trouble.

755
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
 Did you apologise?

756
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
 No, they're gone.

757
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
 They're long gone.

758
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
 Unrepentant.

759
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,520
 I'm glad you weren't my boss, I did.

760
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
 You know London Bus?

761
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
 Just a London Bus.

762
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
 Oh, yeah.

763
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
 Big Red Bus.

764
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
 Big Red Bus.

765
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,520
 You know how long they are in terms of how many London Buses they are?

766
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
 They're one London Bus.

767
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,520
 No, they're 1.2 times the length of a London Bus.

768
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
 Okay.

769
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
 And that's because they're new rootmasters.

770
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,520
 And if you ever look at, like, whatever anyone says, this is so stupid.

771
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,520
 But whatever anyone says, this is like 10 times the length of a London Bus.

772
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
 They're talking about the old London Bus.

773
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
 Oh, talking about the rootmasters.

774
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
 Yeah.

775
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,520
 But they've got the new one, such a 1.2 times the length.

776
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
 Brilliant.

777
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
 I genuinely interested in that.

778
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,520
 Do you know, I bit, like, I loved, I'm the age of remembering rootmasters.

779
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,520
 And they were great when you could jump on the back of the bus.

780
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,520
 Obviously, it wasn't safe, but it was brilliant.

781
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,520
 Yeah.

782
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
 You never had to worry about missing a bus.

783
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
 You just ran.

784
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
 You could still jump on.

785
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,520
 No, because they closed them all because it wasn't safe.

786
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
 Do you remember the old ones?

787
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
 Like, had no door.

788
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
 Totally open.

789
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
 Yeah.

790
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
 No, sorry.

791
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,520
 I've jumped on the back of one when the door was open.

792
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
 Wow.

793
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
 Andy, you're so lucky.

794
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,520
 You jumped on a bus and it was open.

795
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,520
 You didn't just run head first into glass.

796
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,520
 I was sneaking off one bus and onto another one.

797
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
 It was after a party.

798
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,520
 Anyway, I don't want to go into my showbiz life.

799
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,520
 You know, we're familiar with the Spice Bus.

800
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,520
 Yeah.

801
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
 Spice Girls Bus.

802
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
 From the Spice World movie.

803
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,520
 Oh, yeah.

804
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
 And you can rent it now.

805
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
 How can you?

806
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
 You can stay in it overnight.

807
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,520
 Is this a hint for your next birthday?

808
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,520
 No.

809
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
 Is it still so...

810
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
 It's on the other one.

811
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
 It's tedious.

812
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
 I haven't seen this movie.

813
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
 But is it like, I think it's like Uni and Jack.

814
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
 That's not missable.

815
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
 You have to watch Spice Bus.

816
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,520
 Meatloaf is the driver.

817
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,520
 Does it still look the same as it did in the show?

818
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,520
 Yes, it's still, the exterior looks the same.

819
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,520
 But the interior, unfortunately, obviously in the film,

820
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,520
 the interior was this huge three-story potential.

821
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,520
 It couldn't have been what it was.

822
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
 Was it like bigger on the inside kind of thing?

823
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,520
 Yeah, exactly.

824
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
 Well, they never, I don't think they made a kind of space-time definition

825
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,520
 about how big it was.

826
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,520
 Just kept showing you different rooms in it.

827
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,520
 Like a Groundhog's Nest, basically.

828
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
 Exactly.

829
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,520
 There's one more full of shit from the Spice Girls

830
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,520
 than if you attacked her.

831
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,520
 Oh, God.

832
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,520
 We spoke about the Dave Matthews band a few months ago.

833
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,520
 Oh, yeah.

834
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
 Yes, did you know the Dave Matthews band?

835
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
 I didn't know Dave Matthews band.

836
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,520
 There was this thing in 2004 where they dumped 800 pounds

837
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,520
 of raw untreated sewage into a river.

838
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,520
 There was a Chicago River while they were crossing the bridge

839
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
 on their tour bus.

840
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,520
 And they were, unfortunately, they were crossing a slatted bridge

841
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,520
 and there was an open top tour boat passing by beneath the bridge.

842
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,520
 Can I just say it was the driver rather than the band.

843
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,520
 Yeah, I was like the band were there like now.

844
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,520
 So anyway, that was a huge thing led to a lot of,

845
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,520
 I think there were apology letters.

846
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,520
 But I was reading about what happens how you release

847
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,520
 what they call the Blackwater, you know, the sewage from the thing.

848
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,520
 And you know, buses have changed a bit since then.

849
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,520
 I think they've been altered a bit.

850
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,520
 I was reading an interview with a bus driver from 2016 about how you release it.

851
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,520
 And there is a switch that says dump, which they keep.

852
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,520
 Supposedly they keep it by the driver's left elbow, which feels risky.

853
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,520
 Thanks for the indicators.

854
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
 But these days, there's like a nuclear button.

855
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
 There is a plastic cap over the switch.

856
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,520
 So you have to make a conscious decision to dump.

857
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,520
 I mean, we all need that in our lives.

858
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,520
 Make a conscious decision to drop your shit.

859
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,520
 They should put the key for it inside a person.

860
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:43,520
 This is a callback to something the other day.

861
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,520
 The idea of a nuclear button, you put the key inside a person

862
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,520
 so they had to kill the person to get to the nuclear button.

863
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,520
 And the president had to do it himself.

864
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
 Yes, an initial.

865
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,520
 But how's he going to keep that inside him without shitting it out?

866
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,520
 I'll be under his skin.

867
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,520
 Oh, okay. I thought you meant like swallow it and then go through the shit, get the key.

868
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,520
 In this case, sir, the missiles are going to be in two minutes.

869
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,520
 The president is sieving a poo.

870
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,520
 It's like, "I'll find it. I'll find it."

871
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,520
 The key's covered in sweet card.

872
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,520
 Are you sure you want to look at the plastic cover?

873
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
 Not yet, not yet.

874
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
 Oh, God, sorry.

875
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:29,520
 Okay, it is time for fact number one.

876
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,520
 Okay, I'm sorry.

877
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,520
 They say I love won't pay the rent.

878
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,520
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

879
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,520
 My fact is that for many years, the secret of the British Army's balloons

880
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,520
 was known by a single family of Alsatians.

881
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,520
 Wow.

882
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,520
 By which I mean people from Alsat.

883
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,520
 Were they all on a bus together?

884
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,520
 This is a thing where, so the ballooning took off.

885
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:08,520
 If only the people at home could have seen the way that you built up.

886
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
 I know, the face.

887
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,520
 You lifted up the plastic button and you dumped.

888
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
 You pressed dump on your joke.

889
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,520
 I thought, "I could do it. I could go for it, couldn't I?

890
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,520
 They'll all laugh and we'll just move on and it won't be made a big thing off."

891
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,520
 The British Army, they were experimenting.

892
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,520
 They were making hydrogen balloons, and this is in the 1880s.

893
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,520
 So it's 100 years or so after the Montgolfier brothers and so on.

894
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:35,520
 And hydrogen balloons are great in lots of ways, but there's a problem.

895
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,520
 Hydrogen molecules are so tiny that they escape from almost any bag that you keep them in.

896
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,520
 I'll put them in the same bag.

897
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,520
 So they were looking for a way to improve the balloons.

898
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,520
 And there was this family, the Weinling family.

899
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,520
 They were a family of orthodox Jews that came from Alsace in France.

900
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,520
 And they had their own effectively secret proprietary method of making these balloons.

901
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,520
 And they'd made some for a scientific toy shop in the east end of London, which is called Mr. Herons.

902
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:11,520
 And the commander of the first royal balloon factory was called Major Templar.

903
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,520
 He hired the Weinling family, he bought their secret effectively.

904
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,520
 And then for a few decades, Britain had this big advantage in balloon technology,

905
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,520
 because the Weinlings were on board and they were kind of supervising the first balloon factory.

906
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,520
 They had to be persuaded to tell other people how to make the balloons,

907
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,520
 because they originally, it seems like they wanted to make the balloons themselves.

908
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,520
 "We'll do it all, we'll do it all, we just don't want to tell anyone."

909
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
 I can understand that.

910
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,520
 It's pretty amazing as well that, so it was a guy called Henry Coxwell,

911
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,520
 who was walking through this scientific toy shop and saw this thing.

912
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,520
 Can you imagine like during the war effort, you're looking for ways and suddenly here's just a toy for kids,

913
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,520
 that is going to give you the great advantage of the war.

914
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,520
 And what did the toy do? It was like, it was like a little hot air balloon.

915
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,520
 It was a balloon, yeah, yeah.

916
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,520
 And it worked basically, wow.

917
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,520
 And the method that they used was a thing called gold beater skin.

918
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,520
 So it's used, it's made from the lower intestine of a cow.

919
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,520
 And what they would do is they would stretch out the lower intestine.

920
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,520
 And because as you were saying Andy, the nothing could escape, molecules can escape is what they found.

921
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,520
 What's amazing is that when they were, when they make the balloon itself,

922
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
 you wouldn't sew it together.

923
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,520
 So sewing might be a problem because there's micro holes that if you miss whatever something can escape.

924
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,520
 But with this intestine skin, all you had to do was make it a bit wet, a bit damp,

925
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,520
 and then it would just stick.

926
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,520
 And that would be strong enough to make it so cool.

927
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,520
 It's overlapping and it just...

928
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,520
 Guys, how did the Wylings find this out?

929
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:41,520
 Like, I'm sorry, how did this one family be like, oh, you know that cow intestine we've got hanging around?

930
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,520
 Let's stretch it out, dry it and put like, what was going on in that family?

931
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
 It's Mikey's birthday, have we got balloons?

932
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,520
 Sorry, that's what made me laugh so much because it's amazing.

933
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
 It's like really amazing what they did and discovered.

934
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,520
 But what was going on in Alsace?

935
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,520
 Well, they were already using this stuff for gold-beating, which is why it's called gold-beater skin, right?

936
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
 But why are they using it in gold-beating?

937
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,520
 So you would put your gold in between two pieces of intestine or paper or whatever,

938
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,520
 and then you would whack it, whack it, whack it to make it really, really, really, really thin.

939
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,520
 And so then you would have gold leaf instead of a gold bar.

940
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,520
 Oh, and that's why it still comes in as two bits of paper, the gold leaf.

941
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,520
 It does, yeah.

942
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
 Do you buy gold leaf?

943
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:26,520
 You can buy it, like for decorating, people use it for like, if you want to do like a gold effect on tables or on food or...

944
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,520
 I've had biscuits covered in silver.

945
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
 That's the blue.

946
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,520
 Silver what?

947
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,520
 They're Indian.

948
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
 Oh, it's silver leaf, yeah, yeah, yeah.

949
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520
 They're popular, it's not...

950
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
 Sorry, I thought it was like an emperor there.

951
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,520
 He's doing well with his silver biscuits and two knockers.

952
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,520
 But the amazing thing is about this gold-beating rate,

953
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,520
 so you're making gold leaf out of a piece of gold,

954
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,520
 and you could get a sheet of gold that was two millimeters thick,

955
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,520
 and then knock it down, make it thinner, thinner, thinner,

956
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,520
 so there was 100 nanometers, right?

957
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,520
 And it's hard to say what that is,

958
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:08,520
 but it's basically, it's like if I was squashed into a flat sheet,

959
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,520
 which is the thickness of a human hair.

960
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,520
 We're not going to do that, James.

961
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
 No, it's going to do that to you, are they?

962
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,520
 You know, they get hit by a bus.

963
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,520
 But yeah, that's how much, they reduce the thickness of a sheet of gold by 99.996%,

964
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,520
 and they do it using this paper, this ox, you know, this gold beater's paper.

965
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,520
 But that's the second process, to get it down to two millimeters,

966
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,520
 you need to put it through a different two pieces of paper,

967
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,520
 and that's called Montgolfier paper,

968
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,520
 and that was the same paper as the Montgolfiers used to make their balloons.

969
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,520
 Isn't that amazing?

970
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,520
 So the first section of gold beating was Montgolfier paper,

971
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,520
 and the second stuff was this gold beater's paper,

972
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,520
 because the Montgolfiers, they came from a family of paper makers,

973
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,520
 and that's how they got into hot air ballooning,

974
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,520
 because they had all of this amazing paper to use,

975
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,520
 and they turned them into balloons.

976
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
 So cool.

977
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
 It's so weird how one invention leads to another.

978
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,520
 Yeah.

979
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,520
 And it was, the reason I knew about this is because we talked a while ago

980
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,520
 about jobs in the UK that don't exist anymore,

981
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,520
 and the last gold beater I think went out in the UK,

982
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,520
 maybe in the last 10 to 20 years.

983
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,520
 It feels like a very labor intensive job.

984
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
 It is.

985
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,520
 Gold beating.

986
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
 Yeah, it is.

987
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,520
 Also, for the size of the balloons that they were making during the war,

988
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,520
 you needed a lot, so one kind of classic zeppelin

989
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,520
 would require 250,000 intestines

990
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,520
 in order to make the size balloon that they needed in order to do it.

991
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,520
 Again, how did they first get the idea?

992
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,520
 And it was mostly women, right?

993
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
 Yeah.

994
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,520
 It was women doing this work.

995
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,520
 Yeah.

996
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,520
 The Vinling family was...

997
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,520
 It couldn't have been just them, right?

998
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,520
 They must have taught it to...

999
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,520
 But it was women that were doing all the work, I think.

1000
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,520
 Yeah.

1001
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
 Women did the skin stretching,

1002
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
 the skin treating,

1003
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,520
 and that factory was staffed by women.

1004
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,520
 I think it was one Fred Vinling.

1005
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
 There were a couple of sons,

1006
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
 but there was Mrs. Vinling and two daughters

1007
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,520
 who were the chief balloon makers for the army.

1008
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,520
 Wow.

1009
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,520
 And it was such a secret as well

1010
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,520
 that when it eventually got seen that it was being used by the countries,

1011
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
 that was seen as treason.

1012
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
 And this guy, Major Templar, who was the one,

1013
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
 he actually got charged with betraying military secrets

1014
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
 because they thought this was so secret and no one could have known it.

1015
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,520
 No.

1016
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,520
 He was acquitted because I think they worked out that he didn't do it,

1017
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,520
 but that's how important this was to the war effort.

1018
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,520
 But it kind of didn't matter for a few countries

1019
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,520
 because what you needed was cow and testin.

1020
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,520
 So they were being farmed in America

1021
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,520
 and they were being imported to here.

1022
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
 But like Germany couldn't get them because they stopped.

1023
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
 They have cows in Germany.

1024
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,520
 I don't think they had enough at the time.

1025
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,520
 I think we've mentioned once before that Germany had to choose

1026
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,520
 in the war between airships and sausages.

1027
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
 It's a hard choice to make.

1028
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,520
 You're in total war.

1029
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
 Your society needs to survive.

1030
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,520
 It is the worst choice to make.

1031
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
 Come on.

1032
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,520
 In fact, they still lose balloons in war right now, don't they?

1033
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,520
 For instance, while we saw in the news with the so-called spy balloons,

1034
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,520
 they're coming back in.

1035
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520
 It's a new fashion trend.

1036
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,520
 In the Ukraine war, I think both sides used balloons.

1037
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,520
 They kind of put them up there so that the other side

1038
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,520
 kind of uses a permunition trying to shoot them.

1039
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,520
 They're just distractions really, but they are still used.

1040
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,520
 There are barrage balloons in the Second World War.

1041
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,520
 You saw images of London at war.

1042
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,520
 There are all these balloons floating over

1043
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,520
 and it's to make bombers have to fly higher to fly over them.

1044
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,520
 They have steel cables hanging down from them

1045
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,520
 so you can't fly around under them.

1046
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,520
 So they're a good air defence.

1047
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,520
 Those were largely staffed by women.

1048
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,520
 There was the Women's Auxiliary Air Force.

1049
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
 They were on the ground.

1050
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,520
 They would operate the winches basically

1051
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,520
 because there's no one actually up there in a barrage balloon

1052
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,520
 or hanging beneath it.

1053
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,520
 Balloon command was set up in 1938.

1054
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,520
 Yes, please.

1055
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,520
 Even at D-Day.

1056
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
 Good morning, balloon command.

1057
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
 What colour?

1058
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,520
 Rebel?

1059
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,520
 Yes, plenty of those.

1060
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
 How old is he? Seven?

1061
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,520
 Oh, we'll see what we can do.

1062
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,520
 D-Day had the barrage balloon battalion

1063
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,520
 who were specifically bringing to the Normandy beaches

1064
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,520
 the balloons.

1065
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,520
 Wow.

1066
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,520
 They were pre-inflated in the UK

1067
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,520
 and then sailed over to defend the men of beaches.

1068
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,520
 I think that's good because if you're in opposing territory

1069
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,520
 you don't want to be like...

1070
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,520
 Stretch it out a bit.

1071
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,520
 You're absolutely right.

1072
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,520
 They didn't show that at the beginning of a saving private ride, did they?

1073
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,520
 I'm asthmatic, sir. I can't do this.

1074
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,520
 Speaking of women in war,

1075
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,520
 the UK's first official police woman

1076
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,520
 was Mrs Edith Smith of Grantham.

1077
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,520
 She became a sworn officer in 1915

1078
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,520
 and the Home Office weren't very happy about it

1079
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,520
 because they said that women were not proper persons.

1080
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,520
 That's what they said.

1081
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,520
 It's something we have to live with.

1082
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,520
 I know, but this is amazing.

1083
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,520
 Quite a lot of the stuff they made her do

1084
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,520
 was spy on women on behalf of their husbands

1085
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,520
 who were away at war.

1086
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,520
 Oh, wow.

1087
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
 Wow, the power of the patriarchy.

1088
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,520
 You can work for us if you take down your own people.

1089
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,520
 I was wondering if you were having affairs.

1090
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1091
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
 Have we ever mentioned the Hello Ladies?

1092
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,520
 Hello.

1093
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,520
 Hello Ladies.

1094
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,520
 Hello Ladies.

1095
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,520
 Hello Ladies were a group of women.

1096
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,520
 They were in the battlefields of France.

1097
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,520
 They were basically the operators who connect phone calls.

1098
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,520
 The telephone operating ladies, yeah.

1099
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,520
 We were doing it on the front lines.

1100
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,520
 Oh, wow.

1101
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,520
 And so while being bombed,

1102
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,520
 just connecting these phone lines

1103
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,520
 to make sure that these crucial calls could be made back.

1104
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,520
 And at the height of it,

1105
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,520
 the Hello Girls were connecting 150,000 calls a day.

1106
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,520
 And there was 223 in total that were doing that.

1107
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,520
 That's doing tons.

1108
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,520
 Yeah, yeah.

1109
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,520
 It's crazy.

1110
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,520
 But a lot of those were calls being made

1111
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,520
 to a policewoman in Grantham.

1112
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
 Okay, what's she doing now?

1113
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,520
 Well, did they look like they were friends

1114
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,520
 or did they look like it was more serious?

1115
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,520
 Yeah, and they annoyingly, after the war,

1116
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,520
 they weren't considered for veteran status and benefits

1117
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,520
 because they weren't seen as part of the military.

1118
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,520
 And it took until 1977.

1119
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,520
 Oh, my God.

1120
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,520
 The petitioning presidents constantly to get them

1121
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,520
 any kind of compensation.

1122
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,520
 But they finally did it.

1123
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,520
 But they were essential to the war of the Hello Girls.

1124
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,520
 Yeah, you were there.

1125
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,520
 You know, yeah, you were at the front line.

1126
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,520
 You weren't there, though.

1127
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,520
 You were exactly, oh, my God, that's awful.

1128
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,520
 I've just got one more fact about balloons.

1129
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,520
 Yeah, go on.

1130
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,520
 There has only ever been one balloon hit-and-run accident

1131
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,520
 in the UK.

1132
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,520
 Okay, amazing.

1133
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,520
 2004.

1134
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,520
 Yes.

1135
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,520
 Are we talking hot air balloons?

1136
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,520
 Yeah.

1137
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,520
 Wow.

1138
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,520
 Okam, Cumbria.

1139
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,520
 Retired couple sitting in their cottage having a nice time.

1140
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,520
 Suddenly, bang, hot air balloon.

1141
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,520
 Someone stole the chimney.

1142
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,520
 Smashes into their chimney and their roof and then flies off.

1143
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,520
 Oh, my God.

1144
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,520
 I know.

1145
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,520
 It was blue, yellow and red.

1146
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,520
 I'm going to say, in defence of whoever this was, if you're flying over,

1147
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,520
 I used to live in there, if you're flying over and you're out of control enough

1148
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,520
 that you hit a chimney, you're probably out of control enough that you can't stop.

1149
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,520
 To leave you details, yeah.

1150
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,520
 It's quite dangerous because around there they have quite a lot of ministry

1151
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,520
 of difference flights they practice around there.

1152
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,520
 Do they?

1153
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,520
 Yeah.

1154
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,520
 Well, it's the only known, known balloon hit-and-run ever.

1155
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,520
 They never found.

1156
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,520
 They still never...

1157
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,520
 I didn't find a follow-up to the story.

1158
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,520
 Maybe they did.

1159
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,520
 So, that's interesting because only a couple of days ago,

1160
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,520
 I watched a video on Instagram of a hot air balloon coming in close to it.

1161
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:22,520
 There's a whole group of people picnicking on the side of, in this grassy bit of a hill.

1162
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,520
 And they all turn around and look at it.

1163
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,520
 Everyone gets up and they're filming it.

1164
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
 And it just keeps descending and keeps descending.

1165
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,520
 And it suddenly hits the ground and mows through all of them.

1166
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,520
 They're all diving out the way.

1167
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,520
 Oh, my God.

1168
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,520
 All their chairs go through.

1169
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,520
 No one's hit.

1170
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,520
 Everyone's okay.

1171
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,520
 And it takes off again and disappears off into the distance.

1172
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,520
 And I don't know if they got their details later.

1173
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,520
 So that might not count as a hit-and-run.

1174
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,520
 But could you claim a picnic over a chimney?

1175
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,520
 My picnic was ruined.

1176
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,520
 If they put everything back together,

1177
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,520
 they noticed there was one sausage roll missing.

1178
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,520
 Just grab it on the way out.

1179
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,520
 Just left a sausage skin.

1180
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,520
 Make your own balloon.

1181
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:05,520
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

1182
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,520
 And that is my fact.

1183
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,520
 My fact this week is that Orson Welles's nose

1184
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,520
 rarely made appearances in his movies.

1185
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,520
 Wow.

1186
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,520
 Can you give me some of his movies?

1187
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,520
 Yeah.

1188
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,520
 Citizen Kane is perhaps...

1189
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,520
 I've seen the Citizen Kane.

1190
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,520
 But I don't remember any noseless men in that.

1191
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,520
 Well, he was never noseless.

1192
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,520
 Oh.

1193
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,520
 He never, yeah.

1194
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,520
 He didn't...

1195
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,520
 I mean, people would talk about Citizen Kane

1196
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,520
 in a different way if there was no nose on his face.

1197
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
 Like he spends his whole time lusting over.

1198
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,520
 What was it?

1199
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,520
 Rosebud.

1200
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,520
 He'd been memorialising Rosebud.

1201
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,520
 He'd be memorialising his nose.

1202
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,520
 Closebud, will I?

1203
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,520
 No!

1204
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,520
 Thank you.

1205
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,520
 I nearly started watching Citizen Kane last night.

1206
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,520
 Have you not seen it?

1207
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,520
 No, I got quite tired.

1208
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,520
 It's incredible.

1209
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,520
 It's incredible.

1210
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,520
 Why, the only one who hasn't?

1211
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,520
 Yeah.

1212
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,520
 Oh, the worm turns and builds his little nest down.

1213
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,520
 Sorry, I'll keep going with that.

1214
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,520
 He builds his little nest down and then realises

1215
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,520
 this is full of shit from a ground on.

1216
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,520
 Carries on.

1217
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,520
 Actually absorbs it because that's his deal.

1218
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,520
 Have you caught what Citizen Kane is?

1219
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,520
 It's classic.

1220
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,520
 I've seen a couple of his.

1221
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,520
 What have you seen?

1222
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,520
 The Magnificent Ambersons.

1223
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,520
 Oh, I haven't seen that.

1224
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,520
 Very much a B-side these days.

1225
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,520
 Oh, okay.

1226
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1227
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,520
 It is great.

1228
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,520
 The third man, which he did direct, he just is in.

1229
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,520
 Yeah.

1230
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,520
 Oh, sorry, but he was such a direct, yeah.

1231
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,520
 Yeah, yeah, that's okay.

1232
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,520
 So, for the people that don't know, Orson Welles,

1233
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,520
 Citizen Kane is often regarded as one of the

1234
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,520
 greatest movies ever made.

1235
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,520
 I actually was surprised I went onto IMDb.

1236
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,520
 I expected to see it behind Shawshank Redemption.

1237
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,520
 It was actually 95 on the top 100 list.

1238
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,520
 But I think, you know, there's three Avengers movies

1239
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,520
 in that top 100 ahead of it.

1240
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,520
 So, I think that's been answered.

1241
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,520
 Yeah, you went onto IMDb.

1242
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,520
 I think you'd check like Guardians Top Films.

1243
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,520
 Yeah, exactly.

1244
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
 It was the Paddington two of its day.

1245
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,520
 Yeah.

1246
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,520
 It really was.

1247
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,520
 It absolutely was.

1248
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,520
 Orson Welles was, as Andy says, he was a director.

1249
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,520
 He was a writer.

1250
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,520
 He was an actor.

1251
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,520
 He went from radio to stage to film, doing iconic

1252
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,520
 things in every single place.

1253
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:57,520
 He supposedly created a national terror when he did

1254
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,520
 War of the Worlds on radio.

1255
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,520
 That's been mythologized to be a lot worse than it

1256
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,520
 actually was.

1257
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,520
 People, you know, claiming they thought aliens were

1258
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,520
 really invading, were really kind of newspapers

1259
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,520
 just bumping that up.

1260
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,520
 But one thing about him is that for someone who was

1261
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,520
 so confident and he was known to be so balshy and

1262
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,520
 people would talk about his rage and his passion,

1263
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,520
 one thing he was absolutely insecure about was

1264
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,520
 the size of his nose, which he thought hadn't

1265
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,520
 really grown since childhood.

1266
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,520
 And so every single movie that he did, except

1267
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,520
 basically for one movie, as far as I can tell,

1268
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,520
 which was The Third Man, he always had prosthetics

1269
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,520
 on his nose and sometimes applying it himself,

1270
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
 there's an account by a guy called Lewis Gilbert

1271
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,520
 who was a director and he did a movie with him

1272
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,520
 in 1959 called Fairy to Hong Kong.

1273
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,520
 And he said that basically he would do his own nose

1274
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,520
 and the problem was that his nose would be quite

1275
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,520
 different shot to shot.

1276
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,520
 Yeah, they said it was like wonky or green or...

1277
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,520
 Yeah, sometimes it was tilting upwards, sometimes

1278
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,520
 it was tilting downwards.

1279
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,520
 Occasionally it just went sideways.

1280
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,520
 It was not a consistent nose for the entire movie.

1281
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,520
 Yeah, I read one quote saying he said his nose had

1282
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,520
 not grown one millimeter since infancy,

1283
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,520
 which I don't believe it.

1284
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,520
 Exactly.

1285
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,520
 There's no way he had an actual baby's nose.

1286
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,520
 I felt bad though, because when you do look at

1287
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,520
 it, I was like, what? No, he doesn't.

1288
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,520
 And then I saw a picture of him without it and I was like,

1289
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,520
 I guess it is small.

1290
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,520
 I think it doesn't fit his personality,

1291
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,520
 because he was known for being this like huge

1292
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,520
 raconteur, character like absolute,

1293
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,520
 almost I guess Brian Blessed style like fill the room.

1294
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,520
 It doesn't, you expect him to have a much bigger

1295
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,520
 features and the rest of his features are quite big.

1296
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,520
 Not there's anything wrong with having a small nose.

1297
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,520
 He allegedly, he kept every fake nose.

1298
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,520
 And he had a glass case for each one.

1299
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
 And he also gave them all names.

1300
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,520
 That's quite common in a prosthetic and wig

1301
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,520
 world on TV.

1302
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,520
 They sometimes give them names.

1303
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,520
 Really?

1304
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,520
 Yeah, I don't know why.

1305
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,520
 I guess because often you have to look after a wig.

1306
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,520
 Like wash it and preen it and stuff.

1307
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,520
 So you would give it.

1308
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,520
 It's not uncommon to give it a name.

1309
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,520
 Kerry, you've done a lot of sketch comedy on TV.

1310
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,520
 Or sort of shows where you were a comedy character

1311
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,520
 playing a celebrity, like murder and success.

1312
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,520
 Oh yeah.

1313
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,520
 Have you ever worn a prosthetic nose?

1314
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,520
 Yeah, I have.

1315
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,520
 I'm trying to think now.

1316
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,520
 I had to wear loads for murder successful,

1317
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,520
 but I can't remember which one.

1318
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:18,520
 I think for Cheryl Cole, I had to wear a prosthetic nose.

1319
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,520
 I think we called it Cheryl to be fair.

1320
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,520
 He didn't call them the actual names.

1321
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,520
 He looked very weird.

1322
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,520
 He was in a film called Touch of Evil.

1323
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,520
 Oh yes.

1324
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,520
 One of his classics.

1325
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,520
 One of his classics.

1326
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,520
 He knows from that it's called Sandra.

1327
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,520
 Oh, they always women's names.

1328
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,520
 One of the King Lear one was called Sloan Jr.

1329
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,520
 So I don't know if there's a character called

1330
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,520
 Sandra in Touch of Evil, but there's no character

1331
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,520
 called Sloan Jr. in King Lear.

1332
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,520
 No, it's Gona Roll's brother.

1333
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,520
 And actually when he was making that film,

1334
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,520
 I think they lost his nose halfway through production

1335
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,520
 and it had been posted and it hadn't come through.

1336
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,520
 And they basically halted production on this big Hollywood film

1337
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,520
 while they searched every post office in Hong Kong for...

1338
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,520
 To find his nose.

1339
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,520
 And also was his father.

1340
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,520
 It was called Dickhead.

1341
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,520
 His name was Richard Hedwells.

1342
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,520
 I want to say that.

1343
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,520
 Wow.

1344
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,520
 Yeah.

1345
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,520
 Dick Hedwells.

1346
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,520
 And he's pretty cool.

1347
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,520
 Also was his father.

1348
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,520
 He was a kind of inventor and an engineer.

1349
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,520
 He invented a glider.

1350
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,520
 Get this.

1351
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,520
 Which was attached to a steam engine on the ground.

1352
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,520
 Okay.

1353
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,520
 So it's a plane whose engine is on the ground.

1354
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,520
 The plane flies up there and then...

1355
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,520
 You know what it feels like?

1356
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,520
 What?

1357
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,520
 You would have angular momentum on it.

1358
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,520
 If you just try to go forward,

1359
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,520
 you'd end up going in a circle like those fairground rides.

1360
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,520
 Yeah, yeah.

1361
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,520
 Maybe.

1362
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,520
 But it did not work.

1363
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,520
 Well, maybe it worked, but it didn't...

1364
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,520
 Didn't catch up.

1365
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,520
 It didn't take off.

1366
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,520
 Dan, you mentioned the War of the Whales thing.

1367
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,520
 Yeah.

1368
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,520
 He came a bit depressed afterwards because he said that

1369
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,520
 he had two lots of friends.

1370
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,520
 One lot of friends had heard the recording and one lot hadn't.

1371
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,520
 And anyone who'd heard it would want to tell him everything

1372
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,520
 what they thought about it.

1373
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,520
 And anyone who hadn't heard it would tell him tediously

1374
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,520
 why they hadn't been near a wireless on the day.

1375
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,520
 So that everyone he spoke to all wanted to speak to him about that.

1376
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,520
 Is that like how you guys feel?

1377
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,520
 Like people just come up to you with facts or they go,

1378
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,520
 "I've never definitely not only into podcasts."

1379
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,520
 A lot more of the latter than the former, I have to say.

1380
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,520
 I read an interview with him from 1939 and he said

1381
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,520
 that no one has said anything original about that broadcast

1382
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,520
 for at least nine months.

1383
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,520
 Wow.

1384
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,520
 There's a weird coincidence which is that H.G. Wells was in America

1385
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,520
 and he was driving around and he got lost.

1386
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,520
 And so he pulls over and he goes, "Excuse me,

1387
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,520
 so can you help me to find where I'm going?"

1388
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,520
 And it's Orson Wells.

1389
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,520
 And they established that each other each other.

1390
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,520
 And this was not long after Orson Wells had done

1391
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,520
 the War of the Worlds.

1392
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,520
 But of course he wasn't a big face back then, Orson Wells.

1393
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,520
 He was a radio guy.

1394
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,520
 He wasn't a big nose, that's for sure.

1395
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,520
 You know, he couldn't have gone like,

1396
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,520
 "Oh, I'm going to pretend I don't know who Orson Wells is."

1397
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,520
 I wonder if H.G. Wells was recognizable.

1398
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,520
 Quite possibly from the back of books.

1399
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,520
 Were people just less recognizable back in the day?

1400
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,520
 Yeah, I guess so.

1401
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,520
 You didn't have more, you didn't have

1402
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,520
 author jacket photos in the same way that you do these days.

1403
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,520
 And as we know,

1404
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,520
 author jacket photos are not representative of what someone

1405
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,520
 looks like in real life.

1406
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,520
 Excuse me?

1407
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,520
 Holding up my book.

1408
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,520
 Okay, yours is, but most people are not.

1409
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,520
 Thank you.

1410
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,520
 I also read some newspaper articles from the day

1411
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,520
 after the recording went out.

1412
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,520
 To see, you know, did it happen?

1413
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,520
 Or, you know, was this kind of craziness?

1414
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,520
 Did it exist?

1415
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,520
 And the Journal Times, I read,

1416
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,520
 they collected articles from all over America

1417
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,520
 about what had happened.

1418
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,520
 And they said that Senator Clyde Herring of Iowa

1419
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,520
 had called for more regulation of the press

1420
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,520
 as a result of everyone thinking that the Martians

1421
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,520
 had attacked, which is pretty typical.

1422
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,520
 Apparently in New York,

1423
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,520
 one person had called the police and said,

1424
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,520
 "I want a gas mask. I'm a taxpayer."

1425
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,520
 And the police had said that that had definitely happened.

1426
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,520
 And there was a town of concrete,

1427
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,520
 which is in Washington state.

1428
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,520
 And apparently there was a power cut just at the moment

1429
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,520
 the Martians put their death rays into action.

1430
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,520
 And this was reported the day after it went out.

1431
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,520
 So I think it did happen.

1432
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,520
 But the thing was like,

1433
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,520
 they did advertise that it was fiction.

1434
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,520
 -They said right at the top. -Yeah.

1435
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,520
 Awesome Wells comes on at the start and says,

1436
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,520
 "This is fictional."

1437
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,520
 And then they had four times in the middle,

1438
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,520
 they said, "Just to remind you all, this is fictional."

1439
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,520
 And then at the end, he comes on and says,

1440
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,520
 "By the way, that was a play you just listened to."

1441
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,520
 There was a good Radio 4 documentary

1442
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,520
 about what happened and how to...

1443
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,520
 I mean, there were people who obviously did lose their mind.

1444
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,520
 -But it's a tempting myth. -Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1445
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,520
 Like the five stages.

1446
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,520
 Oh, guys.

1447
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,520
 Like it's nice to believe that that would be true.

1448
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,520
 Yeah, it's just kind of nice to believe

1449
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,520
 that people back in the day were so stupid

1450
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,520
 they didn't understand radio.

1451
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,520
 "Oh, we've come a long way, we understand radio now."

1452
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,520
 Wells...

1453
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,520
 So, Dan, you mentioned his most famous film appearance, maybe.

1454
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,520
 And certainly maybe the one he's most famous for these days

1455
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,520
 is in The Third Man, where he...

1456
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,520
 It's in Vienna, it's after the Second World War,

1457
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,520
 and it's an amazing...

1458
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,520
 That is unmissable.

1459
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,520
 And there's a big scene, there's a scene in the sewers of Vienna

1460
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,520
 where they're chasing, he's playing this mysterious

1461
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:08,520
 sort of black market dealer and, you know, crook.

1462
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,520
 And he's very, very dodgy.

1463
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,520
 But they did the filming in the sewers of Vienna,

1464
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,520
 and they all went down there.

1465
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,520
 They were actually very clean in lots of places,

1466
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,520
 and the director had his coffee brought down to him

1467
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,520
 on a silver tray by a waiter from one of the old Viennese cafes.

1468
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,520
 You know, the only person who refused to go down into the sewers...

1469
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,520
 -Awesome Wells. -Awesome Wells.

1470
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,520
 And they had to build a fake sewer in Sheperton.

1471
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,520
 Wow.

1472
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,520
 Is that the famous shot of him, though, in that really, like,

1473
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,520
 the really white circle, and it's him in it?

1474
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,520
 It's either a body double, or it's Sheperton,

1475
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,520
 and everyone else had filmed their bits in Vienna.

1476
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,520
 Yeah, I know, but...

1477
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,520
 He wouldn't have been able to smell it anyway with his...

1478
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,520
 Yeah, he certainly knows.

1479
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,520
 I mean, he was at, like, I can't remember what film it was,

1480
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,520
 but it was filmed in the Deep South, and that actress was quoted as saying,

1481
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,520
 like, it was so hot and sweaty that his nose was, like, falling off.

1482
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,520
 My nose is running.

1483
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,520
 But, like, he was...

1484
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,520
 If he was a woman, he'd be called a diva.

1485
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,520
 Like, the things he would refuse to do.

1486
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,520
 -He was a divo. -He was a divo, yeah.

1487
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,520
 And the guy... I think it's the guy who plays Yago, or Casio,

1488
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,520
 wrote a whole book about the experience of filming a fellow

1489
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,520
 of, like, how insane and awful it was.

1490
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,520
 Like, that was his... kind of made his money on this.

1491
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,520
 Yeah, called Casio.

1492
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,520
 Yeah. So, one that loves Desmondo and starts off all the trouble.

1493
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,520
 He's the one who has that great line, "Beep." Yeah?

1494
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,520
 Yes, Andrew. Yes, fellow English literature scholar, yes.

1495
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,520
 Oh, apparently when he was directing Othello...

1496
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,520
 -Was that a film? -Othello's a film, yeah, yeah.

1497
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,520
 Yeah, it's a great film. It's really interesting.

1498
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,520
 I think he might have also staged a stage version of Othello,

1499
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,520
 because apparently when he was directing that,

1500
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,520
 he would push the actors around the stage with a 20-foot pole,

1501
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,520
 shouting, "To hell with the method! This is the Wells Way! Act, you sons of bitches!"

1502
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,520
 Amazing. Do you know where Orson Wells is buried?

1503
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,520
 -No. -No.

1504
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,520
 He's buried...

1505
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,520
 -Yeah, could we guess? -Yeah, have a guess.

1506
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,520
 -Oh. -Oh.

1507
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,520
 This is the most famous cemetery I could think of.

1508
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,520
 -That's in Paris. -Okay, let me rephrase...

1509
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,520
 No, no, no, no, no. You'll like this.

1510
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,520
 You'll like this. I'm going to rephrase the question,

1511
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,520
 because this is actually the wrong angle.

1512
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,520
 Remember a few weeks ago, when we had Sarah Pasco on,

1513
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,520
 we talked about the guy who invented Pringles being buried in a Pringles...

1514
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,520
 -Tube. -Tube.

1515
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,520
 Okay. So, where is Orson Wells buried?

1516
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,520
 -In a film canister. -In a film canister.

1517
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,520
 -In the Hollywood Hills. -Oh, that's very good.

1518
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,520
 He's in the Hollywood sign. They poured him in.

1519
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,520
 -Into the O. -Into the O.

1520
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,520
 Oh, yeah, yeah, all the three, guys.

1521
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,520
 -In a well. -Orson Wells is in a well.

1522
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,520
 -Is it? -He's in a well.

1523
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,520
 James got it. James got it.

1524
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,520
 -No way. -He's buried.

1525
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,520
 This is years after his death.

1526
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,520
 His daughter brought the ashes of him to Malaga in Spain,

1527
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,520
 to a place called Ronda, where he's now on the property

1528
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,520
 of a retired bullfighter who he really liked.

1529
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,520
 -I've been to Ronda quite recently. -Have you?

1530
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,520
 Yeah. That's the end of the anecdote.

1531
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,520
 Okay. Orson Wells is in a well.

1532
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,520
 -Wow. -In Malaga.

1533
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,520
 Yeah. Lovely city, Malaga.

1534
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,520
 Is that the end of the anecdote?

1535
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,520
 It's surprising, because you think, like,

1536
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,520
 you associated with Package Holiday especially,

1537
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,520
 since he's really nice.

1538
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:18,520
 It's incredible. The cathedral is called La Manquita, I think,

1539
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,520
 which means the woman with one arm.

1540
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,520
 And it's because it's got two towers, the cathedral,

1541
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,520
 but only one of them was completed.

1542
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,520
 -Wow. -So one of them is shorter than the other.

1543
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,520
 -Simon Callow, the actor. -Yes.

1544
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,520
 He is maybe one of the biggest wells experts on the planet,

1545
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,520
 because he's currently writing a biography of Orson Wells.

1546
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,520
 He started working on it in 1989,

1547
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,520
 when Orson Wells had been dead a few years.

1548
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,520
 He thought, "I'll do two volumes, take about three years.

1549
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,520
 1992, be done." Great.

1550
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,520
 Book one was published in 1995.

1551
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,520
 Okay, took a bit longer. Fine.

1552
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,520
 Book one, fine. Book two.

1553
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,520
 Volume two was in 2006.

1554
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,520
 Volume three came out in 2015,

1555
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,520
 and he's now working on volume four.

1556
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,520
 -Wow. -It's such a huge project.

1557
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,520
 He's saying he's done other stuff in between.

1558
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,520
 [laughter]

1559
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,520
 Four weddings and a few roles in there at some point.

1560
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,520
 -He's a busy man. -Pop idol.

1561
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,520
 -Is that him? -No, no, no, no.

1562
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,520
 Who among us doesn't make that mistake?

1563
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,520
 I always make that mistake.

1564
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,520
 When it goes to him at the Judges' Chair,

1565
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,520
 he's surrounded by books on wells,

1566
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,520
 and he's conducting interviews.

1567
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,520
 [music playing]

1568
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:24,520
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

1569
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,520
 Thank you so much for listening.

1570
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,520
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,520

1573
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,520
 I'm on @Shrieberland, Andy...

1574
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,520
 @AndrewHunterM, James...

1575
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,520
 @JamesHurkin.

1576
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,520
 ...and @Cariad.

1577
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,520
 @LadyCariad, 'cause I did it a long time ago.

1578
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,520
 Because of your dayhood.

1579
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,520
 Or @CariadLoyd on Instagram.

1580
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,520
 That's all I am.

1581
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,520
 Right, and you can also get us on @NoSuchThing.

1582
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,520
 Or go to our website, NoSuchThingasafish.com

1583

 and check out all of our previous episodes.

1584
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,520
 But most important of all,

1585
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,520
 get yourself to an online bookshop

1586
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,520
 or a real bookshop to pick up You Are Not Alone.

1587
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,520
 Cariad's book all about grief,

1588
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,520
 and it's tied in with her podcast, Griefcast.

1589
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,520
 So give that a listen as well.

1590
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,520
 I'm sure you have already, but get back to it this week.

1591
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,520
 Has anyone died? Get back in there, guys.

1592
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,520
 But that's it for us for now.

1593
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,520
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

1594
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,520
 We'll see you then. Goodbye.

1595
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,100
 (upbeat music)

1596
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,680
 (upbeat music)

1597
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,260
 (upbeat music)

1598
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:25,840
 (upbeat music)
