00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's episode of Fish, we wanted to"
00:00:04,00:00:09,let you know that our special guest this week is none other than Cariad Lloyd. Cariad has
00:00:09,00:00:13,"been on the show before, of course, you may remember her very funny previous appearances."
00:00:13,00:00:17,This time she's back and she's better than ever. And the good news for those of you who
00:00:17,00:00:22,are Cariad fans is that she has just written a new book. Cariad is the host of the Grief
00:00:22,00:00:26,"cast and the book that she's written is all about grief. It's about her grief, about"
00:00:26,00:00:31,"other peoples, about what we do when someone we love dies and it's brilliant. It's full"
00:00:31,00:00:35,of interesting facts for those of you who like facts and if you are listening to this
00:00:35,00:00:40,"you probably do. And it's also very heartfelt, it's very personal, it's very moving, it's"
00:00:40,00:00:44,"very funny, it's all of these things and more so do check it out, it's called You Are"
00:00:44,00:00:49,Not Alone. And if you'd like to see Cariad in a live setting she is also part of the
00:00:49,00:00:54,"brilliant Jane Austen themed improvised comedy group, Ostentatious. And they are on every"
00:00:54,00:00:59,Monday at the moment at the Arts Theatre just near Leicester Square in London. It's a very
00:00:59,00:01:04,"funny show, I can personally attest to that. Do book first. Okay, that's it. On with the"
00:01:04,00:01:20,show.
00:01:20,00:01:25,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:01:25,00:01:31,"to you from the relocated QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:01:31,00:01:35,"with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Cariad Lloyd and once again we have gathered"
00:01:35,00:01:40,around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in a particular
00:01:40,00:01:45,order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Cariad.
00:01:45,00:01:51,"Hello, my fact is that if you are having trouble with your grief it might be Bill Murray's"
00:01:51,00:01:52,fault.
00:01:52,00:01:58,"Oh, because he kills again."
00:01:58,00:02:02,"And then he finds people who are grieving and he hits them, that's his thing. No, because"
00:02:02,00:02:06,I should backtrack this and say that the reason it might be Bill Murray's fault is the very
00:02:06,00:02:12,famous film Groundhog Day which is based on the five stages of grief theory. The five stages
00:02:12,00:02:19,"of grief theory is a very, very famous theory, began in 1969, created by Elizabeth Kubler-Ross"
00:02:19,00:02:24,in her book On Death and Dying and it really has been the most famous grief theory since
00:02:24,00:02:30,"then. It has now contested heavily, it's considered not to be that helpful or useful, but it's"
00:02:30,00:02:34,still the grief that most people encounter when they enter the world of grief. It's the
00:02:34,00:02:37,"thing that people will come up to me still and say, ""Oh, you know, I'm trying to do the"
00:02:37,00:02:42,"five stages, it's not really working."" And it makes me want to scream because it's, I"
00:02:42,00:02:47,"can swear, I can't, yeah. It's bullshit. But the film Groundhog Day is based on the five"
00:02:47,00:02:53,stages which I think helps to promote this idea that the five stages of grief is something
00:02:53,00:02:56,that you can work through. Grief is something that will end.
00:02:56,00:02:57,Can you give us the five stages?
00:02:57,00:03:00,"I can, man, give you the five stages."
00:03:00,00:03:04,"You wake up, you wake up, they're playing the same song as they were yesterday."
00:03:04,00:03:08,"Something about a weather report, I haven't seen this film. James, genuinely, have you"
00:03:08,00:03:09,not seen Groundhog Day?
00:03:09,00:03:10,I'm afraid not.
00:03:10,00:03:13,"Oh, you know what? It is worth, it is one of those that does stand up to watching."
00:03:13,00:03:14,"Yeah, no."
00:03:14,00:03:15,James hasn't seen any films before about 2000 and...
00:03:15,00:03:16,"Something like that. Well, I've seen some."
00:03:16,00:03:18,There's a few that make it through.
00:03:18,00:03:20,"Normally, I'm absolutely fine when you say you haven't seen a particular film and sometimes"
00:03:20,00:03:22,"you'll say, ""You want that? I'm shocked."""
00:03:22,00:03:23,Groundhog Day.
00:03:23,00:03:24,Groundhog Day's one of these.
00:03:24,00:03:27,"I don't think it's like, I haven't seen that on TV much. Is it on TV all the time?"
00:03:27,00:03:30,In my childhood it was a classic. It was one of those ones that would be on all the time.
00:03:30,00:03:34,"That was in Australia. So, okay, I reckon it's Denial."
00:03:34,00:03:36,"Oh, yeah, Acceptance."
00:03:36,00:03:38,Denial of the next subject.
00:03:38,00:03:40,And that is where people struggle.
00:03:40,00:03:46,"No, the five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance or the"
00:03:46,00:03:50,"worst boy band in your life, basically."
00:03:50,00:03:54,Yeah. And so that was Elizabeth Kubleros who defined these five stages of grief.
00:03:54,00:03:59,"But isn't she, I thought that when she came up with it, first off, it was to relate to"
00:03:59,00:04:01,the dying as opposed to grief.
00:04:01,00:04:02,"Yes, yes."
00:04:02,00:04:07,"But then secondly, she also said this doesn't happen in any particular order. It's much"
00:04:07,00:04:08,like the facts on our podcast.
00:04:08,00:04:09,Yes.
00:04:09,00:04:12,"You can have acceptance, but then later have denial."
00:04:12,00:04:15,"Well, they always start with the celebrity, don't they?"
00:04:15,00:04:16,"Yes, sir."
00:04:16,00:04:21,"So, on her book on Death and Dying, written in 1969, written in 10 weeks, she had something"
00:04:21,00:04:25,"like an article in Time magazine where they were like, ""Wow, this woman's doing amazing"
00:04:25,00:04:28,"work."" And then someone was like, ""You should write a book."" And she wrote the book and"
00:04:28,00:04:31,it became the best seller that it is.
00:04:31,00:04:32,Yeah.
00:04:32,00:04:34,"I mean, you can write a book fast. It doesn't mean it will be bad. It's just like, it's"
00:04:34,00:04:37,"very of its moment, of its time."
00:04:37,00:04:41,She was an amazing woman. She was a founder of the hospice movement. She was working with
00:04:41,00:04:45,people with AIDS in the 80s before that was considered safe. She was incredible. And at
00:04:45,00:04:50,"this time, she was working in hospitals where people were terminally ill, mainly with cancer."
00:04:50,00:04:55,And this was a time when they didn't even use the C word. They were just saying malignancy.
00:04:55,00:04:59,"And they would also not tell people. So, for example, if a wife was sick, they would tell"
00:04:59,00:05:03,"the husband, not the wife. So, she would be being told, she'd be having like radiotherapy"
00:05:03,00:05:08,"and she'd be told, ""It's to make you better."" But they'd all be going to her husband. She's"
00:05:08,00:05:09,not going to live.
00:05:09,00:05:15,"So, she came into this situation and was like, ""Hmm, this isn't great."" If you told people"
00:05:15,00:05:19,"that they were dying, she observed when she did that and helped them through it, that"
00:05:19,00:05:22,they would go through five distinct stages and they would reach an acceptance. And it
00:05:22,00:05:26,"would, I mean, that makes no sense. They would deny it first of all, like, ""Oh, no, I'm not"
00:05:26,00:05:30,"really ill. I'm fine. I can't believe it's me. Why am I dying? Oh, God, why did you do"
00:05:30,00:05:34,"this to me? This is the worst thing. Actually, okay, I'm dying. I'm going to pay off my debts"
00:05:34,00:05:40,"and apologize to all those people."" So, she was talking about people dying. And I honestly,"
00:05:40,00:05:45,"in my research for my book, couldn't find the moment that it became about grieving. It"
00:05:45,00:05:51,"just became about grieving because it was like, ""Well, it's death. It's same room."" And"
00:05:51,00:05:55,"it makes no sense for a grieving person. Like, anyone who's been through any loss will tell"
00:05:55,00:05:59,"you, like, ""You don't go through five distinct stages. You get them pretty much all at once"
00:05:59,00:06:04,"all the time and it can, you know, hit you five years later, two years later, 10 years"
00:06:04,00:06:07,"later."" So, I meet so many people who are like, ""Oh, God, I feel so bad. Like, I need"
00:06:07,00:06:12,"to get to acceptance. I haven't done it."" And I'm always raging because I'm like, ""That"
00:06:12,00:06:17,"isn't what grief looks like."" But the reason it works in a film is that's how films work."
00:06:17,00:06:20,They need to end and we all need to walk away thinking.
00:06:20,00:06:26,"I mean, not all films. No, good films will do that. I'm fingering a few mental suspects."
00:06:26,00:06:30,What? I haven't seen that film.
00:06:30,00:06:31,Hello.
00:06:31,00:06:34,"Although, Andy McDowell is in that as well."
00:06:34,00:06:38,I think we're in a few mental suspects.
00:06:38,00:06:42,She plays the doctor. She's really good.
00:06:42,00:06:46,"We should just quickly say, because James hasn't seen ""Groundhog Day."" So Bill Murray"
00:06:46,00:06:48,"is a journalist. He goes to this town to do ""Groundhog Day."""
00:06:48,00:06:49,The weatherman.
00:06:49,00:06:54,He's the weatherman. He wakes up in the morning and the day has begun again. He's conscious
00:06:54,00:06:57,of it. No one else is. And then the day has begun.
00:06:57,00:06:58,Yeah.
00:06:58,00:06:59,So he's...
00:06:59,00:07:00,Like a Russian doll at a TV show.
00:07:00,00:07:01,Yes.
00:07:01,00:07:02,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:02,00:07:03,Happy Death Day is like...
00:07:03,00:07:04,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:04,00:07:06,"But he reacts differently. So, first of all, he's like, ""This isn't happening."" Then he"
00:07:06,00:07:11,"gets furious. And he starts experimenting with his day. Like, ""Well, if I do this, will"
00:07:11,00:07:13,"I be here tomorrow?"" And it doesn't matter what he does."
00:07:13,00:07:15,He tries literally everything. It's a weird moment where he starts fingering.
00:07:15,00:07:16,But...
00:07:16,00:07:23,"And he's trying to woo Andy McDowell's character. And eventually, he learns everything about"
00:07:23,00:07:25,her becomes perfect and it still doesn't work.
00:07:25,00:07:27,"That's a bit creepy, isn't it?"
00:07:27,00:07:30,It's really creepy. It's creepy. That doesn't really stand up to today's standards.
00:07:30,00:07:31,No.
00:07:31,00:07:32,But it is a...
00:07:32,00:07:33,It is a great film.
00:07:33,00:07:34,It is a brilliant film.
00:07:34,00:07:35,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:35,00:07:36,Kubler Ross.
00:07:36,00:07:37,"Oh, yeah. Cubs."
00:07:37,00:07:38,Cubs.
00:07:38,00:07:39,Cubs.
00:07:39,00:07:40,She has a cool phrase.
00:07:40,00:07:43,"""There's no such thing as..."" Any guesses?"
00:07:43,00:07:44,Death.
00:07:44,00:07:45,"Yeah, death."
00:07:45,00:07:46,"Oh, did she?"
00:07:46,00:07:47,"Yeah, she said like she became..."
00:07:47,00:07:48,Her podcast is great.
00:07:48,00:07:49,Yeah.
00:07:49,00:07:51,It's like a mixture of our podcast and your podcast.
00:07:51,00:07:53,"Yeah, yeah. My God, yeah."
00:07:53,00:07:56,"She basically became so convinced there was an afterlife that she said, ""We don't need"
00:07:56,00:07:58,"to worry about death. There's no such thing as death."""
00:07:58,00:08:02,"That's why she was great at getting people into acceptance. It's just like, ""Don't worry"
00:08:02,00:08:03,"about it, guys. It's fine."""
00:08:03,00:08:08,"But the weird thing is, in her original book, the 1969 one, she called the belief in life"
00:08:08,00:08:13,after death a form of denial. So she actually thought that life after death was complete
00:08:13,00:08:16,"bullshit, and then she went through a change in her life."
00:08:16,00:08:17,Wow.
00:08:17,00:08:18,So she became like...
00:08:18,00:08:23,"Yeah, so she met a patient in a hospital who was called Mrs. Schwartz, and Mrs. Schwartz"
00:08:23,00:08:27,"had been pronounced dead, and then hours later, she was found alive by a nurse."
00:08:27,00:08:28,So...
00:08:28,00:08:29,Wondering the story.
00:08:29,00:08:33,"Yeah. So she went to interview her to say what happened, and she recounted that she said,"
00:08:33,00:08:38,"""I remember everything that happened. I remember being above my body. I remember a joke that"
00:08:38,00:08:42,"the doctor told in the room when I was laying there dead."" All that stuff. And that is what"
00:08:42,00:08:43,made...
00:08:43,00:08:44,"In appropriate, report that."
00:08:44,00:08:45,Exactly.
00:08:45,00:08:49,"So Kubla Ross basically went, ""Ah, this is interesting,"" and became obsessed with it."
00:08:49,00:08:54,"And she even went to have, as it were, out-of-body experiences through a guy called Robert Monroe."
00:08:54,00:08:59,"And then as she got further into it, she believed that she had spirit guides that she was contacting,"
00:08:59,00:09:05,"one of whom was Mrs. Schwartz, who did later die, and then came back to sort of instruct"
00:09:05,00:09:07,Kubla Ross about her ideas about the afterlife.
00:09:07,00:09:13,"And this woman is in charge of most known grief theory, known to humanity, like Western"
00:09:13,00:09:14,"culture, yeah."
00:09:14,00:09:19,"So one thing you write about in the Bookabit Carrier is the Victorian mourning rituals,"
00:09:19,00:09:23,"and how, although they were very starchy and very formal, they did give you a kind of structure."
00:09:23,00:09:26,And then you mention all the different paraphernalia of mourning.
00:09:26,00:09:27,"Yeah, they were mad."
00:09:27,00:09:32,"Yeah, I mean, it was really a culture highly focused on that. I can't remember if you"
00:09:32,00:09:36,"remember, but there's mourning stationery. Yeah, so yeah, that's really common. Yeah,"
00:09:36,00:09:37,mourning stationery.
00:09:37,00:09:40,"You get a black edged card, and when you receive that, you know that the person who sent it"
00:09:40,00:09:41,to you is...
00:09:41,00:09:44,I was thinking like rulers and charlatans and stuff.
00:09:44,00:09:48,"They had, in Regent Street, Jay's of Regent Street, was basically like the prime arc of"
00:09:48,00:09:49,grief and death.
00:09:49,00:09:54,"So where you went and got all your clothes from, and all your hats, and like gentlemen's"
00:09:54,00:09:56,funeral scarves had to be a certain length.
00:09:56,00:10:01,"There was like a book that told you everything, like from the length of the bow around your"
00:10:01,00:10:06,"hat to the staff, to the colour of the ribbon on your door, to your mourning jellies."
00:10:06,00:10:08,They kind of like made an industry of it as a Victorian...
00:10:08,00:10:09,So what is mourning jellies?
00:10:09,00:10:11,The jellies that you have when you're mourning.
00:10:11,00:10:12,Would they be like black?
00:10:12,00:10:15,"I don't know, actually. I never saw one. I just read about it in the book."
00:10:15,00:10:17,But is it for serving at a wake or something like that?
00:10:17,00:10:21,"I guess serving after a funeral, yeah. Or maybe you have it like on a Sunday when you're"
00:10:21,00:10:22,feeling gloomy.
00:10:22,00:10:28,"Well, jelly used to be, I mean, if we're talking London, there used to be pubs where if you"
00:10:28,00:10:35,"saw someone eating jelly, a woman, that would mean that she was available for sexual experiences."
00:10:35,00:10:39,I didn't know that. I need to stop eating jelly in public.
00:10:39,00:10:40,Purchase sexual experiences.
00:10:40,00:10:42,"Yeah, yeah, it wasn't like a traffic light party."
00:10:42,00:10:43,"No, but..."
00:10:43,00:10:47,"If you're eating strawberry jelly, you're not up for it."
00:10:47,00:10:51,It's like handkerchief culture in the...
00:10:51,00:10:52,Muffa knuckle...
00:10:52,00:10:53,Knock a muffling?
00:10:53,00:10:54,One of those?
00:10:54,00:10:55,Say it again.
00:10:55,00:10:56,Knock a muffling.
00:10:56,00:10:57,What's a knock a muffling?
00:10:57,00:10:58,It's loud to upset people at the house.
00:10:58,00:10:59,A door knocker on your house?
00:10:59,00:11:00,Oh.
00:11:00,00:11:01,You'd muffle it if someone's died.
00:11:01,00:11:02,"Yeah, and you'd also..."
00:11:02,00:11:03,To respect.
00:11:03,00:11:04,You'd have different colors as well.
00:11:04,00:11:07,"So, like, there was a black crate ribbon outside, it meant adult and it meant a child"
00:11:07,00:11:10,had died in this house and it would be muffled and there was...
00:11:10,00:11:11,"Yeah, there was like..."
00:11:11,00:11:16,It would cost you so much money to do a proper considered funeral.
00:11:16,00:11:19,"Like, I think they read even a middle-class funeral at the time would have been like a"
00:11:19,00:11:20,thousand pounds.
00:11:20,00:11:21,"Like, it was really..."
00:11:21,00:11:22,Right.
00:11:22,00:11:25,And they had funeral clubs where you'd all put money in every week so that you could
00:11:25,00:11:30,"get like the funeral you like that person deserves because if they didn't, they considered"
00:11:30,00:11:32,"their soul would wander around forever, basically."
00:11:32,00:11:33,"Oh, really?"
00:11:33,00:11:35,"So, it's like your pension, you know, you'll put in every week and then when you need the"
00:11:35,00:11:36,money you can take it.
00:11:36,00:11:37,Like a turkey club?
00:11:37,00:11:39,"Like a turkey club, but for the dead."
00:11:39,00:11:41,"Yeah, turkey's dead, I suppose."
00:11:41,00:11:43,But they don't get anything after that.
00:11:43,00:11:44,"No, you're right."
00:11:44,00:11:45,"Well, they don't pay, I suppose."
00:11:45,00:11:48,"Would you have like, you know, for a wedding you have like a present list."
00:11:48,00:11:52,Was there a similar thing where I'd like this at my funeral and I'll take care of it?
00:11:52,00:11:53,I think it was pretty set.
00:11:53,00:11:54,It was...
00:11:54,00:11:55,Yeah.
00:11:55,00:11:56,You just go.
00:11:56,00:11:59,"Can I just tell you one very tangential thing about knockers, door knockers?"
00:11:59,00:12:02,"You told me it was tangential, here we go."
00:12:02,00:12:07,"So, I was reading about knocker muffling and then I just sort of went around the rabbit"
00:12:07,00:12:15,"hole of door knockers, you know that in old Tehran, houses would have two door knockers,"
00:12:15,00:12:17,one was square and heavier and the other was more rounded.
00:12:17,00:12:18,Can you guess why?
00:12:18,00:12:19,One for the ladies?
00:12:19,00:12:21,It's one for the ladies.
00:12:21,00:12:22,No!
00:12:22,00:12:23,It's one for the men.
00:12:23,00:12:27,It's a big square one and women use the rounded one and then you know who's knocking at the
00:12:27,00:12:33,door and so then the woman of the house might not answer the door to a man for kind of cultural
00:12:33,00:12:34,reasons.
00:12:34,00:12:38,"They might also, I read this, they might disguise their voice behind the door to ask the business"
00:12:38,00:12:39,of who's coming around.
00:12:39,00:12:44,"Oh, is that like saying, ""Oh, I've got some big men here that are going to beat you up"
00:12:44,00:12:45,"if you come in."""
00:12:45,00:12:46,Is that how you do...
00:12:46,00:12:47,Is that what you do?
00:12:47,00:12:50,That's what I say every time someone knocks.
00:12:50,00:12:52,Just in case they might be coming in to attack.
00:12:52,00:12:53,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:53,00:12:56,It's good to let people know what's happening inside.
00:12:56,00:12:57,At an imaginary dog.
00:12:57,00:12:58,"""You're done!"
00:12:58,00:12:59,"Brute us down!"""
00:12:59,00:13:00,"That kind of thing, you know, that really works."
00:13:00,00:13:02,"That's when Julia Caesar's coming around, isn't it?"
00:13:02,00:13:07,"That's that great machine, quantity routine and she did it in her sitcom where you order"
00:13:07,00:13:11,"too many pizzas and the pizza guy's done it with six and you go, ""Yeah, it's here, it's"
00:13:11,00:13:12,"here!"""
00:13:12,00:13:13,"""I'll bring it in a minute."""
00:13:13,00:13:15,"And then they're like, ""It's just for you."""
00:13:15,00:13:18,"You could make it bigger, couldn't you, Andy, and have lots of different knockers, like a"
00:13:18,00:13:24,knocker for your delivery guy and a knocker for a Jehovah's Witness person or whatever.
00:13:24,00:13:25,Don't come in!
00:13:25,00:13:27,I've got some big men in here!
00:13:27,00:13:30,I don't want to know about eternal salvation!
00:13:30,00:13:33,"And so, how long was mourning in that?"
00:13:33,00:13:34,Depends.
00:13:34,00:13:35,"So, they had a rule for every single situation."
00:13:35,00:13:40,"So, like, rule for like your second cousin, your second cousin's child, your sister, your..."
00:13:40,00:13:43,"But for the most common people know, it's like for a partner."
00:13:43,00:13:47,"So, a widow would have a year in mourning where she had to wear black and then you go"
00:13:47,00:13:49,into half-morning and quarter-morning.
00:13:49,00:13:54,"And if you, in that year, got married, you're allowed to, like, not wear black for the day"
00:13:54,00:13:56,and then back in your black dress the next day.
00:13:56,00:14:00,"So, you could have a new husband and be like, ""Sorry, babes, do you remember Alfred?"""
00:14:00,00:14:01,"He was great, wasn't he?"
00:14:01,00:14:03,I'm still pretty sad.
00:14:03,00:14:04,When did we drop?
00:14:04,00:14:06,It was like a moment where we dropped this for some reason.
00:14:06,00:14:09,"Well, that's really interesting, because I don't think we have dropped it."
00:14:09,00:14:13,Because I think we still have an expectation that we expect people to be over things by about
00:14:13,00:14:14,a year.
00:14:14,00:14:18,"We've passed a year to two years, and with grief, we're a bit like, ""Oh, gosh, three years."
00:14:18,00:14:20,"Like, she's still upset."""
00:14:20,00:14:24,"And then, of course, you get the black armbands, which were still going up."
00:14:24,00:14:27,"Like, my mum wore a black armband when her granny died in the '60s."
00:14:27,00:14:30,But I would say she's like the last person I've spoken to who...
00:14:30,00:14:32,"But you still get soccer players doing that, right?"
00:14:32,00:14:33,"Yeah, so soccer..."
00:14:33,00:14:37,"I'm sorry, my brain went football in my head."
00:14:37,00:14:41,"Sports people and, like, military stuff still wear them."
00:14:41,00:14:44,"But other than that, obviously, you used to just wear it day to day."
00:14:44,00:14:49,And that comes up on my podcast that people wished there was still a thing you could have
00:14:49,00:14:51,"that would mean, like, sort of handle with care."
00:14:51,00:14:55,"Because it's like, you don't want to be a society that says you have to wear a black armband."
00:14:55,00:14:59,"But for some people, you know, if you're going to a shop, you're on a tube."
00:14:59,00:15:00,It's a bit like baby on board.
00:15:00,00:15:01,"It's like, ""I'm in grief."
00:15:01,00:15:03,"Like, just be careful with me."
00:15:03,00:15:05,"Like, if I'm in a shop or like..."""
00:15:05,00:15:06,"You have badges, don't you?"
00:15:06,00:15:07,I did sell badges.
00:15:07,00:15:10,"Yeah, but I couldn't keep up with the demand."
00:15:10,00:15:11,What did it say?
00:15:11,00:15:12,"It said, ""Please be kind."
00:15:12,00:15:13,"I'm grieving."""
00:15:13,00:15:14,And it had two little hands.
00:15:14,00:15:16,"And then one said, ""DDC member."""
00:15:16,00:15:18,It was in Dead Dad Club with DMC.
00:15:18,00:15:22,And there was a little amazing artist called Camille Bersini who designed them.
00:15:22,00:15:25,And it was like a little purple ghost with a hat with a flower.
00:15:25,00:15:26,"Oh, Dead Mom's Club."
00:15:26,00:15:27,"No, I was thinking Ron DMC."
00:15:27,00:15:28,That can't be.
00:15:28,00:15:29,I thought you...
00:15:29,00:15:30,They're dead.
00:15:30,00:15:31,They're dead.
00:15:31,00:15:32,It's like that.
00:15:32,00:15:33,And that's the way it is.
00:15:33,00:15:34,"Yeah, yeah."
00:15:34,00:15:37,"So, yeah, it's a shame in a way that we don't have."
00:15:37,00:15:38,"Yeah, I agree."
00:15:38,00:15:41,Because you never know what anyone's going through at any time.
00:15:41,00:15:42,"Yeah, yeah."
00:15:42,00:15:46,"Although I can see why the Victorians were very strict, obviously, like you had to do it."
00:15:46,00:15:47,And if a woman couldn't...
00:15:47,00:15:52,"You would know where you'd be allowed to walk around in like, you know, a bright yellow dress the next day."
00:15:52,00:15:55,"I think we'd have to draw a line on where, what kind of badges you'd have."
00:15:55,00:16:00,"Because I definitely would have like, ""Be gentle, lost an eBay purchase."""
00:16:00,00:16:01,"Like, you know..."
00:16:01,00:16:04,"I feel a small badge, isn't it?"
00:16:04,00:16:06,I've only got facts about groundhogs now.
00:16:06,00:16:07,Let's talk about groundhogs.
00:16:07,00:16:08,"Oh, groundhogs, yeah."
00:16:08,00:16:09,You mind?
00:16:09,00:16:10,No.
00:16:10,00:16:11,Groundhog Day.
00:16:11,00:16:12,Yeah.
00:16:12,00:16:13,"It's about groundhogs, is it?"
00:16:13,00:16:19,"Because there's a special groundhog who comes up and if he can see his shadow, it's going to snow for a month or so."
00:16:19,00:16:21,Have you seen the film Groundhog Day?
00:16:21,00:16:22,All this stuff.
00:16:22,00:16:24,They get him out of his little nest.
00:16:24,00:16:25,"Punctutaniville, isn't he?"
00:16:25,00:16:26,Punctutaniville.
00:16:26,00:16:27,But there are loads of groundhogs.
00:16:27,00:16:28,That's an interesting thing.
00:16:28,00:16:31,"I mean, all over, lots of places have a groundhog celebration."
00:16:31,00:16:36,I was just wondering if punctutani is the most difficult word that everyone knows how to pronounce.
00:16:36,00:16:39,"Yes, from the film Groundhog Day."
00:16:39,00:16:45,"But basically, if they get him out and if he turns around and sees his shadow, then there'll be another six weeks of winter."
00:16:45,00:16:47,"And if he doesn't, then the spring will come."
00:16:47,00:16:48,How do they know if he sees it?
00:16:48,00:16:56,"Well, what I read was, in real Punctutani, there are two scrolls, and if Phil picks the scroll that says he sees a shadow,"
00:16:56,00:16:58,that's how they know he's seen a shadow.
00:16:58,00:17:00,So there's these secret scrolls.
00:17:00,00:17:05,Do they look up the long-range weather forecast and lace one of them with groundhog food or whatever?
00:17:05,00:17:06,"They must do, right?"
00:17:06,00:17:07,They must do.
00:17:07,00:17:08,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:17:08,00:17:12,"It takes place on Gobler's Knob, I read."
00:17:12,00:17:16,Do you know where the name Gobler's Knob comes from?
00:17:16,00:17:18,There's two theories.
00:17:18,00:17:20,"If you get either of them, you can have a point."
00:17:20,00:17:22,Goblin's Knob?
00:17:22,00:17:23,No.
00:17:23,00:17:31,"Was it somebody was gobbling a man's knob and they said, ""We should call this Gobler's Knob,"""
00:17:31,00:17:33,"because she's always there, she's always doing that."
00:17:33,00:17:35,"What, Jelly Sue? Yeah, Jelly Sue."
00:17:35,00:17:38,And Jelly Sue didn't stick with me.
00:17:38,00:17:40,That's not one of the two theories that I have.
00:17:40,00:17:42,"Okay, sure, fine."
00:17:42,00:17:45,"You stick with your theories, I'll stick with mine."
00:17:45,00:17:47,"Oh, is it where people ate on mountains?"
00:17:47,00:17:50,"Yeah, like a knob is just like a hillock."
00:17:50,00:17:53,"Well, that's why I thought Goblin's Knob, because it looks like a goblin's."
00:17:53,00:17:55,"No, no, no, your theory was not bad."
00:17:55,00:17:57,"Oh, he's going to get it."
00:17:57,00:18:04,"So it's where the old shoe mender used to buy his trade, Gobler's Knob, and slowly it became Goblin's Knob."
00:18:04,00:18:06,Why? Why did they start going?
00:18:06,00:18:08,Because he gave a lot of blowjobs.
00:18:08,00:18:10,"Yeah, yeah, I'm going to call it Goblin."
00:18:10,00:18:12,It's an offer to sell shoes.
00:18:12,00:18:16,"Is that like a happy ending for massages, but in the shoe cleaning trade?"
00:18:16,00:18:18,You know when he comes down to measure your feet?
00:18:18,00:18:20,He's bending down.
00:18:20,00:18:22,"Well, I'm down here."
00:18:22,00:18:26,"No, it's because a group of turkeys might have lived there."
00:18:26,00:18:34,"And then another theory is like Dan said, maybe there were hunters and then that's where they would eat their food after the hunt."
00:18:34,00:18:37,"So they would gobble up the food, but I think the turkeys are the most likely ones."
00:18:37,00:18:38,"Yeah, that is good."
00:18:38,00:18:39,I didn't know groundhogs.
00:18:39,00:18:40,The groundhogs are amazing.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"Yeah, sure."
00:18:42,00:18:43,"No, they really are."
00:18:43,00:18:47,So I didn't know they were the same as a woodchuck and it's the largest member of the squirrel family.
00:18:47,00:18:48,What?
00:18:48,00:18:50,"Oh, no, and they're brilliant diggers."
00:18:50,00:18:53,"So they dig, they'll dig several feet down in a row."
00:18:53,00:18:59,"They live in burrows several feet down, then a few feet up, and then they level out and go along."
00:18:59,00:19:04,"And then off the side of that main tunnel, they'll dig several different rooms, one of which is the toilet room."
00:19:04,00:19:06,And they only go to the loo in there.
00:19:06,00:19:09,"And then when it's full, they just seal it up and they dig a new toilet elsewhere."
00:19:09,00:19:10,They're very clean.
00:19:10,00:19:14,"Yeah, I was going to say the first thing that you said they got down and up is that so they got drowned."
00:19:14,00:19:22,"They go to dig another room and they're like, oh no, that's three years ago's toilet."
00:19:22,00:19:24,"Close up, close up, close up."
00:19:24,00:19:26,You have to hit it eventually.
00:19:26,00:19:28,"There's how many rooms, how long is, I guess you keep moving the tunnel down."
00:19:28,00:19:31,"You really have to hide that when selling it, wouldn't you, to the next Grand Old Family?"
00:19:31,00:19:33,"Oh, don't, don't."
00:19:33,00:19:34,What's that on these walls?
00:19:34,00:19:35,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:35,00:19:37,"We want to extend, no, you can't."
00:19:37,00:19:38,You can't extend that.
00:19:38,00:19:48,"Okay, it's time for fact number one and that is Carriette."
00:19:48,00:19:49,Boom.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Brilliant.
00:19:50,00:19:54,It's actually time for fact number two and that is James.
00:19:54,00:19:57,"Okay, my fact this week is that there's a bus tower in Hong Kong,"
00:19:57,00:20:01,which is specifically run for people to sleep all the way through.
00:20:01,00:20:02,Lovely.
00:20:02,00:20:03,"Lovely, lovely idea."
00:20:03,00:20:04,"Sounds great, doesn't it?"
00:20:04,00:20:06,Is it because people are tired in Hong Kong?
00:20:06,00:20:07,That's part of the reason.
00:20:07,00:20:09,"What do you think, Andy?"
00:20:09,00:20:12,"Otherwise, it'd be a terrible place to do this."
00:20:12,00:20:16,"You just get people out and they're all like, no, I'm wide awake."
00:20:16,00:20:17,We're not sleeping in Hong Kong.
00:20:17,00:20:20,Why can't they get a normal bus?
00:20:20,00:20:21,I love sleeping on the bus.
00:20:21,00:20:23,Why can't they just get a bus?
00:20:23,00:20:24,"Well, they could."
00:20:24,00:20:26,"It stops, doesn't it?"
00:20:26,00:20:28,And so they might wake you up and kick you off the bus.
00:20:28,00:20:31,"The idea came from this guy, Kenneth Kong."
00:20:31,00:20:35,He worked for a bus tour organizer and he was chatting to one of his friends
00:20:35,00:20:37,"and his friends said he was really stressed, you know,"
00:20:37,00:20:40,"he's got a really busy job, couldn't sleep at night."
00:20:40,00:20:41,"But whenever he traveled to work on the bus,"
00:20:41,00:20:43,he would always kind of fall asleep.
00:20:43,00:20:45,And Kenneth Kong thought this is amazing.
00:20:45,00:20:46,This is such a good idea.
00:20:46,00:20:50,I'm going to do a bus tour where people are just encouraged to sleep.
00:20:50,00:20:52,"And unlike a normal bus ride,"
00:20:52,00:20:56,"we're going to give you a goodie bag with an eye mask, some ear plugs."
00:20:56,00:21:00,Maybe we'll get a very soporific tour guide or something.
00:21:00,00:21:01,That's a good idea.
00:21:01,00:21:03,"But actually the first time they did it,"
00:21:03,00:21:05,they had the upper deck for people who wanted to sleep
00:21:05,00:21:10,and the lower deck was for people who wanted to have a tour guide chat into them.
00:21:10,00:21:13,"Which feels like the wrong way around because if you want to see the site,"
00:21:13,00:21:14,you want to be on the top.
00:21:14,00:21:15,Exactly. Really good point.
00:21:15,00:21:19,"But anyway, they noticed that a lot of people found that more difficult"
00:21:19,00:21:21,"and didn't sleep, so now they're making two separate bus tours."
00:21:21,00:21:23,One for sleepers and one for not sleepers.
00:21:23,00:21:26,"I also read as well that I don't know if they do this every single time,"
00:21:26,00:21:30,but they might start with a huge two hour long lunch.
00:21:30,00:21:32,So that's a very good idea.
00:21:32,00:21:35,You go into a food coma as you're getting on the bus.
00:21:35,00:21:36,"Oh, nice."
00:21:36,00:21:37,You could do this for lots of things
00:21:37,00:21:40,because there are lots of activities where you're put in a...
00:21:40,00:21:43,"Like the cinema, for example, or theatre, or an opera."
00:21:43,00:21:46,Are you suggesting that you go to sleep in a...
00:21:46,00:21:47,"I'm saying that it's very easy to fall asleep,"
00:21:47,00:21:49,especially if the thing is not good.
00:21:49,00:21:53,"I once went to a Bach concert, which is, you know..."
00:21:53,00:21:57,"It's really sort of deep and sort of quite long notes and stuff,"
00:21:57,00:22:00,and about halfway through I looked around and literally half.
00:22:00,00:22:03,"The men mostly, I must say, but they were mostly asleep."
00:22:03,00:22:04,"Yeah, yeah."
00:22:04,00:22:07,"I used to go to lunchtime concerts at Wigmore Hall,"
00:22:07,00:22:10,"and I thought, ""Oh, this is an exciting London thing to do,"""
00:22:10,00:22:12,"but it was full of people head nodding,"
00:22:12,00:22:14,"just like, ""Oh, this is so nice. I'm on my lunch break."""
00:22:14,00:22:15,It's very hard to do this.
00:22:15,00:22:16,"Yeah, you could get like 15 minutes, couldn't you?"
00:22:16,00:22:18,"That's headbangers, you know, at metal concerts."
00:22:18,00:22:20,"Actually, I'm just about to fall asleep."
00:22:20,00:22:21,Time to wake it up.
00:22:21,00:22:23,"Wake up, Gary. It's just about to stop."
00:22:23,00:22:25,"I once went to Brian Blessed's house,"
00:22:25,00:22:27,"and I was hanging out with him,"
00:22:27,00:22:29,"and he tells stories that go on and on,"
00:22:29,00:22:33,and it was just me and him sitting in his adventurous shed that he has.
00:22:33,00:22:36,"And I was so tired, and he was telling me stories,"
00:22:36,00:22:38,and I fell asleep.
00:22:38,00:22:40,"And I remember waking up with that sudden start,"
00:22:40,00:22:42,"and I looked up, and he was still talking at me."
00:22:42,00:22:43,Amazing.
00:22:43,00:22:45,"He just did, and we would definitely way further away"
00:22:45,00:22:47,than where the story was when I fell asleep.
00:22:47,00:22:48,That's great.
00:22:48,00:22:50,We could hire Brian Blessed to go around to people's houses.
00:22:50,00:22:51,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:51,00:22:53,"Well, he must have some audiobooks you can listen to."
00:22:53,00:22:54,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:54,00:22:55,I was looking up good bus tours.
00:22:55,00:22:56,Yeah.
00:22:56,00:22:57,"Oh, okay."
00:22:57,00:23:00,There was a tour bus for dogs in 2017 in London.
00:23:00,00:23:01,Oh.
00:23:01,00:23:02,But it was a bit of a...
00:23:02,00:23:04,"Well, okay, it was the Rootmaster K9."
00:23:04,00:23:08,And there was a live commentary of Dog Trivia from around London.
00:23:08,00:23:09,Okay.
00:23:09,00:23:10,Fine.
00:23:10,00:23:12,And the route was between places where you could go for walkies.
00:23:12,00:23:14,"But wait, so the owners were the dogs?"
00:23:14,00:23:15,"Yeah, that's the thing."
00:23:15,00:23:17,"There are dogs in Moscow who get on the tube,"
00:23:17,00:23:20,who live kind of down on the tube and sort of jump on between stops.
00:23:20,00:23:21,Wow.
00:23:21,00:23:22,Like the pigeons do.
00:23:22,00:23:23,I don't believe the pigeons.
00:23:23,00:23:24,I've seen them.
00:23:24,00:23:25,I've seen them.
00:23:25,00:23:26,I've seen them.
00:23:26,00:23:27,I've read it.
00:23:27,00:23:28,Okay.
00:23:28,00:23:29,I've seen them.
00:23:29,00:23:30,"Okay, guys, pipe down."
00:23:30,00:23:31,I've done research on this.
00:23:31,00:23:33,I didn't get to read out a few weeks ago on the podcast.
00:23:33,00:23:34,The pigeons get the tube.
00:23:34,00:23:35,Do they know they're doing it?
00:23:35,00:23:36,"And I literally saw the pigeon do it, though."
00:23:36,00:23:38,"No, no, we didn't, because he read a research thing."
00:23:38,00:23:39,We didn't see it.
00:23:39,00:23:40,"A pigeon can be on the tube,"
00:23:40,00:23:42,but it does not have a conception of the map of my pigeon.
00:23:42,00:23:43,"Oh, okay."
00:23:43,00:23:44,But I've seen a pigeon on the tube.
00:23:44,00:23:45,"But you know, there's also the pigeon on the tube."
00:23:45,00:23:46,"No, but listen."
00:23:46,00:23:47,Let me talk.
00:23:47,00:23:49,There's the tube bit that's overground.
00:23:49,00:23:51,So then it's getting on at one stop and going two stops
00:23:51,00:23:53,"and literally walking on, waiting by the door"
00:23:53,00:23:54,and then walking on.
00:23:54,00:23:55,That's what I saw as well.
00:23:55,00:23:57,"Yeah, so it's like, it's not doing underground tube."
00:23:57,00:23:59,"It's like, oh, if I get on at East Finchley."
00:23:59,00:24:02,I'd be more impressed to see a pigeon on the underground tube.
00:24:02,00:24:05,That would be dangerous and upsetting for the pigeon
00:24:05,00:24:06,and distressing.
00:24:06,00:24:07,It'll be fine.
00:24:07,00:24:08,It sort of slides down the escalator.
00:24:08,00:24:10,What we've seen is much more normal.
00:24:10,00:24:13,"An outdoor platform, pigeon gets on, rides and stops, gets on."
00:24:13,00:24:14,"For me, it's so normal."
00:24:14,00:24:15,It's banal.
00:24:15,00:24:18,It's actually come round to banal.
00:24:18,00:24:19,I can't even accept it.
00:24:19,00:24:22,"I wonder what you think, Andy, now that you've read this research."
00:24:22,00:24:24,Are you trusting your own research
00:24:24,00:24:26,or are you believing the eyewitness reports?
00:24:26,00:24:27,I've literally seen it.
00:24:27,00:24:28,I just want to clear this up.
00:24:28,00:24:30,I believe what you've both seen.
00:24:30,00:24:32,You've both seen a pigeon hop onto a train.
00:24:32,00:24:34,The train girl stop or do the pigeon hop off.
00:24:34,00:24:35,Wait by the doors.
00:24:35,00:24:36,Wait by the doors.
00:24:36,00:24:38,"No distress, no panic."
00:24:38,00:24:39,I did the gap.
00:24:39,00:24:41,Pressing that button when it's the open button.
00:24:41,00:24:43,That's what makes it clear that the pigeon's stupid.
00:24:43,00:24:44,The doors operate anyway.
00:24:44,00:24:45,Not on the overground.
00:24:45,00:24:46,Not on the overground.
00:24:46,00:24:47,I didn't see over.
00:24:47,00:24:48,I saw underground.
00:24:48,00:24:49,Underground chain.
00:24:49,00:24:50,"What's the point is, I don't think,"
00:24:50,00:24:52,I think they might be hopping on looking for food or something.
00:24:52,00:24:53,I don't think they're--
00:24:53,00:24:54,But it didn't do any food.
00:24:54,00:24:55,They're not commuting home.
00:24:55,00:24:57,"Andy, this is what I saw."
00:24:57,00:24:59,It just waited by the door.
00:24:59,00:25:00,It was playing Candy Crush.
00:25:00,00:25:03,"It literally got on, stood and faced the doors like a commuter."
00:25:03,00:25:05,"Everyone was like, oh my god, pigeon."
00:25:05,00:25:07,Doors closed and then it went two stops.
00:25:07,00:25:08,So it didn't have to do--
00:25:08,00:25:09,The two is more convincing.
00:25:09,00:25:11,"Yeah, no, it did two."
00:25:11,00:25:15,"It did East Finchley to Finchley Central,"
00:25:15,00:25:16,like to West Finchley.
00:25:16,00:25:18,So it went out to North London and it got out.
00:25:18,00:25:21,Mine had a baby on board back then.
00:25:21,00:25:23,"If it's the several days in a row,"
00:25:23,00:25:25,"within the same half an hour period,"
00:25:25,00:25:27,I will believe you've got a commuting pigeon.
00:25:27,00:25:28,OK.
00:25:28,00:25:29,What were we talking about?
00:25:29,00:25:30,Bassist.
00:25:30,00:25:31,Bassist.
00:25:31,00:25:32,"Oh, Bassist or Dogtar."
00:25:32,00:25:33,Dogtar.
00:25:33,00:25:34,"You started this, Jase."
00:25:34,00:25:35,You said there are dogs on the Bosco jeans.
00:25:35,00:25:36,Sorry.
00:25:36,00:25:38,Can I just ask on your Dogtar?
00:25:38,00:25:40,It's basically a way for dog walkers
00:25:40,00:25:42,"to get from one walkies area to another one,"
00:25:42,00:25:44,and they gave them stuff in the meantime.
00:25:44,00:25:45,I think so.
00:25:45,00:25:47,I think it was around for a few days
00:25:47,00:25:49,as a kind of to promote the firm.
00:25:49,00:25:51,Are your Russian dogs commuting there?
00:25:51,00:25:52,We're just living there.
00:25:52,00:25:55,"I think that's the idea, is that they do go from one place"
00:25:55,00:25:57,to another where they know they can get food
00:25:57,00:25:58,from different places.
00:25:58,00:26:00,But I can't really quite remember.
00:26:00,00:26:01,"Yeah, I believe that."
00:26:01,00:26:02,You believe that.
00:26:02,00:26:03,"Oh, that's fine."
00:26:03,00:26:05,James has never seen it.
00:26:05,00:26:08,"I was going to say, when I went to Moscow,"
00:26:08,00:26:10,"I've been a few times, but whenever I've gone,"
00:26:10,00:26:12,I've tried to look on the underground for these dogs
00:26:12,00:26:13,and I've never seen them.
00:26:13,00:26:15,"Well, Andy still believes you."
00:26:15,00:26:21,I was reading about the bus drivers of history.
00:26:21,00:26:26,One significant and very controversial bus driver
00:26:26,00:26:28,was a guy called James Blake.
00:26:28,00:26:29,"Yeah, of course, Rosa Parks."
00:26:29,00:26:31,He was the Rosa Parks bus driver.
00:26:31,00:26:32,Here's the thing I didn't know.
00:26:32,00:26:33,So he was called James Blake.
00:26:33,00:26:36,"It was 1955, this happened."
00:26:36,00:26:39,The most famous incident.
00:26:39,00:26:41,But she and Blake had beef already.
00:26:41,00:26:45,"Oh, I had read this somewhere because she was like a known activist."
00:26:45,00:26:46,Wasn't she?
00:26:46,00:26:47,That was the big thing.
00:26:47,00:26:51,"12 years earlier in 1943, she got on a bus, paid,"
00:26:51,00:26:54,but she'd got on the front entrance and Blake was the driver.
00:26:54,00:26:57,"And he said, no, you've got to get off and get on the sort of back doors of the bus"
00:26:57,00:26:59,"because that was the rules, segregated buses."
00:26:59,00:27:02,"And she got off to, God's sake, all right."
00:27:02,00:27:05,"She got off to get on the other entrance and he drove off,"
00:27:05,00:27:08,which was a thing they would do sometimes as a kind of prank.
00:27:08,00:27:10,So she avoided his buses for years.
00:27:10,00:27:12,"You know, when she saw he was a driver and then that day,"
00:27:12,00:27:13,she didn't notice that he was the driver.
00:27:13,00:27:14,She was tired.
00:27:14,00:27:15,She was preoccupied.
00:27:15,00:27:17,"And so that's, that's what happened."
00:27:17,00:27:20,He was a bus driver for 19 more years.
00:27:20,00:27:21,19 more years.
00:27:21,00:27:22,Yeah.
00:27:22,00:27:23,Wow.
00:27:23,00:27:27,"Because it was quite, she, her story was one that sort of hit the right moment at the right time."
00:27:27,00:27:32,"There were quite a lot of stories of, of people who were refusing to step up from their seats and go to the back."
00:27:32,00:27:34,I think even Rosa Parks' story is slightly distorted.
00:27:34,00:27:36,"Yeah, I was going to say, she wasn't tight."
00:27:36,00:27:39,She knew it was all planned and they used her because she looked quite mild-mannered
00:27:39,00:27:44,"and they thought that it would be like, you know, a way for it to get on the bus"
00:27:44,00:27:46,"and look like she wasn't going to cause trouble, but they absolutely,"
00:27:46,00:27:49,"she was a super intelligent, brilliant part of the organization."
00:27:49,00:27:52,"And it was very, very well, they knew like they were going to do this incident."
00:27:52,00:27:53,The King was part of that.
00:27:53,00:27:54,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:54,00:27:57,"Genuinely, actually only know that because of a Doctor Who episode from the Jodie Whitaker period."
00:27:57,00:27:59,So that probably needs a fact check.
00:27:59,00:28:01,I think they would have got that right.
00:28:01,00:28:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:02,00:28:04,"Yeah, a lot of, a lot of seminal moments have happened on buses."
00:28:04,00:28:06,So George Harrison joined the Beatles on a bus.
00:28:06,00:28:07,Did he?
00:28:07,00:28:09,"He was sitting on top, top deck of a bus."
00:28:09,00:28:11,Not on top of Paul McCartney's head.
00:28:11,00:28:13,He was giving him a shoulder's ride.
00:28:13,00:28:17,"Yeah, Paul already knew him and that's where he introduced properly to John Lennon"
00:28:17,00:28:19,"and John said, can you play a song?"
00:28:19,00:28:21,That was a very difficult song to play on guitar.
00:28:21,00:28:23,"He played it, nailed it and that's when they said, you're in the band."
00:28:23,00:28:24,So that's important.
00:28:24,00:28:27,George Michael wrote Careless Whisper on the bus.
00:28:27,00:28:29,I'm never going to dance again.
00:28:29,00:28:32,Guilty feet have got no N17.
00:28:32,00:28:33,"No, zero to no."
00:28:33,00:28:34,"No, zero lyric."
00:28:34,00:28:36,I was a tour bus guide.
00:28:36,00:28:37,Tour bus guide?
00:28:37,00:28:38,That sounded wrong.
00:28:38,00:28:40,"No, I was, that's the right."
00:28:40,00:28:41,You were a tour guide who was on the bus.
00:28:41,00:28:42,"Thank you, thank you."
00:28:42,00:28:44,"I was like, tour bus guide is the right."
00:28:44,00:28:45,Here's another tour bus.
00:28:45,00:28:48,"If you look over there, another tour bus is going past."
00:28:48,00:28:50,So many tour buses.
00:28:50,00:28:55,I was a tour guide on an open top bus for some time in London
00:28:55,00:28:57,"and I got in trouble a lot, yes."
00:28:57,00:28:58,For what?
00:28:58,00:28:59,Making stuff up?
00:28:59,00:29:01,"No, I never made stuff up."
00:29:01,00:29:05,I made a joke about the Royal Family and someone wrote and complained
00:29:05,00:29:08,and said I should be ashamed of myself and I disgraced my country.
00:29:08,00:29:09,"Wow, it was about Prince Andrew."
00:29:09,00:29:12,"It wasn't, at the time, that sort of thing wasn't known."
00:29:12,00:29:14,"It was about Prince Harry taking drugs, which was absolutely known"
00:29:14,00:29:18,and it was a really crap joke that every tour guide did on St James's.
00:29:18,00:29:20,So the shops have Royal warrants.
00:29:20,00:29:22,So that's where they have a crest in the window.
00:29:22,00:29:24,That means the Royal Family shop there.
00:29:24,00:29:26,"And the whole of St James's, there's like,"
00:29:26,00:29:29,"oh, Berry Brothers, Lob and Coases."
00:29:29,00:29:31,"There's all like the boot makers, the hat makers"
00:29:31,00:29:34,and there's also a pharmacy on St James's
00:29:34,00:29:36,and you say that's where the Royal Family get their drugs
00:29:36,00:29:38,although I think Prince Harry probably gets his from somewhere else.
00:29:38,00:29:40,It's a terrible joke.
00:29:40,00:29:41,It's fine.
00:29:41,00:29:43,Have you got your first comedy review?
00:29:43,00:29:44,Two stars.
00:29:44,00:29:46,"We got up at Bucking, I said,"
00:29:46,00:29:48,"this is Bucking Palace and a couple marched up to me and they said,"
00:29:48,00:29:49,"""We're getting off."""
00:29:49,00:29:50,"I said, ""Oh, okay."""
00:29:50,00:29:51,"They said, ""We don't want to."""
00:29:51,00:29:53,"I said, ""Oh, what's happening?"""
00:29:53,00:29:54,"And I said, ""It's you."
00:29:54,00:29:55,"We're getting off because of you."""
00:29:55,00:29:56,"And I was like, ""Oh, what?"""
00:29:56,00:30:00,"I said, ""What you just said about the Royal Family was so disgraceful."""
00:30:00,00:30:03,"And then when the letter, they said I had disgraced Prince William."
00:30:03,00:30:05,So they hadn't even been listening to my joke.
00:30:05,00:30:07,You wouldn't make that joke about Prince William.
00:30:07,00:30:08,That's the most annoying thing.
00:30:08,00:30:10,"It was so annoying, but I got in quite big trouble."
00:30:10,00:30:11,Did you apologise?
00:30:11,00:30:12,"No, they're gone."
00:30:12,00:30:13,They're long gone.
00:30:13,00:30:15,Unrepentant.
00:30:15,00:30:18,"I'm glad you weren't my boss, I did."
00:30:18,00:30:19,You know London Bus?
00:30:19,00:30:20,Just a London Bus.
00:30:20,00:30:21,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:21,00:30:22,Big Red Bus.
00:30:22,00:30:23,Big Red Bus.
00:30:23,00:30:27,You know how long they are in terms of how many London Buses they are?
00:30:27,00:30:29,They're one London Bus.
00:30:29,00:30:32,"No, they're 1.2 times the length of a London Bus."
00:30:32,00:30:33,Okay.
00:30:33,00:30:35,And that's because they're new rootmasters.
00:30:35,00:30:39,"And if you ever look at, like, whatever anyone says, this is so stupid."
00:30:39,00:30:43,"But whatever anyone says, this is like 10 times the length of a London Bus."
00:30:43,00:30:44,They're talking about the old London Bus.
00:30:44,00:30:45,"Oh, talking about the rootmasters."
00:30:45,00:30:46,Yeah.
00:30:46,00:30:49,"But they've got the new one, such a 1.2 times the length."
00:30:49,00:30:50,Brilliant.
00:30:50,00:30:51,I genuinely interested in that.
00:30:51,00:30:54,"Do you know, I bit, like, I loved, I'm the age of remembering rootmasters."
00:30:54,00:30:57,And they were great when you could jump on the back of the bus.
00:30:57,00:30:59,"Obviously, it wasn't safe, but it was brilliant."
00:30:59,00:31:00,Yeah.
00:31:00,00:31:01,You never had to worry about missing a bus.
00:31:01,00:31:02,You just ran.
00:31:02,00:31:03,You could still jump on.
00:31:03,00:31:05,"No, because they closed them all because it wasn't safe."
00:31:05,00:31:06,Do you remember the old ones?
00:31:06,00:31:07,"Like, had no door."
00:31:07,00:31:08,Totally open.
00:31:08,00:31:09,Yeah.
00:31:09,00:31:10,"No, sorry."
00:31:10,00:31:11,I've jumped on the back of one when the door was open.
00:31:11,00:31:12,Wow.
00:31:12,00:31:13,"Andy, you're so lucky."
00:31:13,00:31:15,You jumped on a bus and it was open.
00:31:15,00:31:18,You didn't just run head first into glass.
00:31:18,00:31:20,I was sneaking off one bus and onto another one.
00:31:20,00:31:22,It was after a party.
00:31:22,00:31:25,"Anyway, I don't want to go into my showbiz life."
00:31:25,00:31:28,"You know, we're familiar with the Spice Bus."
00:31:28,00:31:29,Yeah.
00:31:29,00:31:30,Spice Girls Bus.
00:31:30,00:31:31,From the Spice World movie.
00:31:31,00:31:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:32,00:31:34,And you can rent it now.
00:31:34,00:31:35,How can you?
00:31:35,00:31:36,You can stay in it overnight.
00:31:36,00:31:39,Is this a hint for your next birthday?
00:31:39,00:31:40,No.
00:31:40,00:31:41,Is it still so...
00:31:41,00:31:42,It's on the other one.
00:31:42,00:31:43,It's tedious.
00:31:43,00:31:44,I haven't seen this movie.
00:31:44,00:31:45,"But is it like, I think it's like Uni and Jack."
00:31:45,00:31:46,That's not missable.
00:31:46,00:31:48,You have to watch Spice Bus.
00:31:48,00:31:50,Meatloaf is the driver.
00:31:50,00:31:53,Does it still look the same as it did in the show?
00:31:53,00:31:56,"Yes, it's still, the exterior looks the same."
00:31:56,00:31:58,"But the interior, unfortunately, obviously in the film,"
00:31:58,00:32:01,the interior was this huge three-story potential.
00:32:01,00:32:03,It couldn't have been what it was.
00:32:03,00:32:05,Was it like bigger on the inside kind of thing?
00:32:05,00:32:06,"Yeah, exactly."
00:32:06,00:32:08,"Well, they never, I don't think they made a kind of space-time definition"
00:32:08,00:32:10,about how big it was.
00:32:10,00:32:12,Just kept showing you different rooms in it.
00:32:12,00:32:14,"Like a Groundhog's Nest, basically."
00:32:14,00:32:15,Exactly.
00:32:15,00:32:19,There's one more full of shit from the Spice Girls
00:32:19,00:32:22,than if you attacked her.
00:32:22,00:32:24,"Oh, God."
00:32:24,00:32:27,We spoke about the Dave Matthews band a few months ago.
00:32:27,00:32:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:28,00:32:30,"Yes, did you know the Dave Matthews band?"
00:32:30,00:32:32,I didn't know Dave Matthews band.
00:32:32,00:32:34,There was this thing in 2004 where they dumped 800 pounds
00:32:34,00:32:37,of raw untreated sewage into a river.
00:32:37,00:32:39,There was a Chicago River while they were crossing the bridge
00:32:39,00:32:41,on their tour bus.
00:32:41,00:32:44,"And they were, unfortunately, they were crossing a slatted bridge"
00:32:44,00:32:48,and there was an open top tour boat passing by beneath the bridge.
00:32:48,00:32:51,Can I just say it was the driver rather than the band.
00:32:51,00:32:54,"Yeah, I was like the band were there like now."
00:32:54,00:32:57,"So anyway, that was a huge thing led to a lot of,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,I think there were apology letters.
00:32:59,00:33:02,But I was reading about what happens how you release
00:33:02,00:33:06,"what they call the Blackwater, you know, the sewage from the thing."
00:33:06,00:33:09,"And you know, buses have changed a bit since then."
00:33:09,00:33:11,I think they've been altered a bit.
00:33:11,00:33:14,I was reading an interview with a bus driver from 2016 about how you release it.
00:33:14,00:33:17,"And there is a switch that says dump, which they keep."
00:33:17,00:33:21,"Supposedly they keep it by the driver's left elbow, which feels risky."
00:33:21,00:33:23,Thanks for the indicators.
00:33:23,00:33:25,"But these days, there's like a nuclear button."
00:33:25,00:33:27,There is a plastic cap over the switch.
00:33:27,00:33:30,So you have to make a conscious decision to dump.
00:33:30,00:33:32,"I mean, we all need that in our lives."
00:33:32,00:33:35,Make a conscious decision to drop your shit.
00:33:35,00:33:38,They should put the key for it inside a person.
00:33:38,00:33:43,This is a callback to something the other day.
00:33:43,00:33:47,"The idea of a nuclear button, you put the key inside a person"
00:33:47,00:33:49,so they had to kill the person to get to the nuclear button.
00:33:49,00:33:51,And the president had to do it himself.
00:33:51,00:33:53,"Yes, an initial."
00:33:53,00:33:56,But how's he going to keep that inside him without shitting it out?
00:33:56,00:33:58,I'll be under his skin.
00:33:58,00:34:01,"Oh, okay. I thought you meant like swallow it and then go through the shit, get the key."
00:34:01,00:34:06,"In this case, sir, the missiles are going to be in two minutes."
00:34:06,00:34:08,The president is sieving a poo.
00:34:08,00:34:11,"It's like, ""I'll find it. I'll find it."""
00:34:11,00:34:14,The key's covered in sweet card.
00:34:14,00:34:18,Are you sure you want to look at the plastic cover?
00:34:18,00:34:19,"Not yet, not yet."
00:34:19,00:34:21,"Oh, God, sorry."
00:34:21,00:34:29,"Okay, it is time for fact number one."
00:34:29,00:34:31,"Okay, I'm sorry."
00:34:31,00:34:35,They say I love won't pay the rent.
00:34:35,00:34:39,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:34:39,00:34:43,"My fact is that for many years, the secret of the British Army's balloons"
00:34:43,00:34:46,was known by a single family of Alsatians.
00:34:46,00:34:48,Wow.
00:34:48,00:34:51,By which I mean people from Alsat.
00:34:51,00:34:54,Were they all on a bus together?
00:34:54,00:35:00,"This is a thing where, so the ballooning took off."
00:35:00,00:35:08,If only the people at home could have seen the way that you built up.
00:35:08,00:35:10,"I know, the face."
00:35:10,00:35:13,You lifted up the plastic button and you dumped.
00:35:13,00:35:15,You pressed dump on your joke.
00:35:15,00:35:19,"I thought, ""I could do it. I could go for it, couldn't I?"
00:35:19,00:35:22,"They'll all laugh and we'll just move on and it won't be made a big thing off."""
00:35:22,00:35:24,"The British Army, they were experimenting."
00:35:24,00:35:27,"They were making hydrogen balloons, and this is in the 1880s."
00:35:27,00:35:30,So it's 100 years or so after the Montgolfier brothers and so on.
00:35:30,00:35:35,"And hydrogen balloons are great in lots of ways, but there's a problem."
00:35:35,00:35:41,Hydrogen molecules are so tiny that they escape from almost any bag that you keep them in.
00:35:41,00:35:46,I'll put them in the same bag.
00:35:46,00:35:50,So they were looking for a way to improve the balloons.
00:35:50,00:35:52,"And there was this family, the Weinling family."
00:35:52,00:35:55,They were a family of orthodox Jews that came from Alsace in France.
00:35:55,00:36:00,And they had their own effectively secret proprietary method of making these balloons.
00:36:00,00:36:06,"And they'd made some for a scientific toy shop in the east end of London, which is called Mr. Herons."
00:36:06,00:36:11,And the commander of the first royal balloon factory was called Major Templar.
00:36:11,00:36:14,"He hired the Weinling family, he bought their secret effectively."
00:36:14,00:36:18,"And then for a few decades, Britain had this big advantage in balloon technology,"
00:36:18,00:36:23,because the Weinlings were on board and they were kind of supervising the first balloon factory.
00:36:23,00:36:26,"They had to be persuaded to tell other people how to make the balloons,"
00:36:26,00:36:28,"because they originally, it seems like they wanted to make the balloons themselves."
00:36:28,00:36:31,"""We'll do it all, we'll do it all, we just don't want to tell anyone."""
00:36:31,00:36:32,I can understand that.
00:36:32,00:36:35,"It's pretty amazing as well that, so it was a guy called Henry Coxwell,"
00:36:35,00:36:38,who was walking through this scientific toy shop and saw this thing.
00:36:38,00:36:43,"Can you imagine like during the war effort, you're looking for ways and suddenly here's just a toy for kids,"
00:36:43,00:36:47,that is going to give you the great advantage of the war.
00:36:47,00:36:50,"And what did the toy do? It was like, it was like a little hot air balloon."
00:36:50,00:36:51,"It was a balloon, yeah, yeah."
00:36:51,00:36:52,"And it worked basically, wow."
00:36:52,00:36:55,And the method that they used was a thing called gold beater skin.
00:36:55,00:36:58,"So it's used, it's made from the lower intestine of a cow."
00:36:58,00:37:02,And what they would do is they would stretch out the lower intestine.
00:37:02,00:37:07,"And because as you were saying Andy, the nothing could escape, molecules can escape is what they found."
00:37:07,00:37:11,"What's amazing is that when they were, when they make the balloon itself,"
00:37:11,00:37:13,you wouldn't sew it together.
00:37:13,00:37:18,So sewing might be a problem because there's micro holes that if you miss whatever something can escape.
00:37:18,00:37:22,"But with this intestine skin, all you had to do was make it a bit wet, a bit damp,"
00:37:22,00:37:24,and then it would just stick.
00:37:24,00:37:27,And that would be strong enough to make it so cool.
00:37:27,00:37:30,It's overlapping and it just...
00:37:30,00:37:33,"Guys, how did the Wylings find this out?"
00:37:33,00:37:41,"Like, I'm sorry, how did this one family be like, oh, you know that cow intestine we've got hanging around?"
00:37:41,00:37:46,"Let's stretch it out, dry it and put like, what was going on in that family?"
00:37:46,00:37:48,"It's Mikey's birthday, have we got balloons?"
00:37:48,00:37:51,"Sorry, that's what made me laugh so much because it's amazing."
00:37:51,00:37:53,It's like really amazing what they did and discovered.
00:37:53,00:37:56,But what was going on in Alsace?
00:37:56,00:38:01,"Well, they were already using this stuff for gold-beating, which is why it's called gold-beater skin, right?"
00:38:01,00:38:03,But why are they using it in gold-beating?
00:38:03,00:38:08,"So you would put your gold in between two pieces of intestine or paper or whatever,"
00:38:08,00:38:12,"and then you would whack it, whack it, whack it to make it really, really, really, really thin."
00:38:12,00:38:15,And so then you would have gold leaf instead of a gold bar.
00:38:15,00:38:18,"Oh, and that's why it still comes in as two bits of paper, the gold leaf."
00:38:18,00:38:19,"It does, yeah."
00:38:19,00:38:20,Do you buy gold leaf?
00:38:20,00:38:26,"You can buy it, like for decorating, people use it for like, if you want to do like a gold effect on tables or on food or..."
00:38:26,00:38:28,I've had biscuits covered in silver.
00:38:28,00:38:30,That's the blue.
00:38:30,00:38:32,Silver what?
00:38:32,00:38:33,They're Indian.
00:38:33,00:38:35,"Oh, it's silver leaf, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:38:35,00:38:37,"They're popular, it's not..."
00:38:37,00:38:39,"Sorry, I thought it was like an emperor there."
00:38:39,00:38:42,He's doing well with his silver biscuits and two knockers.
00:38:42,00:38:47,"But the amazing thing is about this gold-beating rate,"
00:38:47,00:38:50,"so you're making gold leaf out of a piece of gold,"
00:38:50,00:38:54,"and you could get a sheet of gold that was two millimeters thick,"
00:38:54,00:38:57,"and then knock it down, make it thinner, thinner, thinner,"
00:38:57,00:38:59,"so there was 100 nanometers, right?"
00:38:59,00:39:01,"And it's hard to say what that is,"
00:39:01,00:39:08,"but it's basically, it's like if I was squashed into a flat sheet,"
00:39:08,00:39:10,which is the thickness of a human hair.
00:39:10,00:39:12,"We're not going to do that, James."
00:39:12,00:39:14,"No, it's going to do that to you, are they?"
00:39:14,00:39:17,"You know, they get hit by a bus."
00:39:17,00:39:23,"But yeah, that's how much, they reduce the thickness of a sheet of gold by 99.996%,"
00:39:23,00:39:29,"and they do it using this paper, this ox, you know, this gold beater's paper."
00:39:29,00:39:32,"But that's the second process, to get it down to two millimeters,"
00:39:32,00:39:35,"you need to put it through a different two pieces of paper,"
00:39:35,00:39:37,"and that's called Montgolfier paper,"
00:39:37,00:39:41,and that was the same paper as the Montgolfiers used to make their balloons.
00:39:41,00:39:43,Isn't that amazing?
00:39:43,00:39:47,"So the first section of gold beating was Montgolfier paper,"
00:39:47,00:39:50,"and the second stuff was this gold beater's paper,"
00:39:50,00:39:53,"because the Montgolfiers, they came from a family of paper makers,"
00:39:53,00:39:55,"and that's how they got into hot air ballooning,"
00:39:55,00:39:58,"because they had all of this amazing paper to use,"
00:39:58,00:40:00,and they turned them into balloons.
00:40:00,00:40:01,So cool.
00:40:01,00:40:03,It's so weird how one invention leads to another.
00:40:03,00:40:04,Yeah.
00:40:04,00:40:07,"And it was, the reason I knew about this is because we talked a while ago"
00:40:07,00:40:10,"about jobs in the UK that don't exist anymore,"
00:40:10,00:40:13,"and the last gold beater I think went out in the UK,"
00:40:13,00:40:16,maybe in the last 10 to 20 years.
00:40:16,00:40:18,It feels like a very labor intensive job.
00:40:18,00:40:19,It is.
00:40:19,00:40:20,Gold beating.
00:40:20,00:40:21,"Yeah, it is."
00:40:21,00:40:24,"Also, for the size of the balloons that they were making during the war,"
00:40:24,00:40:28,"you needed a lot, so one kind of classic zeppelin"
00:40:28,00:40:32,"would require 250,000 intestines"
00:40:32,00:40:35,in order to make the size balloon that they needed in order to do it.
00:40:35,00:40:39,"Again, how did they first get the idea?"
00:40:39,00:40:40,"And it was mostly women, right?"
00:40:40,00:40:41,Yeah.
00:40:41,00:40:42,It was women doing this work.
00:40:42,00:40:43,Yeah.
00:40:43,00:40:44,The Vinling family was...
00:40:44,00:40:45,"It couldn't have been just them, right?"
00:40:45,00:40:46,They must have taught it to...
00:40:46,00:40:48,"But it was women that were doing all the work, I think."
00:40:48,00:40:49,Yeah.
00:40:49,00:40:51,"Women did the skin stretching,"
00:40:51,00:40:52,"the skin treating,"
00:40:52,00:40:53,and that factory was staffed by women.
00:40:53,00:40:56,I think it was one Fred Vinling.
00:40:56,00:40:57,"There were a couple of sons,"
00:40:57,00:40:59,but there was Mrs. Vinling and two daughters
00:40:59,00:41:01,who were the chief balloon makers for the army.
00:41:01,00:41:02,Wow.
00:41:02,00:41:04,And it was such a secret as well
00:41:04,00:41:09,"that when it eventually got seen that it was being used by the countries,"
00:41:09,00:41:11,that was seen as treason.
00:41:11,00:41:13,"And this guy, Major Templar, who was the one,"
00:41:13,00:41:15,he actually got charged with betraying military secrets
00:41:15,00:41:17,because they thought this was so secret and no one could have known it.
00:41:17,00:41:18,No.
00:41:18,00:41:21,"He was acquitted because I think they worked out that he didn't do it,"
00:41:21,00:41:24,but that's how important this was to the war effort.
00:41:24,00:41:26,But it kind of didn't matter for a few countries
00:41:26,00:41:28,because what you needed was cow and testin.
00:41:28,00:41:30,So they were being farmed in America
00:41:30,00:41:33,and they were being imported to here.
00:41:33,00:41:35,But like Germany couldn't get them because they stopped.
00:41:35,00:41:36,They have cows in Germany.
00:41:36,00:41:38,I don't think they had enough at the time.
00:41:38,00:41:40,I think we've mentioned once before that Germany had to choose
00:41:40,00:41:43,in the war between airships and sausages.
00:41:43,00:41:44,It's a hard choice to make.
00:41:44,00:41:46,You're in total war.
00:41:46,00:41:47,Your society needs to survive.
00:41:47,00:41:50,It is the worst choice to make.
00:41:50,00:41:52,Come on.
00:41:52,00:41:56,"In fact, they still lose balloons in war right now, don't they?"
00:41:56,00:42:00,"For instance, while we saw in the news with the so-called spy balloons,"
00:42:00,00:42:02,they're coming back in.
00:42:02,00:42:03,It's a new fashion trend.
00:42:03,00:42:06,"In the Ukraine war, I think both sides used balloons."
00:42:06,00:42:09,They kind of put them up there so that the other side
00:42:09,00:42:12,kind of uses a permunition trying to shoot them.
00:42:12,00:42:15,"They're just distractions really, but they are still used."
00:42:15,00:42:18,There are barrage balloons in the Second World War.
00:42:18,00:42:20,You saw images of London at war.
00:42:20,00:42:22,There are all these balloons floating over
00:42:22,00:42:25,and it's to make bombers have to fly higher to fly over them.
00:42:25,00:42:28,They have steel cables hanging down from them
00:42:28,00:42:30,so you can't fly around under them.
00:42:30,00:42:32,So they're a good air defence.
00:42:32,00:42:34,Those were largely staffed by women.
00:42:34,00:42:36,There was the Women's Auxiliary Air Force.
00:42:36,00:42:37,They were on the ground.
00:42:37,00:42:38,They would operate the winches basically
00:42:38,00:42:40,because there's no one actually up there in a barrage balloon
00:42:40,00:42:42,or hanging beneath it.
00:42:42,00:42:45,Balloon command was set up in 1938.
00:42:45,00:42:46,"Yes, please."
00:42:46,00:42:47,Even at D-Day.
00:42:47,00:42:49,"Good morning, balloon command."
00:42:49,00:42:50,What colour?
00:42:50,00:42:51,Rebel?
00:42:51,00:42:52,"Yes, plenty of those."
00:42:52,00:42:54,How old is he? Seven?
00:42:54,00:42:56,"Oh, we'll see what we can do."
00:42:56,00:42:59,D-Day had the barrage balloon battalion
00:42:59,00:43:02,who were specifically bringing to the Normandy beaches
00:43:02,00:43:03,the balloons.
00:43:03,00:43:04,Wow.
00:43:04,00:43:06,They were pre-inflated in the UK
00:43:06,00:43:10,and then sailed over to defend the men of beaches.
00:43:10,00:43:13,I think that's good because if you're in opposing territory
00:43:13,00:43:15,you don't want to be like...
00:43:15,00:43:17,Stretch it out a bit.
00:43:17,00:43:19,You're absolutely right.
00:43:19,00:43:23,"They didn't show that at the beginning of a saving private ride, did they?"
00:43:23,00:43:26,"I'm asthmatic, sir. I can't do this."
00:43:26,00:43:28,"Speaking of women in war,"
00:43:28,00:43:30,the UK's first official police woman
00:43:30,00:43:33,was Mrs Edith Smith of Grantham.
00:43:33,00:43:37,She became a sworn officer in 1915
00:43:37,00:43:40,and the Home Office weren't very happy about it
00:43:40,00:43:43,because they said that women were not proper persons.
00:43:43,00:43:44,That's what they said.
00:43:44,00:43:46,It's something we have to live with.
00:43:46,00:43:48,"I know, but this is amazing."
00:43:48,00:43:50,Quite a lot of the stuff they made her do
00:43:50,00:43:52,was spy on women on behalf of their husbands
00:43:52,00:43:54,who were away at war.
00:43:54,00:43:55,"Oh, wow."
00:43:55,00:43:57,"Wow, the power of the patriarchy."
00:43:57,00:44:00,You can work for us if you take down your own people.
00:44:00,00:44:02,I was wondering if you were having affairs.
00:44:02,00:44:03,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:03,00:44:05,Have we ever mentioned the Hello Ladies?
00:44:05,00:44:06,Hello.
00:44:06,00:44:07,Hello Ladies.
00:44:07,00:44:08,Hello Ladies.
00:44:08,00:44:10,Hello Ladies were a group of women.
00:44:10,00:44:12,They were in the battlefields of France.
00:44:12,00:44:14,They were basically the operators who connect phone calls.
00:44:14,00:44:16,"The telephone operating ladies, yeah."
00:44:16,00:44:18,We were doing it on the front lines.
00:44:18,00:44:19,"Oh, wow."
00:44:19,00:44:20,"And so while being bombed,"
00:44:20,00:44:21,just connecting these phone lines
00:44:21,00:44:24,to make sure that these crucial calls could be made back.
00:44:24,00:44:25,"And at the height of it,"
00:44:25,00:44:29,"the Hello Girls were connecting 150,000 calls a day."
00:44:29,00:44:33,And there was 223 in total that were doing that.
00:44:33,00:44:34,That's doing tons.
00:44:34,00:44:35,"Yeah, yeah."
00:44:35,00:44:36,It's crazy.
00:44:36,00:44:37,But a lot of those were calls being made
00:44:37,00:44:39,to a policewoman in Grantham.
00:44:39,00:44:41,"Okay, what's she doing now?"
00:44:41,00:44:43,"Well, did they look like they were friends"
00:44:43,00:44:46,or did they look like it was more serious?
00:44:46,00:44:49,"Yeah, and they annoyingly, after the war,"
00:44:49,00:44:52,they weren't considered for veteran status and benefits
00:44:52,00:44:54,because they weren't seen as part of the military.
00:44:54,00:44:56,And it took until 1977.
00:44:56,00:44:57,"Oh, my God."
00:44:57,00:44:59,The petitioning presidents constantly to get them
00:44:59,00:45:01,any kind of compensation.
00:45:01,00:45:02,But they finally did it.
00:45:02,00:45:04,But they were essential to the war of the Hello Girls.
00:45:04,00:45:05,"Yeah, you were there."
00:45:05,00:45:07,"You know, yeah, you were at the front line."
00:45:07,00:45:08,"You weren't there, though."
00:45:08,00:45:11,"You were exactly, oh, my God, that's awful."
00:45:11,00:45:13,I've just got one more fact about balloons.
00:45:13,00:45:14,"Yeah, go on."
00:45:14,00:45:17,There has only ever been one balloon hit-and-run accident
00:45:17,00:45:18,in the UK.
00:45:18,00:45:19,"Okay, amazing."
00:45:19,00:45:20,2004.
00:45:20,00:45:21,Yes.
00:45:21,00:45:22,Are we talking hot air balloons?
00:45:22,00:45:23,Yeah.
00:45:23,00:45:24,Wow.
00:45:24,00:45:25,"Okam, Cumbria."
00:45:25,00:45:29,Retired couple sitting in their cottage having a nice time.
00:45:29,00:45:32,"Suddenly, bang, hot air balloon."
00:45:32,00:45:33,Someone stole the chimney.
00:45:33,00:45:37,Smashes into their chimney and their roof and then flies off.
00:45:37,00:45:38,"Oh, my God."
00:45:38,00:45:39,I know.
00:45:39,00:45:40,"It was blue, yellow and red."
00:45:40,00:45:45,"I'm going to say, in defence of whoever this was, if you're flying over,"
00:45:45,00:45:49,"I used to live in there, if you're flying over and you're out of control enough"
00:45:49,00:45:53,"that you hit a chimney, you're probably out of control enough that you can't stop."
00:45:53,00:45:55,"To leave you details, yeah."
00:45:55,00:45:58,It's quite dangerous because around there they have quite a lot of ministry
00:45:58,00:46:00,of difference flights they practice around there.
00:46:00,00:46:01,Do they?
00:46:01,00:46:02,Yeah.
00:46:02,00:46:06,"Well, it's the only known, known balloon hit-and-run ever."
00:46:06,00:46:07,They never found.
00:46:07,00:46:08,They still never...
00:46:08,00:46:09,I didn't find a follow-up to the story.
00:46:09,00:46:10,Maybe they did.
00:46:10,00:46:12,"So, that's interesting because only a couple of days ago,"
00:46:12,00:46:16,I watched a video on Instagram of a hot air balloon coming in close to it.
00:46:16,00:46:22,"There's a whole group of people picnicking on the side of, in this grassy bit of a hill."
00:46:22,00:46:24,And they all turn around and look at it.
00:46:24,00:46:25,Everyone gets up and they're filming it.
00:46:25,00:46:27,And it just keeps descending and keeps descending.
00:46:27,00:46:30,And it suddenly hits the ground and mows through all of them.
00:46:30,00:46:31,They're all diving out the way.
00:46:31,00:46:32,"Oh, my God."
00:46:32,00:46:33,All their chairs go through.
00:46:33,00:46:34,No one's hit.
00:46:34,00:46:35,Everyone's okay.
00:46:35,00:46:37,And it takes off again and disappears off into the distance.
00:46:37,00:46:39,And I don't know if they got their details later.
00:46:39,00:46:41,So that might not count as a hit-and-run.
00:46:41,00:46:44,But could you claim a picnic over a chimney?
00:46:44,00:46:46,My picnic was ruined.
00:46:46,00:46:48,"If they put everything back together,"
00:46:48,00:46:51,they noticed there was one sausage roll missing.
00:46:51,00:46:53,Just grab it on the way out.
00:46:53,00:46:54,Just left a sausage skin.
00:46:54,00:46:55,Make your own balloon.
00:46:55,00:47:05,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:47:05,00:47:06,And that is my fact.
00:47:06,00:47:09,My fact this week is that Orson Welles's nose
00:47:09,00:47:12,rarely made appearances in his movies.
00:47:12,00:47:13,Wow.
00:47:13,00:47:15,Can you give me some of his movies?
00:47:15,00:47:16,Yeah.
00:47:16,00:47:17,Citizen Kane is perhaps...
00:47:17,00:47:19,I've seen the Citizen Kane.
00:47:19,00:47:22,But I don't remember any noseless men in that.
00:47:22,00:47:23,"Well, he was never noseless."
00:47:23,00:47:24,Oh.
00:47:24,00:47:25,"He never, yeah."
00:47:25,00:47:26,He didn't...
00:47:26,00:47:28,"I mean, people would talk about Citizen Kane"
00:47:28,00:47:31,in a different way if there was no nose on his face.
00:47:31,00:47:33,Like he spends his whole time lusting over.
00:47:33,00:47:34,What was it?
00:47:34,00:47:35,Rosebud.
00:47:35,00:47:36,He'd been memorialising Rosebud.
00:47:36,00:47:38,He'd be memorialising his nose.
00:47:38,00:47:39,"Closebud, will I?"
00:47:39,00:47:40,No!
00:47:40,00:47:41,Thank you.
00:47:41,00:47:43,I nearly started watching Citizen Kane last night.
00:47:43,00:47:44,Have you not seen it?
00:47:44,00:47:45,"No, I got quite tired."
00:47:45,00:47:46,It's incredible.
00:47:46,00:47:47,It's incredible.
00:47:47,00:47:48,"Why, the only one who hasn't?"
00:47:48,00:47:49,Yeah.
00:47:49,00:47:51,"Oh, the worm turns and builds his little nest down."
00:47:51,00:47:53,"Sorry, I'll keep going with that."
00:47:53,00:47:55,He builds his little nest down and then realises
00:47:55,00:47:57,this is full of shit from a ground on.
00:47:57,00:47:58,Carries on.
00:47:58,00:48:00,Actually absorbs it because that's his deal.
00:48:00,00:48:02,Have you caught what Citizen Kane is?
00:48:02,00:48:03,It's classic.
00:48:03,00:48:04,I've seen a couple of his.
00:48:04,00:48:05,What have you seen?
00:48:05,00:48:06,The Magnificent Ambersons.
00:48:06,00:48:07,"Oh, I haven't seen that."
00:48:07,00:48:08,Very much a B-side these days.
00:48:08,00:48:09,"Oh, okay."
00:48:09,00:48:10,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:48:10,00:48:11,It is great.
00:48:11,00:48:14,"The third man, which he did direct, he just is in."
00:48:14,00:48:15,Yeah.
00:48:15,00:48:17,"Oh, sorry, but he was such a direct, yeah."
00:48:17,00:48:18,"Yeah, yeah, that's okay."
00:48:18,00:48:20,"So, for the people that don't know, Orson Welles,"
00:48:20,00:48:22,Citizen Kane is often regarded as one of the
00:48:22,00:48:23,greatest movies ever made.
00:48:23,00:48:25,I actually was surprised I went onto IMDb.
00:48:25,00:48:27,I expected to see it behind Shawshank Redemption.
00:48:27,00:48:29,It was actually 95 on the top 100 list.
00:48:29,00:48:31,"But I think, you know, there's three Avengers movies"
00:48:31,00:48:33,in that top 100 ahead of it.
00:48:33,00:48:35,"So, I think that's been answered."
00:48:35,00:48:36,"Yeah, you went onto IMDb."
00:48:36,00:48:38,I think you'd check like Guardians Top Films.
00:48:38,00:48:39,"Yeah, exactly."
00:48:39,00:48:41,It was the Paddington two of its day.
00:48:41,00:48:42,Yeah.
00:48:42,00:48:43,It really was.
00:48:43,00:48:44,It absolutely was.
00:48:44,00:48:46,"Orson Welles was, as Andy says, he was a director."
00:48:46,00:48:47,He was a writer.
00:48:47,00:48:48,He was an actor.
00:48:48,00:48:51,"He went from radio to stage to film, doing iconic"
00:48:51,00:48:52,things in every single place.
00:48:52,00:48:57,He supposedly created a national terror when he did
00:48:57,00:48:59,War of the Worlds on radio.
00:48:59,00:49:02,That's been mythologized to be a lot worse than it
00:49:02,00:49:03,actually was.
00:49:03,00:49:05,"People, you know, claiming they thought aliens were"
00:49:05,00:49:07,"really invading, were really kind of newspapers"
00:49:07,00:49:08,just bumping that up.
00:49:08,00:49:11,But one thing about him is that for someone who was
00:49:11,00:49:15,so confident and he was known to be so balshy and
00:49:15,00:49:18,"people would talk about his rage and his passion,"
00:49:18,00:49:20,one thing he was absolutely insecure about was
00:49:20,00:49:22,"the size of his nose, which he thought hadn't"
00:49:22,00:49:24,really grown since childhood.
00:49:24,00:49:26,"And so every single movie that he did, except"
00:49:26,00:49:28,"basically for one movie, as far as I can tell,"
00:49:28,00:49:31,"which was The Third Man, he always had prosthetics"
00:49:31,00:49:35,"on his nose and sometimes applying it himself,"
00:49:35,00:49:37,there's an account by a guy called Lewis Gilbert
00:49:37,00:49:39,who was a director and he did a movie with him
00:49:39,00:49:42,in 1959 called Fairy to Hong Kong.
00:49:42,00:49:45,And he said that basically he would do his own nose
00:49:45,00:49:47,and the problem was that his nose would be quite
00:49:47,00:49:48,different shot to shot.
00:49:48,00:49:51,"Yeah, they said it was like wonky or green or..."
00:49:51,00:49:53,"Yeah, sometimes it was tilting upwards, sometimes"
00:49:53,00:49:54,it was tilting downwards.
00:49:54,00:49:56,Occasionally it just went sideways.
00:49:56,00:49:59,It was not a consistent nose for the entire movie.
00:49:59,00:50:02,"Yeah, I read one quote saying he said his nose had"
00:50:02,00:50:05,"not grown one millimeter since infancy,"
00:50:05,00:50:08,which I don't believe it.
00:50:08,00:50:09,Exactly.
00:50:09,00:50:11,There's no way he had an actual baby's nose.
00:50:11,00:50:13,"I felt bad though, because when you do look at"
00:50:13,00:50:15,"it, I was like, what? No, he doesn't."
00:50:15,00:50:17,"And then I saw a picture of him without it and I was like,"
00:50:17,00:50:18,I guess it is small.
00:50:18,00:50:20,"I think it doesn't fit his personality,"
00:50:20,00:50:23,because he was known for being this like huge
00:50:23,00:50:26,"raconteur, character like absolute,"
00:50:26,00:50:30,almost I guess Brian Blessed style like fill the room.
00:50:30,00:50:32,"It doesn't, you expect him to have a much bigger"
00:50:32,00:50:35,features and the rest of his features are quite big.
00:50:35,00:50:37,Not there's anything wrong with having a small nose.
00:50:37,00:50:40,"He allegedly, he kept every fake nose."
00:50:40,00:50:42,And he had a glass case for each one.
00:50:42,00:50:43,And he also gave them all names.
00:50:43,00:50:47,That's quite common in a prosthetic and wig
00:50:47,00:50:48,world on TV.
00:50:48,00:50:50,They sometimes give them names.
00:50:50,00:50:51,Really?
00:50:51,00:50:52,"Yeah, I don't know why."
00:50:52,00:50:54,I guess because often you have to look after a wig.
00:50:54,00:50:56,Like wash it and preen it and stuff.
00:50:56,00:50:57,So you would give it.
00:50:57,00:50:58,It's not uncommon to give it a name.
00:50:58,00:51:01,"Kerry, you've done a lot of sketch comedy on TV."
00:51:01,00:51:03,Or sort of shows where you were a comedy character
00:51:03,00:51:05,"playing a celebrity, like murder and success."
00:51:05,00:51:06,Oh yeah.
00:51:06,00:51:08,Have you ever worn a prosthetic nose?
00:51:08,00:51:10,"Yeah, I have."
00:51:10,00:51:11,I'm trying to think now.
00:51:11,00:51:13,"I had to wear loads for murder successful,"
00:51:13,00:51:14,but I can't remember which one.
00:51:14,00:51:18,"I think for Cheryl Cole, I had to wear a prosthetic nose."
00:51:18,00:51:22,I think we called it Cheryl to be fair.
00:51:22,00:51:23,He didn't call them the actual names.
00:51:23,00:51:24,He looked very weird.
00:51:24,00:51:26,He was in a film called Touch of Evil.
00:51:26,00:51:27,Oh yes.
00:51:27,00:51:28,One of his classics.
00:51:28,00:51:29,One of his classics.
00:51:29,00:51:30,He knows from that it's called Sandra.
00:51:30,00:51:33,"Oh, they always women's names."
00:51:33,00:51:36,One of the King Lear one was called Sloan Jr.
00:51:36,00:51:38,So I don't know if there's a character called
00:51:38,00:51:40,"Sandra in Touch of Evil, but there's no character"
00:51:40,00:51:42,called Sloan Jr. in King Lear.
00:51:42,00:51:44,"No, it's Gona Roll's brother."
00:51:44,00:51:46,"And actually when he was making that film,"
00:51:46,00:51:48,I think they lost his nose halfway through production
00:51:48,00:51:51,and it had been posted and it hadn't come through.
00:51:51,00:51:53,And they basically halted production on this big Hollywood film
00:51:53,00:51:56,while they searched every post office in Hong Kong for...
00:51:56,00:51:57,To find his nose.
00:51:57,00:51:58,And also was his father.
00:51:58,00:51:59,It was called Dickhead.
00:51:59,00:52:01,His name was Richard Hedwells.
00:52:01,00:52:02,I want to say that.
00:52:02,00:52:03,Wow.
00:52:03,00:52:04,Yeah.
00:52:04,00:52:05,Dick Hedwells.
00:52:05,00:52:07,And he's pretty cool.
00:52:07,00:52:08,Also was his father.
00:52:08,00:52:11,He was a kind of inventor and an engineer.
00:52:11,00:52:12,He invented a glider.
00:52:12,00:52:13,Get this.
00:52:13,00:52:17,Which was attached to a steam engine on the ground.
00:52:17,00:52:18,Okay.
00:52:18,00:52:20,So it's a plane whose engine is on the ground.
00:52:20,00:52:22,The plane flies up there and then...
00:52:22,00:52:23,You know what it feels like?
00:52:23,00:52:24,What?
00:52:24,00:52:26,You would have angular momentum on it.
00:52:26,00:52:27,"If you just try to go forward,"
00:52:27,00:52:29,you'd end up going in a circle like those fairground rides.
00:52:29,00:52:30,"Yeah, yeah."
00:52:30,00:52:31,Maybe.
00:52:31,00:52:32,But it did not work.
00:52:32,00:52:34,"Well, maybe it worked, but it didn't..."
00:52:34,00:52:35,Didn't catch up.
00:52:35,00:52:37,It didn't take off.
00:52:37,00:52:41,"Dan, you mentioned the War of the Whales thing."
00:52:41,00:52:42,Yeah.
00:52:42,00:52:45,He came a bit depressed afterwards because he said that
00:52:45,00:52:47,he had two lots of friends.
00:52:47,00:52:51,One lot of friends had heard the recording and one lot hadn't.
00:52:51,00:52:54,And anyone who'd heard it would want to tell him everything
00:52:54,00:52:55,what they thought about it.
00:52:55,00:52:58,And anyone who hadn't heard it would tell him tediously
00:52:58,00:53:02,why they hadn't been near a wireless on the day.
00:53:02,00:53:05,So that everyone he spoke to all wanted to speak to him about that.
00:53:05,00:53:07,Is that like how you guys feel?
00:53:07,00:53:09,"Like people just come up to you with facts or they go,"
00:53:09,00:53:11,"""I've never definitely not only into podcasts."""
00:53:11,00:53:14,"A lot more of the latter than the former, I have to say."
00:53:14,00:53:16,I read an interview with him from 1939 and he said
00:53:16,00:53:19,that no one has said anything original about that broadcast
00:53:19,00:53:21,for at least nine months.
00:53:21,00:53:22,Wow.
00:53:22,00:53:26,There's a weird coincidence which is that H.G. Wells was in America
00:53:26,00:53:28,and he was driving around and he got lost.
00:53:28,00:53:31,"And so he pulls over and he goes, ""Excuse me,"
00:53:31,00:53:34,"so can you help me to find where I'm going?"""
00:53:34,00:53:35,And it's Orson Wells.
00:53:35,00:53:38,And they established that each other each other.
00:53:38,00:53:40,And this was not long after Orson Wells had done
00:53:40,00:53:41,the War of the Worlds.
00:53:41,00:53:44,"But of course he wasn't a big face back then, Orson Wells."
00:53:44,00:53:45,He was a radio guy.
00:53:45,00:53:47,"He wasn't a big nose, that's for sure."
00:53:47,00:53:49,"You know, he couldn't have gone like,"
00:53:49,00:53:51,"""Oh, I'm going to pretend I don't know who Orson Wells is."""
00:53:51,00:53:54,I wonder if H.G. Wells was recognizable.
00:53:54,00:53:56,Quite possibly from the back of books.
00:53:56,00:53:58,Were people just less recognizable back in the day?
00:53:58,00:53:59,"Yeah, I guess so."
00:53:59,00:54:00,"You didn't have more, you didn't have"
00:54:00,00:54:02,author jacket photos in the same way that you do these days.
00:54:02,00:54:03,"And as we know,"
00:54:03,00:54:05,author jacket photos are not representative of what someone
00:54:05,00:54:06,looks like in real life.
00:54:06,00:54:07,Excuse me?
00:54:07,00:54:09,Holding up my book.
00:54:09,00:54:11,"Okay, yours is, but most people are not."
00:54:11,00:54:12,Thank you.
00:54:12,00:54:15,I also read some newspaper articles from the day
00:54:15,00:54:18,after the recording went out.
00:54:18,00:54:20,"To see, you know, did it happen?"
00:54:20,00:54:22,"Or, you know, was this kind of craziness?"
00:54:22,00:54:23,Did it exist?
00:54:23,00:54:26,"And the Journal Times, I read,"
00:54:26,00:54:29,they collected articles from all over America
00:54:29,00:54:30,about what had happened.
00:54:30,00:54:33,And they said that Senator Clyde Herring of Iowa
00:54:33,00:54:36,had called for more regulation of the press
00:54:36,00:54:39,as a result of everyone thinking that the Martians
00:54:39,00:54:41,"had attacked, which is pretty typical."
00:54:41,00:54:42,"Apparently in New York,"
00:54:42,00:54:44,"one person had called the police and said,"
00:54:44,00:54:47,"""I want a gas mask. I'm a taxpayer."""
00:54:47,00:54:50,And the police had said that that had definitely happened.
00:54:50,00:54:52,"And there was a town of concrete,"
00:54:52,00:54:54,which is in Washington state.
00:54:54,00:54:56,And apparently there was a power cut just at the moment
00:54:56,00:54:59,the Martians put their death rays into action.
00:54:59,00:55:01,And this was reported the day after it went out.
00:55:01,00:55:03,So I think it did happen.
00:55:03,00:55:04,"But the thing was like,"
00:55:04,00:55:06,they did advertise that it was fiction.
00:55:06,00:55:08,-They said right at the top. -Yeah.
00:55:08,00:55:10,"Awesome Wells comes on at the start and says,"
00:55:10,00:55:11,"""This is fictional."""
00:55:11,00:55:13,"And then they had four times in the middle,"
00:55:13,00:55:15,"they said, ""Just to remind you all, this is fictional."""
00:55:15,00:55:17,"And then at the end, he comes on and says,"
00:55:17,00:55:19,"""By the way, that was a play you just listened to."""
00:55:19,00:55:21,There was a good Radio 4 documentary
00:55:21,00:55:23,about what happened and how to...
00:55:23,00:55:26,"I mean, there were people who obviously did lose their mind."
00:55:26,00:55:28,"-But it's a tempting myth. -Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:55:28,00:55:30,Like the five stages.
00:55:30,00:55:32,"Oh, guys."
00:55:32,00:55:35,Like it's nice to believe that that would be true.
00:55:35,00:55:37,"Yeah, it's just kind of nice to believe"
00:55:37,00:55:39,that people back in the day were so stupid
00:55:39,00:55:41,they didn't understand radio.
00:55:41,00:55:43,"""Oh, we've come a long way, we understand radio now."""
00:55:43,00:55:45,Wells...
00:55:45,00:55:48,"So, Dan, you mentioned his most famous film appearance, maybe."
00:55:48,00:55:50,And certainly maybe the one he's most famous for these days
00:55:50,00:55:52,"is in The Third Man, where he..."
00:55:52,00:55:54,"It's in Vienna, it's after the Second World War,"
00:55:54,00:55:56,and it's an amazing...
00:55:56,00:55:58,That is unmissable.
00:55:58,00:56:01,"And there's a big scene, there's a scene in the sewers of Vienna"
00:56:01,00:56:04,"where they're chasing, he's playing this mysterious"
00:56:04,00:56:08,"sort of black market dealer and, you know, crook."
00:56:08,00:56:11,"And he's very, very dodgy."
00:56:11,00:56:14,"But they did the filming in the sewers of Vienna,"
00:56:14,00:56:16,and they all went down there.
00:56:16,00:56:18,"They were actually very clean in lots of places,"
00:56:18,00:56:20,and the director had his coffee brought down to him
00:56:20,00:56:23,on a silver tray by a waiter from one of the old Viennese cafes.
00:56:23,00:56:26,"You know, the only person who refused to go down into the sewers..."
00:56:26,00:56:28,-Awesome Wells. -Awesome Wells.
00:56:28,00:56:32,And they had to build a fake sewer in Sheperton.
00:56:32,00:56:33,Wow.
00:56:33,00:56:35,"Is that the famous shot of him, though, in that really, like,"
00:56:35,00:56:37,"the really white circle, and it's him in it?"
00:56:37,00:56:39,"It's either a body double, or it's Sheperton,"
00:56:39,00:56:42,and everyone else had filmed their bits in Vienna.
00:56:42,00:56:43,"Yeah, I know, but..."
00:56:43,00:56:45,He wouldn't have been able to smell it anyway with his...
00:56:45,00:56:47,"Yeah, he certainly knows."
00:56:47,00:56:49,"I mean, he was at, like, I can't remember what film it was,"
00:56:49,00:56:51,"but it was filmed in the Deep South, and that actress was quoted as saying,"
00:56:51,00:56:54,"like, it was so hot and sweaty that his nose was, like, falling off."
00:56:54,00:56:56,My nose is running.
00:56:57,00:56:59,"But, like, he was..."
00:56:59,00:57:01,"If he was a woman, he'd be called a diva."
00:57:01,00:57:03,"Like, the things he would refuse to do."
00:57:03,00:57:05,"-He was a divo. -He was a divo, yeah."
00:57:05,00:57:08,"And the guy... I think it's the guy who plays Yago, or Casio,"
00:57:08,00:57:11,wrote a whole book about the experience of filming a fellow
00:57:11,00:57:13,"of, like, how insane and awful it was."
00:57:13,00:57:16,"Like, that was his... kind of made his money on this."
00:57:16,00:57:18,"Yeah, called Casio."
00:57:18,00:57:21,"Yeah. So, one that loves Desmondo and starts off all the trouble."
00:57:21,00:57:23,"He's the one who has that great line, ""Beep."" Yeah?"
00:57:25,00:57:29,"Yes, Andrew. Yes, fellow English literature scholar, yes."
00:57:29,00:57:31,"Oh, apparently when he was directing Othello..."
00:57:31,00:57:34,"-Was that a film? -Othello's a film, yeah, yeah."
00:57:34,00:57:36,"Yeah, it's a great film. It's really interesting."
00:57:36,00:57:39,"I think he might have also staged a stage version of Othello,"
00:57:39,00:57:41,"because apparently when he was directing that,"
00:57:41,00:57:44,"he would push the actors around the stage with a 20-foot pole,"
00:57:44,00:57:49,"shouting, ""To hell with the method! This is the Wells Way! Act, you sons of bitches!"""
00:57:49,00:57:52,Amazing. Do you know where Orson Wells is buried?
00:57:52,00:57:54,-No. -No.
00:57:54,00:57:56,He's buried...
00:57:56,00:57:58,"-Yeah, could we guess? -Yeah, have a guess."
00:57:58,00:58:00,-Oh. -Oh.
00:58:00,00:58:02,This is the most famous cemetery I could think of.
00:58:02,00:58:04,"-That's in Paris. -Okay, let me rephrase..."
00:58:04,00:58:06,"No, no, no, no, no. You'll like this."
00:58:06,00:58:09,"You'll like this. I'm going to rephrase the question,"
00:58:09,00:58:11,because this is actually the wrong angle.
00:58:11,00:58:14,"Remember a few weeks ago, when we had Sarah Pasco on,"
00:58:14,00:58:17,we talked about the guy who invented Pringles being buried in a Pringles...
00:58:17,00:58:19,-Tube. -Tube.
00:58:19,00:58:22,"Okay. So, where is Orson Wells buried?"
00:58:22,00:58:25,-In a film canister. -In a film canister.
00:58:25,00:58:27,"-In the Hollywood Hills. -Oh, that's very good."
00:58:27,00:58:30,He's in the Hollywood sign. They poured him in.
00:58:30,00:58:32,-Into the O. -Into the O.
00:58:32,00:58:35,"Oh, yeah, yeah, all the three, guys."
00:58:35,00:58:37,-In a well. -Orson Wells is in a well.
00:58:37,00:58:39,-Is it? -He's in a well.
00:58:39,00:58:41,James got it. James got it.
00:58:41,00:58:43,-No way. -He's buried.
00:58:43,00:58:45,This is years after his death.
00:58:45,00:58:48,"His daughter brought the ashes of him to Malaga in Spain,"
00:58:48,00:58:51,"to a place called Ronda, where he's now on the property"
00:58:51,00:58:55,of a retired bullfighter who he really liked.
00:58:55,00:58:57,-I've been to Ronda quite recently. -Have you?
00:58:57,00:58:59,Yeah. That's the end of the anecdote.
00:58:59,00:59:01,Okay. Orson Wells is in a well.
00:59:01,00:59:03,-Wow. -In Malaga.
00:59:03,00:59:05,"Yeah. Lovely city, Malaga."
00:59:05,00:59:07,Is that the end of the anecdote?
00:59:07,00:59:09,"It's surprising, because you think, like,"
00:59:09,00:59:12,"you associated with Package Holiday especially,"
00:59:12,00:59:13,since he's really nice.
00:59:13,00:59:18,"It's incredible. The cathedral is called La Manquita, I think,"
00:59:18,00:59:20,which means the woman with one arm.
00:59:20,00:59:22,"And it's because it's got two towers, the cathedral,"
00:59:22,00:59:24,but only one of them was completed.
00:59:24,00:59:26,-Wow. -So one of them is shorter than the other.
00:59:26,00:59:28,"-Simon Callow, the actor. -Yes."
00:59:28,00:59:31,"He is maybe one of the biggest wells experts on the planet,"
00:59:31,00:59:34,because he's currently writing a biography of Orson Wells.
00:59:34,00:59:37,"He started working on it in 1989,"
00:59:37,00:59:39,when Orson Wells had been dead a few years.
00:59:39,00:59:41,"He thought, ""I'll do two volumes, take about three years."
00:59:41,00:59:43,"1992, be done."" Great."
00:59:43,00:59:45,Book one was published in 1995.
00:59:45,00:59:47,"Okay, took a bit longer. Fine."
00:59:47,00:59:49,"Book one, fine. Book two."
00:59:49,00:59:51,Volume two was in 2006.
00:59:51,00:59:53,"Volume three came out in 2015,"
00:59:53,00:59:55,and he's now working on volume four.
00:59:55,00:59:57,-Wow. -It's such a huge project.
00:59:57,00:59:59,He's saying he's done other stuff in between.
00:59:59,01:00:01,[laughter]
01:00:01,01:00:03,Four weddings and a few roles in there at some point.
01:00:03,01:00:05,-He's a busy man. -Pop idol.
01:00:05,01:00:07,"-Is that him? -No, no, no, no."
01:00:07,01:00:09,Who among us doesn't make that mistake?
01:00:09,01:00:10,I always make that mistake.
01:00:10,01:00:12,"When it goes to him at the Judges' Chair,"
01:00:12,01:00:14,"he's surrounded by books on wells,"
01:00:14,01:00:16,and he's conducting interviews.
01:00:16,01:00:18,[music playing]
