WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's episode of Fish, we wanted to

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.540
 let you know that our special guest this week is none other than Cariad Lloyd. Cariad has

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.560
 been on the show before, of course, you may remember her very funny previous appearances.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.120
 This time she's back and she's better than ever. And the good news for those of you who

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.600
 are Cariad fans is that she has just written a new book. Cariad is the host of the Grief

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.920
 cast and the book that she's written is all about grief. It's about her grief, about

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.960
 other peoples, about what we do when someone we love dies and it's brilliant. It's full

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.200
 of interesting facts for those of you who like facts and if you are listening to this

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.400
 you probably do. And it's also very heartfelt, it's very personal, it's very moving, it's

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.560
 very funny, it's all of these things and more so do check it out, it's called You Are

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.680
 Not Alone. And if you'd like to see Cariad in a live setting she is also part of the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.960
 brilliant Jane Austen themed improvised comedy group, Ostentatious. And they are on every

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.520
 Monday at the moment at the Arts Theatre just near Leicester Square in London. It's a very

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.520
 funny show, I can personally attest to that. Do book first. Okay, that's it. On with the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 show.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.760
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.140
 to you from the relocated QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.820
 with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Cariad Lloyd and once again we have gathered

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.120
 around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in a particular

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.160
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Cariad.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.280
 Hello, my fact is that if you are having trouble with your grief it might be Bill Murray's

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.280
 fault.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.360
 Oh, because he kills again.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.320
 And then he finds people who are grieving and he hits them, that's his thing. No, because

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.360
 I should backtrack this and say that the reason it might be Bill Murray's fault is the very

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.960
 famous film Groundhog Day which is based on the five stages of grief theory. The five stages

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.120
 of grief theory is a very, very famous theory, began in 1969, created by Elizabeth Kubler-Ross

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.160
 in her book On Death and Dying and it really has been the most famous grief theory since

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.820
 then. It has now contested heavily, it's considered not to be that helpful or useful, but it's

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.560
 still the grief that most people encounter when they enter the world of grief. It's the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.960
 thing that people will come up to me still and say, "Oh, you know, I'm trying to do the

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.080
 five stages, it's not really working." And it makes me want to scream because it's, I

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.280
 can swear, I can't, yeah. It's bullshit. But the film Groundhog Day is based on the five

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.080
 stages which I think helps to promote this idea that the five stages of grief is something

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.000
 that you can work through. Grief is something that will end.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.400
 Can you give us the five stages?

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.000
 I can, man, give you the five stages.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.040
 You wake up, you wake up, they're playing the same song as they were yesterday.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.160
 Something about a weather report, I haven't seen this film. James, genuinely, have you

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.160
 not seen Groundhog Day?

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.160
 I'm afraid not.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.120
 Oh, you know what? It is worth, it is one of those that does stand up to watching.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.120
 Yeah, no.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.680
 James hasn't seen any films before about 2000 and...

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.680
 Something like that. Well, I've seen some.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.200
 There's a few that make it through.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.840
 Normally, I'm absolutely fine when you say you haven't seen a particular film and sometimes

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.440
 you'll say, "You want that? I'm shocked."

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.440
 Groundhog Day.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.440
 Groundhog Day's one of these.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.400
 I don't think it's like, I haven't seen that on TV much. Is it on TV all the time?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.320
 In my childhood it was a classic. It was one of those ones that would be on all the time.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.160
 That was in Australia. So, okay, I reckon it's Denial.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.280
 Oh, yeah, Acceptance.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.760
 Denial of the next subject.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.520
 And that is where people struggle.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.800
 No, the five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance or the

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.400
 worst boy band in your life, basically.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.800
 Yeah. And so that was Elizabeth Kubleros who defined these five stages of grief.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.120
 But isn't she, I thought that when she came up with it, first off, it was to relate to

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.640
 the dying as opposed to grief.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.640
 Yes, yes.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.320
 But then secondly, she also said this doesn't happen in any particular order. It's much

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.760
 like the facts on our podcast.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.760
 Yes.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.560
 You can have acceptance, but then later have denial.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.560
 Well, they always start with the celebrity, don't they?

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.560
 Yes, sir.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.920
 So, on her book on Death and Dying, written in 1969, written in 10 weeks, she had something

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.920
 like an article in Time magazine where they were like, "Wow, this woman's doing amazing

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.800
 work." And then someone was like, "You should write a book." And she wrote the book and

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.080
 it became the best seller that it is.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.080
 Yeah.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.640
 I mean, you can write a book fast. It doesn't mean it will be bad. It's just like, it's

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.400
 very of its moment, of its time.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.240
 She was an amazing woman. She was a founder of the hospice movement. She was working with

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.320
 people with AIDS in the 80s before that was considered safe. She was incredible. And at

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.840
 this time, she was working in hospitals where people were terminally ill, mainly with cancer.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.200
 And this was a time when they didn't even use the C word. They were just saying malignancy.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.480
 And they would also not tell people. So, for example, if a wife was sick, they would tell

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.600
 the husband, not the wife. So, she would be being told, she'd be having like radiotherapy

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.320
 and she'd be told, "It's to make you better." But they'd all be going to her husband. She's

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.320
 not going to live.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.520
 So, she came into this situation and was like, "Hmm, this isn't great." If you told people

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.560
 that they were dying, she observed when she did that and helped them through it, that

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.920
 they would go through five distinct stages and they would reach an acceptance. And it

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.280
 would, I mean, that makes no sense. They would deny it first of all, like, "Oh, no, I'm not

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.000
 really ill. I'm fine. I can't believe it's me. Why am I dying? Oh, God, why did you do

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.560
 this to me? This is the worst thing. Actually, okay, I'm dying. I'm going to pay off my debts

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.000
 and apologize to all those people." So, she was talking about people dying. And I honestly,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 in my research for my book, couldn't find the moment that it became about grieving. It

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.880
 just became about grieving because it was like, "Well, it's death. It's same room." And

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.960
 it makes no sense for a grieving person. Like, anyone who's been through any loss will tell

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.840
 you, like, "You don't go through five distinct stages. You get them pretty much all at once

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.040
 all the time and it can, you know, hit you five years later, two years later, 10 years

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.560
 later." So, I meet so many people who are like, "Oh, God, I feel so bad. Like, I need

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.920
 to get to acceptance. I haven't done it." And I'm always raging because I'm like, "That

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.920
 isn't what grief looks like." But the reason it works in a film is that's how films work.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.000
 They need to end and we all need to walk away thinking.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.360
 I mean, not all films. No, good films will do that. I'm fingering a few mental suspects.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.520
 What? I haven't seen that film.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.520
 Hello.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.760
 Although, Andy McDowell is in that as well.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.080
 I think we're in a few mental suspects.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.680
 She plays the doctor. She's really good.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.160
 We should just quickly say, because James hasn't seen "Groundhog Day." So Bill Murray

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.920
 is a journalist. He goes to this town to do "Groundhog Day."

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.920
 The weatherman.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.720
 He's the weatherman. He wakes up in the morning and the day has begun again. He's conscious

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.520
 of it. No one else is. And then the day has begun.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.520
 Yeah.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.520
 So he's...

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.520
 Like a Russian doll at a TV show.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.520
 Yes.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.520
 Happy Death Day is like...

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.920
 But he reacts differently. So, first of all, he's like, "This isn't happening." Then he

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.000
 gets furious. And he starts experimenting with his day. Like, "Well, if I do this, will

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.040
 I be here tomorrow?" And it doesn't matter what he does.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.920
 He tries literally everything. It's a weird moment where he starts fingering.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920
 But...

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:23.640
 And he's trying to woo Andy McDowell's character. And eventually, he learns everything about

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.840
 her becomes perfect and it still doesn't work.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.040
 That's a bit creepy, isn't it?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.640
 It's really creepy. It's creepy. That doesn't really stand up to today's standards.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.640
 No.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.640
 But it is a...

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.640
 It is a great film.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.640
 It is a brilliant film.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.640
 Kubler Ross.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.640
 Oh, yeah. Cubs.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.640
 Cubs.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.640
 Cubs.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.640
 She has a cool phrase.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.240
 "There's no such thing as..." Any guesses?

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.240
 Death.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.240
 Yeah, death.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.240
 Oh, did she?

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.240
 Yeah, she said like she became...

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.240
 Her podcast is great.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.240
 Yeah.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.440
 It's like a mixture of our podcast and your podcast.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.040
 Yeah, yeah. My God, yeah.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.600
 She basically became so convinced there was an afterlife that she said, "We don't need

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.760
 to worry about death. There's no such thing as death."

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.320
 That's why she was great at getting people into acceptance. It's just like, "Don't worry

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.320
 about it, guys. It's fine."

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.360
 But the weird thing is, in her original book, the 1969 one, she called the belief in life

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:13.200
 after death a form of denial. So she actually thought that life after death was complete

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.120
 bullshit, and then she went through a change in her life.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.120
 Wow.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.120
 So she became like...

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:23.000
 Yeah, so she met a patient in a hospital who was called Mrs. Schwartz, and Mrs. Schwartz

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.480
 had been pronounced dead, and then hours later, she was found alive by a nurse.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.480
 So...

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.480
 Wondering the story.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.480
 Yeah. So she went to interview her to say what happened, and she recounted that she said,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.240
 "I remember everything that happened. I remember being above my body. I remember a joke that

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.920
 the doctor told in the room when I was laying there dead." All that stuff. And that is what

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.920
 made...

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.920
 In appropriate, report that.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.920
 Exactly.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.440
 So Kubla Ross basically went, "Ah, this is interesting," and became obsessed with it.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.640
 And she even went to have, as it were, out-of-body experiences through a guy called Robert Monroe.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.120
 And then as she got further into it, she believed that she had spirit guides that she was contacting,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:05.120
 one of whom was Mrs. Schwartz, who did later die, and then came back to sort of instruct

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.840
 Kubla Ross about her ideas about the afterlife.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.640
 And this woman is in charge of most known grief theory, known to humanity, like Western

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.640
 culture, yeah.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.160
 So one thing you write about in the Bookabit Carrier is the Victorian mourning rituals,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.960
 and how, although they were very starchy and very formal, they did give you a kind of structure.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.640
 And then you mention all the different paraphernalia of mourning.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.640
 Yeah, they were mad.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.440
 Yeah, I mean, it was really a culture highly focused on that. I can't remember if you

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.000
 remember, but there's mourning stationery. Yeah, so yeah, that's really common. Yeah,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 mourning stationery.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.560
 You get a black edged card, and when you receive that, you know that the person who sent it

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.560
 to you is...

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.480
 I was thinking like rulers and charlatans and stuff.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.640
 They had, in Regent Street, Jay's of Regent Street, was basically like the prime arc of

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.640
 grief and death.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.160
 So where you went and got all your clothes from, and all your hats, and like gentlemen's

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.440
 funeral scarves had to be a certain length.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.160
 There was like a book that told you everything, like from the length of the bow around your

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.360
 hat to the staff, to the colour of the ribbon on your door, to your mourning jellies.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.960
 They kind of like made an industry of it as a Victorian...

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.960
 So what is mourning jellies?

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.120
 The jellies that you have when you're mourning.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.120
 Would they be like black?

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.640
 I don't know, actually. I never saw one. I just read about it in the book.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.880
 But is it for serving at a wake or something like that?

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.960
 I guess serving after a funeral, yeah. Or maybe you have it like on a Sunday when you're

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.960
 feeling gloomy.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.680
 Well, jelly used to be, I mean, if we're talking London, there used to be pubs where if you

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:35.200
 saw someone eating jelly, a woman, that would mean that she was available for sexual experiences.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.720
 I didn't know that. I need to stop eating jelly in public.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.720
 Purchase sexual experiences.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.920
 Yeah, yeah, it wasn't like a traffic light party.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.920
 No, but...

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.920
 If you're eating strawberry jelly, you're not up for it.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.040
 It's like handkerchief culture in the...

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.040
 Muffa knuckle...

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.040
 Knock a muffling?

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.040
 One of those?

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.040
 Say it again.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.040
 Knock a muffling.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.040
 What's a knock a muffling?

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.920
 It's loud to upset people at the house.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.920
 A door knocker on your house?

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.920
 Oh.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.920
 You'd muffle it if someone's died.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.920
 Yeah, and you'd also...

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.920
 To respect.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.920
 You'd have different colors as well.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.840
 So, like, there was a black crate ribbon outside, it meant adult and it meant a child

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.600
 had died in this house and it would be muffled and there was...

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.960
 Yeah, there was like...

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.280
 It would cost you so much money to do a proper considered funeral.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.560
 Like, I think they read even a middle-class funeral at the time would have been like a

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.560
 thousand pounds.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.560
 Like, it was really...

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.560
 Right.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.760
 And they had funeral clubs where you'd all put money in every week so that you could

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.360
 get like the funeral you like that person deserves because if they didn't, they considered

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.360
 their soul would wander around forever, basically.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.360
 Oh, really?

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.880
 So, it's like your pension, you know, you'll put in every week and then when you need the

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.880
 money you can take it.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.880
 Like a turkey club?

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.880
 Like a turkey club, but for the dead.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.880
 Yeah, turkey's dead, I suppose.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.600
 But they don't get anything after that.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.600
 No, you're right.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600
 Well, they don't pay, I suppose.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.640
 Would you have like, you know, for a wedding you have like a present list.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.600
 Was there a similar thing where I'd like this at my funeral and I'll take care of it?

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.600
 I think it was pretty set.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.600
 It was...

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.600
 Yeah.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.600
 You just go.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.600
 Can I just tell you one very tangential thing about knockers, door knockers?

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.760
 You told me it was tangential, here we go.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.600
 So, I was reading about knocker muffling and then I just sort of went around the rabbit

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:15.740
 hole of door knockers, you know that in old Tehran, houses would have two door knockers,

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.960
 one was square and heavier and the other was more rounded.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.960
 Can you guess why?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.960
 One for the ladies?

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.960
 It's one for the ladies.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.960
 No!

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.960
 It's one for the men.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.640
 It's a big square one and women use the rounded one and then you know who's knocking at the

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:33.440
 door and so then the woman of the house might not answer the door to a man for kind of cultural

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.440
 reasons.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.120
 They might also, I read this, they might disguise their voice behind the door to ask the business

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.720
 of who's coming around.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.960
 Oh, is that like saying, "Oh, I've got some big men here that are going to beat you up

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.960
 if you come in."

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960
 Is that how you do...

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.960
 Is that what you do?

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.680
 That's what I say every time someone knocks.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.680
 Just in case they might be coming in to attack.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.680
 It's good to let people know what's happening inside.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.680
 At an imaginary dog.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.680
 "You're done!

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.680
 Brute us down!"

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.680
 That kind of thing, you know, that really works.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.680
 That's when Julia Caesar's coming around, isn't it?

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.980
 That's that great machine, quantity routine and she did it in her sitcom where you order

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.680
 too many pizzas and the pizza guy's done it with six and you go, "Yeah, it's here, it's

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.680
 here!"

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.680
 "I'll bring it in a minute."

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.680
 And then they're like, "It's just for you."

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.920
 You could make it bigger, couldn't you, Andy, and have lots of different knockers, like a

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.920
 knocker for your delivery guy and a knocker for a Jehovah's Witness person or whatever.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.920
 Don't come in!

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.920
 I've got some big men in here!

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.920
 I don't want to know about eternal salvation!

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.920
 And so, how long was mourning in that?

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:34.920
 Depends.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.920
 So, they had a rule for every single situation.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.920
 So, like, rule for like your second cousin, your second cousin's child, your sister, your...

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.920
 But for the most common people know, it's like for a partner.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.520
 So, a widow would have a year in mourning where she had to wear black and then you go

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.520
 into half-morning and quarter-morning.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.520
 And if you, in that year, got married, you're allowed to, like, not wear black for the day

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.520
 and then back in your black dress the next day.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.520
 So, you could have a new husband and be like, "Sorry, babes, do you remember Alfred?"

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.520
 He was great, wasn't he?

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.520
 I'm still pretty sad.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.520
 When did we drop?

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.520
 It was like a moment where we dropped this for some reason.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.520
 Well, that's really interesting, because I don't think we have dropped it.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.520
 Because I think we still have an expectation that we expect people to be over things by about

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.520
 a year.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.520
 We've passed a year to two years, and with grief, we're a bit like, "Oh, gosh, three years.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.520
 Like, she's still upset."

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.520
 And then, of course, you get the black armbands, which were still going up.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.520
 Like, my mum wore a black armband when her granny died in the '60s.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.520
 But I would say she's like the last person I've spoken to who...

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.520
 But you still get soccer players doing that, right?

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.520
 Yeah, so soccer...

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.520
 I'm sorry, my brain went football in my head.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.520
 Sports people and, like, military stuff still wear them.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.520
 But other than that, obviously, you used to just wear it day to day.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.520
 And that comes up on my podcast that people wished there was still a thing you could have

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.520
 that would mean, like, sort of handle with care.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.520
 Because it's like, you don't want to be a society that says you have to wear a black armband.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.520
 But for some people, you know, if you're going to a shop, you're on a tube.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.520
 It's a bit like baby on board.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.520
 It's like, "I'm in grief.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.520
 Like, just be careful with me.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.520
 Like, if I'm in a shop or like..."

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.520
 You have badges, don't you?

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.520
 I did sell badges.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.520
 Yeah, but I couldn't keep up with the demand.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.520
 What did it say?

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.520
 It said, "Please be kind.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.520
 I'm grieving."

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.520
 And it had two little hands.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.520
 And then one said, "DDC member."

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.520
 It was in Dead Dad Club with DMC.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.520
 And there was a little amazing artist called Camille Bersini who designed them.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.520
 And it was like a little purple ghost with a hat with a flower.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.520
 Oh, Dead Mom's Club.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.520
 No, I was thinking Ron DMC.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.520
 That can't be.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.520
 I thought you...

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.520
 They're dead.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.520
 They're dead.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.520
 It's like that.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.520
 And that's the way it is.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.520
 So, yeah, it's a shame in a way that we don't have.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.520
 Yeah, I agree.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.520
 Because you never know what anyone's going through at any time.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.520
 Although I can see why the Victorians were very strict, obviously, like you had to do it.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.520
 And if a woman couldn't...

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.520
 You would know where you'd be allowed to walk around in like, you know, a bright yellow dress the next day.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.520
 I think we'd have to draw a line on where, what kind of badges you'd have.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.520
 Because I definitely would have like, "Be gentle, lost an eBay purchase."

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.520
 Like, you know...

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.520
 I feel a small badge, isn't it?

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.520
 I've only got facts about groundhogs now.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.520
 Let's talk about groundhogs.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.520
 Oh, groundhogs, yeah.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.520
 You mind?

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.520
 No.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.520
 Groundhog Day.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.520
 Yeah.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.520
 It's about groundhogs, is it?

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:19.520
 Because there's a special groundhog who comes up and if he can see his shadow, it's going to snow for a month or so.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.520
 Have you seen the film Groundhog Day?

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.520
 All this stuff.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.520
 They get him out of his little nest.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.520
 Punctutaniville, isn't he?

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.520
 Punctutaniville.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.520
 But there are loads of groundhogs.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.520
 That's an interesting thing.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.520
 I mean, all over, lots of places have a groundhog celebration.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.520
 I was just wondering if punctutani is the most difficult word that everyone knows how to pronounce.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.520
 Yes, from the film Groundhog Day.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:45.520
 But basically, if they get him out and if he turns around and sees his shadow, then there'll be another six weeks of winter.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.520
 And if he doesn't, then the spring will come.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.520
 How do they know if he sees it?

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:56.520
 Well, what I read was, in real Punctutani, there are two scrolls, and if Phil picks the scroll that says he sees a shadow,

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.520
 that's how they know he's seen a shadow.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.520
 So there's these secret scrolls.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.520
 Do they look up the long-range weather forecast and lace one of them with groundhog food or whatever?

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.520
 They must do, right?

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.520
 They must do.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.520
 It takes place on Gobler's Knob, I read.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.520
 Do you know where the name Gobler's Knob comes from?

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.520
 There's two theories.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.520
 If you get either of them, you can have a point.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.520
 Goblin's Knob?

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.520
 No.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:31.520
 Was it somebody was gobbling a man's knob and they said, "We should call this Gobler's Knob,"

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.520
 because she's always there, she's always doing that.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.520
 What, Jelly Sue? Yeah, Jelly Sue.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.520
 And Jelly Sue didn't stick with me.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.520
 That's not one of the two theories that I have.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.520
 Okay, sure, fine.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.520
 You stick with your theories, I'll stick with mine.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.520
 Oh, is it where people ate on mountains?

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.520
 Yeah, like a knob is just like a hillock.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.520
 Well, that's why I thought Goblin's Knob, because it looks like a goblin's.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.520
 No, no, no, your theory was not bad.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.520
 Oh, he's going to get it.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:04.520
 So it's where the old shoe mender used to buy his trade, Gobler's Knob, and slowly it became Goblin's Knob.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.520
 Why? Why did they start going?

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.520
 Because he gave a lot of blowjobs.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.520
 Yeah, yeah, I'm going to call it Goblin.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.520
 It's an offer to sell shoes.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.520
 Is that like a happy ending for massages, but in the shoe cleaning trade?

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.520
 You know when he comes down to measure your feet?

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.520
 He's bending down.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.520
 Well, I'm down here.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.520
 No, it's because a group of turkeys might have lived there.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:34.520
 And then another theory is like Dan said, maybe there were hunters and then that's where they would eat their food after the hunt.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.520
 So they would gobble up the food, but I think the turkeys are the most likely ones.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.520
 Yeah, that is good.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.520
 I didn't know groundhogs.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.520
 The groundhogs are amazing.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.520
 Yeah, sure.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.520
 No, they really are.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.520
 So I didn't know they were the same as a woodchuck and it's the largest member of the squirrel family.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.520
 What?

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.520
 Oh, no, and they're brilliant diggers.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.520
 So they dig, they'll dig several feet down in a row.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.520
 They live in burrows several feet down, then a few feet up, and then they level out and go along.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.520
 And then off the side of that main tunnel, they'll dig several different rooms, one of which is the toilet room.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.520
 And they only go to the loo in there.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.520
 And then when it's full, they just seal it up and they dig a new toilet elsewhere.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.520
 They're very clean.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.520
 Yeah, I was going to say the first thing that you said they got down and up is that so they got drowned.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:22.520
 They go to dig another room and they're like, oh no, that's three years ago's toilet.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.520
 Close up, close up, close up.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.520
 You have to hit it eventually.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.520
 There's how many rooms, how long is, I guess you keep moving the tunnel down.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.520
 You really have to hide that when selling it, wouldn't you, to the next Grand Old Family?

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.520
 Oh, don't, don't.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.520
 What's that on these walls?

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.520
 We want to extend, no, you can't.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.520
 You can't extend that.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:48.520
 Okay, it's time for fact number one and that is Carriette.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.520
 Boom.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.520
 Brilliant.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.520
 It's actually time for fact number two and that is James.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.520
 Okay, my fact this week is that there's a bus tower in Hong Kong,

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.520
 which is specifically run for people to sleep all the way through.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.520
 Lovely.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.520
 Lovely, lovely idea.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.520
 Sounds great, doesn't it?

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.520
 Is it because people are tired in Hong Kong?

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.520
 That's part of the reason.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.520
 What do you think, Andy?

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.520
 Otherwise, it'd be a terrible place to do this.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.520
 You just get people out and they're all like, no, I'm wide awake.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.520
 We're not sleeping in Hong Kong.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.520
 Why can't they get a normal bus?

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.520
 I love sleeping on the bus.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.520
 Why can't they just get a bus?

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.520
 Well, they could.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.520
 It stops, doesn't it?

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.520
 And so they might wake you up and kick you off the bus.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.520
 The idea came from this guy, Kenneth Kong.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.520
 He worked for a bus tour organizer and he was chatting to one of his friends

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.520
 and his friends said he was really stressed, you know,

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.520
 he's got a really busy job, couldn't sleep at night.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.520
 But whenever he traveled to work on the bus,

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.520
 he would always kind of fall asleep.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.520
 And Kenneth Kong thought this is amazing.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.520
 This is such a good idea.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.520
 I'm going to do a bus tour where people are just encouraged to sleep.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.520
 And unlike a normal bus ride,

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.520
 we're going to give you a goodie bag with an eye mask, some ear plugs.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.520
 Maybe we'll get a very soporific tour guide or something.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.520
 That's a good idea.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.520
 But actually the first time they did it,

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.520
 they had the upper deck for people who wanted to sleep

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.520
 and the lower deck was for people who wanted to have a tour guide chat into them.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.520
 Which feels like the wrong way around because if you want to see the site,

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.520
 you want to be on the top.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.520
 Exactly. Really good point.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.520
 But anyway, they noticed that a lot of people found that more difficult

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.520
 and didn't sleep, so now they're making two separate bus tours.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.520
 One for sleepers and one for not sleepers.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.520
 I also read as well that I don't know if they do this every single time,

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.520
 but they might start with a huge two hour long lunch.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.520
 So that's a very good idea.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.520
 You go into a food coma as you're getting on the bus.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.520
 Oh, nice.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.520
 You could do this for lots of things

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.520
 because there are lots of activities where you're put in a...

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.520
 Like the cinema, for example, or theatre, or an opera.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.520
 Are you suggesting that you go to sleep in a...

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.520
 I'm saying that it's very easy to fall asleep,

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.520
 especially if the thing is not good.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.520
 I once went to a Bach concert, which is, you know...

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.520
 It's really sort of deep and sort of quite long notes and stuff,

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.520
 and about halfway through I looked around and literally half.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.520
 The men mostly, I must say, but they were mostly asleep.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.520
 I used to go to lunchtime concerts at Wigmore Hall,

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.520
 and I thought, "Oh, this is an exciting London thing to do,"

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.520
 but it was full of people head nodding,

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.520
 just like, "Oh, this is so nice. I'm on my lunch break."

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.520
 It's very hard to do this.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.520
 Yeah, you could get like 15 minutes, couldn't you?

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.520
 That's headbangers, you know, at metal concerts.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.520
 Actually, I'm just about to fall asleep.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.520
 Time to wake it up.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.520
 Wake up, Gary. It's just about to stop.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.520
 I once went to Brian Blessed's house,

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.520
 and I was hanging out with him,

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.520
 and he tells stories that go on and on,

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.520
 and it was just me and him sitting in his adventurous shed that he has.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.520
 And I was so tired, and he was telling me stories,

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.520
 and I fell asleep.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.520
 And I remember waking up with that sudden start,

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.520
 and I looked up, and he was still talking at me.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.520
 Amazing.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.520
 He just did, and we would definitely way further away

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.520
 than where the story was when I fell asleep.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.520
 That's great.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.520
 We could hire Brian Blessed to go around to people's houses.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.520
 Well, he must have some audiobooks you can listen to.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.520
 I was looking up good bus tours.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.520
 Yeah.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.520
 Oh, okay.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.520
 There was a tour bus for dogs in 2017 in London.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.520
 Oh.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.520
 But it was a bit of a...

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.520
 Well, okay, it was the Rootmaster K9.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.520
 And there was a live commentary of Dog Trivia from around London.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.520
 Okay.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.520
 Fine.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.520
 And the route was between places where you could go for walkies.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.520
 But wait, so the owners were the dogs?

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.520
 Yeah, that's the thing.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.520
 There are dogs in Moscow who get on the tube,

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.520
 who live kind of down on the tube and sort of jump on between stops.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.520
 Wow.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.520
 Like the pigeons do.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.520
 I don't believe the pigeons.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.520
 I've seen them.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.520
 I've seen them.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.520
 I've seen them.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.520
 I've read it.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.520
 Okay.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.520
 I've seen them.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.520
 Okay, guys, pipe down.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.520
 I've done research on this.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.520
 I didn't get to read out a few weeks ago on the podcast.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.520
 The pigeons get the tube.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520
 Do they know they're doing it?

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.520
 And I literally saw the pigeon do it, though.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.520
 No, no, we didn't, because he read a research thing.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.520
 We didn't see it.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.520
 A pigeon can be on the tube,

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.520
 but it does not have a conception of the map of my pigeon.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.520
 Oh, okay.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.520
 But I've seen a pigeon on the tube.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.520
 But you know, there's also the pigeon on the tube.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.520
 No, but listen.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.520
 Let me talk.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.520
 There's the tube bit that's overground.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.520
 So then it's getting on at one stop and going two stops

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.520
 and literally walking on, waiting by the door

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.520
 and then walking on.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.520
 That's what I saw as well.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.520
 Yeah, so it's like, it's not doing underground tube.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.520
 It's like, oh, if I get on at East Finchley.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.520
 I'd be more impressed to see a pigeon on the underground tube.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.520
 That would be dangerous and upsetting for the pigeon

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.520
 and distressing.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.520
 It'll be fine.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.520
 It sort of slides down the escalator.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.520
 What we've seen is much more normal.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.520
 An outdoor platform, pigeon gets on, rides and stops, gets on.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.520
 For me, it's so normal.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.520
 It's banal.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.520
 It's actually come round to banal.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.520
 I can't even accept it.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.520
 I wonder what you think, Andy, now that you've read this research.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.520
 Are you trusting your own research

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.520
 or are you believing the eyewitness reports?

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.520
 I've literally seen it.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.520
 I just want to clear this up.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.520
 I believe what you've both seen.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.520
 You've both seen a pigeon hop onto a train.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.520
 The train girl stop or do the pigeon hop off.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.520
 Wait by the doors.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.520
 Wait by the doors.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.520
 No distress, no panic.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.520
 I did the gap.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.520
 Pressing that button when it's the open button.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.520
 That's what makes it clear that the pigeon's stupid.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.520
 The doors operate anyway.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.520
 Not on the overground.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.520
 Not on the overground.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.520
 I didn't see over.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.520
 I saw underground.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.520
 Underground chain.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.520
 What's the point is, I don't think,

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.520
 I think they might be hopping on looking for food or something.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.520
 I don't think they're--

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.520
 But it didn't do any food.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.520
 They're not commuting home.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.520
 Andy, this is what I saw.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.520
 It just waited by the door.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.520
 It was playing Candy Crush.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.520
 It literally got on, stood and faced the doors like a commuter.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.520
 Everyone was like, oh my god, pigeon.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.520
 Doors closed and then it went two stops.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.520
 So it didn't have to do--

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.520
 The two is more convincing.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.520
 Yeah, no, it did two.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.520
 It did East Finchley to Finchley Central,

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.520
 like to West Finchley.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.520
 So it went out to North London and it got out.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.520
 Mine had a baby on board back then.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.520
 If it's the several days in a row,

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.520
 within the same half an hour period,

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.520
 I will believe you've got a commuting pigeon.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.520
 OK.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.520
 What were we talking about?

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.520
 Bassist.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.520
 Bassist.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.520
 Oh, Bassist or Dogtar.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.520
 Dogtar.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.520
 You started this, Jase.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.520
 You said there are dogs on the Bosco jeans.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.520
 Sorry.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.520
 Can I just ask on your Dogtar?

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.520
 It's basically a way for dog walkers

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.520
 to get from one walkies area to another one,

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.520
 and they gave them stuff in the meantime.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.520
 I think so.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.520
 I think it was around for a few days

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.520
 as a kind of to promote the firm.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.520
 Are your Russian dogs commuting there?

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.520
 We're just living there.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.520
 I think that's the idea, is that they do go from one place

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.520
 to another where they know they can get food

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.520
 from different places.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.520
 But I can't really quite remember.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.520
 Yeah, I believe that.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.520
 You believe that.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.520
 Oh, that's fine.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.520
 James has never seen it.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.520
 I was going to say, when I went to Moscow,

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.520
 I've been a few times, but whenever I've gone,

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.520
 I've tried to look on the underground for these dogs

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.520
 and I've never seen them.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.520
 Well, Andy still believes you.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:21.520
 I was reading about the bus drivers of history.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.520
 One significant and very controversial bus driver

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.520
 was a guy called James Blake.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.520
 Yeah, of course, Rosa Parks.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.520
 He was the Rosa Parks bus driver.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.520
 Here's the thing I didn't know.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.520
 So he was called James Blake.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.520
 It was 1955, this happened.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.520
 The most famous incident.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.520
 But she and Blake had beef already.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.520
 Oh, I had read this somewhere because she was like a known activist.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.520
 Wasn't she?

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.520
 That was the big thing.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.520
 12 years earlier in 1943, she got on a bus, paid,

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.520
 but she'd got on the front entrance and Blake was the driver.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.520
 And he said, no, you've got to get off and get on the sort of back doors of the bus

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.520
 because that was the rules, segregated buses.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.520
 And she got off to, God's sake, all right.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.520
 She got off to get on the other entrance and he drove off,

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.520
 which was a thing they would do sometimes as a kind of prank.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.520
 So she avoided his buses for years.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.520
 You know, when she saw he was a driver and then that day,

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.520
 she didn't notice that he was the driver.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.520
 She was tired.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.520
 She was preoccupied.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.520
 And so that's, that's what happened.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.520
 He was a bus driver for 19 more years.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.520
 19 more years.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.520
 Yeah.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.520
 Wow.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.520
 Because it was quite, she, her story was one that sort of hit the right moment at the right time.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:32.520
 There were quite a lot of stories of, of people who were refusing to step up from their seats and go to the back.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.520
 I think even Rosa Parks' story is slightly distorted.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.520
 Yeah, I was going to say, she wasn't tight.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.520
 She knew it was all planned and they used her because she looked quite mild-mannered

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.520
 and they thought that it would be like, you know, a way for it to get on the bus

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.520
 and look like she wasn't going to cause trouble, but they absolutely,

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.520
 she was a super intelligent, brilliant part of the organization.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.520
 And it was very, very well, they knew like they were going to do this incident.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:53.520
 The King was part of that.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.520
 Genuinely, actually only know that because of a Doctor Who episode from the Jodie Whitaker period.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.520
 So that probably needs a fact check.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.520
 I think they would have got that right.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.520
 Yeah, a lot of, a lot of seminal moments have happened on buses.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.520
 So George Harrison joined the Beatles on a bus.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.520
 Did he?

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.520
 He was sitting on top, top deck of a bus.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.520
 Not on top of Paul McCartney's head.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.520
 He was giving him a shoulder's ride.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.520
 Yeah, Paul already knew him and that's where he introduced properly to John Lennon

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.520
 and John said, can you play a song?

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.520
 That was a very difficult song to play on guitar.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.520
 He played it, nailed it and that's when they said, you're in the band.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.520
 So that's important.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.520
 George Michael wrote Careless Whisper on the bus.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.520
 I'm never going to dance again.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.520
 Guilty feet have got no N17.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.520
 No, zero to no.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.520
 No, zero lyric.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.520
 I was a tour bus guide.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.520
 Tour bus guide?

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.520
 That sounded wrong.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.520
 No, I was, that's the right.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.520
 You were a tour guide who was on the bus.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.520
 Thank you, thank you.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.520
 I was like, tour bus guide is the right.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.520
 Here's another tour bus.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.520
 If you look over there, another tour bus is going past.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.520
 So many tour buses.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:55.520
 I was a tour guide on an open top bus for some time in London

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.520
 and I got in trouble a lot, yes.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.520
 For what?

00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.520
 Making stuff up?

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.520
 No, I never made stuff up.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.520
 I made a joke about the Royal Family and someone wrote and complained

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.520
 and said I should be ashamed of myself and I disgraced my country.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.520
 Wow, it was about Prince Andrew.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.520
 It wasn't, at the time, that sort of thing wasn't known.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.520
 It was about Prince Harry taking drugs, which was absolutely known

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.520
 and it was a really crap joke that every tour guide did on St James's.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.520
 So the shops have Royal warrants.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.520
 So that's where they have a crest in the window.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.520
 That means the Royal Family shop there.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.520
 And the whole of St James's, there's like,

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.520
 oh, Berry Brothers, Lob and Coases.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.520
 There's all like the boot makers, the hat makers

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.520
 and there's also a pharmacy on St James's

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.520
 and you say that's where the Royal Family get their drugs

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.520
 although I think Prince Harry probably gets his from somewhere else.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.520
 It's a terrible joke.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.520
 It's fine.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.520
 Have you got your first comedy review?

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.520
 Two stars.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.520
 We got up at Bucking, I said,

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.520
 this is Bucking Palace and a couple marched up to me and they said,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.520
 "We're getting off."

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.520
 I said, "Oh, okay."

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.520
 They said, "We don't want to."

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.520
 I said, "Oh, what's happening?"

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.520
 And I said, "It's you.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.520
 We're getting off because of you."

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.520
 And I was like, "Oh, what?"

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.520
 I said, "What you just said about the Royal Family was so disgraceful."

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.520
 And then when the letter, they said I had disgraced Prince William.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.520
 So they hadn't even been listening to my joke.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.520
 You wouldn't make that joke about Prince William.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.520
 That's the most annoying thing.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.520
 It was so annoying, but I got in quite big trouble.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.520
 Did you apologise?

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.520
 No, they're gone.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.520
 They're long gone.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.520
 Unrepentant.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.520
 I'm glad you weren't my boss, I did.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.520
 You know London Bus?

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.520
 Just a London Bus.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.520
 Big Red Bus.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.520
 Big Red Bus.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.520
 You know how long they are in terms of how many London Buses they are?

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.520
 They're one London Bus.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.520
 No, they're 1.2 times the length of a London Bus.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.520
 Okay.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.520
 And that's because they're new rootmasters.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.520
 And if you ever look at, like, whatever anyone says, this is so stupid.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.520
 But whatever anyone says, this is like 10 times the length of a London Bus.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.520
 They're talking about the old London Bus.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.520
 Oh, talking about the rootmasters.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.520
 Yeah.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.520
 But they've got the new one, such a 1.2 times the length.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.520
 Brilliant.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.520
 I genuinely interested in that.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.520
 Do you know, I bit, like, I loved, I'm the age of remembering rootmasters.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.520
 And they were great when you could jump on the back of the bus.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.520
 Obviously, it wasn't safe, but it was brilliant.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.520
 Yeah.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.520
 You never had to worry about missing a bus.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.520
 You just ran.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.520
 You could still jump on.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.520
 No, because they closed them all because it wasn't safe.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.520
 Do you remember the old ones?

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.520
 Like, had no door.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.520
 Totally open.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.520
 Yeah.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.520
 No, sorry.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.520
 I've jumped on the back of one when the door was open.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.520
 Wow.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.520
 Andy, you're so lucky.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.520
 You jumped on a bus and it was open.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.520
 You didn't just run head first into glass.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.520
 I was sneaking off one bus and onto another one.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.520
 It was after a party.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.520
 Anyway, I don't want to go into my showbiz life.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.520
 You know, we're familiar with the Spice Bus.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.520
 Yeah.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.520
 Spice Girls Bus.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.520
 From the Spice World movie.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.520
 And you can rent it now.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.520
 How can you?

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.520
 You can stay in it overnight.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.520
 Is this a hint for your next birthday?

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.520
 No.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.520
 Is it still so...

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.520
 It's on the other one.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.520
 It's tedious.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.520
 I haven't seen this movie.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.520
 But is it like, I think it's like Uni and Jack.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.520
 That's not missable.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.520
 You have to watch Spice Bus.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.520
 Meatloaf is the driver.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.520
 Does it still look the same as it did in the show?

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.520
 Yes, it's still, the exterior looks the same.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.520
 But the interior, unfortunately, obviously in the film,

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.520
 the interior was this huge three-story potential.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.520
 It couldn't have been what it was.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.520
 Was it like bigger on the inside kind of thing?

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.520
 Well, they never, I don't think they made a kind of space-time definition

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.520
 about how big it was.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.520
 Just kept showing you different rooms in it.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.520
 Like a Groundhog's Nest, basically.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.520
 Exactly.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.520
 There's one more full of shit from the Spice Girls

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.520
 than if you attacked her.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.520
 Oh, God.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.520
 We spoke about the Dave Matthews band a few months ago.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.520
 Yes, did you know the Dave Matthews band?

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.520
 I didn't know Dave Matthews band.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.520
 There was this thing in 2004 where they dumped 800 pounds

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.520
 of raw untreated sewage into a river.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.520
 There was a Chicago River while they were crossing the bridge

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.520
 on their tour bus.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.520
 And they were, unfortunately, they were crossing a slatted bridge

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.520
 and there was an open top tour boat passing by beneath the bridge.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.520
 Can I just say it was the driver rather than the band.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.520
 Yeah, I was like the band were there like now.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.520
 So anyway, that was a huge thing led to a lot of,

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.520
 I think there were apology letters.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.520
 But I was reading about what happens how you release

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:06.520
 what they call the Blackwater, you know, the sewage from the thing.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.520
 And you know, buses have changed a bit since then.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.520
 I think they've been altered a bit.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.520
 I was reading an interview with a bus driver from 2016 about how you release it.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.520
 And there is a switch that says dump, which they keep.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.520
 Supposedly they keep it by the driver's left elbow, which feels risky.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.520
 Thanks for the indicators.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.520
 But these days, there's like a nuclear button.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.520
 There is a plastic cap over the switch.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.520
 So you have to make a conscious decision to dump.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.520
 I mean, we all need that in our lives.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.520
 Make a conscious decision to drop your shit.

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.520
 They should put the key for it inside a person.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:43.520
 This is a callback to something the other day.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.520
 The idea of a nuclear button, you put the key inside a person

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.520
 so they had to kill the person to get to the nuclear button.

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.520
 And the president had to do it himself.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.520
 Yes, an initial.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.520
 But how's he going to keep that inside him without shitting it out?

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.520
 I'll be under his skin.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.520
 Oh, okay. I thought you meant like swallow it and then go through the shit, get the key.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.520
 In this case, sir, the missiles are going to be in two minutes.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.520
 The president is sieving a poo.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.520
 It's like, "I'll find it. I'll find it."

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.520
 The key's covered in sweet card.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:18.520
 Are you sure you want to look at the plastic cover?

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.520
 Not yet, not yet.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.520
 Oh, God, sorry.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:29.520
 Okay, it is time for fact number one.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.520
 Okay, I'm sorry.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.520
 They say I love won't pay the rent.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.520
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.520
 My fact is that for many years, the secret of the British Army's balloons

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.520
 was known by a single family of Alsatians.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.520
 Wow.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.520
 By which I mean people from Alsat.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.520
 Were they all on a bus together?

00:34:54.520 --> 00:35:00.520
 This is a thing where, so the ballooning took off.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:08.520
 If only the people at home could have seen the way that you built up.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.520
 I know, the face.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.520
 You lifted up the plastic button and you dumped.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.520
 You pressed dump on your joke.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.520
 I thought, "I could do it. I could go for it, couldn't I?

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.520
 They'll all laugh and we'll just move on and it won't be made a big thing off."

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.520
 The British Army, they were experimenting.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.520
 They were making hydrogen balloons, and this is in the 1880s.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.520
 So it's 100 years or so after the Montgolfier brothers and so on.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:35.520
 And hydrogen balloons are great in lots of ways, but there's a problem.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:41.520
 Hydrogen molecules are so tiny that they escape from almost any bag that you keep them in.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.520
 I'll put them in the same bag.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.520
 So they were looking for a way to improve the balloons.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.520
 And there was this family, the Weinling family.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.520
 They were a family of orthodox Jews that came from Alsace in France.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.520
 And they had their own effectively secret proprietary method of making these balloons.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:06.520
 And they'd made some for a scientific toy shop in the east end of London, which is called Mr. Herons.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:11.520
 And the commander of the first royal balloon factory was called Major Templar.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.520
 He hired the Weinling family, he bought their secret effectively.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:18.520
 And then for a few decades, Britain had this big advantage in balloon technology,

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:23.520
 because the Weinlings were on board and they were kind of supervising the first balloon factory.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.520
 They had to be persuaded to tell other people how to make the balloons,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.520
 because they originally, it seems like they wanted to make the balloons themselves.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:31.520
 "We'll do it all, we'll do it all, we just don't want to tell anyone."

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.520
 I can understand that.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:35.520
 It's pretty amazing as well that, so it was a guy called Henry Coxwell,

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.520
 who was walking through this scientific toy shop and saw this thing.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:43.520
 Can you imagine like during the war effort, you're looking for ways and suddenly here's just a toy for kids,

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.520
 that is going to give you the great advantage of the war.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.520
 And what did the toy do? It was like, it was like a little hot air balloon.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.520
 It was a balloon, yeah, yeah.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.520
 And it worked basically, wow.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.520
 And the method that they used was a thing called gold beater skin.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.520
 So it's used, it's made from the lower intestine of a cow.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.520
 And what they would do is they would stretch out the lower intestine.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:07.520
 And because as you were saying Andy, the nothing could escape, molecules can escape is what they found.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.520
 What's amazing is that when they were, when they make the balloon itself,

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.520
 you wouldn't sew it together.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:18.520
 So sewing might be a problem because there's micro holes that if you miss whatever something can escape.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:22.520
 But with this intestine skin, all you had to do was make it a bit wet, a bit damp,

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.520
 and then it would just stick.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.520
 And that would be strong enough to make it so cool.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.520
 It's overlapping and it just...

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.520
 Guys, how did the Wylings find this out?

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:41.520
 Like, I'm sorry, how did this one family be like, oh, you know that cow intestine we've got hanging around?

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:46.520
 Let's stretch it out, dry it and put like, what was going on in that family?

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.520
 It's Mikey's birthday, have we got balloons?

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.520
 Sorry, that's what made me laugh so much because it's amazing.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.520
 It's like really amazing what they did and discovered.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.520
 But what was going on in Alsace?

00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:01.520
 Well, they were already using this stuff for gold-beating, which is why it's called gold-beater skin, right?

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.520
 But why are they using it in gold-beating?

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:08.520
 So you would put your gold in between two pieces of intestine or paper or whatever,

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.520
 and then you would whack it, whack it, whack it to make it really, really, really, really thin.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.520
 And so then you would have gold leaf instead of a gold bar.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.520
 Oh, and that's why it still comes in as two bits of paper, the gold leaf.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.520
 It does, yeah.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.520
 Do you buy gold leaf?

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:26.520
 You can buy it, like for decorating, people use it for like, if you want to do like a gold effect on tables or on food or...

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.520
 I've had biscuits covered in silver.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.520
 That's the blue.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.520
 Silver what?

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.520
 They're Indian.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.520
 Oh, it's silver leaf, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.520
 They're popular, it's not...

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.520
 Sorry, I thought it was like an emperor there.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.520
 He's doing well with his silver biscuits and two knockers.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.520
 But the amazing thing is about this gold-beating rate,

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.520
 so you're making gold leaf out of a piece of gold,

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:54.520
 and you could get a sheet of gold that was two millimeters thick,

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.520
 and then knock it down, make it thinner, thinner, thinner,

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.520
 so there was 100 nanometers, right?

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.520
 And it's hard to say what that is,

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:08.520
 but it's basically, it's like if I was squashed into a flat sheet,

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.520
 which is the thickness of a human hair.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.520
 We're not going to do that, James.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.520
 No, it's going to do that to you, are they?

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.520
 You know, they get hit by a bus.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:23.520
 But yeah, that's how much, they reduce the thickness of a sheet of gold by 99.996%,

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:29.520
 and they do it using this paper, this ox, you know, this gold beater's paper.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.520
 But that's the second process, to get it down to two millimeters,

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.520
 you need to put it through a different two pieces of paper,

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.520
 and that's called Montgolfier paper,

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.520
 and that was the same paper as the Montgolfiers used to make their balloons.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.520
 Isn't that amazing?

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:47.520
 So the first section of gold beating was Montgolfier paper,

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.520
 and the second stuff was this gold beater's paper,

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.520
 because the Montgolfiers, they came from a family of paper makers,

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.520
 and that's how they got into hot air ballooning,

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.520
 because they had all of this amazing paper to use,

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.520
 and they turned them into balloons.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.520
 So cool.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.520
 It's so weird how one invention leads to another.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.520
 Yeah.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.520
 And it was, the reason I knew about this is because we talked a while ago

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.520
 about jobs in the UK that don't exist anymore,

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.520
 and the last gold beater I think went out in the UK,

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.520
 maybe in the last 10 to 20 years.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.520
 It feels like a very labor intensive job.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.520
 It is.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.520
 Gold beating.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.520
 Yeah, it is.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.520
 Also, for the size of the balloons that they were making during the war,

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:28.520
 you needed a lot, so one kind of classic zeppelin

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.520
 would require 250,000 intestines

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.520
 in order to make the size balloon that they needed in order to do it.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.520
 Again, how did they first get the idea?

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.520
 And it was mostly women, right?

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.520
 Yeah.

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.520
 It was women doing this work.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.520
 Yeah.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.520
 The Vinling family was...

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.520
 It couldn't have been just them, right?

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.520
 They must have taught it to...

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.520
 But it was women that were doing all the work, I think.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.520
 Yeah.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.520
 Women did the skin stretching,

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.520
 the skin treating,

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.520
 and that factory was staffed by women.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.520
 I think it was one Fred Vinling.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.520
 There were a couple of sons,

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.520
 but there was Mrs. Vinling and two daughters

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.520
 who were the chief balloon makers for the army.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.520
 Wow.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.520
 And it was such a secret as well

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:09.520
 that when it eventually got seen that it was being used by the countries,

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.520
 that was seen as treason.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.520
 And this guy, Major Templar, who was the one,

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.520
 he actually got charged with betraying military secrets

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.520
 because they thought this was so secret and no one could have known it.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.520
 No.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.520
 He was acquitted because I think they worked out that he didn't do it,

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.520
 but that's how important this was to the war effort.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.520
 But it kind of didn't matter for a few countries

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.520
 because what you needed was cow and testin.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.520
 So they were being farmed in America

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.520
 and they were being imported to here.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.520
 But like Germany couldn't get them because they stopped.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.520
 They have cows in Germany.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.520
 I don't think they had enough at the time.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.520
 I think we've mentioned once before that Germany had to choose

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.520
 in the war between airships and sausages.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.520
 It's a hard choice to make.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.520
 You're in total war.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.520
 Your society needs to survive.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.520
 It is the worst choice to make.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.520
 Come on.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.520
 In fact, they still lose balloons in war right now, don't they?

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.520
 For instance, while we saw in the news with the so-called spy balloons,

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.520
 they're coming back in.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.520
 It's a new fashion trend.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.520
 In the Ukraine war, I think both sides used balloons.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.520
 They kind of put them up there so that the other side

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.520
 kind of uses a permunition trying to shoot them.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.520
 They're just distractions really, but they are still used.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.520
 There are barrage balloons in the Second World War.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.520
 You saw images of London at war.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.520
 There are all these balloons floating over

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.520
 and it's to make bombers have to fly higher to fly over them.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.520
 They have steel cables hanging down from them

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.520
 so you can't fly around under them.

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.520
 So they're a good air defence.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.520
 Those were largely staffed by women.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.520
 There was the Women's Auxiliary Air Force.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.520
 They were on the ground.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.520
 They would operate the winches basically

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.520
 because there's no one actually up there in a barrage balloon

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.520
 or hanging beneath it.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.520
 Balloon command was set up in 1938.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.520
 Yes, please.

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:47.520
 Even at D-Day.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.520
 Good morning, balloon command.

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.520
 What colour?

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.520
 Rebel?

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.520
 Yes, plenty of those.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.520
 How old is he? Seven?

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.520
 Oh, we'll see what we can do.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.520
 D-Day had the barrage balloon battalion

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.520
 who were specifically bringing to the Normandy beaches

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.520
 the balloons.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.520
 Wow.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.520
 They were pre-inflated in the UK

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.520
 and then sailed over to defend the men of beaches.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.520
 I think that's good because if you're in opposing territory

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.520
 you don't want to be like...

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.520
 Stretch it out a bit.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.520
 You're absolutely right.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.520
 They didn't show that at the beginning of a saving private ride, did they?

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.520
 I'm asthmatic, sir. I can't do this.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.520
 Speaking of women in war,

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.520
 the UK's first official police woman

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.520
 was Mrs Edith Smith of Grantham.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.520
 She became a sworn officer in 1915

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.520
 and the Home Office weren't very happy about it

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.520
 because they said that women were not proper persons.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.520
 That's what they said.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.520
 It's something we have to live with.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.520
 I know, but this is amazing.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.520
 Quite a lot of the stuff they made her do

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.520
 was spy on women on behalf of their husbands

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.520
 who were away at war.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.520
 Oh, wow.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.520
 Wow, the power of the patriarchy.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.520
 You can work for us if you take down your own people.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.520
 I was wondering if you were having affairs.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:03.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.520
 Have we ever mentioned the Hello Ladies?

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.520
 Hello.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.520
 Hello Ladies.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.520
 Hello Ladies.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.520
 Hello Ladies were a group of women.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.520
 They were in the battlefields of France.

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.520
 They were basically the operators who connect phone calls.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.520
 The telephone operating ladies, yeah.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.520
 We were doing it on the front lines.

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.520
 Oh, wow.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.520
 And so while being bombed,

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.520
 just connecting these phone lines

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.520
 to make sure that these crucial calls could be made back.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:25.520
 And at the height of it,

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:29.520
 the Hello Girls were connecting 150,000 calls a day.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.520
 And there was 223 in total that were doing that.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.520
 That's doing tons.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:35.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.520
 It's crazy.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.520
 But a lot of those were calls being made

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.520
 to a policewoman in Grantham.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.520
 Okay, what's she doing now?

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.520
 Well, did they look like they were friends

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.520
 or did they look like it was more serious?

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.520
 Yeah, and they annoyingly, after the war,

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.520
 they weren't considered for veteran status and benefits

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.520
 because they weren't seen as part of the military.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.520
 And it took until 1977.

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.520
 Oh, my God.

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:59.520
 The petitioning presidents constantly to get them

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.520
 any kind of compensation.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.520
 But they finally did it.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.520
 But they were essential to the war of the Hello Girls.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.520
 Yeah, you were there.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.520
 You know, yeah, you were at the front line.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.520
 You weren't there, though.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.520
 You were exactly, oh, my God, that's awful.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.520
 I've just got one more fact about balloons.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.520
 Yeah, go on.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.520
 There has only ever been one balloon hit-and-run accident

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.520
 in the UK.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.520
 Okay, amazing.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.520
 2004.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.520
 Yes.

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.520
 Are we talking hot air balloons?

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:23.520
 Yeah.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.520
 Wow.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.520
 Okam, Cumbria.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.520
 Retired couple sitting in their cottage having a nice time.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.520
 Suddenly, bang, hot air balloon.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.520
 Someone stole the chimney.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.520
 Smashes into their chimney and their roof and then flies off.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.520
 Oh, my God.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.520
 I know.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.520
 It was blue, yellow and red.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:45.520
 I'm going to say, in defence of whoever this was, if you're flying over,

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.520
 I used to live in there, if you're flying over and you're out of control enough

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:53.520
 that you hit a chimney, you're probably out of control enough that you can't stop.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.520
 To leave you details, yeah.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.520
 It's quite dangerous because around there they have quite a lot of ministry

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.520
 of difference flights they practice around there.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.520
 Do they?

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.520
 Yeah.

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.520
 Well, it's the only known, known balloon hit-and-run ever.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.520
 They never found.

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:08.520
 They still never...

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.520
 I didn't find a follow-up to the story.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.520
 Maybe they did.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.520
 So, that's interesting because only a couple of days ago,

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:16.520
 I watched a video on Instagram of a hot air balloon coming in close to it.

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:22.520
 There's a whole group of people picnicking on the side of, in this grassy bit of a hill.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.520
 And they all turn around and look at it.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.520
 Everyone gets up and they're filming it.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.520
 And it just keeps descending and keeps descending.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.520
 And it suddenly hits the ground and mows through all of them.

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.520
 They're all diving out the way.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.520
 Oh, my God.

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.520
 All their chairs go through.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.520
 No one's hit.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:35.520
 Everyone's okay.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.520
 And it takes off again and disappears off into the distance.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.520
 And I don't know if they got their details later.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.520
 So that might not count as a hit-and-run.

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.520
 But could you claim a picnic over a chimney?

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.520
 My picnic was ruined.

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.520
 If they put everything back together,

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.520
 they noticed there was one sausage roll missing.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.520
 Just grab it on the way out.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.520
 Just left a sausage skin.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.520
 Make your own balloon.

00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:05.520
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.520
 And that is my fact.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.520
 My fact this week is that Orson Welles's nose

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.520
 rarely made appearances in his movies.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.520
 Wow.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.520
 Can you give me some of his movies?

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.520
 Yeah.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.520
 Citizen Kane is perhaps...

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.520
 I've seen the Citizen Kane.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:22.520
 But I don't remember any noseless men in that.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.520
 Well, he was never noseless.

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.520
 Oh.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.520
 He never, yeah.

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.520
 He didn't...

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.520
 I mean, people would talk about Citizen Kane

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.520
 in a different way if there was no nose on his face.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.520
 Like he spends his whole time lusting over.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.520
 What was it?

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.520
 Rosebud.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.520
 He'd been memorialising Rosebud.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.520
 He'd be memorialising his nose.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.520
 Closebud, will I?

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.520
 No!

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.520
 Thank you.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.520
 I nearly started watching Citizen Kane last night.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.520
 Have you not seen it?

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.520
 No, I got quite tired.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.520
 It's incredible.

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.520
 It's incredible.

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.520
 Why, the only one who hasn't?

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.520
 Yeah.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.520
 Oh, the worm turns and builds his little nest down.

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.520
 Sorry, I'll keep going with that.

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.520
 He builds his little nest down and then realises

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.520
 this is full of shit from a ground on.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.520
 Carries on.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.520
 Actually absorbs it because that's his deal.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.520
 Have you caught what Citizen Kane is?

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.520
 It's classic.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.520
 I've seen a couple of his.

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.520
 What have you seen?

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.520
 The Magnificent Ambersons.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.520
 Oh, I haven't seen that.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.520
 Very much a B-side these days.

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.520
 Oh, okay.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.520
 It is great.

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.520
 The third man, which he did direct, he just is in.

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.520
 Yeah.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.520
 Oh, sorry, but he was such a direct, yeah.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.520
 Yeah, yeah, that's okay.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.520
 So, for the people that don't know, Orson Welles,

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.520
 Citizen Kane is often regarded as one of the

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.520
 greatest movies ever made.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.520
 I actually was surprised I went onto IMDb.

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.520
 I expected to see it behind Shawshank Redemption.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.520
 It was actually 95 on the top 100 list.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.520
 But I think, you know, there's three Avengers movies

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.520
 in that top 100 ahead of it.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.520
 So, I think that's been answered.

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.520
 Yeah, you went onto IMDb.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:38.520
 I think you'd check like Guardians Top Films.

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.520
 It was the Paddington two of its day.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.520
 Yeah.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.520
 It really was.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.520
 It absolutely was.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.520
 Orson Welles was, as Andy says, he was a director.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.520
 He was a writer.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.520
 He was an actor.

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.520
 He went from radio to stage to film, doing iconic

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.520
 things in every single place.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:57.520
 He supposedly created a national terror when he did

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.520
 War of the Worlds on radio.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.520
 That's been mythologized to be a lot worse than it

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.520
 actually was.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.520
 People, you know, claiming they thought aliens were

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.520
 really invading, were really kind of newspapers

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.520
 just bumping that up.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.520
 But one thing about him is that for someone who was

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.520
 so confident and he was known to be so balshy and

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.520
 people would talk about his rage and his passion,

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.520
 one thing he was absolutely insecure about was

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.520
 the size of his nose, which he thought hadn't

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.520
 really grown since childhood.

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.520
 And so every single movie that he did, except

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.520
 basically for one movie, as far as I can tell,

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.520
 which was The Third Man, he always had prosthetics

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.520
 on his nose and sometimes applying it himself,

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.520
 there's an account by a guy called Lewis Gilbert

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.520
 who was a director and he did a movie with him

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.520
 in 1959 called Fairy to Hong Kong.

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.520
 And he said that basically he would do his own nose

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.520
 and the problem was that his nose would be quite

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.520
 different shot to shot.

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.520
 Yeah, they said it was like wonky or green or...

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.520
 Yeah, sometimes it was tilting upwards, sometimes

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.520
 it was tilting downwards.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.520
 Occasionally it just went sideways.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.520
 It was not a consistent nose for the entire movie.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.520
 Yeah, I read one quote saying he said his nose had

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.520
 not grown one millimeter since infancy,

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.520
 which I don't believe it.

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.520
 Exactly.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.520
 There's no way he had an actual baby's nose.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.520
 I felt bad though, because when you do look at

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.520
 it, I was like, what? No, he doesn't.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.520
 And then I saw a picture of him without it and I was like,

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.520
 I guess it is small.

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.520
 I think it doesn't fit his personality,

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.520
 because he was known for being this like huge

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.520
 raconteur, character like absolute,

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:30.520
 almost I guess Brian Blessed style like fill the room.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.520
 It doesn't, you expect him to have a much bigger

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.520
 features and the rest of his features are quite big.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.520
 Not there's anything wrong with having a small nose.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.520
 He allegedly, he kept every fake nose.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.520
 And he had a glass case for each one.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.520
 And he also gave them all names.

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.520
 That's quite common in a prosthetic and wig

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.520
 world on TV.

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.520
 They sometimes give them names.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.520
 Really?

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.520
 Yeah, I don't know why.

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.520
 I guess because often you have to look after a wig.

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.520
 Like wash it and preen it and stuff.

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.520
 So you would give it.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.520
 It's not uncommon to give it a name.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.520
 Kerry, you've done a lot of sketch comedy on TV.

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.520
 Or sort of shows where you were a comedy character

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.520
 playing a celebrity, like murder and success.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.520
 Oh yeah.

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.520
 Have you ever worn a prosthetic nose?

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.520
 Yeah, I have.

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.520
 I'm trying to think now.

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.520
 I had to wear loads for murder successful,

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.520
 but I can't remember which one.

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:18.520
 I think for Cheryl Cole, I had to wear a prosthetic nose.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:22.520
 I think we called it Cheryl to be fair.

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.520
 He didn't call them the actual names.

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.520
 He looked very weird.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.520
 He was in a film called Touch of Evil.

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.520
 Oh yes.

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:28.520
 One of his classics.

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.520
 One of his classics.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.520
 He knows from that it's called Sandra.

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.520
 Oh, they always women's names.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.520
 One of the King Lear one was called Sloan Jr.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.520
 So I don't know if there's a character called

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.520
 Sandra in Touch of Evil, but there's no character

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.520
 called Sloan Jr. in King Lear.

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.520
 No, it's Gona Roll's brother.

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.520
 And actually when he was making that film,

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.520
 I think they lost his nose halfway through production

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.520
 and it had been posted and it hadn't come through.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.520
 And they basically halted production on this big Hollywood film

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.520
 while they searched every post office in Hong Kong for...

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:57.520
 To find his nose.

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.520
 And also was his father.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.520
 It was called Dickhead.

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.520
 His name was Richard Hedwells.

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.520
 I want to say that.

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:03.520
 Wow.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.520
 Yeah.

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.520
 Dick Hedwells.

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.520
 And he's pretty cool.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.520
 Also was his father.

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.520
 He was a kind of inventor and an engineer.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.520
 He invented a glider.

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.520
 Get this.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.520
 Which was attached to a steam engine on the ground.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:18.520
 Okay.

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.520
 So it's a plane whose engine is on the ground.

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.520
 The plane flies up there and then...

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.520
 You know what it feels like?

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.520
 What?

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.520
 You would have angular momentum on it.

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.520
 If you just try to go forward,

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.520
 you'd end up going in a circle like those fairground rides.

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.520
 Maybe.

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.520
 But it did not work.

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.520
 Well, maybe it worked, but it didn't...

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.520
 Didn't catch up.

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.520
 It didn't take off.

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:41.520
 Dan, you mentioned the War of the Whales thing.

00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.520
 Yeah.

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:45.520
 He came a bit depressed afterwards because he said that

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.520
 he had two lots of friends.

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:51.520
 One lot of friends had heard the recording and one lot hadn't.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.520
 And anyone who'd heard it would want to tell him everything

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.520
 what they thought about it.

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.520
 And anyone who hadn't heard it would tell him tediously

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:02.520
 why they hadn't been near a wireless on the day.

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.520
 So that everyone he spoke to all wanted to speak to him about that.

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.520
 Is that like how you guys feel?

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:09.520
 Like people just come up to you with facts or they go,

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.520
 "I've never definitely not only into podcasts."

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.520
 A lot more of the latter than the former, I have to say.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.520
 I read an interview with him from 1939 and he said

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:19.520
 that no one has said anything original about that broadcast

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.520
 for at least nine months.

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:22.520
 Wow.

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:26.520
 There's a weird coincidence which is that H.G. Wells was in America

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.520
 and he was driving around and he got lost.

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.520
 And so he pulls over and he goes, "Excuse me,

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.520
 so can you help me to find where I'm going?"

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.520
 And it's Orson Wells.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.520
 And they established that each other each other.

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.520
 And this was not long after Orson Wells had done

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:41.520
 the War of the Worlds.

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.520
 But of course he wasn't a big face back then, Orson Wells.

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.520
 He was a radio guy.

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.520
 He wasn't a big nose, that's for sure.

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.520
 You know, he couldn't have gone like,

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.520
 "Oh, I'm going to pretend I don't know who Orson Wells is."

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:54.520
 I wonder if H.G. Wells was recognizable.

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:56.520
 Quite possibly from the back of books.

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.520
 Were people just less recognizable back in the day?

00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.520
 Yeah, I guess so.

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.520
 You didn't have more, you didn't have

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.520
 author jacket photos in the same way that you do these days.

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.520
 And as we know,

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:05.520
 author jacket photos are not representative of what someone

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.520
 looks like in real life.

00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.520
 Excuse me?

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.520
 Holding up my book.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.520
 Okay, yours is, but most people are not.

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.520
 Thank you.

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.520
 I also read some newspaper articles from the day

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.520
 after the recording went out.

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.520
 To see, you know, did it happen?

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.520
 Or, you know, was this kind of craziness?

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.520
 Did it exist?

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.520
 And the Journal Times, I read,

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.520
 they collected articles from all over America

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.520
 about what had happened.

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.520
 And they said that Senator Clyde Herring of Iowa

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.520
 had called for more regulation of the press

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.520
 as a result of everyone thinking that the Martians

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.520
 had attacked, which is pretty typical.

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.520
 Apparently in New York,

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.520
 one person had called the police and said,

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:47.520
 "I want a gas mask. I'm a taxpayer."

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:50.520
 And the police had said that that had definitely happened.

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.520
 And there was a town of concrete,

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.520
 which is in Washington state.

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.520
 And apparently there was a power cut just at the moment

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:59.520
 the Martians put their death rays into action.

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.520
 And this was reported the day after it went out.

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.520
 So I think it did happen.

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.520
 But the thing was like,

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:06.520
 they did advertise that it was fiction.

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.520
 -They said right at the top. -Yeah.

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.520
 Awesome Wells comes on at the start and says,

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.520
 "This is fictional."

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.520
 And then they had four times in the middle,

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.520
 they said, "Just to remind you all, this is fictional."

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.520
 And then at the end, he comes on and says,

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.520
 "By the way, that was a play you just listened to."

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.520
 There was a good Radio 4 documentary

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.520
 about what happened and how to...

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.520
 I mean, there were people who obviously did lose their mind.

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:28.520
 -But it's a tempting myth. -Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.520
 Like the five stages.

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.520
 Oh, guys.

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.520
 Like it's nice to believe that that would be true.

00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.520
 Yeah, it's just kind of nice to believe

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.520
 that people back in the day were so stupid

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.520
 they didn't understand radio.

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.520
 "Oh, we've come a long way, we understand radio now."

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.520
 Wells...

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:48.520
 So, Dan, you mentioned his most famous film appearance, maybe.

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.520
 And certainly maybe the one he's most famous for these days

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.520
 is in The Third Man, where he...

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.520
 It's in Vienna, it's after the Second World War,

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.520
 and it's an amazing...

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.520
 That is unmissable.

00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:01.520
 And there's a big scene, there's a scene in the sewers of Vienna

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.520
 where they're chasing, he's playing this mysterious

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:08.520
 sort of black market dealer and, you know, crook.

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:11.520
 And he's very, very dodgy.

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.520
 But they did the filming in the sewers of Vienna,

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.520
 and they all went down there.

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.520
 They were actually very clean in lots of places,

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.520
 and the director had his coffee brought down to him

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.520
 on a silver tray by a waiter from one of the old Viennese cafes.

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:26.520
 You know, the only person who refused to go down into the sewers...

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.520
 -Awesome Wells. -Awesome Wells.

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:32.520
 And they had to build a fake sewer in Sheperton.

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:33.520
 Wow.

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.520
 Is that the famous shot of him, though, in that really, like,

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.520
 the really white circle, and it's him in it?

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.520
 It's either a body double, or it's Sheperton,

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:42.520
 and everyone else had filmed their bits in Vienna.

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.520
 Yeah, I know, but...

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.520
 He wouldn't have been able to smell it anyway with his...

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.520
 Yeah, he certainly knows.

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.520
 I mean, he was at, like, I can't remember what film it was,

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.520
 but it was filmed in the Deep South, and that actress was quoted as saying,

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.520
 like, it was so hot and sweaty that his nose was, like, falling off.

00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.520
 My nose is running.

00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.520
 But, like, he was...

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.520
 If he was a woman, he'd be called a diva.

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.520
 Like, the things he would refuse to do.

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.520
 -He was a divo. -He was a divo, yeah.

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.520
 And the guy... I think it's the guy who plays Yago, or Casio,

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.520
 wrote a whole book about the experience of filming a fellow

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.520
 of, like, how insane and awful it was.

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:16.520
 Like, that was his... kind of made his money on this.

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:18.520
 Yeah, called Casio.

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.520
 Yeah. So, one that loves Desmondo and starts off all the trouble.

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.520
 He's the one who has that great line, "Beep." Yeah?

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:29.520
 Yes, Andrew. Yes, fellow English literature scholar, yes.

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.520
 Oh, apparently when he was directing Othello...

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.520
 -Was that a film? -Othello's a film, yeah, yeah.

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.520
 Yeah, it's a great film. It's really interesting.

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:39.520
 I think he might have also staged a stage version of Othello,

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:41.520
 because apparently when he was directing that,

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.520
 he would push the actors around the stage with a 20-foot pole,

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:49.520
 shouting, "To hell with the method! This is the Wells Way! Act, you sons of bitches!"

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.520
 Amazing. Do you know where Orson Wells is buried?

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:54.520
 -No. -No.

00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.520
 He's buried...

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.520
 -Yeah, could we guess? -Yeah, have a guess.

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:00.520
 -Oh. -Oh.

00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:02.520
 This is the most famous cemetery I could think of.

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.520
 -That's in Paris. -Okay, let me rephrase...

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.520
 No, no, no, no, no. You'll like this.

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.520
 You'll like this. I'm going to rephrase the question,

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.520
 because this is actually the wrong angle.

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.520
 Remember a few weeks ago, when we had Sarah Pasco on,

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:17.520
 we talked about the guy who invented Pringles being buried in a Pringles...

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.520
 -Tube. -Tube.

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:22.520
 Okay. So, where is Orson Wells buried?

00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.520
 -In a film canister. -In a film canister.

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.520
 -In the Hollywood Hills. -Oh, that's very good.

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.520
 He's in the Hollywood sign. They poured him in.

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.520
 -Into the O. -Into the O.

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:35.520
 Oh, yeah, yeah, all the three, guys.

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.520
 -In a well. -Orson Wells is in a well.

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.520
 -Is it? -He's in a well.

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.520
 James got it. James got it.

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.520
 -No way. -He's buried.

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.520
 This is years after his death.

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:48.520
 His daughter brought the ashes of him to Malaga in Spain,

00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:51.520
 to a place called Ronda, where he's now on the property

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:55.520
 of a retired bullfighter who he really liked.

00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.520
 -I've been to Ronda quite recently. -Have you?

00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.520
 Yeah. That's the end of the anecdote.

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.520
 Okay. Orson Wells is in a well.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.520
 -Wow. -In Malaga.

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.520
 Yeah. Lovely city, Malaga.

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.520
 Is that the end of the anecdote?

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.520
 It's surprising, because you think, like,

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.520
 you associated with Package Holiday especially,

00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:13.520
 since he's really nice.

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:18.520
 It's incredible. The cathedral is called La Manquita, I think,

00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.520
 which means the woman with one arm.

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.520
 And it's because it's got two towers, the cathedral,

00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.520
 but only one of them was completed.

00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:26.520
 -Wow. -So one of them is shorter than the other.

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:28.520
 -Simon Callow, the actor. -Yes.

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:31.520
 He is maybe one of the biggest wells experts on the planet,

00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:34.520
 because he's currently writing a biography of Orson Wells.

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:37.520
 He started working on it in 1989,

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.520
 when Orson Wells had been dead a few years.

00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:41.520
 He thought, "I'll do two volumes, take about three years.

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.520
 1992, be done." Great.

00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.520
 Book one was published in 1995.

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:47.520
 Okay, took a bit longer. Fine.

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.520
 Book one, fine. Book two.

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.520
 Volume two was in 2006.

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.520
 Volume three came out in 2015,

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.520
 and he's now working on volume four.

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:57.520
 -Wow. -It's such a huge project.

00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:59.520
 He's saying he's done other stuff in between.

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.520
 [laughter]

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.520
 Four weddings and a few roles in there at some point.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.520
 -He's a busy man. -Pop idol.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.520
 -Is that him? -No, no, no, no.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.520
 Who among us doesn't make that mistake?

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.520
 I always make that mistake.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.520
 When it goes to him at the Judges' Chair,

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.520
 he's surrounded by books on wells,

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.520
 and he's conducting interviews.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.520
 [music playing]

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:24.520
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.520
 Thank you so much for listening.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.520
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.520
 about the things we've said over the course of this podcast,

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.520
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.520
 I'm on @Shrieberland, Andy...

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.520
 @AndrewHunterM, James...

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.520
 @JamesHurkin.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.520
 ...and @Cariad.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:40.520
 @LadyCariad, 'cause I did it a long time ago.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.520
 Because of your dayhood.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.520
 Or @CariadLoyd on Instagram.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.520
 That's all I am.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.520
 Right, and you can also get us on @NoSuchThing.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.520
 Or go to our website, NoSuchThingasafish.com

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.520
 and check out all of our previous episodes.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.520
 But most important of all,

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.520
 get yourself to an online bookshop

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.520
 or a real bookshop to pick up You Are Not Alone.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.520
 Cariad's book all about grief,

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.520
 and it's tied in with her podcast, Griefcast.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.520
 So give that a listen as well.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.520
 I'm sure you have already, but get back to it this week.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.520
 Has anyone died? Get back in there, guys.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.520
 But that's it for us for now.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.520
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.520
 We'll see you then. Goodbye.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:18.100
 (upbeat music)

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.680
 (upbeat music)

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.260
 (upbeat music)

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.840
