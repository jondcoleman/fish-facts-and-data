00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.520

 You do not need a record player to be able to play anything that's available on this

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.840
 vinyl.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.600
 You can just pin it to your wall, go online and actually listen like a modern human if

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.600
 you like.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.360
 What do you know about being a modern human?

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.200
 But here is something and the bonus episode is also available online on iTunes and all

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.880
 And we've been told that if enough listeners download it, we have a natural chance of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.920
 getting into the UK album charts.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.920
 Yes.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.640
 And we will perform live on top of the pops.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.640
 Is that sort of thing?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.000
 You know how I was saying about you, not being a modern human.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 OK, I'm with the show.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 [MUSIC]

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:26.400
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.920
 This week coming to you from the Lyric Theatre in London's West End.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.840
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and please welcome to the stage the three regular elves.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.320
 It's Andy Murray, Anna Chazinsky, and James Harkin.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.640
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.840
 the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.160
 Starting with you, Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.680
 My fact this week is that Lord Byron's nickname for William Wordsworth was "William Terzworth."

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.840
 He had a way with words, he was an engineer.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.920
 They were living in the same time, they were mates.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.920
 Well, they weren't mates.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.920
 They weren't at all.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 Yeah.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.360
 Byron thought Wordsworth was very boring, and so he called him that.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.160
 There's this whole cache of letters they've just found from Lord Byron to a friend of his.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.480
 It was a clergyman.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.480
 And yeah, he happens to slag off Wordsworth as Terzworth, and there you go.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.520
 I was quite surprised that the word "Therz" existed so far back.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.520
 Really?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520
 Yeah.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.760
 Did you-- I thought of it as more of a modern thing.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.800
 I don't think of it as a word like hyperlink or--

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.440
 I thought they were exactly the same thing.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.600
 I have a look on Hansard, which is the House of Parliament kind of transcripts, and nobody

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.880
 has ever directly called another MP a "Therz" in the entire history of Parliament.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.600
 The closest anyone came was in a hunting debate a few years ago, when the MP for Worcester,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.800
 Michael Foster, was described as a nasty snide little "Therz," but in that case the MP was

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.880
 quoting Harry M. Field, so it didn't look like that directly.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.640
 I think you're still calling someone something when you're quoting someone else.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.640
 Yeah.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.640
 He was saying, isn't it bad that they called him this?

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640
 Yeah, basically.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.520
 You're a real dickhead, said Rick Maill in bottom.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.080
 It's so called on the guy a dickhead.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.400
 The world record for uttering the word "Therz" in Parliament.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.400
 What?

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.400
 World record.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.880
 Well, it's not really a world record.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.360
 But most world records, you have to bring someone to record it, especially in, so that must

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.520
 have been a phone call where they said, "I've got a big idea I want to do in Parliament

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520
 today.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.520
 Are you up for calming?

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.520
 Is it frequency or volume?"

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.520
 It was frequency.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.280
 Frequency is Tony Banks, the former Minister for Sport, and he said, "It's three times

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.320
 in two years in the late 80s."

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.320
 So it's very visible.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.080
 Yeah, you could say it ten times in ten seconds if you wanted to.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.080
 It's true.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.320
 All I'm saying to the current MPs that there is a chance of breaking that record.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.320
 Yeah.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.880
 There was one time where he said, "I've read every time MP has ever said "Therz" and there

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.760
 was one when Tony Banks said it and he said, "There was an occasion when I walked around

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.160
 the corner and was faced with a terrible dilemma of seeing a £1 coin embedded in a dog

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.640
 turd."

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.400
 And then he said, "I managed to find a small boy who for 50p was prepared to meet you."

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.240
 Bill, were they debating at the time?

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.800
 It was about dog mess on the streets.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.800
 OK.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.000
 George Bush used to call Carl Rove, "Therz Blossom," didn't he?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Yeah.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Chief of Staff, Carl Rove, but it was a compliment.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 OK.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.520
 So Turd Blossom is a flower, apparently, in California, wherever that grows out of shit.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.560
 And George Bush said, "You know, you're so great, Carl Rove, you can turn a bad thing

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.560
 into a good thing."

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.560
 So you're Turd Blossom.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.760
 Also, I reckon that was an emergency meeting with the biggest minds of America going,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.920
 "OK, I just called Carl Rove Turd Blossom.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.760
 I just want to turn this around on its head."

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.920
 I just got one more thing from Hansard.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.520
 I was so hoping to talk about Lord Byron about romantic verse.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.040
 Yeah, well, tough.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.680
 The first time that ever anyone said "twat" in Parliament was a guy called Bill Cash.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:25.000
 And he described Field Marshal Lord Carver as a boring old twat in 1986.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 And the second use of the word "twat" was immediately afterwards with an unnamed MP shouting,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.240
 "He said "twat!"

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:44.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.120
 Byron liked insult, his fellow poets a lot, didn't he?

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.720
 And if it all romantic poets had all these rivalries between them, but he said about Keith,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.800
 he wrote "piss a bed poetry," which I don't know what that means.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.560
 Like, did it mean you were the best when you read it?

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.400
 Well, "piss a bed" was an old name for Dundee Lion, so maybe it was another question.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.320
 I just didn't feel judging by the tone of it.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.560
 And he goes on to say, "No more keats I entreat, flay him alive.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.960
 If some of you don't, I must skin him myself.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.800
 There is no bearing the driveling idiotism of the mankin."

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.240
 So I don't think he was calling him a fan.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.880
 I don't know if I called that, I must say.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.800
 He also said that his writing was a sort of mental masturbation.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.400
 Wow.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.280
 I think he meant it, yeah.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.120
 I have quite a good thing on a literary feud, which happened.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.360
 So, A.N. Wilson, he's a famous author, and he was writing a book about John Becherman,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.600
 just decades ago.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.360
 And so was another person called Bevis Hylia, and A.N. Wilson was so rude about Bevis Hylia's

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.680
 book, which came out first in a review.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.680
 And when he was writing his, a little while later, he got this letter from a mysterious

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.720
 French woman, which included this, like, gold dust for interviewers.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.440
 It was a hitherto unknown copy of a letter from John Becherman to one of his mistresses.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.440
 And Wilson was so excited, and he printed the letter in full in his book, only for Bevis

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.240
 Hylia to reveal that he had sent the letter, and that it was an acrostic, and that the first

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:15.080
 letter of every sentence spelt out, A.N. Wilson is a shit.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.200
 I put it in his own book.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.800
 I found out something really rude about Lord Byron.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.080
 When he died, he was buried in a really odd way.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.000
 They removed his organs, and they put them in jars, and it was in a different country.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 And when he came back, he was buried, and they weren't quite sure if it was definitely

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 him.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.360
 And so someone wanted to find out.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.960
 And they made a discovery that not many people have spoken about.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.360
 So this was the sentence, basically, before replacing the lid, the vicar, who was the person

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.320
 who was looking for him, noted that his sexual organ showed quite abnormal development.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.760
 He began to tap the spot just above Byron's knee, and he said, he was built like a pony.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:04.440
 That was in the tomb, that's not a horse.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.880
 You know, we're being really critical.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:14.320
 So when they got his body out of the tomb, there was seven people present.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.880
 So there was Thomas Gerard Barber, who was the canon of the church.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:24.240
 He was an unnamed doctor, a surveyor called Nathaniel Lane, a local archaeologist, a photographer

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.280
 called Mr. Bullock, and the local MP was there, and I promise you, this was his actual name.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.840
 He was called Frederick Seymour Cox.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.840
 No.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.840
 No.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.840
 I promise.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.840
 Honestly.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.840
 That's his name, honestly.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.840
 You know what they say?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.840
 Seymour Cox, my name.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:51.080
 Byron didn't wonder where, apparently, and apparently this is what was fashionable.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.040
 Just can't find them in his size.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.280
 Do you have that in pony?

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.080
 No, that was, and the reason was, and it was common, like people like Bob Rommel and

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.040
 other fashionable people in Byron's era weren't wearing pants either, and it was because

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.400
 tight trousers were in fashion at the time, and it was to avoid VPL, do people still

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.400
 say VPL?

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.320
 They used to say when I was at school.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.320
 What's VPL?

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.520
 A visible panty line.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.960
 They didn't say it was to avoid that.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.120
 The historian, who's book I was reading, said, "The line of the trousers was not to be interrupted

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.720
 by underwear, and so he largely didn't wear any underwear."

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.480
 He bought white linen trousers and batches of 24 at a time.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.480
 Wow.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.080
 What was he doing to them?

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.480
 Going through them.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:40.280
 I did not think this fact would be this penicy, and I like to put them on the record.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.640
 We're going to have to move on very soon to our next facts.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.640
 Oh, really?

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.640
 Yeah.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.640
 Do anything before we do?

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.640
 I have a fact about nicknames.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.640
 Okay.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.640
 Yeah.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:57.360
 At least ten kings of Serbia had the nickname "The Crowned," as all they could think of for

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.360
 them.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.360
 It's imaginative.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.760
 My favorite nickname of all time, there was a guy called Leo II, he was Roman Emperor, and

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.680
 he was known as Leo the Butcher.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.160
 That's not my favorite one.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.880
 He was called the Butcher because he killed the patriarch of Alexandra's supporters, and

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:17.000
 he was called Timothy the Cat, but that's not my favorite either.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.280
 Because Timothy the Cat had replaced another guy called Timothy Wobble-Hat, and nobody

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.720
 knows why he was called Timothy Wobble-Hat.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.480
 There's two main theories.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.840
 One of them is that he flip-flopped between religious positions, and the other one is

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:39.600
 he had a Wobble-Hat.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.840
 Okay, let's move on to our second fact.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.960
 It's time for our second fact, and that is James Harkin.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.960
 Okay.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:55.400
 My fact this week is that if you grow a cost lettuce on a spaceship, it tastes like rocket.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:01.880
 Yeah, so this is the first ever lettuce that's been grown in space.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.880
 It was a red-remain lettuce, which is also known as a cos lettuce, and astronaut Scott Kelly

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.200
 said it tastes good, kind of like arugula, and in this country we call arugula rocket.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.000
 It's weird that he didn't manage to make that leap, though, from arugula to the word rocket

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.360
 as someone living on a rocket.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:26.360
 They called it, apparently, at the time, a giant leaf for mankind.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.660
 Also, when they ate it, apparently, because they had to freeze half of them, I think, to

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.060
 return to earth for studies if they picked up any radiation or any microorganisms or anything.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.700
 But they also ate the other half, and they were really happy of it, and they put extra virgin

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.900
 olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the leaves, but they had already cleaned the leaves with

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.900
 sanitizing wipes.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:50.740
 I don't know why they're both mentioning that, because that's just normal, isn't it?

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.300
 Do you know the thing that astronauts most like to eat in space?

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.300
 You'll know this.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.660
 Almost every single astronaut who comes back from space says, "So there's a bunch of staple

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.660
 meals that you get given in space."

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.460
 I think they have their meals repeated every eight days, so you've got eight days worth of

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.780
 meals, and then you have to go back to the start.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:11.740
 The one that they all love is Broncoctel, and they all rave about it, so Chris Hadfield,

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.340
 Jim Riley, Jim Lovell, they all say that Jim Cocktail is their favourite.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.380
 There was one astronaut who said that he, because the astronauts choose their menus before

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.380
 they go out into space.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.460
 If you're out there for a year, you have to write down what you want, there's a big commitment.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.380
 He said he has a word with the astronauts before they're about to go out into space,

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.740
 saying, "Make sure you do the Broncoctel, because I'm not going to be giving you any of mine

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.740
 in space."

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.940
 You're going to really, really want it.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:34.940
 But apparently it's delicious.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:39.460
 One thing they do like is really spicy foods, or very flavoursome foods, and the reason for

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:45.020
 that is because the blood goes into your sinuses, because no gravity is such, and you can't

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.780
 really taste things properly.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:51.260
 I did a radio show which we had Helen Sharman on earlier this year.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.300
 Helen Sharman, first British astronaut into space.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.300
 Yeah.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.300
 Back to you, Jamesy.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:02.020
 And she said that when she went into space, she was warned.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.620
 Basically, the Russians are going to have loads and loads of garlic, and the Americans are

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.380
 going to have loads and loads of chili.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.620
 And when you go up there, it is going to smell bad.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.380
 And apparently you're warned not to say anything.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.220
 When you go up there, just pretend that you can't smell it, because these people haven't

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.340
 seen a human for months and months, and the last thing they want to do is you come in

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.340
 and go...

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.340
 Fucking hell.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:26.220
 Someone opened a window.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:31.220
 You know how if you go into places like the Science Museum, or anywhere that has astronaut-based

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.660
 products, you always buy astronaut ice cream.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.660
 Astronaut-based products.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.660
 Astronaut-based products?

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.820
 And Stainsbury, in that section, you tell me where the astronaut products are.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:49.500
 Well, try IL-10, nine, eight.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:55.340
 So anyway, so you know, astronaut ice cream is a massive thing and everyone buys it, and

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.020
 we all eat it, and we go, "This tastes horrible, but they eat it in space."

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:04.060
 It turns out that astronaut ice cream was used for one mission, and it was in 1968.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.060
 No one liked it.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.060
 It was too crumbly.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.660
 It's never been out back again.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.740
 And so the makers of it went, "Well, what do we do with this?

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.140
 Let's just pretend it's still a thing."

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.660
 So every time anyone eats it and goes, "This tastes terrible, but oh, doesn't it feel

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.660
 like space?"

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.660
 No one's eating it.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.660
 It didn't work.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.660
 It's a failed product.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.220
 When do you say everyone buys it and eats it?

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.220
 Out of interest.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.020
 I come to my family for Christmas.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.740
 There are plans to farm in space.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.700
 One of the advantages apparently, so it's good at the idea of farming in space for various

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:37.220
 reasons, but one of them is that the Veggie project, which is what this is part of, could

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:42.140
 be used by astronauts in space for recreational gardening during the long-duration missions,

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.820
 which I quite like, because they all have their own allotments.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:50.860
 They are NASA once shipped a specific bit of fruit up into space because they wanted

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.500
 to do an experiment and attribute to Isaac Newton.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:00.020
 So they sent up a bit of the tree that Newton had the idea under, and they sent it up with

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.200
 an apple because they thought, "Oh, this would be great," film a video of not only the bit

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.220
 of the tree that taught us about gravity, but also an apple.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.620
 So they brought it up and they were all set to film, and it was looking like it was going

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.860
 to be an amazing video to put online.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.620
 And as they were about to film, they forgot to tell one of the astronauts that they were

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:20.580
 doing that, who suddenly saw this floating apple going, "Oh, God, there's an apple."

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:27.140
 She ate the apple, and they went, "Where's our apple?" and she went, "Hm?"

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:32.060
 And then they had to film the video with a pair.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.660
 You can see on YouTube there's a pair floating in space, and they don't mention it.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.900
 They're like, "Wow!"

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:44.140
 The first ever Swedish astronaut was a guy called Krista Fugelsang, and he tried to take

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.580
 reindeer meat into space because it was around Christmas time, and it's a delicacy, but

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.340
 he was told it wasn't very Christmasy.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.340
 To eat reindeer.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:58.980
 Yeah, it's like bringing a piece of Santa Claus up to the end.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:05.900
 So on lettuce, lettuce has been an aphrodisiac for three thousand years, apparently.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.900
 And the reason is, I didn't realise this, so part of it is because of its upright kind

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:14.060
 of phallic structure, so it was considered an aphrodisiac in ancient Egypt, and continued

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.340
 to be considered that throughout Rome and Greece, and it's because it's got this upright

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:21.780
 structure, and also it's the Krista latex, at the bottom of it, which it oozes like white

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.780
 liquid when you cut it.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.900
 Wait, hang on, did you say it's the Krista at the base?

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.900
 Yes.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.900
 Well, that's one point of difference.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.900
 Right.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:37.180
 If you're listening to this, and that sounds like you, you need to contact a doctor immediately.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.620
 Of course, it's green.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.020
 But supposedly we've bred it, so it's much more domesticated, and we sort of tamed

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.980
 the wild lettuce, which did have all these sort of sexy connotations, and we've now got

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.380
 really boring iceberg lettuce and things like that, which are not sexy at all, then they're

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.380
 not.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.380
 Yeah, because it was too rude before.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.380
 Yeah.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.380
 It was postcard for your stuff.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.620
 Um, I found a couple of foods in space that are not food.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.620
 Okay.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.620
 Yes, explain.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:07.860
 So, the process of falling into a black hole is called spaghettification.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.860
 Yeah.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.580
 That's an actual scientific word, and the idea is that when you fall into a black hole,

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:16.700
 as you may do, you get stretched out, longer and longer like spaghetti.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.700
 Yeah.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.220
 And so some scientists just said that's spaghettification.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.380
 Yeah, the tidal forces end up stretching you like spaghetti, yeah.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.380
 Yes.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.380
 So, that's what spaghetti is.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.380
 Yes.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.380
 That's what spaghetti is.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.380
 That's how we get spaghetti.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.380
 I'm giving up.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.820
 The other one I found is that in the US Army, there was a program back in the day, a

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:40.140
 future weapons office, for in case we colonise the moon, and they invented a sausage

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.140
 gun.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.140
 What?

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.140
 Wait.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.140
 What?

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.780
 It didn't shoot sausages, but it did a process whereby you make sausages coming out of the

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.780
 gun.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:53.060
 And there was an actual thing that the Pentagon worked out and said that once the war gets

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.380
 way enhanced and we're all on the moon fighting, you're going to need your sausage gun.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.380
 It's not exciting.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.380
 So, does that have anything to do with sausages?

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.380
 There's no sausages.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.380
 It's not made of a gun.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.380
 The gun's not made of sausages.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.220
 To be honest, I stop reading when it's so sausage-cars, so.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.740
 That's pretty exciting there, doesn't it?

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.620
 A sausage gun's on the moon.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.380
 It's time for our third fact of the evening, and that is my fact.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:27.180
 My fact this week is that scientists have grown an ear using Van Gogh's DNA.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.180
 Yeah!

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.220
 Okay, so this is what it was.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:36.620
 It was an artist decided that they wanted to do a project where they could regrow an

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:44.060
 ear and they found, on the back of a stamp, some saliva from Van Gogh and they used it and

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:49.380
 they contacted one of the great, great, great nephews of Van Gogh and they managed to get

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:54.860
 some of their cells off them and they created a kind of scaffolding and they regrown the ear,

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.380
 the left-hand side ear that would have been sliced off when he sliced it off, that's amazing.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:04.300
 Oh, we totally are 100% sure that whoever it was that stole Van Gogh's ear in the first

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:08.380
 place, hasn't been burying this burden of guilt for the last 150 years and thought I've got

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:13.940
 to let it out and they've just put it on the market and said, "I'll grow it."

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.540
 But no one knows what happened to it, right?

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.500
 Was it not supposed to be given to our prostitutes?

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.620
 Well, yeah, so it's thought they gave it to our prostitute, but there's another theory

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.100
 that Gogan chopped it off.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.020
 So I think Gogan was living with Van Gogh at the time and I think Van Gogh likes Gogan

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:31.860
 more than Gogan like Van Gogh and Gogan was also like an, you know, ardent fencer and

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.060
 they used to have a lot of fights.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.540
 And so people at Peace together said that what happened is they had a fight, Gogan chopped

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.500
 Van Gogh's ear off and then Van Gogh was such a needy, weird housemate and Gogan wanted to

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.340
 move out anyway and he was like, "It's alright, I won't tell anyone.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.500
 I'll just say that I chopped off my own ear and I sent it to a prostitute.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.340
 Is that what you say if I do that?"

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.820
 And that's a genuine theory.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:53.820
 Yeah.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:20:01.220
 I've had arguments with housemates before and it sounds plausible.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:05.460
 You know you can get a disappearing ear Van Gogh mug.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.500
 When you pour in hot water, his ear disappears.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.500
 Oh!

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.500
 Disappoints by bandage.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.500
 It's really cool.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.500
 Oh, that's really cool.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.500
 I think what I'm saying is wrong.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.500
 It should be Van Gogh.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.500
 Something.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.500
 Van Gogh.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.500
 Yeah.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.180
 So it's very hard to say his name.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:24.220
 A very old thing that happened on this episode was that I once said in a fact Van Gogh

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.620
 because that's what I thought his name was.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.500
 And we got, I got a tweet when the show went out and I just, I just want to read you the

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.500
 tweet.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.500
 Episode 28.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:37.300
 At 10 minutes, 55 seconds.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:46.540
 Why did you incredibly stupidly and ignorantly say Van Gogh instead of Van Gogh?

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:51.420
 And then I wrote back to him because I was really angry but I wrote back to him saying sorry

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:55.460
 and wait till he hear how I say Covert Garden.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:02.860
 What I wanted to say was, go fuck yourself.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:12.580
 So on ears, a woman recently grew an ear on her arm and that was because she'd had a kind

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:17.540
 of skin cancer that meant her ear had, she didn't have an ear anymore, and she wanted to regenerate

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.620
 her ear and so it was grown on her arm as does sometimes happen.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:25.020
 So there's another guy in China I think who had a nose grown on his forehead which if you

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:29.280
 Google image it is very impressive and you know it was used to replace his nose a couple of

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.280
 months later.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.020
 Anyway this woman had an ear grown on her arm and it was in order to be transplanted back

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.820
 on to where her ear should be a couple of months later.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.180
 So the surgeon who did it said she had some fun with it.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:46.860
 If the kids got into trouble, she'd roll up her sleeve and say tell it to the arm.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:53.300
 In 2009, this is a news article, doctors have saved the woman's severed lobe by stitching

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.680
 it to her bottom.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:01.660
 Julia Schwarz's right ear was bitten off by her best friend in a fight over a lover and

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.420
 they stitched it onto her ass and kept it there until they could pull it because she had too

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.220
 much scouring that they couldn't pull it on straight away so they stitched it onto her

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.220
 ass.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.220
 But why the ass?

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:14.740
 It's about availability of blood vessels and availability of skin, there's a lot of skin

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:15.740
 on your ass.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:16.740
 All right.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.220
 There was someone else here.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:29.140
 I really enjoyed this, I can't remember what paper it was in, but it was someone who designed

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:34.140
 a mechanical or something who cut off the tip of his finger or half of his finger and had

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.140
 to have it regrown.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.420
 Again, they thought let's try and regrow this on a part of your body so that it gets fed

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.460
 by the blood vessels and so that the muscle can be grown and the skin can grow around it.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:49.460
 And so they sewed his finger onto his stomach, but I think I read this article on maybe the

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:53.740
 Huffington Post and on the picture of it, they've blacked out like you would if someone was

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:59.500
 showing their penis or something, they've blacked out the bit where you see the finger grafted

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.420
 onto the stomach and then you can only see it if you scroll right down to the bottom and

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:07.100
 there's a big black box over and I think it because it does look a bit phallic, but it's

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.940
 not a penis, it's just a finger on somebody's stomach.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:15.580
 Well you say it looks like a penis, does it have white stuff coming from the base?

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:21.300
 I was when I was looking into Van Gogh, there's a Van Gogh, there's a theory, there's an actual

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:27.860
 theory that he used to paint at night with candles on his hat so that he could see in the evening.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:32.060
 And his nickname was Flamie Hat.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:36.340
 There are many theories as to why.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.300
 Can I mention another thing about this ear, which is really exciting.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.660
 So because it was done by an artist, you can actually visit the ear that's been grown.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:49.940
 It's a New York City and they've done it in a way that you can talk to the ear and I don't

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.940
 fully understand the science of it, but-

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.500
 It can't hear anything by the way.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:59.180
 Well from what I gather, when you talk to it, the ear kind of slightly moves in a way that

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:03.860
 it's going, no, it responds to what you're saying.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:08.740
 And the first person to speak to this ear when it was initially debuted in Germany was

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:14.300
 Nome Chomsky, that's a Nome Chomsky, and then the ear went, "Wow!" and we don't know what

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.300
 he said.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.140
 But a really cool thing about this work of art is that it's called Sugar Babe.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:23.700
 The idea is that it's about the philosophical argument called the Ship of Theesius, right?

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:28.460
 Which is if you replace every bit of a ship one by one, at what point is it no longer the

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.700
 original ship?

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:35.220
 And this applies to the band The Sugar Babes.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:42.020
 Can I just, I have something so cool on acoustics, which I didn't know, and which is sounds only

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:47.340
 ten as you're related, but you know hearing trumpets, ear trumpets that they used to use before

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.740
 hearing aids were invented.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.860
 The reason they were invented, it was in the 17th century, and it was because Puritan

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:58.180
 couples in America, when they went out to dine with each other, they wanted to have private

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.140
 conversations, but they had to sit opposite each other because there was no intimacy allowed.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.940
 And so they sat opposite each other, but they wanted to have private conversations, they

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:09.900
 launched you, you know, chats or whatever, and so the ear trumpet was apparently invented

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.180
 in order that he could be sitting there with your boyfriend and he could be saying into

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:19.740
 this end of the trumpet, you know, I really want to have sex with you.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:28.500
 I wish that all adult chattelines were starved by women with ear trumpets.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.100
 Can I tell you one cool thing about ears?

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.100
 Yes, please.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:37.660
 Butterflies have ears on their wings, and complete with ear drums, their proper ears, but they

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:42.020
 use them to hear bats ultrasound, and when scientists play ultrasound to butterflies, they

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:48.100
 start flying in crazy patterns, sort of doing evasion tactics to get away from a predator,

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.660
 and butterflies evolved at the same time that bats developed the ability to use echolocation

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.100
 and develop their big ears.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:26:00.460
 And the theory is that butterflies started flying in a daytime to avoid bats, or in other

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.980
 words, bats invented butterflies.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:11.420
 Let's move on to our final fact of the show, and that is Anichaczynski.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:17.780
 Yeah, my fact is that the larger Pacific striped octopus catches its prey by sneaking up

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.940
 behind it and tapping it on the shoulder.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.460
 Yeah, this has only just been documented this behaviour.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:29.740
 Well, it was actually documented once in the 1970s, and a biologist wrote a report on it.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.980
 No one believed it, and it was ignored, and it's only just been rediscovered, the behaviour

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.020
 of the larger Pacific striped octopus.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:40.660
 But the way that it hunts is, it sneaks up, it's called a slow bounce.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:46.540
 So it's like a grandmother's footsteps, and it sits there hiding on the sand.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:51.820
 It's only small, it's only a few inches big, and it's chasing a shrimp, and it will sneak

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.060
 a bit further and further up behind it when the shrimp can't see, and eventually, when

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:59.300
 it's close enough, it gets one of its tentacles, or its arms, or its legs, or whatever you want

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:04.900
 to call them, and it gets its leg around to the front of the shrimp, and it prods it here,

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.060
 and then the shrimp's like, "Oh, fuck, there's a predator here!" and it rebounds right

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.900
 back into his mouth.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.620
 And that's how it does it.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.620
 That's amazing.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.620
 It's so cool.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.620
 Look it up.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.220
 There's a video of it, which is excellent of an octopus sneaking up on a shrimp.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.820
 Another thing octopus does do, this is so cool.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.140
 They fling sand or debris in each other's faces when they're fighting, so you know scenes

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:28.220
 of films where the villain throws some sand into the hero's eyes.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.220
 They do that.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.300
 Oh my god, down at every movie.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:38.740
 They don't see the gut, the bad and the octopus.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.620
 But they do it with shells and debris, like hard shells and debris as well.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:49.140
 So they have a kind of water ejector system, which means they pick up a shell, and they

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:54.300
 propel it with this water ejector system at their enemies, and knock them unconsciously.

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.100
 So, yeah, this is actually amazing.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.580
 You mentioned this age ago in the office.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:03.060
 So they throw a shell and then they have this water pistol that launches the shell behind

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.060
 it.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:12.020
 So it picks up speed like a bullet towards like a sausage bullet, like a moon sausage bullets.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.220
 They also, by the way, they carry armor with them.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:20.860
 So if they're going into battle, or if they predict battle may happen to them, they carry

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:26.420
 coconut shells, often two at a time, and they will travel on the seabed.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.900
 So the enemies think they're a horse.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:36.420
 But they genuinely have coconuts, and they have the shells, and then as soon as the enemy

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.580
 started attacking, they'll bring the coconut shells up over them, like, "I swear to god,

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:41.580
 this is true."

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.580
 It is amazing to watch.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.580
 Again, videos of that aren't there, and they pull the coconut shells in to create one

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:46.580
 coconut.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.820
 But if you try to drink the milk from inside it, there's an octopus.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.260
 They seem to have personalities, octopuses, and lots of scientists say that if you watch

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.700
 an octopus, it watches you back.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.820
 One scientist, he had teased the octopus, he had offered it a fish, and then he'd really

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.860
 quickly taken it away again, right?

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:05.060
 And then when he got into the office the next day, as soon as he walked through the door,

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.340
 the octopus had been waiting in its tank and squirted him with this water funnel, with

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.700
 a huge jet of water.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:14.980
 However, there were already loads of splashes of water on the wall, which implies the octopus

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:20.660
 had been doing target practice at the scientist's height, and was just waiting for him to come

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.300
 in in the morning so he could get him with water.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.300
 Isn't that incredible?

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.300
 That's amazing.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:31.340
 Well, the endless conundrum with octopuses is octopuses, that they hate each other.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.140
 They like to be solitary, except for the larger Pacific striped octopus, by the way, if

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.540
 there's one here, they're really sociable, but that's really weird.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.700
 They're the first species that's been seen to be sociable, so actually, there was in the

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:46.260
 experiment that my fact was about one of the scientists said, "It was really amazing

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.260
 watching them.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.260
 They're so sociable.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.020
 I put two in a tank together, and they didn't kill each other."

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.980
 Most of them hate each other, but they have to have sex in a very intimate way, which is

00:29:54.980 --> 00:30:00.220
 quite unusual for animals like that, so the way they have sex is they insert their penis

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.220
 arm into the…

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:05.020
 Let's pose you there as I do.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.460
 Wait, have a penis arm.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.460
 Yep.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.940
 Have they ever had one as a penis arm?

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:18.500
 That's what right or left-handed means.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:25.780
 So the world record for an octopus opening a jar is 54 seconds, and this all kind of started

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:31.260
 as an experiment at Seattle Aquarium, where they gave childproof bottles to octopuses to

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.900
 see if they could open them.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:37.940
 The first attempt for opening one of these by a Pacific octopus, as well, called Billy,

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:43.860
 it took him 55 minutes to open it, or her, sorry, and within a bit of practice, she could

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:49.460
 open these within five minutes, but Roland Anderson, the lead researcher, said, "These results

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:54.940
 do not imply octopuses are smarter than children."

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.460
 It's easy to open childproof stuff once you've worked out the trick.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.460
 Yeah.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.740
 As soon as you know to push it before you twist it, then you're gold.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.100
 I can't believe it's in five minutes after that.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:07.980
 There was an American group called Safe Kids, who tried out whether children could open

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.300
 these or not.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.140
 They gave the containers to the kids and said, "We want you to open them.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.140
 Three to one go."

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.580
 And then the kids were asked to open them as quickly as they could.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.260
 And every single child in the group could open at least one of the bottles that they were

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.260
 given.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:24.860
 And Olivia, who opened two within a minute, was interviewed by a researcher.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.340
 She said, "I'm really fast, because I'm a big girl."

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.340
 Oh.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.340
 That's nice, isn't it?

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.340
 Very nice.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:37.620
 There's an Indonesian species of octopus where they sometimes build bunkers, they don't

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.620
 build bunkers.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.940
 They just dig in the sand.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:45.660
 The male stays in a little hole in the sand is built and it's lined with mucus, and he

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:50.700
 sends his arm over across the seafloor and down into the den of the female next door and

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.620
 has sex with her that way.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:58.260
 But sometimes the females go out mid-sex on an errand or something.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:04.260
 If I had a pound from her.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:13.140
 But we're never shot to groceries in my house.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:19.340
 They accidentally drag the male along with them.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.940
 Again, if James had a pound.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:27.780
 Both of us, it's an accident because it's a massive danger in octopus sex of the female

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:32.340
 eating the male because they love to eat male octopuses and so the best time apparently

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.340
 if you're a male octopus out there to have sex with a female is while she's eating because

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:41.460
 then she's distracted while she's foraging, so maybe he's chosen to go for it that way.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.100
 But that's why they go for the long-distance sex, isn't it?

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:48.020
 To try and make sure they don't get eaten, and sometimes she will suddenly leap out and

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.620
 propel herself towards him and swallow him whole.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:55.260
 Or strangle him to death sometimes during sex, as in like Zenia, all the tops, does anyone

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.260
 remember her?

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.260
 And her 90s body films, yeah.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.300
 They'll have sex, get the sperm in them, and then struggle them to death and eat them.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.700
 It's like an all-in-one kind of deal.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:13.380
 Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts, thank you so much for listening to our episode.
