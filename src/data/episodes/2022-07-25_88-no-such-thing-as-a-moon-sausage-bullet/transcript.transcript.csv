00:00:37,00:00:38,you like.

00:00:42,00:00:47,But here is something and the bonus episode is also available online on iTunes and all
00:00:47,00:00:48,the other places.
00:00:48,00:00:52,"And we've been told that if enough listeners download it, we have a natural chance of"
00:00:52,00:00:55,getting into the UK album charts.
00:00:55,00:00:56,Yes.
00:00:56,00:00:59,And we will perform live on top of the pops.
00:00:59,00:01:00,Is that sort of thing?
00:01:00,00:01:04,"You know how I was saying about you, not being a modern human."
00:01:04,00:01:06,"OK, I'm with the show."
00:01:06,00:01:14,[MUSIC]
00:01:14,00:01:26,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast."
00:01:26,00:01:29,This week coming to you from the Lyric Theatre in London's West End.
00:01:29,00:01:33,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and please welcome to the stage the three regular elves."
00:01:33,00:01:41,"It's Andy Murray, Anna Chazinsky, and James Harkin."
00:01:41,00:01:46,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from"
00:01:46,00:01:50,"the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:50,00:01:53,"Starting with you, Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:01:53,00:01:59,"My fact this week is that Lord Byron's nickname for William Wordsworth was ""William Terzworth."""
00:01:59,00:02:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:00,00:02:04,"He had a way with words, he was an engineer."
00:02:04,00:02:06,"They were living in the same time, they were mates."
00:02:06,00:02:07,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:02:07,00:02:08,"Well, they weren't mates."
00:02:08,00:02:09,They weren't at all.
00:02:09,00:02:10,Yeah.
00:02:10,00:02:13,"Byron thought Wordsworth was very boring, and so he called him that."
00:02:13,00:02:16,There's this whole cache of letters they've just found from Lord Byron to a friend of his.
00:02:16,00:02:17,It was a clergyman.
00:02:17,00:02:21,"And yeah, he happens to slag off Wordsworth as Terzworth, and there you go."
00:02:21,00:02:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:22,00:02:26,"I was quite surprised that the word ""Therz"" existed so far back."
00:02:26,00:02:27,Really?
00:02:27,00:02:28,Yeah.
00:02:28,00:02:29,Did you-- I thought of it as more of a modern thing.
00:02:29,00:02:31,I don't think of it as a word like hyperlink or--
00:02:31,00:02:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:34,00:02:38,I thought they were exactly the same thing.
00:02:38,00:02:43,"I have a look on Hansard, which is the House of Parliament kind of transcripts, and nobody"
00:02:43,00:02:49,"has ever directly called another MP a ""Therz"" in the entire history of Parliament."
00:02:49,00:02:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:50,00:02:55,"The closest anyone came was in a hunting debate a few years ago, when the MP for Worcester,"
00:02:55,00:03:01,"Michael Foster, was described as a nasty snide little ""Therz,"" but in that case the MP was"
00:03:01,00:03:05,"quoting Harry M. Field, so it didn't look like that directly."
00:03:05,00:03:09,I think you're still calling someone something when you're quoting someone else.
00:03:09,00:03:10,Yeah.
00:03:10,00:03:12,"He was saying, isn't it bad that they called him this?"
00:03:12,00:03:13,"Yeah, basically."
00:03:13,00:03:16,"You're a real dickhead, said Rick Maill in bottom."
00:03:16,00:03:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:17,00:03:19,It's so called on the guy a dickhead.
00:03:19,00:03:23,"The world record for uttering the word ""Therz"" in Parliament."
00:03:23,00:03:24,What?
00:03:24,00:03:25,World record.
00:03:25,00:03:26,"Well, it's not really a world record."
00:03:26,00:03:31,"But most world records, you have to bring someone to record it, especially in, so that must"
00:03:31,00:03:34,"have been a phone call where they said, ""I've got a big idea I want to do in Parliament"
00:03:34,00:03:35,today.
00:03:35,00:03:36,Are you up for calming?
00:03:36,00:03:38,"Is it frequency or volume?"""
00:03:38,00:03:39,It was frequency.
00:03:39,00:03:44,"Frequency is Tony Banks, the former Minister for Sport, and he said, ""It's three times"
00:03:44,00:03:46,"in two years in the late 80s."""
00:03:46,00:03:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:47,00:03:49,So it's very visible.
00:03:49,00:03:52,"Yeah, you could say it ten times in ten seconds if you wanted to."
00:03:52,00:03:53,It's true.
00:03:53,00:03:56,All I'm saying to the current MPs that there is a chance of breaking that record.
00:03:56,00:03:57,Yeah.
00:03:57,00:04:01,"There was one time where he said, ""I've read every time MP has ever said ""Therz"" and there"
00:04:01,00:04:05,"was one when Tony Banks said it and he said, ""There was an occasion when I walked around"
00:04:05,00:04:12,the corner and was faced with a terrible dilemma of seeing a Â£1 coin embedded in a dog
00:04:12,00:04:17,"turd."""
00:04:17,00:04:24,"And then he said, ""I managed to find a small boy who for 50p was prepared to meet you."""
00:04:24,00:04:29,"Bill, were they debating at the time?"
00:04:29,00:04:31,It was about dog mess on the streets.
00:04:31,00:04:32,OK.
00:04:32,00:04:36,"George Bush used to call Carl Rove, ""Therz Blossom,"" didn't he?"
00:04:36,00:04:37,Yeah.
00:04:37,00:04:39,"Chief of Staff, Carl Rove, but it was a compliment."
00:04:39,00:04:40,OK.
00:04:40,00:04:45,"So Turd Blossom is a flower, apparently, in California, wherever that grows out of shit."
00:04:45,00:04:49,"And George Bush said, ""You know, you're so great, Carl Rove, you can turn a bad thing"
00:04:49,00:04:50,"into a good thing."""
00:04:50,00:04:51,So you're Turd Blossom.
00:04:51,00:04:55,"Also, I reckon that was an emergency meeting with the biggest minds of America going,"
00:04:55,00:04:57,"""OK, I just called Carl Rove Turd Blossom."
00:04:57,00:05:00,"I just want to turn this around on its head."""
00:05:00,00:05:03,I just got one more thing from Hansard.
00:05:03,00:05:07,I was so hoping to talk about Lord Byron about romantic verse.
00:05:07,00:05:11,"Yeah, well, tough."
00:05:11,00:05:18,"The first time that ever anyone said ""twat"" in Parliament was a guy called Bill Cash."
00:05:18,00:05:25,And he described Field Marshal Lord Carver as a boring old twat in 1986.
00:05:25,00:05:31,"And the second use of the word ""twat"" was immediately afterwards with an unnamed MP shouting,"
00:05:31,00:05:32,"""He said ""twat!"""
00:05:32,00:05:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:44,00:05:47,"Byron liked insult, his fellow poets a lot, didn't he?"
00:05:47,00:05:51,"And if it all romantic poets had all these rivalries between them, but he said about Keith,"
00:05:51,00:05:54,"he wrote ""piss a bed poetry,"" which I don't know what that means."
00:05:54,00:05:56,"Like, did it mean you were the best when you read it?"
00:05:56,00:05:59,"Well, ""piss a bed"" was an old name for Dundee Lion, so maybe it was another question."
00:05:59,00:06:01,I just didn't feel judging by the tone of it.
00:06:01,00:06:06,"And he goes on to say, ""No more keats I entreat, flay him alive."
00:06:06,00:06:08,"If some of you don't, I must skin him myself."
00:06:08,00:06:12,"There is no bearing the driveling idiotism of the mankin."""
00:06:12,00:06:14,So I don't think he was calling him a fan.
00:06:14,00:06:16,"I don't know if I called that, I must say."
00:06:16,00:06:20,He also said that his writing was a sort of mental masturbation.
00:06:20,00:06:21,Wow.
00:06:21,00:06:24,"I think he meant it, yeah."
00:06:24,00:06:28,"I have quite a good thing on a literary feud, which happened."
00:06:28,00:06:34,"So, A.N. Wilson, he's a famous author, and he was writing a book about John Becherman,"
00:06:34,00:06:35,just decades ago.
00:06:35,00:06:41,"And so was another person called Bevis Hylia, and A.N. Wilson was so rude about Bevis Hylia's"
00:06:41,00:06:43,"book, which came out first in a review."
00:06:43,00:06:47,"And when he was writing his, a little while later, he got this letter from a mysterious"
00:06:47,00:06:51,"French woman, which included this, like, gold dust for interviewers."
00:06:51,00:06:57,It was a hitherto unknown copy of a letter from John Becherman to one of his mistresses.
00:06:57,00:07:01,"And Wilson was so excited, and he printed the letter in full in his book, only for Bevis"
00:07:01,00:07:07,"Hylia to reveal that he had sent the letter, and that it was an acrostic, and that the first"
00:07:07,00:07:15,"letter of every sentence spelt out, A.N. Wilson is a shit."
00:07:15,00:07:20,I put it in his own book.
00:07:20,00:07:23,I found out something really rude about Lord Byron.
00:07:23,00:07:27,"When he died, he was buried in a really odd way."
00:07:27,00:07:30,"They removed his organs, and they put them in jars, and it was in a different country."
00:07:30,00:07:34,"And when he came back, he was buried, and they weren't quite sure if it was definitely"
00:07:34,00:07:35,him.
00:07:35,00:07:37,And so someone wanted to find out.
00:07:37,00:07:39,And they made a discovery that not many people have spoken about.
00:07:39,00:07:44,"So this was the sentence, basically, before replacing the lid, the vicar, who was the person"
00:07:44,00:07:50,"who was looking for him, noted that his sexual organ showed quite abnormal development."
00:07:50,00:07:55,"He began to tap the spot just above Byron's knee, and he said, he was built like a pony."
00:07:55,00:08:04,"That was in the tomb, that's not a horse."
00:08:04,00:08:07,"You know, we're being really critical."
00:08:07,00:08:14,"So when they got his body out of the tomb, there was seven people present."
00:08:14,00:08:17,"So there was Thomas Gerard Barber, who was the canon of the church."
00:08:17,00:08:24,"He was an unnamed doctor, a surveyor called Nathaniel Lane, a local archaeologist, a photographer"
00:08:24,00:08:30,"called Mr. Bullock, and the local MP was there, and I promise you, this was his actual name."
00:08:30,00:08:32,He was called Frederick Seymour Cox.
00:08:32,00:08:33,No.
00:08:33,00:08:34,No.
00:08:34,00:08:35,I promise.
00:08:35,00:08:36,Honestly.
00:08:36,00:08:37,"That's his name, honestly."
00:08:37,00:08:39,You know what they say?
00:08:39,00:08:42,"Seymour Cox, my name."
00:08:42,00:08:51,"Byron didn't wonder where, apparently, and apparently this is what was fashionable."
00:08:51,00:08:53,Just can't find them in his size.
00:08:53,00:08:58,Do you have that in pony?
00:08:58,00:09:02,"No, that was, and the reason was, and it was common, like people like Bob Rommel and"
00:09:02,00:09:05,"other fashionable people in Byron's era weren't wearing pants either, and it was because"
00:09:05,00:09:10,"tight trousers were in fashion at the time, and it was to avoid VPL, do people still"
00:09:10,00:09:11,say VPL?
00:09:11,00:09:13,They used to say when I was at school.
00:09:13,00:09:14,What's VPL?
00:09:14,00:09:16,A visible panty line.
00:09:16,00:09:17,They didn't say it was to avoid that.
00:09:17,00:09:22,"The historian, who's book I was reading, said, ""The line of the trousers was not to be interrupted"
00:09:22,00:09:25,"by underwear, and so he largely didn't wear any underwear."""
00:09:25,00:09:29,He bought white linen trousers and batches of 24 at a time.
00:09:29,00:09:30,Wow.
00:09:30,00:09:32,What was he doing to them?
00:09:32,00:09:33,Going through them.
00:09:33,00:09:40,"I did not think this fact would be this penicy, and I like to put them on the record."
00:09:40,00:09:43,We're going to have to move on very soon to our next facts.
00:09:43,00:09:44,"Oh, really?"
00:09:44,00:09:45,Yeah.
00:09:45,00:09:46,Do anything before we do?
00:09:46,00:09:47,I have a fact about nicknames.
00:09:47,00:09:48,Okay.
00:09:48,00:09:49,Yeah.
00:09:49,00:09:57,"At least ten kings of Serbia had the nickname ""The Crowned,"" as all they could think of for"
00:09:57,00:09:58,them.
00:09:58,00:09:59,It's imaginative.
00:09:59,00:10:03,"My favorite nickname of all time, there was a guy called Leo II, he was Roman Emperor, and"
00:10:03,00:10:05,he was known as Leo the Butcher.
00:10:05,00:10:07,That's not my favorite one.
00:10:07,00:10:11,"He was called the Butcher because he killed the patriarch of Alexandra's supporters, and"
00:10:11,00:10:17,"he was called Timothy the Cat, but that's not my favorite either."
00:10:17,00:10:24,"Because Timothy the Cat had replaced another guy called Timothy Wobble-Hat, and nobody"
00:10:24,00:10:26,knows why he was called Timothy Wobble-Hat.
00:10:26,00:10:28,There's two main theories.
00:10:28,00:10:32,"One of them is that he flip-flopped between religious positions, and the other one is"
00:10:32,00:10:39,he had a Wobble-Hat.
00:10:39,00:10:43,"Okay, let's move on to our second fact."
00:10:43,00:10:46,"It's time for our second fact, and that is James Harkin."
00:10:46,00:10:47,Okay.
00:10:47,00:10:55,"My fact this week is that if you grow a cost lettuce on a spaceship, it tastes like rocket."
00:10:55,00:11:01,"Yeah, so this is the first ever lettuce that's been grown in space."
00:11:01,00:11:06,"It was a red-remain lettuce, which is also known as a cos lettuce, and astronaut Scott Kelly"
00:11:06,00:11:12,"said it tastes good, kind of like arugula, and in this country we call arugula rocket."
00:11:12,00:11:17,"It's weird that he didn't manage to make that leap, though, from arugula to the word rocket"
00:11:17,00:11:20,as someone living on a rocket.
00:11:20,00:11:26,"They called it, apparently, at the time, a giant leaf for mankind."
00:11:26,00:11:30,"Also, when they ate it, apparently, because they had to freeze half of them, I think, to"
00:11:30,00:11:35,return to earth for studies if they picked up any radiation or any microorganisms or anything.
00:11:35,00:11:39,"But they also ate the other half, and they were really happy of it, and they put extra virgin"
00:11:39,00:11:42,"olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the leaves, but they had already cleaned the leaves with"
00:11:42,00:11:43,sanitizing wipes.
00:11:43,00:11:50,"I don't know why they're both mentioning that, because that's just normal, isn't it?"
00:11:50,00:11:54,Do you know the thing that astronauts most like to eat in space?
00:11:54,00:11:55,You'll know this.
00:11:55,00:11:58,"Almost every single astronaut who comes back from space says, ""So there's a bunch of staple"
00:11:58,00:12:00,"meals that you get given in space."""
00:12:00,00:12:03,"I think they have their meals repeated every eight days, so you've got eight days worth of"
00:12:03,00:12:05,"meals, and then you have to go back to the start."
00:12:05,00:12:11,"The one that they all love is Broncoctel, and they all rave about it, so Chris Hadfield,"
00:12:11,00:12:15,"Jim Riley, Jim Lovell, they all say that Jim Cocktail is their favourite."
00:12:15,00:12:19,"There was one astronaut who said that he, because the astronauts choose their menus before"
00:12:19,00:12:20,they go out into space.
00:12:20,00:12:23,"If you're out there for a year, you have to write down what you want, there's a big commitment."
00:12:23,00:12:27,"He said he has a word with the astronauts before they're about to go out into space,"
00:12:27,00:12:30,"saying, ""Make sure you do the Broncoctel, because I'm not going to be giving you any of mine"
00:12:30,00:12:31,"in space."""
00:12:31,00:12:33,"You're going to really, really want it."
00:12:33,00:12:34,But apparently it's delicious.
00:12:34,00:12:39,"One thing they do like is really spicy foods, or very flavoursome foods, and the reason for"
00:12:39,00:12:45,"that is because the blood goes into your sinuses, because no gravity is such, and you can't"
00:12:45,00:12:46,really taste things properly.
00:12:46,00:12:51,I did a radio show which we had Helen Sharman on earlier this year.
00:12:51,00:12:54,"Helen Sharman, first British astronaut into space."
00:12:54,00:12:55,Yeah.
00:12:55,00:12:56,"Back to you, Jamesy."
00:12:56,00:13:02,"And she said that when she went into space, she was warned."
00:13:02,00:13:05,"Basically, the Russians are going to have loads and loads of garlic, and the Americans are"
00:13:05,00:13:07,going to have loads and loads of chili.
00:13:07,00:13:10,"And when you go up there, it is going to smell bad."
00:13:10,00:13:12,And apparently you're warned not to say anything.
00:13:12,00:13:15,"When you go up there, just pretend that you can't smell it, because these people haven't"
00:13:15,00:13:19,"seen a human for months and months, and the last thing they want to do is you come in"
00:13:19,00:13:20,and go...
00:13:20,00:13:21,Fucking hell.
00:13:21,00:13:26,Someone opened a window.
00:13:26,00:13:31,"You know how if you go into places like the Science Museum, or anywhere that has astronaut-based"
00:13:31,00:13:34,"products, you always buy astronaut ice cream."
00:13:34,00:13:35,Astronaut-based products.
00:13:35,00:13:36,Astronaut-based products?
00:13:36,00:13:41,"And Stainsbury, in that section, you tell me where the astronaut products are."
00:13:41,00:13:49,"Well, try IL-10, nine, eight."
00:13:49,00:13:55,"So anyway, so you know, astronaut ice cream is a massive thing and everyone buys it, and"
00:13:55,00:13:59,"we all eat it, and we go, ""This tastes horrible, but they eat it in space."""
00:13:59,00:14:04,"It turns out that astronaut ice cream was used for one mission, and it was in 1968."
00:14:04,00:14:05,No one liked it.
00:14:05,00:14:06,It was too crumbly.
00:14:06,00:14:07,It's never been out back again.
00:14:07,00:14:09,"And so the makers of it went, ""Well, what do we do with this?"
00:14:09,00:14:12,"Let's just pretend it's still a thing."""
00:14:12,00:14:15,"So every time anyone eats it and goes, ""This tastes terrible, but oh, doesn't it feel"
00:14:15,00:14:16,"like space?"""
00:14:16,00:14:17,No one's eating it.
00:14:17,00:14:18,It didn't work.
00:14:18,00:14:19,It's a failed product.
00:14:19,00:14:22,When do you say everyone buys it and eats it?
00:14:22,00:14:23,Out of interest.
00:14:23,00:14:27,I come to my family for Christmas.
00:14:27,00:14:28,There are plans to farm in space.
00:14:28,00:14:31,"One of the advantages apparently, so it's good at the idea of farming in space for various"
00:14:31,00:14:37,"reasons, but one of them is that the Veggie project, which is what this is part of, could"
00:14:37,00:14:42,"be used by astronauts in space for recreational gardening during the long-duration missions,"
00:14:42,00:14:45,"which I quite like, because they all have their own allotments."
00:14:45,00:14:50,They are NASA once shipped a specific bit of fruit up into space because they wanted
00:14:50,00:14:54,to do an experiment and attribute to Isaac Newton.
00:14:54,00:15:00,"So they sent up a bit of the tree that Newton had the idea under, and they sent it up with"
00:15:00,00:15:04,"an apple because they thought, ""Oh, this would be great,"" film a video of not only the bit"
00:15:04,00:15:07,"of the tree that taught us about gravity, but also an apple."
00:15:07,00:15:10,"So they brought it up and they were all set to film, and it was looking like it was going"
00:15:10,00:15:12,to be an amazing video to put online.
00:15:12,00:15:15,"And as they were about to film, they forgot to tell one of the astronauts that they were"
00:15:15,00:15:20,"doing that, who suddenly saw this floating apple going, ""Oh, God, there's an apple."""
00:15:20,00:15:27,"She ate the apple, and they went, ""Where's our apple?"" and she went, ""Hm?"""
00:15:27,00:15:32,And then they had to film the video with a pair.
00:15:32,00:15:36,"You can see on YouTube there's a pair floating in space, and they don't mention it."
00:15:36,00:15:38,"They're like, ""Wow!"""
00:15:38,00:15:44,"The first ever Swedish astronaut was a guy called Krista Fugelsang, and he tried to take"
00:15:44,00:15:48,"reindeer meat into space because it was around Christmas time, and it's a delicacy, but"
00:15:48,00:15:52,he was told it wasn't very Christmasy.
00:15:52,00:15:53,To eat reindeer.
00:15:53,00:15:58,"Yeah, it's like bringing a piece of Santa Claus up to the end."
00:15:58,00:16:05,"So on lettuce, lettuce has been an aphrodisiac for three thousand years, apparently."
00:16:05,00:16:09,"And the reason is, I didn't realise this, so part of it is because of its upright kind"
00:16:09,00:16:14,"of phallic structure, so it was considered an aphrodisiac in ancient Egypt, and continued"
00:16:14,00:16:17,"to be considered that throughout Rome and Greece, and it's because it's got this upright"
00:16:17,00:16:21,"structure, and also it's the Krista latex, at the bottom of it, which it oozes like white"
00:16:21,00:16:23,liquid when you cut it.
00:16:23,00:16:25,"Wait, hang on, did you say it's the Krista at the base?"
00:16:25,00:16:26,Yes.
00:16:26,00:16:28,"Well, that's one point of difference."
00:16:28,00:16:29,Right.
00:16:29,00:16:37,"If you're listening to this, and that sounds like you, you need to contact a doctor immediately."
00:16:37,00:16:41,"Of course, it's green."
00:16:41,00:16:45,"But supposedly we've bred it, so it's much more domesticated, and we sort of tamed"
00:16:45,00:16:48,"the wild lettuce, which did have all these sort of sexy connotations, and we've now got"
00:16:48,00:16:52,"really boring iceberg lettuce and things like that, which are not sexy at all, then they're"
00:16:52,00:16:53,not.
00:16:53,00:16:54,"Yeah, because it was too rude before."
00:16:54,00:16:55,Yeah.
00:16:55,00:16:56,It was postcard for your stuff.
00:16:56,00:17:00,"Um, I found a couple of foods in space that are not food."
00:17:00,00:17:01,Okay.
00:17:01,00:17:02,"Yes, explain."
00:17:02,00:17:07,"So, the process of falling into a black hole is called spaghettification."
00:17:07,00:17:08,Yeah.
00:17:08,00:17:12,"That's an actual scientific word, and the idea is that when you fall into a black hole,"
00:17:12,00:17:16,"as you may do, you get stretched out, longer and longer like spaghetti."
00:17:16,00:17:17,Yeah.
00:17:17,00:17:19,And so some scientists just said that's spaghettification.
00:17:19,00:17:22,"Yeah, the tidal forces end up stretching you like spaghetti, yeah."
00:17:22,00:17:23,Yes.
00:17:23,00:17:24,"So, that's what spaghetti is."
00:17:24,00:17:25,Yes.
00:17:25,00:17:26,That's what spaghetti is.
00:17:26,00:17:27,That's how we get spaghetti.
00:17:27,00:17:29,I'm giving up.
00:17:29,00:17:33,"The other one I found is that in the US Army, there was a program back in the day, a"
00:17:33,00:17:40,"future weapons office, for in case we colonise the moon, and they invented a sausage"
00:17:40,00:17:41,gun.
00:17:41,00:17:42,What?
00:17:42,00:17:43,Wait.
00:17:43,00:17:44,What?
00:17:44,00:17:47,"It didn't shoot sausages, but it did a process whereby you make sausages coming out of the"
00:17:47,00:17:48,gun.
00:17:48,00:17:53,And there was an actual thing that the Pentagon worked out and said that once the war gets
00:17:53,00:17:56,"way enhanced and we're all on the moon fighting, you're going to need your sausage gun."
00:17:56,00:17:57,It's not exciting.
00:17:57,00:17:59,"So, does that have anything to do with sausages?"
00:17:59,00:18:00,There's no sausages.
00:18:00,00:18:01,It's not made of a gun.
00:18:01,00:18:02,The gun's not made of sausages.
00:18:02,00:18:06,"To be honest, I stop reading when it's so sausage-cars, so."
00:18:06,00:18:10,"That's pretty exciting there, doesn't it?"
00:18:10,00:18:15,A sausage gun's on the moon.
00:18:15,00:18:19,"It's time for our third fact of the evening, and that is my fact."
00:18:19,00:18:27,My fact this week is that scientists have grown an ear using Van Gogh's DNA.
00:18:27,00:18:28,Yeah!
00:18:28,00:18:32,"Okay, so this is what it was."
00:18:32,00:18:36,It was an artist decided that they wanted to do a project where they could regrow an
00:18:36,00:18:44,"ear and they found, on the back of a stamp, some saliva from Van Gogh and they used it and"
00:18:44,00:18:49,"they contacted one of the great, great, great nephews of Van Gogh and they managed to get"
00:18:49,00:18:54,"some of their cells off them and they created a kind of scaffolding and they regrown the ear,"
00:18:54,00:18:59,"the left-hand side ear that would have been sliced off when he sliced it off, that's amazing."
00:18:59,00:19:04,"Oh, we totally are 100% sure that whoever it was that stole Van Gogh's ear in the first"
00:19:04,00:19:08,"place, hasn't been burying this burden of guilt for the last 150 years and thought I've got"
00:19:08,00:19:13,"to let it out and they've just put it on the market and said, ""I'll grow it."""
00:19:13,00:19:15,"But no one knows what happened to it, right?"
00:19:15,00:19:17,Was it not supposed to be given to our prostitutes?
00:19:17,00:19:20,"Well, yeah, so it's thought they gave it to our prostitute, but there's another theory"
00:19:20,00:19:23,that Gogan chopped it off.
00:19:23,00:19:27,So I think Gogan was living with Van Gogh at the time and I think Van Gogh likes Gogan
00:19:27,00:19:31,"more than Gogan like Van Gogh and Gogan was also like an, you know, ardent fencer and"
00:19:31,00:19:34,they used to have a lot of fights.
00:19:34,00:19:38,"And so people at Peace together said that what happened is they had a fight, Gogan chopped"
00:19:38,00:19:42,"Van Gogh's ear off and then Van Gogh was such a needy, weird housemate and Gogan wanted to"
00:19:42,00:19:45,"move out anyway and he was like, ""It's alright, I won't tell anyone."
00:19:45,00:19:49,I'll just say that I chopped off my own ear and I sent it to a prostitute.
00:19:49,00:19:51,"Is that what you say if I do that?"""
00:19:51,00:19:52,And that's a genuine theory.
00:19:52,00:19:53,Yeah.
00:19:53,00:20:01,I've had arguments with housemates before and it sounds plausible.
00:20:01,00:20:05,You know you can get a disappearing ear Van Gogh mug.
00:20:05,00:20:07,"When you pour in hot water, his ear disappears."
00:20:07,00:20:08,Oh!
00:20:08,00:20:09,Disappoints by bandage.
00:20:09,00:20:10,It's really cool.
00:20:10,00:20:11,"Oh, that's really cool."
00:20:11,00:20:12,I think what I'm saying is wrong.
00:20:12,00:20:13,It should be Van Gogh.
00:20:13,00:20:14,Something.
00:20:14,00:20:15,Van Gogh.
00:20:15,00:20:16,Yeah.
00:20:16,00:20:18,So it's very hard to say his name.
00:20:18,00:20:24,A very old thing that happened on this episode was that I once said in a fact Van Gogh
00:20:24,00:20:26,because that's what I thought his name was.
00:20:26,00:20:30,"And we got, I got a tweet when the show went out and I just, I just want to read you the"
00:20:30,00:20:31,tweet.
00:20:31,00:20:32,Episode 28.
00:20:32,00:20:37,"At 10 minutes, 55 seconds."
00:20:37,00:20:46,Why did you incredibly stupidly and ignorantly say Van Gogh instead of Van Gogh?
00:20:46,00:20:51,And then I wrote back to him because I was really angry but I wrote back to him saying sorry
00:20:51,00:20:55,and wait till he hear how I say Covert Garden.
00:20:55,00:21:02,"What I wanted to say was, go fuck yourself."
00:21:02,00:21:12,"So on ears, a woman recently grew an ear on her arm and that was because she'd had a kind"
00:21:12,00:21:17,"of skin cancer that meant her ear had, she didn't have an ear anymore, and she wanted to regenerate"
00:21:17,00:21:20,her ear and so it was grown on her arm as does sometimes happen.
00:21:20,00:21:25,So there's another guy in China I think who had a nose grown on his forehead which if you
00:21:25,00:21:29,Google image it is very impressive and you know it was used to replace his nose a couple of
00:21:29,00:21:30,months later.
00:21:30,00:21:34,Anyway this woman had an ear grown on her arm and it was in order to be transplanted back
00:21:34,00:21:36,on to where her ear should be a couple of months later.
00:21:36,00:21:40,So the surgeon who did it said she had some fun with it.
00:21:40,00:21:46,"If the kids got into trouble, she'd roll up her sleeve and say tell it to the arm."
00:21:46,00:21:53,"In 2009, this is a news article, doctors have saved the woman's severed lobe by stitching"
00:21:53,00:21:55,it to her bottom.
00:21:55,00:22:01,Julia Schwarz's right ear was bitten off by her best friend in a fight over a lover and
00:22:01,00:22:05,they stitched it onto her ass and kept it there until they could pull it because she had too
00:22:05,00:22:08,much scouring that they couldn't pull it on straight away so they stitched it onto her
00:22:08,00:22:09,ass.
00:22:09,00:22:10,But why the ass?
00:22:10,00:22:14,"It's about availability of blood vessels and availability of skin, there's a lot of skin"
00:22:14,00:22:15,on your ass.
00:22:15,00:22:16,All right.
00:22:16,00:22:20,There was someone else here.
00:22:20,00:22:29,"I really enjoyed this, I can't remember what paper it was in, but it was someone who designed"
00:22:29,00:22:34,a mechanical or something who cut off the tip of his finger or half of his finger and had
00:22:34,00:22:35,to have it regrown.
00:22:35,00:22:39,"Again, they thought let's try and regrow this on a part of your body so that it gets fed"
00:22:39,00:22:43,by the blood vessels and so that the muscle can be grown and the skin can grow around it.
00:22:43,00:22:49,"And so they sewed his finger onto his stomach, but I think I read this article on maybe the"
00:22:49,00:22:53,"Huffington Post and on the picture of it, they've blacked out like you would if someone was"
00:22:53,00:22:59,"showing their penis or something, they've blacked out the bit where you see the finger grafted"
00:22:59,00:23:03,onto the stomach and then you can only see it if you scroll right down to the bottom and
00:23:03,00:23:07,"there's a big black box over and I think it because it does look a bit phallic, but it's"
00:23:07,00:23:09,"not a penis, it's just a finger on somebody's stomach."
00:23:09,00:23:15,"Well you say it looks like a penis, does it have white stuff coming from the base?"
00:23:15,00:23:21,"I was when I was looking into Van Gogh, there's a Van Gogh, there's a theory, there's an actual"
00:23:21,00:23:27,theory that he used to paint at night with candles on his hat so that he could see in the evening.
00:23:27,00:23:32,And his nickname was Flamie Hat.
00:23:32,00:23:36,There are many theories as to why.
00:23:36,00:23:39,"Can I mention another thing about this ear, which is really exciting."
00:23:39,00:23:43,"So because it was done by an artist, you can actually visit the ear that's been grown."
00:23:43,00:23:49,It's a New York City and they've done it in a way that you can talk to the ear and I don't
00:23:49,00:23:51,"fully understand the science of it, but-"
00:23:51,00:23:54,It can't hear anything by the way.
00:23:54,00:23:59,"Well from what I gather, when you talk to it, the ear kind of slightly moves in a way that"
00:23:59,00:24:03,"it's going, no, it responds to what you're saying."
00:24:03,00:24:08,And the first person to speak to this ear when it was initially debuted in Germany was
00:24:08,00:24:14,"Nome Chomsky, that's a Nome Chomsky, and then the ear went, ""Wow!"" and we don't know what"
00:24:14,00:24:15,he said.
00:24:15,00:24:19,But a really cool thing about this work of art is that it's called Sugar Babe.
00:24:19,00:24:23,"The idea is that it's about the philosophical argument called the Ship of Theesius, right?"
00:24:23,00:24:28,"Which is if you replace every bit of a ship one by one, at what point is it no longer the"
00:24:28,00:24:29,original ship?
00:24:29,00:24:35,And this applies to the band The Sugar Babes.
00:24:35,00:24:42,"Can I just, I have something so cool on acoustics, which I didn't know, and which is sounds only"
00:24:42,00:24:47,"ten as you're related, but you know hearing trumpets, ear trumpets that they used to use before"
00:24:47,00:24:48,hearing aids were invented.
00:24:48,00:24:52,"The reason they were invented, it was in the 17th century, and it was because Puritan"
00:24:52,00:24:58,"couples in America, when they went out to dine with each other, they wanted to have private"
00:24:58,00:25:02,"conversations, but they had to sit opposite each other because there was no intimacy allowed."
00:25:02,00:25:04,"And so they sat opposite each other, but they wanted to have private conversations, they"
00:25:04,00:25:09,"launched you, you know, chats or whatever, and so the ear trumpet was apparently invented"
00:25:09,00:25:13,in order that he could be sitting there with your boyfriend and he could be saying into
00:25:13,00:25:19,"this end of the trumpet, you know, I really want to have sex with you."
00:25:19,00:25:28,I wish that all adult chattelines were starved by women with ear trumpets.
00:25:28,00:25:30,Can I tell you one cool thing about ears?
00:25:30,00:25:31,"Yes, please."
00:25:31,00:25:37,"Butterflies have ears on their wings, and complete with ear drums, their proper ears, but they"
00:25:37,00:25:42,"use them to hear bats ultrasound, and when scientists play ultrasound to butterflies, they"
00:25:42,00:25:48,"start flying in crazy patterns, sort of doing evasion tactics to get away from a predator,"
00:25:48,00:25:52,and butterflies evolved at the same time that bats developed the ability to use echolocation
00:25:52,00:25:54,and develop their big ears.
00:25:54,00:26:00,"And the theory is that butterflies started flying in a daytime to avoid bats, or in other"
00:26:00,00:26:03,"words, bats invented butterflies."
00:26:03,00:26:11,"Let's move on to our final fact of the show, and that is Anichaczynski."
00:26:11,00:26:17,"Yeah, my fact is that the larger Pacific striped octopus catches its prey by sneaking up"
00:26:17,00:26:20,behind it and tapping it on the shoulder.
00:26:20,00:26:24,"Yeah, this has only just been documented this behaviour."
00:26:24,00:26:29,"Well, it was actually documented once in the 1970s, and a biologist wrote a report on it."
00:26:29,00:26:33,"No one believed it, and it was ignored, and it's only just been rediscovered, the behaviour"
00:26:33,00:26:36,of the larger Pacific striped octopus.
00:26:36,00:26:40,"But the way that it hunts is, it sneaks up, it's called a slow bounce."
00:26:40,00:26:46,"So it's like a grandmother's footsteps, and it sits there hiding on the sand."
00:26:46,00:26:51,"It's only small, it's only a few inches big, and it's chasing a shrimp, and it will sneak"
00:26:51,00:26:55,"a bit further and further up behind it when the shrimp can't see, and eventually, when"
00:26:55,00:26:59,"it's close enough, it gets one of its tentacles, or its arms, or its legs, or whatever you want"
00:26:59,00:27:04,"to call them, and it gets its leg around to the front of the shrimp, and it prods it here,"
00:27:04,00:27:08,"and then the shrimp's like, ""Oh, fuck, there's a predator here!"" and it rebounds right"
00:27:08,00:27:09,back into his mouth.
00:27:09,00:27:12,And that's how it does it.
00:27:12,00:27:13,That's amazing.
00:27:13,00:27:14,It's so cool.
00:27:14,00:27:15,Look it up.
00:27:15,00:27:18,"There's a video of it, which is excellent of an octopus sneaking up on a shrimp."
00:27:18,00:27:19,"Another thing octopus does do, this is so cool."
00:27:19,00:27:24,"They fling sand or debris in each other's faces when they're fighting, so you know scenes"
00:27:24,00:27:28,of films where the villain throws some sand into the hero's eyes.
00:27:28,00:27:29,They do that.
00:27:29,00:27:32,"Oh my god, down at every movie."
00:27:32,00:27:38,"They don't see the gut, the bad and the octopus."
00:27:38,00:27:42,"But they do it with shells and debris, like hard shells and debris as well."
00:27:42,00:27:49,"So they have a kind of water ejector system, which means they pick up a shell, and they"
00:27:49,00:27:54,"propel it with this water ejector system at their enemies, and knock them unconsciously."
00:27:54,00:27:56,"So, yeah, this is actually amazing."
00:27:56,00:27:57,You mentioned this age ago in the office.
00:27:57,00:28:03,So they throw a shell and then they have this water pistol that launches the shell behind
00:28:03,00:28:04,it.
00:28:04,00:28:12,"So it picks up speed like a bullet towards like a sausage bullet, like a moon sausage bullets."
00:28:12,00:28:15,"They also, by the way, they carry armor with them."
00:28:15,00:28:20,"So if they're going into battle, or if they predict battle may happen to them, they carry"
00:28:20,00:28:26,"coconut shells, often two at a time, and they will travel on the seabed."
00:28:26,00:28:30,So the enemies think they're a horse.
00:28:30,00:28:36,"But they genuinely have coconuts, and they have the shells, and then as soon as the enemy"
00:28:36,00:28:40,"started attacking, they'll bring the coconut shells up over them, like, ""I swear to god,"
00:28:40,00:28:41,"this is true."""
00:28:41,00:28:42,It is amazing to watch.
00:28:42,00:28:45,"Again, videos of that aren't there, and they pull the coconut shells in to create one"
00:28:45,00:28:46,coconut.
00:28:46,00:28:49,"But if you try to drink the milk from inside it, there's an octopus."
00:28:49,00:28:53,"They seem to have personalities, octopuses, and lots of scientists say that if you watch"
00:28:53,00:28:55,"an octopus, it watches you back."
00:28:55,00:28:58,"One scientist, he had teased the octopus, he had offered it a fish, and then he'd really"
00:28:58,00:29:00,"quickly taken it away again, right?"
00:29:00,00:29:05,"And then when he got into the office the next day, as soon as he walked through the door,"
00:29:05,00:29:08,"the octopus had been waiting in its tank and squirted him with this water funnel, with"
00:29:08,00:29:09,a huge jet of water.
00:29:09,00:29:14,"However, there were already loads of splashes of water on the wall, which implies the octopus"
00:29:14,00:29:20,"had been doing target practice at the scientist's height, and was just waiting for him to come"
00:29:20,00:29:22,in in the morning so he could get him with water.
00:29:22,00:29:23,Isn't that incredible?
00:29:23,00:29:24,That's amazing.
00:29:24,00:29:31,"Well, the endless conundrum with octopuses is octopuses, that they hate each other."
00:29:31,00:29:34,"They like to be solitary, except for the larger Pacific striped octopus, by the way, if"
00:29:34,00:29:36,"there's one here, they're really sociable, but that's really weird."
00:29:36,00:29:40,"They're the first species that's been seen to be sociable, so actually, there was in the"
00:29:40,00:29:46,"experiment that my fact was about one of the scientists said, ""It was really amazing"
00:29:46,00:29:47,watching them.
00:29:47,00:29:48,They're so sociable.
00:29:48,00:29:52,"I put two in a tank together, and they didn't kill each other."""
00:29:52,00:29:54,"Most of them hate each other, but they have to have sex in a very intimate way, which is"
00:29:54,00:30:00,"quite unusual for animals like that, so the way they have sex is they insert their penis"
00:30:00,00:30:01,arm into theâ¦
00:30:01,00:30:05,Let's pose you there as I do.
00:30:05,00:30:07,"Wait, have a penis arm."
00:30:07,00:30:08,Yep.
00:30:08,00:30:10,Have they ever had one as a penis arm?
00:30:10,00:30:18,That's what right or left-handed means.
00:30:18,00:30:25,"So the world record for an octopus opening a jar is 54 seconds, and this all kind of started"
00:30:25,00:30:31,"as an experiment at Seattle Aquarium, where they gave childproof bottles to octopuses to"
00:30:31,00:30:32,see if they could open them.
00:30:32,00:30:37,"The first attempt for opening one of these by a Pacific octopus, as well, called Billy,"
00:30:37,00:30:43,"it took him 55 minutes to open it, or her, sorry, and within a bit of practice, she could"
00:30:43,00:30:49,"open these within five minutes, but Roland Anderson, the lead researcher, said, ""These results"
00:30:49,00:30:54,"do not imply octopuses are smarter than children."""
00:30:54,00:30:58,It's easy to open childproof stuff once you've worked out the trick.
00:30:58,00:30:59,Yeah.
00:30:59,00:31:01,"As soon as you know to push it before you twist it, then you're gold."
00:31:01,00:31:04,I can't believe it's in five minutes after that.
00:31:04,00:31:07,"There was an American group called Safe Kids, who tried out whether children could open"
00:31:07,00:31:09,these or not.
00:31:09,00:31:12,"They gave the containers to the kids and said, ""We want you to open them."
00:31:12,00:31:13,"Three to one go."""
00:31:13,00:31:15,And then the kids were asked to open them as quickly as they could.
00:31:15,00:31:19,And every single child in the group could open at least one of the bottles that they were
00:31:19,00:31:20,given.
00:31:20,00:31:24,"And Olivia, who opened two within a minute, was interviewed by a researcher."
00:31:24,00:31:28,"She said, ""I'm really fast, because I'm a big girl."""
00:31:28,00:31:29,Oh.
00:31:29,00:31:30,"That's nice, isn't it?"
00:31:30,00:31:31,Very nice.
00:31:31,00:31:37,"There's an Indonesian species of octopus where they sometimes build bunkers, they don't"
00:31:37,00:31:38,build bunkers.
00:31:38,00:31:40,They just dig in the sand.
00:31:40,00:31:45,"The male stays in a little hole in the sand is built and it's lined with mucus, and he"
00:31:45,00:31:50,sends his arm over across the seafloor and down into the den of the female next door and
00:31:50,00:31:52,has sex with her that way.
00:31:52,00:31:58,But sometimes the females go out mid-sex on an errand or something.
00:31:58,00:32:04,If I had a pound from her.
00:32:04,00:32:13,But we're never shot to groceries in my house.
00:32:13,00:32:19,They accidentally drag the male along with them.
00:32:19,00:32:21,"Again, if James had a pound."
00:32:21,00:32:27,"Both of us, it's an accident because it's a massive danger in octopus sex of the female"
00:32:27,00:32:32,eating the male because they love to eat male octopuses and so the best time apparently
00:32:32,00:32:36,if you're a male octopus out there to have sex with a female is while she's eating because
00:32:36,00:32:41,"then she's distracted while she's foraging, so maybe he's chosen to go for it that way."
00:32:41,00:32:44,"But that's why they go for the long-distance sex, isn't it?"
00:32:44,00:32:48,"To try and make sure they don't get eaten, and sometimes she will suddenly leap out and"
00:32:48,00:32:50,propel herself towards him and swallow him whole.
00:32:50,00:32:55,"Or strangle him to death sometimes during sex, as in like Zenia, all the tops, does anyone"
00:32:55,00:32:56,remember her?
00:32:56,00:32:58,"And her 90s body films, yeah."
00:32:58,00:33:02,"They'll have sex, get the sperm in them, and then struggle them to death and eat them."
00:33:02,00:33:05,It's like an all-in-one kind of deal.
00:33:05,00:33:13,"Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts, thank you so much for listening to our episode."
