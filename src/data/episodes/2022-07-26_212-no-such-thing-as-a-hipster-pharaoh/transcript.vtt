00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.920
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.500
 (upbeat music)

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.240
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.420
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.120
 this week coming to you live from Belfast!

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.360
 (audience cheering)

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.080
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.840
 with Anichis Isinski, Andrew Hansen-Marie,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.920
 and James Harkin, and once again,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.680
 we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.760
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.360
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.440
 Starting with you, James.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.760
 - Okay, my fact this week is that there are a number

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.040
 of chickens in California that have their own personal chefs.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.520
 (audience laughing)

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.840
 - I think you'd live in constant fear as a chicken

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.320
 if you had your own chicken.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.880
 (audience laughing)

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.320
 One day he's gonna run us to stuff in the pantry.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.840
 - Oh, they can give me a lot of sage and onion recently.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.320
 (audience laughing)

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.360
 - Mr. Chicken, tonight for dinner, you.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.880
 (audience laughing)

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.080
 - Yeah, that's very exciting.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.520
 - So this is specifically in Silicon Valley

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.240
 and at the moment there is a chicken mania happening

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.880
 in Silicon Valley.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.400
 Single chicken can cost $350.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.840
 And normally they cost about $15.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.720
 Their coupes are controlled by smartphone apps

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.640
 and basically it's kind of a state of symbol

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.400
 in Silicon Valley to have your own chicken.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.720
 - Wow.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.280
 - Are they special chickens in any way?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.320
 Are they amazing or amazing, the all-night chickens?

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.040
 - Some of them are pretty good, actually, I have to say.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.200
 I'm not sure I'd pay $350 for one, but they are pretty good.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.640
 So they're specially bred for desirable personality traits.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.400
 So the ones that are particularly.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.480
 (audience laughing)

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.080
 - What is a personality trait in a chicken?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.640
 (audience laughing)

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.480
 - Well, you know.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.320
 - It's the ground.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.080
 (audience laughing)

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.320
 - So for instance, if they're gentle enough

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.960
 for a child to cuddle.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.800
 - Okay.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.400
 - So rock 'n' like an angry chicken,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.360
 you wouldn't want to put that near your child.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.040
 They don't have those.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.040
 There are some that are rare,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.120
 there are some that are beautiful

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.640
 according to the article I read.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.720
 And some of them have special highly coveted colored eggs

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.760
 and they're called Easter Eggers

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.440
 and they give you blue eggs.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.280
 - Wow.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.120
 - They're really, really good ones, those.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.120
 - That's very cool.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.400
 - They also, I read a lot of people

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.440
 keep the chickens in their house like they're a cat or a dog

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.080
 and they call them lap chickens

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.840
 'cause they come and they sit on your lap

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.960
 and you can just stroke them.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.280
 And the way that they make sure

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.120
 that they don't defecate all over the house

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.720
 is they put them in diapers.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.480
 So there's special chicken diapers that you can now buy.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.160
 And I went to a website that sells these chicken diapers

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.000
 'cause I wanted to--

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.720
 - I want you all wearing them tonight.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.200
 (audience laughing)

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.680
 - No, there's a few good websites that do it actually.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.400
 There's one called my pet chicken

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.720
 and there's one called pampered poultry.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.840
 Pampered poultry is very nice.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.960
 So you can see that they're all nicely designed.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.120
 They sit around the bum of the chicken, like a diaper.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.880
 But they not only sell diapers,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.320
 they also sell saddles on chickens.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.280
 And it's mainly for people to ride chickens.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.800
 - No, yeah.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.680
 That's what I thought, but it turns out what it is

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.160
 is that when a chicken is having sex

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.280
 from the behind, the male is really aggressive

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.840
 and packs away at their back.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.160
 So it's a sort of blanket that sits over the back

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.960
 of the chicken so they don't lose all their feathers

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.200
 when the male is just--

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.320
 - So it's when they're being ridden in a way.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.800
 (audience laughing)

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.080
 - Very true, very true.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.200
 They also, my pet chicken has a very exciting device.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.760
 Basically, a lot of people have problems

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.240
 if they do have a chicken in their house

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.280
 where it does cock-a-doodle-doo a lot.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.720
 So they have on their site, they called cock-a-doodle-don't.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.880
 And cock-a-doodle-d don't is a new contraption

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.360
 that goes around the neck that stops it

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.560
 from crowing, from roostering.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.400
 And--

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.280
 - How does it stop it?

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.640
 - It, it, it, it, it goes around the throat.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.720
 - Please strangle the chicken.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.000
 - Yeah, it, it, it's, it's a bit questionable.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.600
 I'm not sure my pet chicken.com is--

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.000
 - Did you not just say this is a very cool contraption?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.400
 - Can we edit that bit out?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.120
 'Cause that's staying in, isn't it?

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.600
 And if you pay an extra amount of money,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.080
 $12 more, it only costs $18 for it to happen.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.560
 They say it doesn't hurt the chicken,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.160
 but if you, uh, if the rooster, if you do it,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.280
 for $12 more, you can buy a bow tie that goes around.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.280
 - Absolutely, bargain.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.400
 - For just $30, you can choke the chicken

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.160
 in a classy bow tie fashion.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.080
 Oh, nice.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.040
 - Nothing more classy than a dead chicken with a bow tie on.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.480
 You do get some incredible looking kind of designer chickens now,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.320
 though.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.640
 Or, I mean, just Google some designer chickens.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.440
 They're stunning.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.320
 But I think my favorite is the I Am Chicken, the--

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.480
 is AYAM, and it's described by breeders

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.120
 as the Lamborghini of chickens.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.520
 And you can see why.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.640
 So you might have seen it.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.880
 It's that chicken that's black, completely black from head to toe.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.080
 It looks like it's been dipped in oil.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.200
 So it's big, it's crown, it's--

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.400
 sorry, it's comb, it's legs, it's feet.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.000
 And the weird thing is, like, it's eyes completely black.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.840
 But the weird thing is, it's fully black on the inside as well,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.680
 which I didn't realize.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.640
 So all of its organs, all of the meat in it, all of its flesh,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.200
 all of its bones, everything is black.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.840
 And so if you then eat this chicken,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.800
 it's the meat itself is black.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.520
 The only thing about the chicken that's not black

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.480
 is it lays white eggs.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.560
 And they're just-- they're incredible.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.160
 And there's this I Am Breeder in America who's got a site

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.160
 where they sell them.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.520
 And they say they're very, very good natured as well.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.680
 So I think a New York magazine wanted to meet one.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.200
 And the review said, "The rooster patiently allowed himself

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.440
 to be draped with million-dollar jewelry

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.040
 and trust with red ribbon, well-being photographed

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.720
 under bright lights."

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.280
 Which, again, it's an amazing looking chicken.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.240
 People are doing some weird shit with their chickens.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.240
 Yeah.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.320
 Of course, your website's going to say,

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.800
 our chickens are extremely friendly.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.800
 No website selling these chickens are going to say,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.360
 our chicken's a real bastard, it's actually--

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.720
 So I was looking up chickens in Silicon Valley,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.200
 because it's the massive trend at the moment.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.360
 There is a company at the moment

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.360
 is trying to disrupt eggs, OK?

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.160
 So they're trying to make-- there are food--

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.320
 stuff stuff-- thing called just.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.520
 And they make eggless scrambled eggs out of mung beans.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.400
 But the other thing they've started doing recently,

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.800
 they've started making chicken nuggets from chickens,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.760
 which are still alive.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.280
 What?

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.640
 The others just like chickens with bits missing.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.000
 Well, kind of.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.040
 So they took some cells from the inside of a chicken feather.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.400
 So they took one feather from a chicken called Ian

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.040
 for the record.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.640
 I don't know.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.040
 It's a perfectly spoiled land, normal land.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.320
 So they took some cells from the inside of the feather.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.400
 And then they cultivated them.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.280
 And they fed those cells on plant proteins, right?

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.440
 And they turned those into a big mass of chicken meat.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.880
 They grew those into chicken muscle.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.720
 And then they had a barbecue where they served up chicken nuggets.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.080
 And Ian was present walking around on the table while he was

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.320
 being eaten by these people.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.760
 Presumably, surely he was there with a megaphone saying,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.840
 this is an outrage.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.160
 Yeah, it's very-- basically, people in Silicon Valley are mad.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.760
 That's all we need to know.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.760
 Yeah, you can go on a tour of Silicon Valley

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.680
 called Torda Coop, where you just see all of the chicken

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.520
 coops that they have, because they're unbelievably expensive.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.960
 Some of them can cost up to like $20,000.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.840
 And one owner, at least, plans to transform

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.720
 his coop into an Airbnb for humans.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.680
 Once his chickens die, that's how on later it is.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.680
 I don't-- and my parents had chickens.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.960
 There's no way I'd want to sleep in the same place

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.160
 that those chickens are sleeping.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.480
 That's disgusting.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.000
 Would you share the coop with them?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.880
 Or do they vacate--

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.880
 I don't know.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.040
 I guess they vacate and leave you a croissant and stuff

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.000
 when you stay there, presumably.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.480
 They're basically dead.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.160
 And they've been eaten.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.160
 They're long gone, and they probably clean it.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.000
 And, you know.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.120
 Oh, that's actually not how Airbnb works at all.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.920
 Thank you.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.640
 Yeah, some other weird stuff that people in Silicon Valley are doing.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.080
 So there's been a lot lately about what

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.000
 people in Silicon Valley call biohacking, which

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.640
 I just find a really amusing word, because what it means

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.320
 is stupid diets.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.040
 But they call it biohacking, because it sounds really smart.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.720
 But all the CEOs of all the big companies are into this.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.040
 And weird kind of diets.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.920
 So there's Jeffrey Wu, who's CEO of a biohacking company.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.760
 And he got all his staff to do a full-on seven-day fast.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.760
 And they all had to wear glucose monitors

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.600
 that are designed for diabetics.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.680
 And it inserts pinpricks into your skin.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.800
 And it measures your blood-elevated ketones, which

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.440
 is a way of checking how much fat you're using and stuff.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.960
 So he makes all his staff go--

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.440
 staff themselves for seven days-- to make sure they're burning

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.520
 enough fat and it elevates your mental acuity and things

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.280
 like that.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.080
 But they're all kind of going on silly teenage girl diets,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.480
 getting his biohacking, and so it's OK.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.840
 I read about Jeffrey Wu, because he started this thing.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.400
 There's a drug that people in Silicon Valley take, which

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.160
 is the idea is it's a cognitive enhancing drug.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.840
 And so it's a brain drug, effectively,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.560
 and it's called new tropics, which is an old idea.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.040
 That was back in 1972 that that term was coined.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.640
 But the idea is you take it, and it makes

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.160
 your brain get stimulated.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.040
 So he runs a company where he provides these drugs.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.560
 Everyone's on these brain stimulant drugs in Silicon Valley

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.640
 if they're working with Jeffrey.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.320
 But I don't know.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.480
 If it's making you want to pay $350 for a chicken,

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.280
 I'm not sure how smart they're making you.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.040
 Actually, the chicken's control the company that makes the drug.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.560
 Have you met our CEO, Ian?

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.640
 I read about a hobby, because the hobbies that people have

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.240
 in Silicon Valley, and people do various weird sports and stuff,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.840
 because there's a lot of mountainous terrain.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.080
 Have you heard of ride and tie?

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.200
 This is so cool.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.560
 So it's a mountain race involving two people on one horse.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.240
 So-- but the rule is, only one person

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.320
 can be touching the horse at any given moment.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.880
 So you get on the horse, and you ride for a couple of miles,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.560
 and your friend runs, and then you tie the horse up

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.600
 for a couple of miles, and then you start running,

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.520
 and your friend catches up to the horse, gets on it,

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.920
 rides it, overtakes you, and then--

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.640
 And you have to get off after two miles.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.840
 You can't just go on the horse for the whole length of the horse.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.640
 Oh, that's a much better idea, actually.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.400
 Yeah, again, see, they're reinventing the wheel,

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.560
 just going for a ride on a horse.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.040
 That's pretty cool.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.920
 I think it does sound kind of fun.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.920
 It sounds quite intense.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.040
 Yeah, really fun.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.960
 Why wouldn't you just go on the horse alongside the person who's running?

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.720
 Horses can run faster than people can run.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.240
 No, I know, but--

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.960
 Same as-- I mean, that's why those guys

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.000
 who do the grand national.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.040
 Yeah.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.680
 But no humans have won that, have they?

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.200
 They've never even qualified for it.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.880
 But actually, there is a horse versus human race, isn't there?

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.000
 I think it's in Wales every year or something.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Yeah.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.960
 And sometimes the humans do win, but it's

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.760
 on a really twisty cost with like, you know, stairs and lifts.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.280
 Things that horses can't do.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.320
 And on drugs, actually, all Silicon Valley CEOs

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.360
 are also doing LSD at the moment.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.560
 And again, the--

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.240
 For legal reasons, I think not all.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.920
 Sorry, yes, definitely not all.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.840
 Yeah, but bloody most right.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.680
 But it's micro-dosing.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.840
 So they take a tenth the amount of LSD

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.960
 that you'd usually, not you, but that one might usually

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.720
 take to get a proper hallucination.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.280
 And apparently, the effect this has

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.520
 is that it increases alertness and energy and stuff.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.320
 And it's another way of them, I guess,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.600
 kind of biohacking themselves, taking a bit of hallucinogenic

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.640
 to make themselves more switched on.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.920
 So the other thing that's been in the news

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.480
 is like raw water.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.320
 Have you seen all this?

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.120
 Yeah.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.040
 So basically, people are drinking water that's

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.560
 come direct from source and hasn't been decontaminated,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.400
 which is really, really a terrible idea.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.560
 There was an expert who said almost everything

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.040
 conceivable that can make you sick can be found in water.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.560
 So a lot of it contains animal feces.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.280
 There are terrible diseases.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.480
 You can get hepatitis A. You can get color.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.920
 You can get eat coli.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.440
 And this expert, they asked him about it.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.640
 And he said, you can't stop consenting adults

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.600
 from being stupid.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.120
 But we should at least try.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.200
 That's amazing.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.200
 We're going to have to-- sorry.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.040
 We're going to have to move on to our next vaccine.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.000
 I was just going to say that I was reading a quote

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.600
 from Mukande Singh, who's a founder of Live Water, which

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.160
 is one of the big water startups.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.520
 And so they don't trust all the chemicals that go

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.200
 in the water that we drink.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.880
 And he said, so we have things like chloramine

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.080
 and fluoride in our water.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.840
 Call me a conspiracy theorist.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.280
 But it's a mind-controlled drug that

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.440
 has no benefit to our dental health.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.120
 I'll go there.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.840
 He's a fucking conspiracy theorist.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.120
 Just one more thing.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.400
 Apple have built a new campus in California this year.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.360
 It's made completely out of glass.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.200
 And the idea is to encourage an open working environment.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.960
 And on the very first day, seven people

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.600
 were taken to hospital through walking into the hospital.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.080
 It's so good.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:34.160
 OK, it is time to move on to fact number two.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.600
 And that is Andy.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.840
 My fact is that the Victorian cat burglar, Charles Peace,

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.920
 could supposedly disguise himself just by changing

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.440
 the shape of his face.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.080
 So he was a real guy.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.920
 And before we go any further, he was a really unpleasant guy.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.040
 He was a burglar and he was a murderer as well.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.960
 But he killed two people.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.200
 For a while, he was the nation's most wanted man.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.920
 But he had this incredible gift, supposedly,

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.840
 for just moving his face into a slightly different shape.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.600
 And he would think, where did he go?

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.840
 I just can't see how that worked.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.760
 I can't imagine how that would work.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.280
 I know.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.560
 Neither can I, but supposedly he was very rubbery face.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.080
 I suppose like Mr. Bean kind of thing,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.320
 like Rowan Atkinson maybe.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.240
 Yeah, exactly.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.760
 Well, Jim Kerry, when he was in the movie The Mask,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.600
 the people who were doing the CGI,

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.000
 said they had to spend way less than they anticipated,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.400
 because his face was so elastic that he was able to contort it.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.480
 And it looked like CGI had been done already.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.000
 Oh, all right.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.840
 Yeah, there we go.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.440
 But it's not like it doesn't look like that.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.960
 It's not like Rowan Atkinson and Jim Kerry

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.120
 can avoid all publicity and attention

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.200
 by just contorting their face quickly.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.720
 Rowan Atkinson could be in the front row.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.400
 So this guy, Charles Peace, he was an extremely interesting man

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:46.960
 in lots of ways.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.800
 So he--

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.320
 He was really famous at the time, wasn't he?

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.880
 He was very, very notorious.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.160
 And he had a missing finger, which you would think

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.160
 would have identified him.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.960
 But he cleverly got around this by using an entire prosthetic arm,

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.800
 which apparently is less inconspicuous.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.280
 Yeah, the guy with three arms.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.360
 He's got the right number of fingers,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.080
 but he's not one extra arm.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.360
 He was executed, wasn't he?

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.360
 He was.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.040
 And he told the clergyman who interviewed him in prison

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.360
 just before his execution.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.200
 He said that he hoped that after he was gone,

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.440
 he would be entirely forgotten by everybody.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.560
 And his name never mentioned again.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.040
 Yeah.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.880
 Sorry, ma'am.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.600
 But also, within hours of his death,

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.840
 the first ballad of Charles Peace was on sale.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.360
 Was it?

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:33.840
 Yeah.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.160
 And the biography was ready for publication even before he was dead.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.360
 So that's how famous he was.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:38.880
 Wow.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.000
 And also, his executioner was very famous as well.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.280
 It was a guy called Marwood.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.120
 So he was executed by probably Britain's most famous

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.480
 at the time executioner.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.120
 People would go, he was a celebrity of execution.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.200
 And to the point where he had a popular rhyme

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.880
 that people used to sing about him, which was,

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.120
 if part killed Mar, who had killed part, Marwood,

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:57.960
 that was the--

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.800
 Oh, that's great.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.640
 That's really clever.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.360
 Cyclover.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.680
 I read, I mean, it's a bit gruesome,

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.200
 but in the British newspaper archive,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.000
 I actually read one of the articles from the time

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.320
 about when he was executed.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.840
 And it's darkly amusing because he does what any of us would do,

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.560
 which is like, he keeps trying to put it off.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.760
 So he'd like to say, and he said his prayers,

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.120
 and thanks for everyone who was ready to go.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.080
 And then he went, actually, I'm really thirsty.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.600
 Can I get a drink of water please?

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.160
 And they were like, no, I don't think so.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.880
 And they said, hold on, I've got one more thing to say.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.280
 And this article goes on and on.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.480
 He keeps on going, wait, wait.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.080
 I've just got one more quick thing before we--

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.480
 can I?

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.720
 And the person who he killed was a policeman called PCCock.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.440
 And what was interesting is, because he did kill this guy.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.480
 He was basically caught doing a burglary

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.240
 and he killed the policeman.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.320
 But luckily for him, the police simply picked up

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.360
 the nearest Irishman they could find.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.000
 They charged this Irishman with murder,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.440
 and then apparently Charlie attended the trial dressed

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.040
 as a vicar and made--

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.920
 Of course he did.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.840
 --with his three arms.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.680
 He played all 12 members of the jury at various points.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.840
 And then there's 20 money.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.360
 And he made loud remarks from the public gallery

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.280
 to the effect that the evidence was merely circumstantial.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.120
 So he was, you know, he was the guy who did it.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.880
 And he was like, this guy's not guilty, man.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.880
 This guy's a guilty--

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.000
 willing to say it was me, I did it.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.160
 No, you're right.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.440
 He's halfway there, conscience-wise, I think.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.280
 Yeah.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.680
 Yeah.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.760
 He admitted to it in the end when he

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.880
 was found guilty of the other murder.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.160
 He admitted to the early one.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.840
 Yeah, that's what I read in the article that I read

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.800
 is that he did admit by doing that, that it was him.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.080
 I read this, by the way, on a website called

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.520
 executedtoday.com.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.480
 Every new day, a new execution to read up on about.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.960
 If you're looking for a cheery read,

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.080
 executedtoday.com.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.920
 He did once have a really good comedy moment

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.400
 where he was in prison loads of times.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.240
 I don't know how he had time to do any burglaries.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.320
 And one time, he was put in a train

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.760
 and was being taken to a prison.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.520
 And he was coming out of works up on his way to this prison.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.840
 And he jumped off the train to escape.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.880
 And a warden on the train grabbed hold of his leg

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.840
 as he jumped off.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.320
 And apparently, he bounced along on his head

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.800
 with the warden clinging to his ankle.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.800
 A few hundreds of feet until eventually he wriggled out

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.760
 of his grip and then the train stopped

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.480
 and they turned back and picked him up again.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.480
 Should have worn a third leg.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.120
 Speaking of him and legs, his father

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.920
 was a one-legged lion tamer.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.920
 Yes.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.640
 I was quite a family, is what they're saying.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.880
 What's amazing, as well, there is no more detail

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.280
 about his dad under that one sentence.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.880
 His life, that's all that exists now, that's all we know.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.600
 We can guess how he lost the leg, I think.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:46.680
 But he was very bad, two-legged lion tamer, wasn't it?

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.840
 If we're being stichless for facts, he started as a collier

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.960
 and lost his leg when he was doing mining.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.880
 And then became a lion tamer, as he would.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.880
 So when you said there was no other information online,

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.280
 it was just--

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.640
 Well, it wasn't all executed today, don't come yet.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.800
 He became a shoemaker after being a lion tamer,

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800
 which I really loved that.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.800
 OK, there's a lot of stuff on the online.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.600
 I got it.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.680
 So was he a one-legged shoemaker?

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.120
 He's a one-legged shoemaker, everything half-price.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.160
 So he was apparently irresistible to women

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.360
 with his three arms and--

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.040
 Take your hand off me and that one.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.800
 And that one.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.960
 But I suppose if you can change your face all the time,

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.880
 then you can-- if you don't like this one, I've got others.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.960
 I've just done my last boyfriend.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.960
 He had three arms.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.040
 Maybe the new one's got three arms.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.480
 So he got married.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.080
 And then he moved to London.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.040
 And he got married again.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.600
 But he lived with his previous wife as well,

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.200
 who he called his mother.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.240
 And it seems that the second wife didn't know

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.240
 that who he called his mother was actually his first wife.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.520
 Oh, wow.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.040
 Oh, for a Victorian Jeremy Kyle show.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.720
 That's a-- well, he's a Jeremiah Kyle.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.920
 He's incredible.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.720
 That's true?

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.720
 Well, I mean, we should say actually at this point,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.840
 because I said it's true.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.600
 A lot of it is clouded in meth, isn't it?

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.840
 Because he was so famous.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.320
 And he was famous as like a Robin Hood kind of character.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.240
 So there were lots of stories about him.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.360
 But according to people at the time, this is what happened.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:28.000
 He lived with his wife and his mother in Peckham.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.120
 And they used to have parties attended

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.080
 by all the rich people in Peckham, which they were at the time.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:41.520
 And they're all now since Del Boy won the lottery.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.880
 And then what would happen is Charlie

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.160
 would get called out on some urgent business

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.000
 during the party.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.280
 They would carry on the party.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.800
 And then when all the guests got home,

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.520
 they all found they'd been burgled.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.760
 Well, so just on disguises--

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.200
 because this guy was disguising himself a lot--

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.080
 I tried to look up other people who had great disguises.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.880
 So there was a guy, a bank robber called Willie Sutton.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.840
 And he was very crafty.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.600
 Because he was known in life as Slick Willie.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.120
 And he-- night, come on now.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:18.560
 He, in 1947, he escaped the Philadelphia County Prison,

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.320
 where he was being held.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.560
 And he escaped dressed as a prison guard.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.040
 And he was so crafty that the search light on the prison wall

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:24.840
 found him.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.920
 But he was dressed as a prison guard.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.680
 And he just shouted, it's OK.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.200
 And they kept going.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.320
 That's so good, so good.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.200
 I was-- yeah, so I was looking at some other good disguises,

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.840
 more modern burglars of tried.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.680
 Did you guys read about the guy I think last year

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.720
 who dressed as a tree to rob a bank?

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.220
 So--

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:46.720
 Which one?

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.720
 What's it?

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:57.880
 So this is a new Hampshire.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.480
 And this is a guy who walks straight into a bank.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.840
 And he just-- there's pictures of him, there's CCTV.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.680
 He had kind of leaves duct tape to his kind of face

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.000
 and bits of his body.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.520
 He did.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.000
 He looked almost nothing like a tree.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.040
 But he walked in and he said, give me all your money,

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:14.920
 and they gave him money.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.360
 But then on CCTV, someone immediately recognized him.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.960
 Because he'd only covered about a quarter of his face

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.160
 with bits of twig and said that's not the ball,

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.200
 but whatever it was.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.040
 And he was cool.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.520
 When it be grape, there was a police line up

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.720
 of genuine trees and just--

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.880
 Do you know who you can tell an officer from MI5?

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.840
 Their spies, are they?

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.440
 They are spies.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.080
 So you wouldn't be able to tell them.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.880
 But there's a good chance that they will be dressed as a beggar.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.480
 Because this is a very good way of keeping surveillance

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.720
 on a building.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.840
 Because a lot of people ignore the beggars or the homeless

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.040
 or end and walk on by.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.200
 And one guy from MI5 said that for operations,

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.360
 he would use my own clothes soaked in my own urine

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.080
 to complement that cover.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.080
 So it is proper deep cover.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.080
 Wow.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.760
 I didn't see that James Bond film.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.360
 Ah, Bond, we've got you these.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.120
 They're your trousers covered in gold.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.200
 Just on spies, did you guys see the news today

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.960
 that, you know, how every country at the moment

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.080
 is sort of sending their Russian spies out,

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.320
 so Britain sent the Russian spies out?

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.040
 New Zealand said that they would do the same.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.600
 And then added, actually, we can't find any.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.480
 That could be that they're just really good stars.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.440
 That's a thing, yeah.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.440
 There are some weird new trees outside the last night,

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.320
 see, but a lot of people come there in their own past.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.320
 Do you know the CIA has a chief of disguise?

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.280
 So this is a real post in the CIA.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.560
 And there is someone who's just retired as the chief of disguise.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.400
 She's called Jonna Mendes.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.080
 And she said this in an interview.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.240
 I can't tell if she's joking or not.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.760
 I think she's being serious.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.600
 She said that one message, the CIA--

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.880
 one-- sorry.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.720
 She said that one method the CIA might use

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.640
 to send a message to someone would be to shave a pet,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.560
 tattoo a message onto it, and then

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.520
 pass the animal on once the hair has grown back on the animal.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.440
 Yeah, that's a historical thing, I think.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.160
 Well, I've heard it with ancient creeps shaving the head

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.680
 of the slave.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.880
 But I'm very much like I do shaving a hamster and writing.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.920
 I think you go for a snake.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.960
 You can't shave a snake.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.840
 Imagine if you wrote on, let's say, I don't know--

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.680
 It's going to be something big, which I don't know.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.280
 But yeah, if you got to the end of a dog,

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.440
 and then you ran out of words, so you had to append a hamster

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.440
 to the dog.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.040
 It's not the immediate messaging service of texting, is it?

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:40.800
 It's not.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.600
 If it's we compromise, burn everything

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.600
 and get out of the country.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.120
 OK, it's time to move on to our third fact.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.520
 And that is my fact.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.800
 My fact this week is that if the British treated their monarchy,

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.440
 the way that the ancient Egyptians did,

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.080
 Queen Elizabeth, the second, would

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.640
 have to run around a racetrack every three years

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.440
 to prove she was still fit for the job.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.440
 So the idea of this is that in ancient Egypt,

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.680
 it said that what they used to have

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.360
 was a festival called Hebset.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.680
 And after a pharaoh had reached 30 years in ruling power,

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.520
 that were they still fit to run it.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.400
 That was a big question.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.640
 And in order to prove that they were still fit,

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.600
 they would have to run around the complex of where

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.200
 they were living.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.840
 And usually it was a racetrack.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.960
 And they would do it with a sort of animal tail

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.240
 that was hanging behind them.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.200
 And everyone came to watch it.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.800
 And the first time you did it was after 30 years.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.720
 But then it was every subsequent three years

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.560
 because they thought you might lose it in those three years' time.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.080
 So if Queen Elizabeth the second had to do it,

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.680
 she would have done it 13 times by now.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.000
 And we don't actually know why they did it, do we?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.600
 No.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.440
 We're not quite sure.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.080
 There's a few different theories.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.960
 One theory that I quite like is that there

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.080
 was an original thing they did where once you're

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.080
 in office for 30 years, you would just get killed.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.800
 And then some smart pharaoh went, well,

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.440
 what if I do the running thing instead?

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.520
 Or maybe they were trying to kill him

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.920
 and he was running away, yes, like that.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.520
 But some people think that, other people,

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.480
 it's just like it proves that you're fit enough to do that.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.200
 I read it was a thing as well where it was sort of--

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.960
 it was directly related to the afterlife.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.760
 And by doing it, you were building up,

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.960
 as it were, bonus points.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.440
 I don't know what for, but--

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.240
 you know, like how Mario collects coins.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.240
 And it was just-- and it would do something for your next life.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.760
 I didn't see that theory, OK.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.560
 I love the ideas.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.960
 They were outrunning gold age.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.160
 That was all outrunning death.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.440
 That was another theory.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.000
 But you did?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.120
 They did really have to collect all the right stuff

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.400
 for the afterlife, didn't they?

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.520
 Egyptian pharaohs.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.400
 They're burying them with such a hassle.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.720
 It was like going on a holiday for the rest of your life.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.920
 So you have to pack everything you possibly needed.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:45.320
 So all ancient Egyptian royals were buried with many breweries

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.440
 so that they had all the alcohol they would need for the afterlife,

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.280
 which is quite good.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.000
 So it's like a really good source of how

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.560
 we know how they brewed beer and stuff in ancient Egypt.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.720
 It's because if you look at all the tombs of people

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.240
 from 3,000 years ago, they all had a little brewery in them.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.360
 They all had micro-breweries.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.000
 They all had a micro-brewery bunch of hipsters.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 With the beer and little beers.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.400
 And I've reached that before that.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.560
 They used to have slaves specifically

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.320
 to keep their wine cool, to fan their wine,

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.880
 which I don't know how well it works.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.520
 But they just go around with the fan, fanning the wine.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.560
 Well, there was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.640
 called Pepe the Second.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.400
 And he used to have a thing where there

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.520
 was so many flies that would hit you in ancient Egypt.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.400
 And it said that what he did was to make sure no flies ever landed on him.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.560
 He always took with him a servant or a slave

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:37.200
 who was coated completely in honey, so that any fly would immediately sit on that.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.560
 I learned that from horrible histories.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.040
 It's good, sir.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:41.560
 Yeah, good.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.760
 Pepe the Second, he was, he reigned for 90 years,

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.040
 so it seems like he did this running thing 20 times.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.480
 He reigned for 90?

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.800
 90 years, yeah.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.000
 Yeah, they can't decide because it comes from one source.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.880
 They think it might be that he reigned for about 64 years.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.840
 On the Beards thing, they would always, they would shave.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.240
 And then they would wear a false beard, which is supposed,

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.760
 I think it was an imitation of the gods,

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.800
 because I think they said that Osiris the God had a beard just like this.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.000
 And so if you shave and you put it on a false beard, just like this.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.360
 So there was a female pharaoh, wasn't there?

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.840
 And she always wore a fake beard.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.680
 Exactly.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.520
 Or something.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520
 Yeah.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.520
 So the queen, if she was ancient, Egyptian would have to wear a fake beard as well.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.520
 Yeah.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:26.080
 And on a hatch episode, there has just been a new image of her discovered.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.680
 This is very exciting, brand new archaeological discovery.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.040
 And a new image of her has been found in Swansea.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:32.560
 Really?

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.480
 Yeah, really.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.280
 It's been in storage for 40 years at Swansea University's Egypt Center.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.320
 And they were just having a standard teaching session

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.640
 going through a few of the images.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.800
 And one of the professors, his name is Ken Griffin.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.000
 He was examining it.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.600
 And he thought, that's a hatch episode.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.320
 And it's very hard, because they're all wearing a beard and normal male clothes

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.080
 in these depictions.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.520
 So it's very hard to spot her.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.600
 What was she doing in Swansea?

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.000
 Was that where she summit?

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.520
 Or--

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.120
 Weird.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.840
 I don't know.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:03.000
 We should say that a lot of the information that we have about ancient Egypt

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.160
 comes from Greek sources.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.840
 So a lot of it comes from Herodotus.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.160
 And he was a good historian, a lot of ways.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.560
 But then was sometimes a bit fanciful.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.960
 But I really like this, which I think is Herodotus, about--

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.640
 I'd never read this before, about the Persian king,

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.880
 Kambeisis, who defeated Egyptian pharaoh

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.000
 called Samatek III.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.600
 And he defeated him using his knowledge of Egyptian culture,

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.360
 specifically the fact that Egyptians worship cats, which is quite well known.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.320
 So what he did was he was attacking the Egyptians.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.560
 And he had this big army.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:36.000
 But then rather than actually attack their army with his army,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.440
 he took a bunch of cats hostage.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.200
 And then he released them onto the battlefield as his front line.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.280
 And actually, he had sort of backing them up a bunch of dogs, sheep,

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.240
 ibises, and whatever other animals the Egyptians hold dear.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.760
 And the Egyptians just surrendered.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.080
 They said, well, we can't kill any of those.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.640
 Because they're precious to us.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.440
 And they gave it.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.600
 How many cats was it?

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.280
 It was quite a lot, right?

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.160
 I think it was many.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.360
 Because that is quite--

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.120
 I mean, looking after cats like that and keeping them all in one place

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.320
 and making them stand in a row, I think he deserves it.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.560
 I reckon that's why they ran away.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:11.440
 And I like this guy as a cat whisperer.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.920
 I read a thing if we're talking about pharaohs

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.200
 and the weird things that they got up to.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.600
 There was one guy called pharaohs.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.440
 And he--

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.960
 He gets a pharaoh called pharaohs.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.160
 Yeah, I think so.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.760
 Yeah, so the gnar was flooding.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.120
 And he got very angry about that.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.440
 So he went down to it, and he threw a spirit at it

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.280
 as if to say, get down and thought he could puncture it, maybe.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.960
 And the gods were furious that he did that.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.240
 So they blinded him.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.760
 And as a result, he couldn't see.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.240
 Obviously he was blind, but he really wanted to.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.640
 So he spoke to, I believe it was an oracle,

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.280
 and said, I want my sight back.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.040
 And she said, what you have to do is you

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.800
 have to wash your eyes with the urine of a woman

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.840
 who has never slept with anyone but her husband.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.480
 So he thought, that's easy.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.840
 I'll just use my wives.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.760
 She's--

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.960
 So it didn't work.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.240
 Yeah.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.880
 She got another lot of trouble.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.280
 I mean, that's just not going to work anyway, though,

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:01.720
 is it?

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.280
 There is no medical way that washing your blind eye

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.640
 in urine is ever going to work.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.760
 And he said that, but he got every woman in town to come.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.680
 And he sampled there--

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.840
 Oh, he put it there.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.280
 He sampled their urine, and one eventually worked.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.360
 And he got his sight back.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.880
 So egg on your face.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.400
 Urine on your face.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.400
 It's like the original Cinderella, really, isn't it?

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.640
 It's pretty sharp, isn't it?

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.000
 Touring the land, wind my eye, wind my eye.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.560
 No, it's not this one.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.680
 James Bond turns up.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.720
 I think I can help with this.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.120
 Oh, we're going to have to move on shortly to the next act.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.400
 I just have a fact about running that I've

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.840
 wanted to say for a while.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.840
 And that is that in ancient times, in ancient Egypt,

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.080
 they didn't know what you're splendid.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.720
 And so they would often remove it in long distance runners

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.360
 to make them run faster.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.240
 Well, this is amazing.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.920
 This is genuinely true.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.720
 They basically, it was like a big organ

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.000
 than they thought, if they got rid of it,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.400
 maybe they'll just be a bit lighter

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.840
 and you'd be able to run faster.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.000
 Because they didn't know what it did.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.840
 Does it-- does it work?

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.800
 Well, no.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.520
 Let's give it a go.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.920
 Is Paula Radcliffe missing a trick here?

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.320
 So here is the amazing thing.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:13.680
 In 1922, some scientists at Johns Hopkins University

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.680
 removed the spleen from mice, and they ran faster.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.360
 OK.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.160
 And no one quite knows what causes a stitch.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:26.040
 But one theory is that it's too much blood going to your spleen.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.200
 But apparently, it's possible that by removing a spleen,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.680
 you might not have a stitch as much.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.840
 Of course, you would-- everything that the spleen does,

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.040
 you'd be in trouble for.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.920
 I think-- I mean, I don't know if this is

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.280
 how you feel on the other side of me,

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.640
 but I feel like we're all looking at you,

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.240
 partly thinking, what a stupid idea, and partly thinking,

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.080
 but what exactly does the spleen do?

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.120
 Yeah.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.280
 I think we're going to need to check the British cycling

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.000
 team for spleens at the end of the next season.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.280
 But what does it explain yourself?

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.760
 What does it do?

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.920
 I think it's part of your immune system or something.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.960
 Some of them-- some of them will probably

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.400
 50 people will come up and tell us after.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.760
 And then lots of people will tweet me.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.880
 But I think it's something to do with your immune system.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.680
 OK.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.920
 Can I tell you one quick thing about an Egyptian ferry

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.520
 that I like?

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.520
 Yeah.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.120
 The ferry is Sassostris, who, whenever

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.200
 Sassostris conquered a city or conquered an army,

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.880
 if it had been a particularly easy conquest,

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.200
 then the first thing he would do was he'd

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.520
 go up to all their pillars and he'd

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.360
 draw a female genitalia all over them

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.160
 to imply that they were a bunch of cowards, which I know

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.840
 is very anti-feminist, but it is also quite funny.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.080
 Wow.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.080
 OK.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.840
 It is time for a final fact of the show.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.400
 And that is Chazinsky.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:42.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.920
 My fact this week is that people who smuggle drugs one way

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:50.680
 across a Sahara desert often smuggle pasta the other way.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.200
 And this is pasta smuggling.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.240
 It's a big deal.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.800
 I read this in the economist.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.120
 And so they did a little investigation.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.160
 And it turns out that, if you're trafficking drugs,

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.280
 you have these big drugs that take them to a way

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.240
 you need to drop off the drugs.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.560
 And then you've got empty trucks.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.320
 So you might as well fill them with something.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.160
 And so they stuffed pasta in them.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:13.440
 And the drugs go north over the Sahara.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.040
 And then they fill them up with pasta in countries

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.640
 like Libya or Algeria, because they have subsidized pasta

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:19.160
 prices.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.040
 So it means that pasta is much cheaper there.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.360
 So they shove their trucks full of tagliatelle

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.800
 and then they drive them back down through the Sahara

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:30.880
 and deliver them in places like more southern places,

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.720
 like the Ivory Coast, Storquac and Salmaco and Marley as well.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.400
 Yeah.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.800
 And the economist spoke to an expert who

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.000
 reckons that, by weight, pasta is the main product

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.040
 by weight that smuggled across the Sahara.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.200
 Wow, just because you can make a profit on the other side.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.480
 You might as well, right, because you've got it.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.960
 But still driving a truck full of pasta by yourself

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.080
 across the Sahara desert.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.080
 There must be a cannoli life.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:06.040
 Mixed, mixed reaction.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.880
 Did you say how they weight marks on the way back?

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.600
 No, they put-- they stick spaghetti sticking out of the desert

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.600
 in the sand.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.120
 Right.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.760
 So when's it going from Libya to Senegal,

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.000
 they're putting bits of spaghetti in so they know how

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.880
 to get back to Libya?

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.400
 Yes.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.120
 Well, exactly.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.840
 How do they see it?

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.760
 I don't know.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.600
 That's the worst color to put as a way marker on sand.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.440
 It is.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.200
 It is weird that they're confused me.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.760
 I wanted to think maybe take lots together,

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.240
 so at least it sticks up like a pole,

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.520
 because spaghetti isn't that long.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.840
 And that is very different in West Africa.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.120
 But also, when they're going the other way,

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.040
 do they stick like cocaine in the world?

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.400
 So in the 13th century, they had pasta guilds in Italy.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.520
 And they were fighting over the right to make pasta

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.680
 and hope got involved.

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.480
 And the Pope was just trying to sort out tensions.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.240
 And he made a decree in 1641 requiring

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.160
 that all pasta shops be at least 25 yards apart.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.160
 So if you see two pasta shops that are closer than that apart,

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.480
 then that's basically-- they're excommunicated, basically.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.480
 Wow.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.800
 Just to stop them fighting.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.280
 Yeah?

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.840
 Do you know in Italy, and please shout,

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.560
 if you're Italian or you're fluent Italian,

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.520
 and this isn't true, I think it was in the New York Times,

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.480
 but in Italy, there's a specific word that

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.480
 refers to pasta without salt.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.720
 And the word is shioka, or shioccha.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.440
 And it also means silly.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.960
 So that's the word of a silly, which

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.480
 is also a pasta without salt.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.760
 That's a stupid idea.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.280
 And in the 19th century, they made pasta

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.840
 by getting huge troughs full of dough,

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:41.800
 and they would trample them like wine, like wine grapes.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.800
 And that's how you made it.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.600
 Really?

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.800
 And the King of Naples wanted to modernize

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.720
 and wanted to find a new way of doing it.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.400
 And the only way he could find of doing it

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.880
 was a huge mechanical man with bronze feet.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.320
 Last year, officials in Sudan seized more than 70

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.560
 use with sexual organs sewn onto them.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:03.280
 So?

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:03.800
 What?

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.600
 Sorry, can you?

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.600
 So a U is a female sheep, and they

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:13.560
 sewed on male sheep sexual organs onto the female sheep.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.320
 And that's because you have to pay a lot of tax--

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.040
 You're sorry, you have to pay a lot of tax.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.880
 Seems up, sir.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.720
 One has to pay a lot of tax for female sheep,

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.800
 because they're really good, and they

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.720
 can make lots of baby sheep and stuff.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.320
 But actually, male sheep are not that important.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.520
 And so if you're sending male sheep across,

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.040
 then you don't have to pay the tax.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.920
 And so the way they did it is got the female ones,

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.360
 and just put little light sodson cock and balls on them.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.800
 And obviously it didn't work in the end,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.040
 because they got caught.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.080
 No, it didn't.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:47.960
 They got caught.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.920
 But we only know the time they got caught.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.480
 This might have been happening for centuries.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.040
 It was called owling, actually.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.240
 Wasn't it sheep smuggling?

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.480
 That's a version of owling, which

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.600
 was sort of the main version of smuggling

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.360
 that existed in England, specifically,

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.120
 from about the 1,300 until the 1,800s,

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.640
 because they didn't want other countries

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.200
 to be creating their own wool, I think.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.120
 And so a lot we smothered wool out of England.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.360
 And yeah, but confusingly called owling,

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.140
 we don't know why, probably, to just

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.880
 bewilder custom officials.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.800
 And weirdly, I found someone which combined smuggling

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.160
 and pasta in another sense.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:27.660
 OK.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.920
 But it turns out to be a very disappointing story.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.240
 I'm afraid.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.400
 Basically, in 2012, there was smugglers

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.200
 who tried to smuggle four million fake cigarettes

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.600
 into the West Midlands.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.400
 And they did so by hiding them in a pasta consignment.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.000
 And I was really excited.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.380
 And then it turned out that they just

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.760
 hid them behind Canaloni, actually.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.760
 But they just hid them behind boxes of Canaloni,

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.760
 rather than what I assumed they had done, which

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.920
 was put the fake cigarettes inside penny.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.520
 I was-- I kid you not.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.720
 I was so excited about it.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.680
 I'm really excited.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.560
 I'm glad you took us on your emotional journey there.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.560
 Thank you.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.680
 I wasn't strong enough fact without the emotional journey.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.520
 That's the problem.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.560
 No.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.800
 I was reading about a modern smuggler who I really like,

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.520
 a guy called Robert Kusak, who's a Californian.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.400
 And he was flying home from Thailand.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.440
 He had been on holiday in Thailand.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.440
 And he was undergoing a routine inspection

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.360
 at the airport when an exotic bird flew out of his bag,

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.200
 which was awkward.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.680
 And so they searched his bags.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.960
 And they found three more exotic birds.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.960
 And they also found 50 orchids.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.000
 And then the security official said,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.200
 do you have any other contraband to declare?

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.600
 And he immediately said, yes, I've got monkeys in my pants.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.120
 They pulled down his trousers.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.560
 And he did indeed have two pygmy monkeys down his pants.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.480
 I've got a modern smuggler as well called Jasmine Claire.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:51.640
 And she was caught off the back of a tip that

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.920
 was given to the Homeland Security.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.280
 It was anonymously given saying that there

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.480
 would be possible smuggling activity taking place

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.480
 in the vicinity of a bed and breakfast

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.280
 called the smugglers in.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.080
 So they took it as a real tip, as opposed to thinking

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.040
 that was a bad joke.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.040
 And they set up a surveillance there.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.120
 And they eventually saw someone who

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.160
 was doing the smuggling.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.160
 It was Jasmine Claire.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.680
 It turns out they were alerted to the fact

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.200
 it might be her, because the car that

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.200
 arrived had the vanity license plate smuggler--

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:26.920
 --and it was her.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.640
 And she had blocks of cocaine.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.920
 Nine bricks of cocaine.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.720
 That's incredible.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:30.920
 Yeah.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.280
 Smugglers are in smuggler on the license plate.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.520
 It's the oldest double bluff I've ever heard.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.600
 Sorry, it didn't work.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.080
 So I became a bit obsessed with trying

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.040
 to find out-- I think we're all familiar with the term

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.320
 budgie smugglers.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.520
 I'd get which other very tight swimsuits

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.480
 worn in Australia, and elsewhere.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.760
 And I became obsessed with trying

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.800
 to find out if anyone has ever actually smuggled a budgie.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:56.800
 And it was a very long search, and it's a hard search.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.800
 I tried typing in the Latin name of the species.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.800
 That didn't yield anything.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.760
 I did find a paper called "The Smuggled Budgie"

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.560
 from 2010 for exciting etymology paper

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.680
 about the origin of the word budgie, like that.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.280
 But--

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.480
 That's emotional journey is amazing.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.040
 But I did find a guy in Cuba in 2014

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.360
 who-- this was pants based, as well.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.720
 He was detained trying to board a flight to the USA

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.720
 with 66 birds inside his trousers.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.440
 And he made it through the metal detector.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.000
 Obviously, birds are not made of metal.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.840
 So he's doing great.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.240
 But there were loads of bulges in his trousers,

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.880
 and he was stopped in the airport.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.160
 And when the authorities at the airport stopped him,

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.920
 he said, OK, you got me.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:43.360
 I am concealing a pigeon as a gift for my grandson

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.360
 in my trousers.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.520
 I presume he thought they would say, OK, fine.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.280
 No questions asked.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.040
 Go on your way.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.000
 Police forced him to remove his trousers,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.360
 and they found dozens of finches and hummingbirds hidden

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.600
 inside his trousers and his pants.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.600
 Yeah.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.680
 And sometimes when people smuggle rare birds,

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.120
 they have to tape their beaks shut so they won't

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.680
 sing like a canary.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.680
 But also, some people who smuggle them

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.720
 have their beaks facing inwards on the crotch region.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.640
 Oh, it's just like a massive hostage of fortune.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.920
 Why would they do that?

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.320
 I think it's just the very small--

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.640
 and I think it's the best place to hide them.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.480
 Maybe it's pleasant, who knows.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.440
 But it'll be happening in Silicon Valley

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.280
 with a fortnight of this podcast going out.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.640
 I read about that guy, and the article

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:31.680
 specified that the two birds next to his genitals were dead.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.960
 I don't know, kind of weird toxicity was happening there,

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.280
 but I killed two birds with one bone.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.120
 We're going to have to wrap up.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.680
 OK, that is it.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.360
 That is all of our facts.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.920
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.800
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.440
 about the things that we have said over the course

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.120
 of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.280
 I'm on @Streiberland, Andy.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.320
 Andrew Hunter, Emma.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:00.820
 James.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:01.840
 That's James Harkin.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.600
 And Shazinski.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.760
 You can email Poghost@QI.com.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.360
 Yeah, or you can go to our group account @nosuchthing,

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.640
 or a Facebook page.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.240
 No such thing as a fish, or no such thing as a fish.com.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:11.960
 It's our website.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.280
 We have everything up there from links to our tour dates.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.320
 We have our previous book that we released,

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:21.120
 and we also have a link to our new tape that we've released.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.720
 And we're about to give a copy of it away right now

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.920
 to one of the members of our audience here in Belfast.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.240
 Yeah.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.040
 So if the person who wins it, if you

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.680
 can give us a shout when we say your fact,

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.760
 and the winner is Anna.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.560
 So it's Natasha Riley.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.760
 Are you here?

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.880
 Yeah, come get us at the end.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.560
 This is the fact.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.760
 When filming the battle scenes for Game of Thrones

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.480
 filmed in Northern Ireland, of course,

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.160
 the fighting was so intense that they

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.360
 had to create a safe word in case someone got hurt.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.880
 So the safe word for Game of Thrones is banana.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.760
 That's awesome.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.280
 That's it.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.440
 That's all of our facts.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.440
 Thank you so much.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.440
 Good night.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.440
 [APPLAUSE]

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.800
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.800
 (audience cheering)
