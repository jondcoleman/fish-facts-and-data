1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,500
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,240
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,420
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,120
 this week coming to you live from Belfast!

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,360
 (audience cheering)

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,080
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,840
 with Anichis Isinski, Andrew Hansen-Marie,

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,920
 and James Harkin, and once again,

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,680
 we have gathered around the microphones

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,760
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,360
 and in no particular order, here we go.

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,440
 Starting with you, James.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,760
 - Okay, my fact this week is that there are a number

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,040
 of chickens in California that have their own personal chefs.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,520
 (audience laughing)

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,840
 - I think you'd live in constant fear as a chicken

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,320
 if you had your own chicken.

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,880
 (audience laughing)

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,320
 One day he's gonna run us to stuff in the pantry.

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,840
 - Oh, they can give me a lot of sage and onion recently.

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,320
 (audience laughing)

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,360
 - Mr. Chicken, tonight for dinner, you.

25
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,880
 (audience laughing)

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,080
 - Yeah, that's very exciting.

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,520
 - So this is specifically in Silicon Valley

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,240
 and at the moment there is a chicken mania happening

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,880
 in Silicon Valley.

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,400
 Single chicken can cost $350.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,840
 And normally they cost about $15.

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,720
 Their coupes are controlled by smartphone apps

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,640
 and basically it's kind of a state of symbol

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,400
 in Silicon Valley to have your own chicken.

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,720
 - Wow.

36
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,280
 - Are they special chickens in any way?

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,320
 Are they amazing or amazing, the all-night chickens?

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,040
 - Some of them are pretty good, actually, I have to say.

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,200
 I'm not sure I'd pay $350 for one, but they are pretty good.

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,640
 So they're specially bred for desirable personality traits.

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,400
 So the ones that are particularly.

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,480
 (audience laughing)

43
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,080
 - What is a personality trait in a chicken?

44
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,640
 (audience laughing)

45
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,480
 - Well, you know.

46
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,320
 - It's the ground.

47
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,080
 (audience laughing)

48
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,320
 - So for instance, if they're gentle enough

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,960
 for a child to cuddle.

50
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,800
 - Okay.

51
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,400
 - So rock 'n' like an angry chicken,

52
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,360
 you wouldn't want to put that near your child.

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,040
 They don't have those.

54
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
 There are some that are rare,

55
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,120
 there are some that are beautiful

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,640
 according to the article I read.

57
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,720
 And some of them have special highly coveted colored eggs

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,760
 and they're called Easter Eggers

59
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,440
 and they give you blue eggs.

60
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,280
 - Wow.

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,120
 - They're really, really good ones, those.

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
 - That's very cool.

63
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,400
 - They also, I read a lot of people

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,440
 keep the chickens in their house like they're a cat or a dog

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,080
 and they call them lap chickens

66
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,840
 'cause they come and they sit on your lap

67
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,960
 and you can just stroke them.

68
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,280
 And the way that they make sure

69
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,120
 that they don't defecate all over the house

70
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,720
 is they put them in diapers.

71
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,480
 So there's special chicken diapers that you can now buy.

72
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,160
 And I went to a website that sells these chicken diapers

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,000
 'cause I wanted to--

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,720
 - I want you all wearing them tonight.

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,200
 (audience laughing)

76
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,680
 - No, there's a few good websites that do it actually.

77
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,400
 There's one called my pet chicken

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,720
 and there's one called pampered poultry.

79
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,840
 Pampered poultry is very nice.

80
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,960
 So you can see that they're all nicely designed.

81
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,120
 They sit around the bum of the chicken, like a diaper.

82
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,880
 But they not only sell diapers,

83
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,320
 they also sell saddles on chickens.

84
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,280
 And it's mainly for people to ride chickens.

85
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,800
 - No, yeah.

86
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,680
 That's what I thought, but it turns out what it is

87
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,160
 is that when a chicken is having sex

88
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,280
 from the behind, the male is really aggressive

89
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,840
 and packs away at their back.

90
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,160
 So it's a sort of blanket that sits over the back

91
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,960
 of the chicken so they don't lose all their feathers

92
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,200
 when the male is just--

93
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,320
 - So it's when they're being ridden in a way.

94
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,800
 (audience laughing)

95
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,080
 - Very true, very true.

96
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,200
 They also, my pet chicken has a very exciting device.

97
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,760
 Basically, a lot of people have problems

98
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,240
 if they do have a chicken in their house

99
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,280
 where it does cock-a-doodle-doo a lot.

100
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,720
 So they have on their site, they called cock-a-doodle-don't.

101
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,880
 And cock-a-doodle-d don't is a new contraption

102
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,360
 that goes around the neck that stops it

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,560
 from crowing, from roostering.

104
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,400
 And--

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,280
 - How does it stop it?

106
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,640
 - It, it, it, it, it goes around the throat.

107
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,720
 - Please strangle the chicken.

108
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,000
 - Yeah, it, it, it's, it's a bit questionable.

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
 I'm not sure my pet chicken.com is--

110
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,000
 - Did you not just say this is a very cool contraption?

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,400
 - Can we edit that bit out?

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,120
 'Cause that's staying in, isn't it?

113
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,600
 And if you pay an extra amount of money,

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,080
 $12 more, it only costs $18 for it to happen.

115
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,560
 They say it doesn't hurt the chicken,

116
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,160
 but if you, uh, if the rooster, if you do it,

117
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,280
 for $12 more, you can buy a bow tie that goes around.

118
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
 - Absolutely, bargain.

119
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,400
 - For just $30, you can choke the chicken

120
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,160
 in a classy bow tie fashion.

121
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,080
 Oh, nice.

122
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,280
 [LAUGHTER]

123
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,040
 - Nothing more classy than a dead chicken with a bow tie on.

124
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,480
 You do get some incredible looking kind of designer chickens now,

125
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,320
 though.

126
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,640
 Or, I mean, just Google some designer chickens.

127
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,440
 They're stunning.

128
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,320
 But I think my favorite is the I Am Chicken, the--

129
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,480
 is AYAM, and it's described by breeders

130
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,120
 as the Lamborghini of chickens.

131
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,960
 [LAUGHTER]

132
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,520
 And you can see why.

133
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,640
 So you might have seen it.

134
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,880
 It's that chicken that's black, completely black from head to toe.

135
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,080
 It looks like it's been dipped in oil.

136
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,200
 So it's big, it's crown, it's--

137
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,400
 sorry, it's comb, it's legs, it's feet.

138
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,000
 And the weird thing is, like, it's eyes completely black.

139
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,840
 But the weird thing is, it's fully black on the inside as well,

140
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,680
 which I didn't realize.

141
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,640
 So all of its organs, all of the meat in it, all of its flesh,

142
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,200
 all of its bones, everything is black.

143
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,840
 And so if you then eat this chicken,

144
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,800
 it's the meat itself is black.

145
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,520
 The only thing about the chicken that's not black

146
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,480
 is it lays white eggs.

147
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,560
 And they're just-- they're incredible.

148
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,160
 And there's this I Am Breeder in America who's got a site

149
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
 where they sell them.

150
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,520
 And they say they're very, very good natured as well.

151
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,680
 So I think a New York magazine wanted to meet one.

152
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,200
 And the review said, "The rooster patiently allowed himself

153
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,440
 to be draped with million-dollar jewelry

154
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,040
 and trust with red ribbon, well-being photographed

155
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,720
 under bright lights."

156
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,280
 Which, again, it's an amazing looking chicken.

157
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,240
 People are doing some weird shit with their chickens.

158
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,240
 Yeah.

159
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,320
 Of course, your website's going to say,

160
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,800
 our chickens are extremely friendly.

161
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
 No website selling these chickens are going to say,

162
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,360
 our chicken's a real bastard, it's actually--

163
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,480
 [LAUGHTER]

164
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,720
 So I was looking up chickens in Silicon Valley,

165
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,200
 because it's the massive trend at the moment.

166
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,360
 There is a company at the moment

167
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,360
 is trying to disrupt eggs, OK?

168
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,160
 So they're trying to make-- there are food--

169
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,320
 stuff stuff-- thing called just.

170
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,520
 And they make eggless scrambled eggs out of mung beans.

171
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,400
 But the other thing they've started doing recently,

172
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,800
 they've started making chicken nuggets from chickens,

173
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,760
 which are still alive.

174
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,280
 What?

175
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,640
 The others just like chickens with bits missing.

176
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,000
 Well, kind of.

177
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,040
 So they took some cells from the inside of a chicken feather.

178
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,400
 So they took one feather from a chicken called Ian

179
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,040
 for the record.

180
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
 [LAUGHTER]

181
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,640
 I don't know.

182
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,040
 It's a perfectly spoiled land, normal land.

183
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,320
 So they took some cells from the inside of the feather.

184
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,400
 And then they cultivated them.

185
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,280
 And they fed those cells on plant proteins, right?

186
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,440
 And they turned those into a big mass of chicken meat.

187
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
 They grew those into chicken muscle.

188
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,720
 And then they had a barbecue where they served up chicken nuggets.

189
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,080
 And Ian was present walking around on the table while he was

190
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,320
 being eaten by these people.

191
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,760
 Presumably, surely he was there with a megaphone saying,

192
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,840
 this is an outrage.

193
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,160
 Yeah, it's very-- basically, people in Silicon Valley are mad.

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,760
 That's all we need to know.

195
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,760
 Yeah, you can go on a tour of Silicon Valley

196
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,680
 called Torda Coop, where you just see all of the chicken

197
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,520
 coops that they have, because they're unbelievably expensive.

198
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,960
 Some of them can cost up to like $20,000.

199
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,840
 And one owner, at least, plans to transform

200
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,720
 his coop into an Airbnb for humans.

201
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,680
 Once his chickens die, that's how on later it is.

202
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,680
 I don't-- and my parents had chickens.

203
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,960
 There's no way I'd want to sleep in the same place

204
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,160
 that those chickens are sleeping.

205
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,480
 That's disgusting.

206
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,000
 Would you share the coop with them?

207
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,880
 Or do they vacate--

208
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
 I don't know.

209
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,040
 I guess they vacate and leave you a croissant and stuff

210
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,000
 when you stay there, presumably.

211
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,480
 They're basically dead.

212
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,160
 And they've been eaten.

213
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
 They're long gone, and they probably clean it.

214
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,000
 And, you know.

215
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,120
 Oh, that's actually not how Airbnb works at all.

216
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,080
 [LAUGHTER]

217
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,920
 Thank you.

218
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,640
 Yeah, some other weird stuff that people in Silicon Valley are doing.

219
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,080
 So there's been a lot lately about what

220
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,000
 people in Silicon Valley call biohacking, which

221
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,640
 I just find a really amusing word, because what it means

222
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,320
 is stupid diets.

223
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,040
 But they call it biohacking, because it sounds really smart.

224
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,720
 But all the CEOs of all the big companies are into this.

225
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,040
 And weird kind of diets.

226
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,920
 So there's Jeffrey Wu, who's CEO of a biohacking company.

227
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,760
 And he got all his staff to do a full-on seven-day fast.

228
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
 And they all had to wear glucose monitors

229
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,600
 that are designed for diabetics.

230
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,680
 And it inserts pinpricks into your skin.

231
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,800
 And it measures your blood-elevated ketones, which

232
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,440
 is a way of checking how much fat you're using and stuff.

233
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,960
 So he makes all his staff go--

234
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,440
 staff themselves for seven days-- to make sure they're burning

235
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,520
 enough fat and it elevates your mental acuity and things

236
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,280
 like that.

237
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,080
 But they're all kind of going on silly teenage girl diets,

238
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,480
 getting his biohacking, and so it's OK.

239
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,840
 I read about Jeffrey Wu, because he started this thing.

240
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,400
 There's a drug that people in Silicon Valley take, which

241
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,160
 is the idea is it's a cognitive enhancing drug.

242
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,840
 And so it's a brain drug, effectively,

243
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,560
 and it's called new tropics, which is an old idea.

244
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,040
 That was back in 1972 that that term was coined.

245
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,640
 But the idea is you take it, and it makes

246
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,160
 your brain get stimulated.

247
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,040
 So he runs a company where he provides these drugs.

248
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,560
 Everyone's on these brain stimulant drugs in Silicon Valley

249
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,640
 if they're working with Jeffrey.

250
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,320
 But I don't know.

251
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,480
 If it's making you want to pay $350 for a chicken,

252
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,280
 I'm not sure how smart they're making you.

253
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,040
 Actually, the chicken's control the company that makes the drug.

254
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,560
 Have you met our CEO, Ian?

255
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,640
 I read about a hobby, because the hobbies that people have

256
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,240
 in Silicon Valley, and people do various weird sports and stuff,

257
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,840
 because there's a lot of mountainous terrain.

258
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,080
 Have you heard of ride and tie?

259
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,200
 This is so cool.

260
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,560
 So it's a mountain race involving two people on one horse.

261
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,240
 So-- but the rule is, only one person

262
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,320
 can be touching the horse at any given moment.

263
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,880
 So you get on the horse, and you ride for a couple of miles,

264
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,560
 and your friend runs, and then you tie the horse up

265
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,600
 for a couple of miles, and then you start running,

266
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,520
 and your friend catches up to the horse, gets on it,

267
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,920
 rides it, overtakes you, and then--

268
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,640
 And you have to get off after two miles.

269
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,840
 You can't just go on the horse for the whole length of the horse.

270
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,640
 Oh, that's a much better idea, actually.

271
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,400
 Yeah, again, see, they're reinventing the wheel,

272
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,560
 just going for a ride on a horse.

273
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,040
 That's pretty cool.

274
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,920
 I think it does sound kind of fun.

275
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
 It sounds quite intense.

276
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,040
 Yeah, really fun.

277
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,960
 Why wouldn't you just go on the horse alongside the person who's running?

278
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,720
 Horses can run faster than people can run.

279
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,240
 No, I know, but--

280
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,960
 Same as-- I mean, that's why those guys

281
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,000
 who do the grand national.

282
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,040
 Yeah.

283
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,680
 But no humans have won that, have they?

284
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,200
 They've never even qualified for it.

285
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,880
 But actually, there is a horse versus human race, isn't there?

286
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,000
 I think it's in Wales every year or something.

287
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Yeah.

288
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,960
 And sometimes the humans do win, but it's

289
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,760
 on a really twisty cost with like, you know, stairs and lifts.

290
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,280
 Things that horses can't do.

291
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,320
 And on drugs, actually, all Silicon Valley CEOs

292
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,360
 are also doing LSD at the moment.

293
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,560
 And again, the--

294
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,240
 For legal reasons, I think not all.

295
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,920
 Sorry, yes, definitely not all.

296
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,840
 Yeah, but bloody most right.

297
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,680
 But it's micro-dosing.

298
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,840
 So they take a tenth the amount of LSD

299
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,960
 that you'd usually, not you, but that one might usually

300
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,720
 take to get a proper hallucination.

301
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,280
 And apparently, the effect this has

302
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,520
 is that it increases alertness and energy and stuff.

303
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,320
 And it's another way of them, I guess,

304
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,600
 kind of biohacking themselves, taking a bit of hallucinogenic

305
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,640
 to make themselves more switched on.

306
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,920
 So the other thing that's been in the news

307
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,480
 is like raw water.

308
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,320
 Have you seen all this?

309
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,120
 Yeah.

310
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,040
 So basically, people are drinking water that's

311
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,560
 come direct from source and hasn't been decontaminated,

312
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,400
 which is really, really a terrible idea.

313
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,560
 There was an expert who said almost everything

314
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,040
 conceivable that can make you sick can be found in water.

315
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,560
 So a lot of it contains animal feces.

316
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,280
 There are terrible diseases.

317
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,480
 You can get hepatitis A. You can get color.

318
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,920
 You can get eat coli.

319
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,440
 And this expert, they asked him about it.

320
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,640
 And he said, you can't stop consenting adults

321
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,600
 from being stupid.

322
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,120
 But we should at least try.

323
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,200
 [LAUGHTER]

324
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
 That's amazing.

325
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
 We're going to have to-- sorry.

326
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,040
 We're going to have to move on to our next vaccine.

327
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,000
 I was just going to say that I was reading a quote

328
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,600
 from Mukande Singh, who's a founder of Live Water, which

329
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,160
 is one of the big water startups.

330
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,520
 And so they don't trust all the chemicals that go

331
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,200
 in the water that we drink.

332
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,880
 And he said, so we have things like chloramine

333
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,080
 and fluoride in our water.

334
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,840
 Call me a conspiracy theorist.

335
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,280
 But it's a mind-controlled drug that

336
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,440
 has no benefit to our dental health.

337
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,120
 I'll go there.

338
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,840
 He's a fucking conspiracy theorist.

339
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,840
 [LAUGHTER]

340
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,120
 Just one more thing.

341
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,400
 Apple have built a new campus in California this year.

342
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,360
 It's made completely out of glass.

343
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,200
 And the idea is to encourage an open working environment.

344
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,960
 And on the very first day, seven people

345
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,600
 were taken to hospital through walking into the hospital.

346
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,040
 [LAUGHTER]

347
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,080
 It's so good.

348
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:34,160
 OK, it is time to move on to fact number two.

349
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,600
 And that is Andy.

350
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,840
 My fact is that the Victorian cat burglar, Charles Peace,

351
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,920
 could supposedly disguise himself just by changing

352
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,440
 the shape of his face.

353
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,200
 [LAUGHTER]

354
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,080
 So he was a real guy.

355
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,920
 And before we go any further, he was a really unpleasant guy.

356
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,040
 He was a burglar and he was a murderer as well.

357
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,960
 But he killed two people.

358
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,200
 For a while, he was the nation's most wanted man.

359
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,920
 But he had this incredible gift, supposedly,

360
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,840
 for just moving his face into a slightly different shape.

361
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,600
 And he would think, where did he go?

362
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,840
 [LAUGHTER]

363
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
 I just can't see how that worked.

364
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,760
 I can't imagine how that would work.

365
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,280
 I know.

366
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,560
 Neither can I, but supposedly he was very rubbery face.

367
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,080
 I suppose like Mr. Bean kind of thing,

368
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,320
 like Rowan Atkinson maybe.

369
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,240
 Yeah, exactly.

370
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,760
 Well, Jim Kerry, when he was in the movie The Mask,

371
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,600
 the people who were doing the CGI,

372
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,000
 said they had to spend way less than they anticipated,

373
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,400
 because his face was so elastic that he was able to contort it.

374
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,480
 And it looked like CGI had been done already.

375
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,000
 Oh, all right.

376
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,840
 Yeah, there we go.

377
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,440
 But it's not like it doesn't look like that.

378
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,960
 It's not like Rowan Atkinson and Jim Kerry

379
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,120
 can avoid all publicity and attention

380
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,200
 by just contorting their face quickly.

381
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,720
 Rowan Atkinson could be in the front row.

382
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,520
 [LAUGHTER]

383
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,400
 So this guy, Charles Peace, he was an extremely interesting man

384
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,960
 in lots of ways.

385
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,800
 So he--

386
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,320
 He was really famous at the time, wasn't he?

387
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,880
 He was very, very notorious.

388
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,160
 And he had a missing finger, which you would think

389
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
 would have identified him.

390
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,960
 But he cleverly got around this by using an entire prosthetic arm,

391
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,800
 which apparently is less inconspicuous.

392
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,280
 Yeah, the guy with three arms.

393
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,800
 [LAUGHTER]

394
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,360
 He's got the right number of fingers,

395
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,080
 but he's not one extra arm.

396
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,360
 He was executed, wasn't he?

397
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
 He was.

398
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,040
 And he told the clergyman who interviewed him in prison

399
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,360
 just before his execution.

400
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,200
 He said that he hoped that after he was gone,

401
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,440
 he would be entirely forgotten by everybody.

402
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,560
 And his name never mentioned again.

403
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,040
 Yeah.

404
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,880
 Sorry, ma'am.

405
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,600
 But also, within hours of his death,

406
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,840
 the first ballad of Charles Peace was on sale.

407
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,360
 Was it?

408
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,840
 Yeah.

409
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,160
 And the biography was ready for publication even before he was dead.

410
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,360
 So that's how famous he was.

411
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,880
 Wow.

412
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,000
 And also, his executioner was very famous as well.

413
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,280
 It was a guy called Marwood.

414
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,120
 So he was executed by probably Britain's most famous

415
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,480
 at the time executioner.

416
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,120
 People would go, he was a celebrity of execution.

417
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,200
 And to the point where he had a popular rhyme

418
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,880
 that people used to sing about him, which was,

419
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,120
 if part killed Mar, who had killed part, Marwood,

420
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,960
 that was the--

421
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,800
 Oh, that's great.

422
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,640
 That's really clever.

423
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,400
 Yeah, yeah.

424
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,360
 Cyclover.

425
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,680
 I read, I mean, it's a bit gruesome,

426
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,200
 but in the British newspaper archive,

427
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,000
 I actually read one of the articles from the time

428
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,320
 about when he was executed.

429
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,840
 And it's darkly amusing because he does what any of us would do,

430
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,560
 which is like, he keeps trying to put it off.

431
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,760
 So he'd like to say, and he said his prayers,

432
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,120
 and thanks for everyone who was ready to go.

433
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,080
 And then he went, actually, I'm really thirsty.

434
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,600
 Can I get a drink of water please?

435
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,160
 And they were like, no, I don't think so.

436
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,880
 And they said, hold on, I've got one more thing to say.

437
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,280
 And this article goes on and on.

438
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,480
 He keeps on going, wait, wait.

439
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,080
 I've just got one more quick thing before we--

440
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,480
 can I?

441
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,720
 And the person who he killed was a policeman called PCCock.

442
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,440
 And what was interesting is, because he did kill this guy.

443
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,480
 He was basically caught doing a burglary

444
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,240
 and he killed the policeman.

445
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,320
 But luckily for him, the police simply picked up

446
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,360
 the nearest Irishman they could find.

447
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,360
 [LAUGHTER]

448
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,000
 They charged this Irishman with murder,

449
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,440
 and then apparently Charlie attended the trial dressed

450
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,040
 as a vicar and made--

451
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,920
 Of course he did.

452
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,840
 --with his three arms.

453
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,680
 He played all 12 members of the jury at various points.

454
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,840
 And then there's 20 money.

455
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,360
 And he made loud remarks from the public gallery

456
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,280
 to the effect that the evidence was merely circumstantial.

457
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,120
 So he was, you know, he was the guy who did it.

458
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,880
 And he was like, this guy's not guilty, man.

459
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
 This guy's a guilty--

460
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,000
 willing to say it was me, I did it.

461
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,160
 No, you're right.

462
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,440
 He's halfway there, conscience-wise, I think.

463
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,280
 Yeah.

464
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,680
 Yeah.

465
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,760
 He admitted to it in the end when he

466
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,880
 was found guilty of the other murder.

467
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,160
 He admitted to the early one.

468
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,840
 Yeah, that's what I read in the article that I read

469
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,800
 is that he did admit by doing that, that it was him.

470
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,080
 I read this, by the way, on a website called

471
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,520
 executedtoday.com.

472
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,480
 Every new day, a new execution to read up on about.

473
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,960
 If you're looking for a cheery read,

474
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,080
 executedtoday.com.

475
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,920
 He did once have a really good comedy moment

476
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,400
 where he was in prison loads of times.

477
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
 I don't know how he had time to do any burglaries.

478
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,320
 And one time, he was put in a train

479
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,760
 and was being taken to a prison.

480
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,520
 And he was coming out of works up on his way to this prison.

481
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,840
 And he jumped off the train to escape.

482
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,880
 And a warden on the train grabbed hold of his leg

483
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,840
 as he jumped off.

484
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,320
 And apparently, he bounced along on his head

485
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,800
 with the warden clinging to his ankle.

486
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,800
 A few hundreds of feet until eventually he wriggled out

487
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,760
 of his grip and then the train stopped

488
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,480
 and they turned back and picked him up again.

489
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,480
 Should have worn a third leg.

490
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,120
 Speaking of him and legs, his father

491
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,920
 was a one-legged lion tamer.

492
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
 Yes.

493
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,640
 I was quite a family, is what they're saying.

494
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,880
 What's amazing, as well, there is no more detail

495
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,280
 about his dad under that one sentence.

496
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,880
 His life, that's all that exists now, that's all we know.

497
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,600
 We can guess how he lost the leg, I think.

498
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,680
 But he was very bad, two-legged lion tamer, wasn't it?

499
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,840
 If we're being stichless for facts, he started as a collier

500
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,960
 and lost his leg when he was doing mining.

501
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,880
 And then became a lion tamer, as he would.

502
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
 So when you said there was no other information online,

503
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,280
 it was just--

504
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,640
 Well, it wasn't all executed today, don't come yet.

505
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,800
 He became a shoemaker after being a lion tamer,

506
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
 which I really loved that.

507
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 OK, there's a lot of stuff on the online.

508
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,600
 I got it.

509
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,680
 So was he a one-legged shoemaker?

510
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,120
 He's a one-legged shoemaker, everything half-price.

511
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,160
 So he was apparently irresistible to women

512
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,360
 with his three arms and--

513
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,040
 Take your hand off me and that one.

514
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,800
 And that one.

515
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,960
 But I suppose if you can change your face all the time,

516
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,880
 then you can-- if you don't like this one, I've got others.

517
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,960
 I've just done my last boyfriend.

518
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
 He had three arms.

519
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,040
 Maybe the new one's got three arms.

520
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,480
 So he got married.

521
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,080
 And then he moved to London.

522
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,040
 And he got married again.

523
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,600
 But he lived with his previous wife as well,

524
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,200
 who he called his mother.

525
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,240
 And it seems that the second wife didn't know

526
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,240
 that who he called his mother was actually his first wife.

527
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,520
 Oh, wow.

528
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,040
 Oh, for a Victorian Jeremy Kyle show.

529
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,440
 [LAUGHTER]

530
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,720
 That's a-- well, he's a Jeremiah Kyle.

531
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,880
 [LAUGHTER]

532
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,920
 He's incredible.

533
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,720
 That's true?

534
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,720
 Well, I mean, we should say actually at this point,

535
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,840
 because I said it's true.

536
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,600
 A lot of it is clouded in meth, isn't it?

537
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,840
 Because he was so famous.

538
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,320
 And he was famous as like a Robin Hood kind of character.

539
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,240
 So there were lots of stories about him.

540
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,360
 But according to people at the time, this is what happened.

541
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,000
 He lived with his wife and his mother in Peckham.

542
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,120
 And they used to have parties attended

543
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,080
 by all the rich people in Peckham, which they were at the time.

544
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:41,520
 And they're all now since Del Boy won the lottery.

545
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,880
 And then what would happen is Charlie

546
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,160
 would get called out on some urgent business

547
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,000
 during the party.

548
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,280
 They would carry on the party.

549
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,800
 And then when all the guests got home,

550
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,520
 they all found they'd been burgled.

551
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,000
 [LAUGHTER]

552
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,760
 Well, so just on disguises--

553
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,200
 because this guy was disguising himself a lot--

554
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,080
 I tried to look up other people who had great disguises.

555
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,880
 So there was a guy, a bank robber called Willie Sutton.

556
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,840
 And he was very crafty.

557
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,600
 Because he was known in life as Slick Willie.

558
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,120
 And he-- night, come on now.

559
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:18,560
 He, in 1947, he escaped the Philadelphia County Prison,

560
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,320
 where he was being held.

561
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,560
 And he escaped dressed as a prison guard.

562
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,040
 And he was so crafty that the search light on the prison wall

563
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,840
 found him.

564
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,920
 But he was dressed as a prison guard.

565
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,680
 And he just shouted, it's OK.

566
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
 [LAUGHTER]

567
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,200
 And they kept going.

568
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,320
 That's so good, so good.

569
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,200
 I was-- yeah, so I was looking at some other good disguises,

570
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,840
 more modern burglars of tried.

571
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,680
 Did you guys read about the guy I think last year

572
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,720
 who dressed as a tree to rob a bank?

573
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,220
 So--

574
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,720
 Which one?

575
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
 What's it?

576
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,240
 [LAUGHTER]

577
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:57,880
 So this is a new Hampshire.

578
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,480
 And this is a guy who walks straight into a bank.

579
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,840
 And he just-- there's pictures of him, there's CCTV.

580
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,680
 He had kind of leaves duct tape to his kind of face

581
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,000
 and bits of his body.

582
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,520
 He did.

583
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,000
 He looked almost nothing like a tree.

584
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,280
 [LAUGHTER]

585
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,040
 But he walked in and he said, give me all your money,

586
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,920
 and they gave him money.

587
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,360
 But then on CCTV, someone immediately recognized him.

588
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,960
 Because he'd only covered about a quarter of his face

589
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,160
 with bits of twig and said that's not the ball,

590
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,200
 but whatever it was.

591
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,040
 And he was cool.

592
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,520
 When it be grape, there was a police line up

593
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,720
 of genuine trees and just--

594
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,720
 [LAUGHTER]

595
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,880
 Do you know who you can tell an officer from MI5?

596
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,840
 Their spies, are they?

597
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,440
 They are spies.

598
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,080
 So you wouldn't be able to tell them.

599
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,880
 But there's a good chance that they will be dressed as a beggar.

600
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,480
 Because this is a very good way of keeping surveillance

601
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,720
 on a building.

602
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
 Because a lot of people ignore the beggars or the homeless

603
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,040
 or end and walk on by.

604
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,200
 And one guy from MI5 said that for operations,

605
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,360
 he would use my own clothes soaked in my own urine

606
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,080
 to complement that cover.

607
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
 So it is proper deep cover.

608
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
 Wow.

609
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,760
 I didn't see that James Bond film.

610
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,360
 Ah, Bond, we've got you these.

611
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,120
 They're your trousers covered in gold.

612
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,160
 [LAUGHTER]

613
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,200
 Just on spies, did you guys see the news today

614
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,960
 that, you know, how every country at the moment

615
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,080
 is sort of sending their Russian spies out,

616
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,320
 so Britain sent the Russian spies out?

617
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,040
 New Zealand said that they would do the same.

618
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,600
 And then added, actually, we can't find any.

619
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,480
 That could be that they're just really good stars.

620
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,440
 That's a thing, yeah.

621
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
 There are some weird new trees outside the last night,

622
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,320
 see, but a lot of people come there in their own past.

623
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,120
 [LAUGHTER]

624
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,320
 Do you know the CIA has a chief of disguise?

625
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,280
 So this is a real post in the CIA.

626
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,560
 And there is someone who's just retired as the chief of disguise.

627
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,400
 She's called Jonna Mendes.

628
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,080
 And she said this in an interview.

629
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,240
 I can't tell if she's joking or not.

630
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,760
 I think she's being serious.

631
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,600
 She said that one message, the CIA--

632
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,880
 one-- sorry.

633
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,720
 She said that one method the CIA might use

634
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,640
 to send a message to someone would be to shave a pet,

635
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,560
 tattoo a message onto it, and then

636
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,520
 pass the animal on once the hair has grown back on the animal.

637
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,440
 Yeah, that's a historical thing, I think.

638
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,160
 Well, I've heard it with ancient creeps shaving the head

639
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,680
 of the slave.

640
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,880
 But I'm very much like I do shaving a hamster and writing.

641
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,920
 I think you go for a snake.

642
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,960
 You can't shave a snake.

643
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,800
 [LAUGHTER]

644
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,840
 Imagine if you wrote on, let's say, I don't know--

645
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,680
 It's going to be something big, which I don't know.

646
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,280
 But yeah, if you got to the end of a dog,

647
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,440
 and then you ran out of words, so you had to append a hamster

648
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
 to the dog.

649
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,800
 [LAUGHTER]

650
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,040
 It's not the immediate messaging service of texting, is it?

651
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,800
 It's not.

652
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,600
 If it's we compromise, burn everything

653
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,600
 and get out of the country.

654
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,120
 OK, it's time to move on to our third fact.

655
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,520
 And that is my fact.

656
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,800
 My fact this week is that if the British treated their monarchy,

657
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,440
 the way that the ancient Egyptians did,

658
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,080
 Queen Elizabeth, the second, would

659
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,640
 have to run around a racetrack every three years

660
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,440
 to prove she was still fit for the job.

661
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,600
 [LAUGHTER]

662
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,440
 So the idea of this is that in ancient Egypt,

663
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,680
 it said that what they used to have

664
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,360
 was a festival called Hebset.

665
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,680
 And after a pharaoh had reached 30 years in ruling power,

666
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,520
 that were they still fit to run it.

667
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,400
 That was a big question.

668
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,640
 And in order to prove that they were still fit,

669
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,600
 they would have to run around the complex of where

670
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,200
 they were living.

671
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,840
 And usually it was a racetrack.

672
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,960
 And they would do it with a sort of animal tail

673
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,240
 that was hanging behind them.

674
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,200
 And everyone came to watch it.

675
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,800
 And the first time you did it was after 30 years.

676
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,720
 But then it was every subsequent three years

677
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,560
 because they thought you might lose it in those three years' time.

678
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,080
 So if Queen Elizabeth the second had to do it,

679
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,680
 she would have done it 13 times by now.

680
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,000
 And we don't actually know why they did it, do we?

681
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,600
 No.

682
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,440
 We're not quite sure.

683
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,080
 There's a few different theories.

684
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,960
 One theory that I quite like is that there

685
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,080
 was an original thing they did where once you're

686
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,080
 in office for 30 years, you would just get killed.

687
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,800
 And then some smart pharaoh went, well,

688
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,440
 what if I do the running thing instead?

689
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,520
 Or maybe they were trying to kill him

690
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,920
 and he was running away, yes, like that.

691
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,520
 But some people think that, other people,

692
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,480
 it's just like it proves that you're fit enough to do that.

693
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,200
 I read it was a thing as well where it was sort of--

694
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,960
 it was directly related to the afterlife.

695
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,760
 And by doing it, you were building up,

696
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,960
 as it were, bonus points.

697
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,440
 I don't know what for, but--

698
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,240
 you know, like how Mario collects coins.

699
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,240
 And it was just-- and it would do something for your next life.

700
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,760
 I didn't see that theory, OK.

701
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,560
 I love the ideas.

702
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,960
 They were outrunning gold age.

703
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,160
 That was all outrunning death.

704
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,440
 That was another theory.

705
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,000
 But you did?

706
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,120
 They did really have to collect all the right stuff

707
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,400
 for the afterlife, didn't they?

708
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,520
 Egyptian pharaohs.

709
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,400
 They're burying them with such a hassle.

710
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,720
 It was like going on a holiday for the rest of your life.

711
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,920
 So you have to pack everything you possibly needed.

712
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,320
 So all ancient Egyptian royals were buried with many breweries

713
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,440
 so that they had all the alcohol they would need for the afterlife,

714
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,280
 which is quite good.

715
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,000
 So it's like a really good source of how

716
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,560
 we know how they brewed beer and stuff in ancient Egypt.

717
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,720
 It's because if you look at all the tombs of people

718
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,240
 from 3,000 years ago, they all had a little brewery in them.

719
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,360
 They all had micro-breweries.

720
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,000
 They all had a micro-brewery bunch of hipsters.

721
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 With the beer and little beers.

722
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,400
 And I've reached that before that.

723
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,560
 They used to have slaves specifically

724
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,320
 to keep their wine cool, to fan their wine,

725
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,880
 which I don't know how well it works.

726
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,520
 But they just go around with the fan, fanning the wine.

727
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,560
 Well, there was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh

728
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,640
 called Pepe the Second.

729
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,400
 And he used to have a thing where there

730
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,520
 was so many flies that would hit you in ancient Egypt.

731
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,400
 And it said that what he did was to make sure no flies ever landed on him.

732
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,560
 He always took with him a servant or a slave

733
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:37,200
 who was coated completely in honey, so that any fly would immediately sit on that.

734
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,560
 I learned that from horrible histories.

735
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,040
 It's good, sir.

736
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,560
 Yeah, good.

737
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,760
 Pepe the Second, he was, he reigned for 90 years,

738
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,040
 so it seems like he did this running thing 20 times.

739
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,480
 He reigned for 90?

740
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,800
 90 years, yeah.

741
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,000
 Yeah, they can't decide because it comes from one source.

742
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,880
 They think it might be that he reigned for about 64 years.

743
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,840
 On the Beards thing, they would always, they would shave.

744
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,240
 And then they would wear a false beard, which is supposed,

745
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,760
 I think it was an imitation of the gods,

746
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,800
 because I think they said that Osiris the God had a beard just like this.

747
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,000
 And so if you shave and you put it on a false beard, just like this.

748
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,360
 So there was a female pharaoh, wasn't there?

749
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,840
 And she always wore a fake beard.

750
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,680
 Exactly.

751
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,520
 Or something.

752
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
 Yeah.

753
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,520
 So the queen, if she was ancient, Egyptian would have to wear a fake beard as well.

754
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
 Yeah.

755
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:26,080
 And on a hatch episode, there has just been a new image of her discovered.

756
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,680
 This is very exciting, brand new archaeological discovery.

757
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,040
 And a new image of her has been found in Swansea.

758
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,560
 Really?

759
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,480
 Yeah, really.

760
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,280
 It's been in storage for 40 years at Swansea University's Egypt Center.

761
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,320
 And they were just having a standard teaching session

762
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,640
 going through a few of the images.

763
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,800
 And one of the professors, his name is Ken Griffin.

764
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,000
 He was examining it.

765
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,600
 And he thought, that's a hatch episode.

766
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,320
 And it's very hard, because they're all wearing a beard and normal male clothes

767
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,080
 in these depictions.

768
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,520
 So it's very hard to spot her.

769
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,600
 What was she doing in Swansea?

770
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,000
 Was that where she summit?

771
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,520
 Or--

772
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,360
 [LAUGHTER]

773
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,120
 Weird.

774
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,840
 I don't know.

775
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,000
 We should say that a lot of the information that we have about ancient Egypt

776
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,160
 comes from Greek sources.

777
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,840
 So a lot of it comes from Herodotus.

778
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,160
 And he was a good historian, a lot of ways.

779
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,560
 But then was sometimes a bit fanciful.

780
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,960
 But I really like this, which I think is Herodotus, about--

781
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,640
 I'd never read this before, about the Persian king,

782
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,880
 Kambeisis, who defeated Egyptian pharaoh

783
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,000
 called Samatek III.

784
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,600
 And he defeated him using his knowledge of Egyptian culture,

785
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,360
 specifically the fact that Egyptians worship cats, which is quite well known.

786
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,320
 So what he did was he was attacking the Egyptians.

787
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,560
 And he had this big army.

788
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,000
 But then rather than actually attack their army with his army,

789
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,440
 he took a bunch of cats hostage.

790
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,200
 And then he released them onto the battlefield as his front line.

791
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,280
 And actually, he had sort of backing them up a bunch of dogs, sheep,

792
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,240
 ibises, and whatever other animals the Egyptians hold dear.

793
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,760
 And the Egyptians just surrendered.

794
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,080
 They said, well, we can't kill any of those.

795
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,640
 Because they're precious to us.

796
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,440
 And they gave it.

797
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,600
 How many cats was it?

798
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,280
 It was quite a lot, right?

799
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,160
 I think it was many.

800
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,360
 Because that is quite--

801
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,120
 I mean, looking after cats like that and keeping them all in one place

802
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,320
 and making them stand in a row, I think he deserves it.

803
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,560
 I reckon that's why they ran away.

804
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,440
 And I like this guy as a cat whisperer.

805
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,920
 I read a thing if we're talking about pharaohs

806
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,200
 and the weird things that they got up to.

807
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,600
 There was one guy called pharaohs.

808
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,440
 And he--

809
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,960
 He gets a pharaoh called pharaohs.

810
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,160
 Yeah, I think so.

811
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,760
 Yeah, so the gnar was flooding.

812
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,120
 And he got very angry about that.

813
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,440
 So he went down to it, and he threw a spirit at it

814
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,280
 as if to say, get down and thought he could puncture it, maybe.

815
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,960
 And the gods were furious that he did that.

816
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
 So they blinded him.

817
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,760
 And as a result, he couldn't see.

818
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,240
 Obviously he was blind, but he really wanted to.

819
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,640
 So he spoke to, I believe it was an oracle,

820
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,280
 and said, I want my sight back.

821
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,040
 And she said, what you have to do is you

822
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,800
 have to wash your eyes with the urine of a woman

823
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,840
 who has never slept with anyone but her husband.

824
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,480
 So he thought, that's easy.

825
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,840
 I'll just use my wives.

826
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,760
 She's--

827
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,960
 So it didn't work.

828
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,240
 Yeah.

829
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,880
 She got another lot of trouble.

830
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,280
 I mean, that's just not going to work anyway, though,

831
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:01,720
 is it?

832
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,280
 There is no medical way that washing your blind eye

833
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,640
 in urine is ever going to work.

834
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,760
 And he said that, but he got every woman in town to come.

835
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,680
 And he sampled there--

836
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,840
 Oh, he put it there.

837
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,280
 He sampled their urine, and one eventually worked.

838
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,360
 And he got his sight back.

839
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,880
 So egg on your face.

840
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,400
 Urine on your face.

841
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
 It's like the original Cinderella, really, isn't it?

842
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,640
 It's pretty sharp, isn't it?

843
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,000
 Touring the land, wind my eye, wind my eye.

844
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,560
 No, it's not this one.

845
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,680
 James Bond turns up.

846
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,720
 I think I can help with this.

847
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,120
 Oh, we're going to have to move on shortly to the next act.

848
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,400
 I just have a fact about running that I've

849
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,840
 wanted to say for a while.

850
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,840
 And that is that in ancient times, in ancient Egypt,

851
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,080
 they didn't know what you're splendid.

852
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,720
 And so they would often remove it in long distance runners

853
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,360
 to make them run faster.

854
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,240
 Well, this is amazing.

855
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,920
 This is genuinely true.

856
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,720
 They basically, it was like a big organ

857
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,000
 than they thought, if they got rid of it,

858
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,400
 maybe they'll just be a bit lighter

859
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,840
 and you'd be able to run faster.

860
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,000
 Because they didn't know what it did.

861
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,840
 Does it-- does it work?

862
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,800
 Well, no.

863
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,520
 Let's give it a go.

864
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,920
 Is Paula Radcliffe missing a trick here?

865
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,320
 So here is the amazing thing.

866
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,680
 In 1922, some scientists at Johns Hopkins University

867
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,680
 removed the spleen from mice, and they ran faster.

868
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,360
 OK.

869
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,160
 And no one quite knows what causes a stitch.

870
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:26,040
 But one theory is that it's too much blood going to your spleen.

871
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,200
 But apparently, it's possible that by removing a spleen,

872
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,680
 you might not have a stitch as much.

873
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,840
 Of course, you would-- everything that the spleen does,

874
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,040
 you'd be in trouble for.

875
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,920
 I think-- I mean, I don't know if this is

876
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,280
 how you feel on the other side of me,

877
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,640
 but I feel like we're all looking at you,

878
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,240
 partly thinking, what a stupid idea, and partly thinking,

879
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,080
 but what exactly does the spleen do?

880
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,120
 Yeah.

881
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,280
 I think we're going to need to check the British cycling

882
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,000
 team for spleens at the end of the next season.

883
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,280
 But what does it explain yourself?

884
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,760
 What does it do?

885
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,920
 I think it's part of your immune system or something.

886
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,960
 Some of them-- some of them will probably

887
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,400
 50 people will come up and tell us after.

888
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,760
 And then lots of people will tweet me.

889
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,880
 But I think it's something to do with your immune system.

890
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,680
 OK.

891
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,920
 Can I tell you one quick thing about an Egyptian ferry

892
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,520
 that I like?

893
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
 Yeah.

894
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,120
 The ferry is Sassostris, who, whenever

895
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,200
 Sassostris conquered a city or conquered an army,

896
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,880
 if it had been a particularly easy conquest,

897
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,200
 then the first thing he would do was he'd

898
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,520
 go up to all their pillars and he'd

899
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,360
 draw a female genitalia all over them

900
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,160
 to imply that they were a bunch of cowards, which I know

901
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,840
 is very anti-feminist, but it is also quite funny.

902
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,200
 [LAUGHTER]

903
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,080
 Wow.

904
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,080
 OK.

905
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,840
 It is time for a final fact of the show.

906
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,400
 And that is Chazinsky.

907
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,600
 Oh, yeah.

908
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,920
 My fact this week is that people who smuggle drugs one way

909
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,680
 across a Sahara desert often smuggle pasta the other way.

910
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,200
 And this is pasta smuggling.

911
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,240
 It's a big deal.

912
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,800
 I read this in the economist.

913
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,120
 And so they did a little investigation.

914
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,160
 And it turns out that, if you're trafficking drugs,

915
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,280
 you have these big drugs that take them to a way

916
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,240
 you need to drop off the drugs.

917
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,560
 And then you've got empty trucks.

918
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,320
 So you might as well fill them with something.

919
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,160
 And so they stuffed pasta in them.

920
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,440
 And the drugs go north over the Sahara.

921
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,040
 And then they fill them up with pasta in countries

922
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,640
 like Libya or Algeria, because they have subsidized pasta

923
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,160
 prices.

924
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,040
 So it means that pasta is much cheaper there.

925
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,360
 So they shove their trucks full of tagliatelle

926
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,800
 and then they drive them back down through the Sahara

927
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,880
 and deliver them in places like more southern places,

928
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,720
 like the Ivory Coast, Storquac and Salmaco and Marley as well.

929
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,400
 Yeah.

930
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,800
 And the economist spoke to an expert who

931
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,000
 reckons that, by weight, pasta is the main product

932
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,040
 by weight that smuggled across the Sahara.

933
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,200
 Wow, just because you can make a profit on the other side.

934
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,000
 Yeah, exactly.

935
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,480
 You might as well, right, because you've got it.

936
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,960
 But still driving a truck full of pasta by yourself

937
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,080
 across the Sahara desert.

938
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,080
 There must be a cannoli life.

939
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,800
 [LAUGHTER]

940
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:06,040
 Mixed, mixed reaction.

941
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,880
 Did you say how they weight marks on the way back?

942
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,600
 No, they put-- they stick spaghetti sticking out of the desert

943
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
 in the sand.

944
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,120
 Right.

945
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,760
 So when's it going from Libya to Senegal,

946
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,000
 they're putting bits of spaghetti in so they know how

947
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,880
 to get back to Libya?

948
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,400
 Yes.

949
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,120
 Well, exactly.

950
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,840
 How do they see it?

951
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,760
 I don't know.

952
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,600
 That's the worst color to put as a way marker on sand.

953
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,440
 It is.

954
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,200
 It is weird that they're confused me.

955
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,760
 I wanted to think maybe take lots together,

956
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,240
 so at least it sticks up like a pole,

957
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,520
 because spaghetti isn't that long.

958
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,840
 And that is very different in West Africa.

959
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,120
 But also, when they're going the other way,

960
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,040
 do they stick like cocaine in the world?

961
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,080
 [LAUGHTER]

962
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,400
 So in the 13th century, they had pasta guilds in Italy.

963
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,520
 And they were fighting over the right to make pasta

964
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,680
 and hope got involved.

965
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,480
 And the Pope was just trying to sort out tensions.

966
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,240
 And he made a decree in 1641 requiring

967
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,160
 that all pasta shops be at least 25 yards apart.

968
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
 [LAUGHTER]

969
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,160
 So if you see two pasta shops that are closer than that apart,

970
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,480
 then that's basically-- they're excommunicated, basically.

971
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
 Wow.

972
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,800
 Just to stop them fighting.

973
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,280
 Yeah?

974
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,840
 Do you know in Italy, and please shout,

975
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,560
 if you're Italian or you're fluent Italian,

976
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,520
 and this isn't true, I think it was in the New York Times,

977
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,480
 but in Italy, there's a specific word that

978
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
 refers to pasta without salt.

979
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,720
 And the word is shioka, or shioccha.

980
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,440
 And it also means silly.

981
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,960
 So that's the word of a silly, which

982
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,480
 is also a pasta without salt.

983
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,760
 That's a stupid idea.

984
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,760
 [LAUGHTER]

985
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,280
 And in the 19th century, they made pasta

986
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,840
 by getting huge troughs full of dough,

987
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,800
 and they would trample them like wine, like wine grapes.

988
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
 And that's how you made it.

989
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,600
 Really?

990
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,800
 And the King of Naples wanted to modernize

991
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,720
 and wanted to find a new way of doing it.

992
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,400
 And the only way he could find of doing it

993
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,880
 was a huge mechanical man with bronze feet.

994
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,640
 [LAUGHTER]

995
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,320
 Last year, officials in Sudan seized more than 70

996
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,560
 use with sexual organs sewn onto them.

997
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,280
 So?

998
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,800
 What?

999
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,600
 Sorry, can you?

1000
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,600
 So a U is a female sheep, and they

1001
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,560
 sewed on male sheep sexual organs onto the female sheep.

1002
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,320
 And that's because you have to pay a lot of tax--

1003
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,040
 You're sorry, you have to pay a lot of tax.

1004
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,800
 [LAUGHTER]

1005
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,880
 Seems up, sir.

1006
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,840
 [LAUGHTER]

1007
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,720
 One has to pay a lot of tax for female sheep,

1008
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,800
 because they're really good, and they

1009
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,720
 can make lots of baby sheep and stuff.

1010
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,320
 But actually, male sheep are not that important.

1011
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,520
 And so if you're sending male sheep across,

1012
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,040
 then you don't have to pay the tax.

1013
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,920
 And so the way they did it is got the female ones,

1014
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,360
 and just put little light sodson cock and balls on them.

1015
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,320
 [LAUGHTER]

1016
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,800
 And obviously it didn't work in the end,

1017
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,040
 because they got caught.

1018
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,080
 No, it didn't.

1019
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,960
 They got caught.

1020
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,920
 But we only know the time they got caught.

1021
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,480
 This might have been happening for centuries.

1022
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,680
 [LAUGHTER]

1023
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,040
 It was called owling, actually.

1024
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,240
 Wasn't it sheep smuggling?

1025
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,480
 That's a version of owling, which

1026
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,600
 was sort of the main version of smuggling

1027
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,360
 that existed in England, specifically,

1028
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,120
 from about the 1,300 until the 1,800s,

1029
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,640
 because they didn't want other countries

1030
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,200
 to be creating their own wool, I think.

1031
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,120
 And so a lot we smothered wool out of England.

1032
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,360
 And yeah, but confusingly called owling,

1033
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,140
 we don't know why, probably, to just

1034
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,880
 bewilder custom officials.

1035
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,800
 And weirdly, I found someone which combined smuggling

1036
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,160
 and pasta in another sense.

1037
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:27,660
 OK.

1038
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,920
 But it turns out to be a very disappointing story.

1039
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,240
 I'm afraid.

1040
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,400
 Basically, in 2012, there was smugglers

1041
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,200
 who tried to smuggle four million fake cigarettes

1042
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,600
 into the West Midlands.

1043
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,400
 And they did so by hiding them in a pasta consignment.

1044
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,000
 And I was really excited.

1045
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,380
 And then it turned out that they just

1046
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,760
 hid them behind Canaloni, actually.

1047
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
 But they just hid them behind boxes of Canaloni,

1048
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
 rather than what I assumed they had done, which

1049
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,920
 was put the fake cigarettes inside penny.

1050
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,360
 [LAUGHTER]

1051
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,520
 I was-- I kid you not.

1052
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,720
 I was so excited about it.

1053
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,680
 I'm really excited.

1054
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,560
 I'm glad you took us on your emotional journey there.

1055
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
 Thank you.

1056
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,680
 I wasn't strong enough fact without the emotional journey.

1057
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,520
 That's the problem.

1058
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,560
 No.

1059
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,800
 I was reading about a modern smuggler who I really like,

1060
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,520
 a guy called Robert Kusak, who's a Californian.

1061
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,400
 And he was flying home from Thailand.

1062
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,440
 He had been on holiday in Thailand.

1063
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
 And he was undergoing a routine inspection

1064
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,360
 at the airport when an exotic bird flew out of his bag,

1065
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,200
 which was awkward.

1066
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,680
 And so they searched his bags.

1067
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,960
 And they found three more exotic birds.

1068
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
 And they also found 50 orchids.

1069
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,000
 And then the security official said,

1070
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,200
 do you have any other contraband to declare?

1071
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,600
 And he immediately said, yes, I've got monkeys in my pants.

1072
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,880
 [LAUGHTER]

1073
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,120
 They pulled down his trousers.

1074
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,560
 And he did indeed have two pygmy monkeys down his pants.

1075
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,480
 I've got a modern smuggler as well called Jasmine Claire.

1076
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,640
 And she was caught off the back of a tip that

1077
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,920
 was given to the Homeland Security.

1078
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,280
 It was anonymously given saying that there

1079
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,480
 would be possible smuggling activity taking place

1080
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,480
 in the vicinity of a bed and breakfast

1081
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,280
 called the smugglers in.

1082
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,080
 So they took it as a real tip, as opposed to thinking

1083
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,040
 that was a bad joke.

1084
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,040
 And they set up a surveillance there.

1085
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,120
 And they eventually saw someone who

1086
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,160
 was doing the smuggling.

1087
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
 It was Jasmine Claire.

1088
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,680
 It turns out they were alerted to the fact

1089
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,200
 it might be her, because the car that

1090
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,200
 arrived had the vanity license plate smuggler--

1091
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
 [LAUGHTER]

1092
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,920
 --and it was her.

1093
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,640
 And she had blocks of cocaine.

1094
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,920
 Nine bricks of cocaine.

1095
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,720
 That's incredible.

1096
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:30,920
 Yeah.

1097
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,280
 Smugglers are in smuggler on the license plate.

1098
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,520
 It's the oldest double bluff I've ever heard.

1099
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,600
 Sorry, it didn't work.

1100
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,080
 So I became a bit obsessed with trying

1101
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,040
 to find out-- I think we're all familiar with the term

1102
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,320
 budgie smugglers.

1103
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,000
 Oh, yeah.

1104
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,520
 I'd get which other very tight swimsuits

1105
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,480
 worn in Australia, and elsewhere.

1106
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,760
 And I became obsessed with trying

1107
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,800
 to find out if anyone has ever actually smuggled a budgie.

1108
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,800
 And it was a very long search, and it's a hard search.

1109
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
 I tried typing in the Latin name of the species.

1110
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
 That didn't yield anything.

1111
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,760
 I did find a paper called "The Smuggled Budgie"

1112
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,560
 from 2010 for exciting etymology paper

1113
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,680
 about the origin of the word budgie, like that.

1114
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,280
 But--

1115
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,480
 That's emotional journey is amazing.

1116
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,040
 But I did find a guy in Cuba in 2014

1117
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,360
 who-- this was pants based, as well.

1118
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,720
 He was detained trying to board a flight to the USA

1119
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,720
 with 66 birds inside his trousers.

1120
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,440
 And he made it through the metal detector.

1121
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,000
 Obviously, birds are not made of metal.

1122
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,720
 [LAUGHTER]

1123
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,840
 So he's doing great.

1124
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,240
 But there were loads of bulges in his trousers,

1125
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,880
 and he was stopped in the airport.

1126
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,160
 And when the authorities at the airport stopped him,

1127
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,920
 he said, OK, you got me.

1128
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,360
 I am concealing a pigeon as a gift for my grandson

1129
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,360
 in my trousers.

1130
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,520
 I presume he thought they would say, OK, fine.

1131
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,280
 No questions asked.

1132
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,040
 Go on your way.

1133
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,000
 Police forced him to remove his trousers,

1134
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,360
 and they found dozens of finches and hummingbirds hidden

1135
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,600
 inside his trousers and his pants.

1136
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
 Yeah.

1137
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,680
 And sometimes when people smuggle rare birds,

1138
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,120
 they have to tape their beaks shut so they won't

1139
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,680
 sing like a canary.

1140
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,680
 But also, some people who smuggle them

1141
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,720
 have their beaks facing inwards on the crotch region.

1142
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,640
 Oh, it's just like a massive hostage of fortune.

1143
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,920
 Why would they do that?

1144
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,320
 I think it's just the very small--

1145
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,640
 and I think it's the best place to hide them.

1146
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,480
 Maybe it's pleasant, who knows.

1147
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,440
 But it'll be happening in Silicon Valley

1148
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,280
 with a fortnight of this podcast going out.

1149
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,640
 I read about that guy, and the article

1150
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,680
 specified that the two birds next to his genitals were dead.

1151
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,960
 I don't know, kind of weird toxicity was happening there,

1152
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,280
 but I killed two birds with one bone.

1153
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,880
 [LAUGHTER]

1154
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,120
 We're going to have to wrap up.

1155
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,680
 OK, that is it.

1156
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,360
 That is all of our facts.

1157
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,920
 Thank you so much for listening.

1158
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,800
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us

1159
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,440
 about the things that we have said over the course

1160
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,120
 of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

1161
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,280
 I'm on @Streiberland, Andy.

1162
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,320
 Andrew Hunter, Emma.

1163
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:00,820
 James.

1164
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,840
 That's James Harkin.

1165
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,600
 And Shazinski.

1166
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,760
 You can email Poghost@QI.com.

1167
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,360
 Yeah, or you can go to our group account @nosuchthing,

1168
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,640
 or a Facebook page.

1169
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,240
 No such thing as a fish, or no such thing as a fish.com.

1170
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:11,960
 It's our website.

1171
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,280
 We have everything up there from links to our tour dates.

1172
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,320
 We have our previous book that we released,

1173
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,120
 and we also have a link to our new tape that we've released.

1174
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,720
 And we're about to give a copy of it away right now

1175
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,920
 to one of the members of our audience here in Belfast.

1176
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,240
 Yeah.

1177
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,040
 So if the person who wins it, if you

1178
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,680
 can give us a shout when we say your fact,

1179
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,760
 and the winner is Anna.

1180
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,560
 So it's Natasha Riley.

1181
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,760
 Are you here?

1182
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,880
 Yeah, come get us at the end.

1183
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,560
 This is the fact.

1184
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,760
 When filming the battle scenes for Game of Thrones

1185
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,480
 filmed in Northern Ireland, of course,

1186
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,160
 the fighting was so intense that they

1187
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,360
 had to create a safe word in case someone got hurt.

1188
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,880
 So the safe word for Game of Thrones is banana.

1189
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,960
 [LAUGHTER]

1190
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,760
 That's awesome.

1191
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,280
 That's it.

1192
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,440
 That's all of our facts.

1193
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
 Thank you so much.

1194
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,440
 Good night.

1195
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,440
 [APPLAUSE]

1196
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,800
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

1197
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,800
 (audience cheering)
