00:00:02,00:00:05,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:05,00:00:08,(upbeat music)
00:00:08,00:00:15,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:15,00:00:18,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:18,00:00:22,this week coming to you live from Belfast!
00:00:22,00:00:25,(audience cheering)
00:00:25,00:00:29,My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here
00:00:29,00:00:31,"with Anichis Isinski, Andrew Hansen-Marie,"
00:00:31,00:00:33,"and James Harkin, and once again,"
00:00:33,00:00:35,we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:35,00:00:38,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:38,00:00:41,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:41,00:00:43,"Starting with you, James."
00:00:43,00:00:45,"- Okay, my fact this week is that there are a number"
00:00:45,00:00:50,of chickens in California that have their own personal chefs.
00:00:50,00:00:53,(audience laughing)
00:00:53,00:00:55,- I think you'd live in constant fear as a chicken
00:00:55,00:00:57,if you had your own chicken.
00:00:57,00:00:59,(audience laughing)
00:00:59,00:01:02,One day he's gonna run us to stuff in the pantry.
00:01:02,00:01:04,"- Oh, they can give me a lot of sage and onion recently."
00:01:04,00:01:06,(audience laughing)
00:01:06,00:01:08,"- Mr. Chicken, tonight for dinner, you."
00:01:08,00:01:09,(audience laughing)
00:01:09,00:01:11,"- Yeah, that's very exciting."
00:01:11,00:01:13,- So this is specifically in Silicon Valley
00:01:13,00:01:16,and at the moment there is a chicken mania happening
00:01:16,00:01:17,in Silicon Valley.
00:01:17,00:01:21,Single chicken can cost $350.
00:01:21,00:01:23,And normally they cost about $15.
00:01:23,00:01:26,Their coupes are controlled by smartphone apps
00:01:26,00:01:29,and basically it's kind of a state of symbol
00:01:29,00:01:32,in Silicon Valley to have your own chicken.
00:01:32,00:01:33,- Wow.
00:01:33,00:01:35,- Are they special chickens in any way?
00:01:35,00:01:38,"Are they amazing or amazing, the all-night chickens?"
00:01:38,00:01:41,"- Some of them are pretty good, actually, I have to say."
00:01:41,00:01:44,"I'm not sure I'd pay $350 for one, but they are pretty good."
00:01:44,00:01:48,So they're specially bred for desirable personality traits.
00:01:48,00:01:50,So the ones that are particularly.
00:01:50,00:01:51,(audience laughing)
00:01:51,00:01:54,- What is a personality trait in a chicken?
00:01:54,00:01:55,(audience laughing)
00:01:55,00:01:56,"- Well, you know."
00:01:56,00:01:57,- It's the ground.
00:01:57,00:01:59,(audience laughing)
00:01:59,00:02:01,"- So for instance, if they're gentle enough"
00:02:01,00:02:02,for a child to cuddle.
00:02:02,00:02:03,- Okay.
00:02:03,00:02:05,"- So rock 'n' like an angry chicken,"
00:02:05,00:02:07,you wouldn't want to put that near your child.
00:02:07,00:02:09,They don't have those.
00:02:09,00:02:10,"There are some that are rare,"
00:02:10,00:02:11,there are some that are beautiful
00:02:11,00:02:12,according to the article I read.
00:02:12,00:02:16,And some of them have special highly coveted colored eggs
00:02:16,00:02:18,and they're called Easter Eggers
00:02:18,00:02:20,and they give you blue eggs.
00:02:20,00:02:21,- Wow.
00:02:21,00:02:23,"- They're really, really good ones, those."
00:02:23,00:02:24,- That's very cool.
00:02:24,00:02:26,"- They also, I read a lot of people"
00:02:26,00:02:29,keep the chickens in their house like they're a cat or a dog
00:02:29,00:02:31,and they call them lap chickens
00:02:31,00:02:32,'cause they come and they sit on your lap
00:02:32,00:02:33,and you can just stroke them.
00:02:33,00:02:36,And the way that they make sure
00:02:36,00:02:38,that they don't defecate all over the house
00:02:38,00:02:39,is they put them in diapers.
00:02:39,00:02:43,So there's special chicken diapers that you can now buy.
00:02:43,00:02:46,And I went to a website that sells these chicken diapers
00:02:46,00:02:47,'cause I wanted to--
00:02:47,00:02:48,- I want you all wearing them tonight.
00:02:48,00:02:50,(audience laughing)
00:02:50,00:02:52,"- No, there's a few good websites that do it actually."
00:02:52,00:02:54,There's one called my pet chicken
00:02:54,00:02:56,and there's one called pampered poultry.
00:02:56,00:02:58,Pampered poultry is very nice.
00:02:58,00:03:00,So you can see that they're all nicely designed.
00:03:00,00:03:06,"They sit around the bum of the chicken, like a diaper."
00:03:06,00:03:07,"But they not only sell diapers,"
00:03:07,00:03:10,they also sell saddles on chickens.
00:03:10,00:03:14,And it's mainly for people to ride chickens.
00:03:14,00:03:15,"- No, yeah."
00:03:15,00:03:18,"That's what I thought, but it turns out what it is"
00:03:18,00:03:22,is that when a chicken is having sex
00:03:22,00:03:25,"from the behind, the male is really aggressive"
00:03:25,00:03:26,and packs away at their back.
00:03:26,00:03:29,So it's a sort of blanket that sits over the back
00:03:29,00:03:30,of the chicken so they don't lose all their feathers
00:03:30,00:03:32,when the male is just--
00:03:32,00:03:34,- So it's when they're being ridden in a way.
00:03:34,00:03:36,(audience laughing)
00:03:36,00:03:39,"- Very true, very true."
00:03:39,00:03:42,"They also, my pet chicken has a very exciting device."
00:03:42,00:03:44,"Basically, a lot of people have problems"
00:03:44,00:03:46,if they do have a chicken in their house
00:03:46,00:03:48,where it does cock-a-doodle-doo a lot.
00:03:48,00:03:51,"So they have on their site, they called cock-a-doodle-don't."
00:03:51,00:03:54,And cock-a-doodle-d don't is a new contraption
00:03:54,00:03:57,that goes around the neck that stops it
00:03:57,00:03:59,"from crowing, from roostering."
00:03:59,00:04:00,And--
00:04:00,00:04:01,- How does it stop it?
00:04:01,00:04:03,"- It, it, it, it, it goes around the throat."
00:04:03,00:04:04,- Please strangle the chicken.
00:04:04,00:04:07,"- Yeah, it, it, it's, it's a bit questionable."
00:04:07,00:04:08,I'm not sure my pet chicken.com is--
00:04:08,00:04:11,- Did you not just say this is a very cool contraption?
00:04:11,00:04:12,- Can we edit that bit out?
00:04:12,00:04:15,"'Cause that's staying in, isn't it?"
00:04:15,00:04:17,"And if you pay an extra amount of money,"
00:04:17,00:04:20,"$12 more, it only costs $18 for it to happen."
00:04:20,00:04:21,"They say it doesn't hurt the chicken,"
00:04:21,00:04:24,"but if you, uh, if the rooster, if you do it,"
00:04:24,00:04:28,"for $12 more, you can buy a bow tie that goes around."
00:04:28,00:04:29,"- Absolutely, bargain."
00:04:29,00:04:31,"- For just $30, you can choke the chicken"
00:04:31,00:04:34,in a classy bow tie fashion.
00:04:34,00:04:35,"Oh, nice."
00:04:35,00:04:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:38,00:04:43,- Nothing more classy than a dead chicken with a bow tie on.
00:04:43,00:04:46,"You do get some incredible looking kind of designer chickens now,"
00:04:46,00:04:47,though.
00:04:47,00:04:49,"Or, I mean, just Google some designer chickens."
00:04:49,00:04:50,They're stunning.
00:04:50,00:04:53,"But I think my favorite is the I Am Chicken, the--"
00:04:53,00:04:56,"is AYAM, and it's described by breeders"
00:04:56,00:04:58,as the Lamborghini of chickens.
00:04:58,00:05:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:00,00:05:02,And you can see why.
00:05:02,00:05:03,So you might have seen it.
00:05:03,00:05:06,"It's that chicken that's black, completely black from head to toe."
00:05:06,00:05:08,It looks like it's been dipped in oil.
00:05:08,00:05:12,"So it's big, it's crown, it's--"
00:05:12,00:05:14,"sorry, it's comb, it's legs, it's feet."
00:05:14,00:05:17,"And the weird thing is, like, it's eyes completely black."
00:05:17,00:05:19,"But the weird thing is, it's fully black on the inside as well,"
00:05:19,00:05:20,which I didn't realize.
00:05:20,00:05:24,"So all of its organs, all of the meat in it, all of its flesh,"
00:05:24,00:05:27,"all of its bones, everything is black."
00:05:27,00:05:28,"And so if you then eat this chicken,"
00:05:28,00:05:30,it's the meat itself is black.
00:05:30,00:05:32,The only thing about the chicken that's not black
00:05:32,00:05:34,is it lays white eggs.
00:05:34,00:05:36,And they're just-- they're incredible.
00:05:36,00:05:40,And there's this I Am Breeder in America who's got a site
00:05:40,00:05:41,where they sell them.
00:05:41,00:05:43,"And they say they're very, very good natured as well."
00:05:43,00:05:46,So I think a New York magazine wanted to meet one.
00:05:46,00:05:50,"And the review said, ""The rooster patiently allowed himself"
00:05:50,00:05:52,to be draped with million-dollar jewelry
00:05:52,00:05:55,"and trust with red ribbon, well-being photographed"
00:05:55,00:05:56,"under bright lights."""
00:05:56,00:05:58,"Which, again, it's an amazing looking chicken."
00:05:58,00:06:00,People are doing some weird shit with their chickens.
00:06:00,00:06:01,Yeah.
00:06:01,00:06:02,"Of course, your website's going to say,"
00:06:02,00:06:03,our chickens are extremely friendly.
00:06:03,00:06:05,"No website selling these chickens are going to say,"
00:06:05,00:06:07,"our chicken's a real bastard, it's actually--"
00:06:07,00:06:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:09,00:06:11,"So I was looking up chickens in Silicon Valley,"
00:06:11,00:06:13,because it's the massive trend at the moment.
00:06:13,00:06:14,There is a company at the moment
00:06:14,00:06:17,"is trying to disrupt eggs, OK?"
00:06:17,00:06:20,So they're trying to make-- there are food--
00:06:20,00:06:22,stuff stuff-- thing called just.
00:06:22,00:06:27,And they make eggless scrambled eggs out of mung beans.
00:06:27,00:06:29,"But the other thing they've started doing recently,"
00:06:29,00:06:31,"they've started making chicken nuggets from chickens,"
00:06:31,00:06:33,which are still alive.
00:06:33,00:06:34,What?
00:06:34,00:06:36,The others just like chickens with bits missing.
00:06:36,00:06:39,"Well, kind of."
00:06:39,00:06:43,So they took some cells from the inside of a chicken feather.
00:06:43,00:06:45,So they took one feather from a chicken called Ian
00:06:45,00:06:46,for the record.
00:06:46,00:06:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:47,00:06:53,I don't know.
00:06:53,00:06:57,"It's a perfectly spoiled land, normal land."
00:06:57,00:06:59,So they took some cells from the inside of the feather.
00:06:59,00:07:00,And then they cultivated them.
00:07:00,00:07:02,"And they fed those cells on plant proteins, right?"
00:07:02,00:07:05,And they turned those into a big mass of chicken meat.
00:07:05,00:07:06,They grew those into chicken muscle.
00:07:06,00:07:09,And then they had a barbecue where they served up chicken nuggets.
00:07:09,00:07:15,And Ian was present walking around on the table while he was
00:07:15,00:07:17,being eaten by these people.
00:07:17,00:07:19,"Presumably, surely he was there with a megaphone saying,"
00:07:19,00:07:21,this is an outrage.
00:07:21,00:07:24,"Yeah, it's very-- basically, people in Silicon Valley are mad."
00:07:24,00:07:25,That's all we need to know.
00:07:25,00:07:28,"Yeah, you can go on a tour of Silicon Valley"
00:07:28,00:07:31,"called Torda Coop, where you just see all of the chicken"
00:07:31,00:07:34,"coops that they have, because they're unbelievably expensive."
00:07:34,00:07:37,"Some of them can cost up to like $20,000."
00:07:37,00:07:40,"And one owner, at least, plans to transform"
00:07:40,00:07:43,his coop into an Airbnb for humans.
00:07:43,00:07:46,"Once his chickens die, that's how on later it is."
00:07:46,00:07:48,I don't-- and my parents had chickens.
00:07:48,00:07:50,There's no way I'd want to sleep in the same place
00:07:50,00:07:52,that those chickens are sleeping.
00:07:52,00:07:53,That's disgusting.
00:07:53,00:07:55,Would you share the coop with them?
00:07:55,00:07:55,Or do they vacate--
00:07:55,00:07:56,I don't know.
00:07:56,00:07:59,I guess they vacate and leave you a croissant and stuff
00:07:59,00:08:01,"when you stay there, presumably."
00:08:01,00:08:02,They're basically dead.
00:08:02,00:08:04,And they've been eaten.
00:08:04,00:08:06,"They're long gone, and they probably clean it."
00:08:06,00:08:07,"And, you know."
00:08:07,00:08:09,"Oh, that's actually not how Airbnb works at all."
00:08:09,00:08:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:12,00:08:18,Thank you.
00:08:18,00:08:23,"Yeah, some other weird stuff that people in Silicon Valley are doing."
00:08:23,00:08:26,So there's been a lot lately about what
00:08:26,00:08:29,"people in Silicon Valley call biohacking, which"
00:08:29,00:08:31,"I just find a really amusing word, because what it means"
00:08:31,00:08:33,is stupid diets.
00:08:33,00:08:36,"But they call it biohacking, because it sounds really smart."
00:08:36,00:08:38,But all the CEOs of all the big companies are into this.
00:08:38,00:08:40,And weird kind of diets.
00:08:40,00:08:45,"So there's Jeffrey Wu, who's CEO of a biohacking company."
00:08:45,00:08:49,And he got all his staff to do a full-on seven-day fast.
00:08:49,00:08:51,And they all had to wear glucose monitors
00:08:51,00:08:53,that are designed for diabetics.
00:08:53,00:08:56,And it inserts pinpricks into your skin.
00:08:56,00:08:59,"And it measures your blood-elevated ketones, which"
00:08:59,00:09:02,is a way of checking how much fat you're using and stuff.
00:09:02,00:09:03,So he makes all his staff go--
00:09:03,00:09:06,staff themselves for seven days-- to make sure they're burning
00:09:06,00:09:09,enough fat and it elevates your mental acuity and things
00:09:09,00:09:10,like that.
00:09:10,00:09:14,"But they're all kind of going on silly teenage girl diets,"
00:09:14,00:09:16,"getting his biohacking, and so it's OK."
00:09:16,00:09:19,"I read about Jeffrey Wu, because he started this thing."
00:09:19,00:09:22,"There's a drug that people in Silicon Valley take, which"
00:09:22,00:09:25,is the idea is it's a cognitive enhancing drug.
00:09:25,00:09:26,"And so it's a brain drug, effectively,"
00:09:26,00:09:29,"and it's called new tropics, which is an old idea."
00:09:29,00:09:32,That was back in 1972 that that term was coined.
00:09:32,00:09:33,"But the idea is you take it, and it makes"
00:09:33,00:09:35,your brain get stimulated.
00:09:35,00:09:39,So he runs a company where he provides these drugs.
00:09:39,00:09:42,Everyone's on these brain stimulant drugs in Silicon Valley
00:09:42,00:09:43,if they're working with Jeffrey.
00:09:43,00:09:44,But I don't know.
00:09:44,00:09:47,"If it's making you want to pay $350 for a chicken,"
00:09:47,00:09:50,I'm not sure how smart they're making you.
00:09:50,00:09:54,"Actually, the chicken's control the company that makes the drug."
00:09:54,00:09:55,"Have you met our CEO, Ian?"
00:10:00,00:10:05,"I read about a hobby, because the hobbies that people have"
00:10:05,00:10:09,"in Silicon Valley, and people do various weird sports and stuff,"
00:10:09,00:10:10,because there's a lot of mountainous terrain.
00:10:10,00:10:13,Have you heard of ride and tie?
00:10:13,00:10:14,This is so cool.
00:10:14,00:10:18,So it's a mountain race involving two people on one horse.
00:10:18,00:10:21,"So-- but the rule is, only one person"
00:10:21,00:10:24,can be touching the horse at any given moment.
00:10:24,00:10:27,"So you get on the horse, and you ride for a couple of miles,"
00:10:27,00:10:30,"and your friend runs, and then you tie the horse up"
00:10:30,00:10:32,"for a couple of miles, and then you start running,"
00:10:32,00:10:34,"and your friend catches up to the horse, gets on it,"
00:10:34,00:10:36,"rides it, overtakes you, and then--"
00:10:36,00:10:38,And you have to get off after two miles.
00:10:38,00:10:40,You can't just go on the horse for the whole length of the horse.
00:10:40,00:10:43,"Oh, that's a much better idea, actually."
00:10:43,00:10:45,"Yeah, again, see, they're reinventing the wheel,"
00:10:45,00:10:47,just going for a ride on a horse.
00:10:47,00:10:49,That's pretty cool.
00:10:49,00:10:49,I think it does sound kind of fun.
00:10:49,00:10:50,It sounds quite intense.
00:10:50,00:10:52,"Yeah, really fun."
00:10:52,00:10:55,Why wouldn't you just go on the horse alongside the person who's running?
00:10:55,00:10:57,Horses can run faster than people can run.
00:10:57,00:10:59,"No, I know, but--"
00:10:59,00:11:01,"Same as-- I mean, that's why those guys"
00:11:01,00:11:03,who do the grand national.
00:11:03,00:11:04,Yeah.
00:11:04,00:11:07,"But no humans have won that, have they?"
00:11:07,00:11:10,They've never even qualified for it.
00:11:10,00:11:12,"But actually, there is a horse versus human race, isn't there?"
00:11:12,00:11:15,I think it's in Wales every year or something.
00:11:15,00:11:16,Yeah.
00:11:16,00:11:17,"And sometimes the humans do win, but it's"
00:11:17,00:11:22,"on a really twisty cost with like, you know, stairs and lifts."
00:11:22,00:11:24,Things that horses can't do.
00:11:24,00:11:27,"And on drugs, actually, all Silicon Valley CEOs"
00:11:27,00:11:29,are also doing LSD at the moment.
00:11:29,00:11:30,"And again, the--"
00:11:30,00:11:33,"For legal reasons, I think not all."
00:11:33,00:11:34,"Sorry, yes, definitely not all."
00:11:34,00:11:38,"Yeah, but bloody most right."
00:11:38,00:11:40,But it's micro-dosing.
00:11:40,00:11:42,So they take a tenth the amount of LSD
00:11:42,00:11:44,"that you'd usually, not you, but that one might usually"
00:11:44,00:11:48,take to get a proper hallucination.
00:11:48,00:11:50,"And apparently, the effect this has"
00:11:50,00:11:52,is that it increases alertness and energy and stuff.
00:11:52,00:11:54,"And it's another way of them, I guess,"
00:11:54,00:11:56,"kind of biohacking themselves, taking a bit of hallucinogenic"
00:11:56,00:11:58,to make themselves more switched on.
00:11:58,00:11:59,So the other thing that's been in the news
00:11:59,00:12:01,is like raw water.
00:12:01,00:12:02,Have you seen all this?
00:12:02,00:12:03,Yeah.
00:12:03,00:12:05,"So basically, people are drinking water that's"
00:12:05,00:12:08,"come direct from source and hasn't been decontaminated,"
00:12:08,00:12:12,"which is really, really a terrible idea."
00:12:12,00:12:14,There was an expert who said almost everything
00:12:14,00:12:19,conceivable that can make you sick can be found in water.
00:12:19,00:12:21,So a lot of it contains animal feces.
00:12:21,00:12:23,There are terrible diseases.
00:12:23,00:12:25,You can get hepatitis A. You can get color.
00:12:25,00:12:26,You can get eat coli.
00:12:26,00:12:28,"And this expert, they asked him about it."
00:12:28,00:12:30,"And he said, you can't stop consenting adults"
00:12:30,00:12:32,from being stupid.
00:12:32,00:12:34,But we should at least try.
00:12:34,00:12:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:36,00:12:37,That's amazing.
00:12:37,00:12:38,We're going to have to-- sorry.
00:12:38,00:12:40,We're going to have to move on to our next vaccine.
00:12:40,00:12:42,I was just going to say that I was reading a quote
00:12:42,00:12:44,"from Mukande Singh, who's a founder of Live Water, which"
00:12:44,00:12:47,is one of the big water startups.
00:12:47,00:12:49,And so they don't trust all the chemicals that go
00:12:49,00:12:51,in the water that we drink.
00:12:51,00:12:53,"And he said, so we have things like chloramine"
00:12:53,00:12:56,and fluoride in our water.
00:12:56,00:12:57,Call me a conspiracy theorist.
00:12:57,00:12:59,But it's a mind-controlled drug that
00:12:59,00:13:01,has no benefit to our dental health.
00:13:01,00:13:02,I'll go there.
00:13:02,00:13:03,He's a fucking conspiracy theorist.
00:13:03,00:13:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:06,00:13:08,Just one more thing.
00:13:08,00:13:11,Apple have built a new campus in California this year.
00:13:11,00:13:13,It's made completely out of glass.
00:13:13,00:13:17,And the idea is to encourage an open working environment.
00:13:17,00:13:18,"And on the very first day, seven people"
00:13:18,00:13:21,were taken to hospital through walking into the hospital.
00:13:21,00:13:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:25,00:13:26,It's so good.
00:13:26,00:13:34,"OK, it is time to move on to fact number two."
00:13:34,00:13:36,And that is Andy.
00:13:36,00:13:39,"My fact is that the Victorian cat burglar, Charles Peace,"
00:13:39,00:13:42,could supposedly disguise himself just by changing
00:13:42,00:13:44,the shape of his face.
00:13:44,00:13:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:47,00:13:49,So he was a real guy.
00:13:49,00:13:50,"And before we go any further, he was a really unpleasant guy."
00:13:50,00:13:54,He was a burglar and he was a murderer as well.
00:13:54,00:13:54,But he killed two people.
00:13:54,00:13:57,"For a while, he was the nation's most wanted man."
00:13:57,00:13:59,"But he had this incredible gift, supposedly,"
00:13:59,00:14:02,for just moving his face into a slightly different shape.
00:14:02,00:14:04,"And he would think, where did he go?"
00:14:04,00:14:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:06,00:14:08,I just can't see how that worked.
00:14:08,00:14:10,I can't imagine how that would work.
00:14:10,00:14:11,I know.
00:14:11,00:14:13,"Neither can I, but supposedly he was very rubbery face."
00:14:13,00:14:15,"I suppose like Mr. Bean kind of thing,"
00:14:15,00:14:16,like Rowan Atkinson maybe.
00:14:16,00:14:17,"Yeah, exactly."
00:14:17,00:14:20,"Well, Jim Kerry, when he was in the movie The Mask,"
00:14:20,00:14:22,"the people who were doing the CGI,"
00:14:22,00:14:25,"said they had to spend way less than they anticipated,"
00:14:25,00:14:28,because his face was so elastic that he was able to contort it.
00:14:28,00:14:30,And it looked like CGI had been done already.
00:14:30,00:14:31,"Oh, all right."
00:14:31,00:14:31,"Yeah, there we go."
00:14:31,00:14:33,But it's not like it doesn't look like that.
00:14:33,00:14:34,It's not like Rowan Atkinson and Jim Kerry
00:14:34,00:14:37,can avoid all publicity and attention
00:14:37,00:14:39,by just contorting their face quickly.
00:14:39,00:14:40,Rowan Atkinson could be in the front row.
00:14:40,00:14:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:43,00:14:46,"So this guy, Charles Peace, he was an extremely interesting man"
00:14:46,00:14:46,in lots of ways.
00:14:46,00:14:47,So he--
00:14:47,00:14:49,"He was really famous at the time, wasn't he?"
00:14:49,00:14:50,"He was very, very notorious."
00:14:50,00:14:54,"And he had a missing finger, which you would think"
00:14:54,00:14:56,would have identified him.
00:14:56,00:15:00,"But he cleverly got around this by using an entire prosthetic arm,"
00:15:00,00:15:02,which apparently is less inconspicuous.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"Yeah, the guy with three arms."
00:15:04,00:15:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:07,00:15:09,"He's got the right number of fingers,"
00:15:09,00:15:12,but he's not one extra arm.
00:15:12,00:15:14,"He was executed, wasn't he?"
00:15:14,00:15:15,He was.
00:15:15,00:15:18,And he told the clergyman who interviewed him in prison
00:15:18,00:15:19,just before his execution.
00:15:19,00:15:21,"He said that he hoped that after he was gone,"
00:15:21,00:15:23,he would be entirely forgotten by everybody.
00:15:23,00:15:25,And his name never mentioned again.
00:15:25,00:15:26,Yeah.
00:15:26,00:15:27,"Sorry, ma'am."
00:15:27,00:15:29,"But also, within hours of his death,"
00:15:29,00:15:32,the first ballad of Charles Peace was on sale.
00:15:32,00:15:33,Was it?
00:15:33,00:15:33,Yeah.
00:15:33,00:15:37,And the biography was ready for publication even before he was dead.
00:15:37,00:15:38,So that's how famous he was.
00:15:38,00:15:38,Wow.
00:15:38,00:15:42,"And also, his executioner was very famous as well."
00:15:42,00:15:43,It was a guy called Marwood.
00:15:43,00:15:46,So he was executed by probably Britain's most famous
00:15:46,00:15:47,at the time executioner.
00:15:47,00:15:50,"People would go, he was a celebrity of execution."
00:15:50,00:15:52,And to the point where he had a popular rhyme
00:15:52,00:15:53,"that people used to sing about him, which was,"
00:15:53,00:15:57,"if part killed Mar, who had killed part, Marwood,"
00:15:57,00:15:57,that was the--
00:15:57,00:15:58,"Oh, that's great."
00:15:58,00:15:59,That's really clever.
00:15:59,00:16:00,"Yeah, yeah."
00:16:00,00:16:01,Cyclover.
00:16:01,00:16:02,"I read, I mean, it's a bit gruesome,"
00:16:02,00:16:04,"but in the British newspaper archive,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,I actually read one of the articles from the time
00:16:06,00:16:07,about when he was executed.
00:16:07,00:16:11,"And it's darkly amusing because he does what any of us would do,"
00:16:11,00:16:13,"which is like, he keeps trying to put it off."
00:16:13,00:16:15,"So he'd like to say, and he said his prayers,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,and thanks for everyone who was ready to go.
00:16:17,00:16:19,"And then he went, actually, I'm really thirsty."
00:16:19,00:16:20,Can I get a drink of water please?
00:16:20,00:16:22,"And they were like, no, I don't think so."
00:16:22,00:16:23,"And they said, hold on, I've got one more thing to say."
00:16:23,00:16:25,And this article goes on and on.
00:16:25,00:16:26,"He keeps on going, wait, wait."
00:16:26,00:16:29,I've just got one more quick thing before we--
00:16:29,00:16:30,can I?
00:16:30,00:16:34,And the person who he killed was a policeman called PCCock.
00:16:34,00:16:38,"And what was interesting is, because he did kill this guy."
00:16:38,00:16:40,He was basically caught doing a burglary
00:16:40,00:16:42,and he killed the policeman.
00:16:42,00:16:44,"But luckily for him, the police simply picked up"
00:16:44,00:16:46,the nearest Irishman they could find.
00:16:46,00:16:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:49,00:16:51,"They charged this Irishman with murder,"
00:16:51,00:16:53,and then apparently Charlie attended the trial dressed
00:16:53,00:16:55,as a vicar and made--
00:16:55,00:16:56,Of course he did.
00:16:56,00:16:58,--with his three arms.
00:16:58,00:17:01,He played all 12 members of the jury at various points.
00:17:01,00:17:03,And then there's 20 money.
00:17:03,00:17:06,And he made loud remarks from the public gallery
00:17:06,00:17:09,to the effect that the evidence was merely circumstantial.
00:17:09,00:17:11,"So he was, you know, he was the guy who did it."
00:17:11,00:17:12,"And he was like, this guy's not guilty, man."
00:17:12,00:17:13,This guy's a guilty--
00:17:13,00:17:16,"willing to say it was me, I did it."
00:17:16,00:17:17,"No, you're right."
00:17:17,00:17:19,"He's halfway there, conscience-wise, I think."
00:17:19,00:17:20,Yeah.
00:17:20,00:17:21,Yeah.
00:17:21,00:17:23,He admitted to it in the end when he
00:17:23,00:17:25,was found guilty of the other murder.
00:17:25,00:17:27,He admitted to the early one.
00:17:27,00:17:29,"Yeah, that's what I read in the article that I read"
00:17:29,00:17:34,"is that he did admit by doing that, that it was him."
00:17:34,00:17:37,"I read this, by the way, on a website called"
00:17:37,00:17:40,executedtoday.com.
00:17:40,00:17:43,"Every new day, a new execution to read up on about."
00:17:43,00:17:45,"If you're looking for a cheery read,"
00:17:45,00:17:48,executedtoday.com.
00:17:48,00:17:49,He did once have a really good comedy moment
00:17:49,00:17:52,where he was in prison loads of times.
00:17:52,00:17:54,I don't know how he had time to do any burglaries.
00:17:54,00:17:56,"And one time, he was put in a train"
00:17:56,00:17:57,and was being taken to a prison.
00:17:57,00:18:00,And he was coming out of works up on his way to this prison.
00:18:00,00:18:02,And he jumped off the train to escape.
00:18:02,00:18:04,And a warden on the train grabbed hold of his leg
00:18:04,00:18:05,as he jumped off.
00:18:05,00:18:08,"And apparently, he bounced along on his head"
00:18:08,00:18:10,with the warden clinging to his ankle.
00:18:10,00:18:15,A few hundreds of feet until eventually he wriggled out
00:18:15,00:18:17,of his grip and then the train stopped
00:18:17,00:18:20,and they turned back and picked him up again.
00:18:20,00:18:23,Should have worn a third leg.
00:18:23,00:18:25,"Speaking of him and legs, his father"
00:18:25,00:18:26,was a one-legged lion tamer.
00:18:26,00:18:28,Yes.
00:18:28,00:18:31,"I was quite a family, is what they're saying."
00:18:31,00:18:33,"What's amazing, as well, there is no more detail"
00:18:33,00:18:36,about his dad under that one sentence.
00:18:36,00:18:38,"His life, that's all that exists now, that's all we know."
00:18:38,00:18:40,"We can guess how he lost the leg, I think."
00:18:40,00:18:46,"But he was very bad, two-legged lion tamer, wasn't it?"
00:18:46,00:18:48,"If we're being stichless for facts, he started as a collier"
00:18:48,00:18:50,and lost his leg when he was doing mining.
00:18:50,00:18:52,"And then became a lion tamer, as he would."
00:18:52,00:18:54,"So when you said there was no other information online,"
00:18:54,00:18:56,it was just--
00:18:56,00:19:00,"Well, it wasn't all executed today, don't come yet."
00:19:00,00:19:02,"He became a shoemaker after being a lion tamer,"
00:19:02,00:19:03,which I really loved that.
00:19:03,00:19:05,"OK, there's a lot of stuff on the online."
00:19:05,00:19:06,I got it.
00:19:06,00:19:08,So was he a one-legged shoemaker?
00:19:08,00:19:13,"He's a one-legged shoemaker, everything half-price."
00:19:13,00:19:16,So he was apparently irresistible to women
00:19:16,00:19:19,with his three arms and--
00:19:19,00:19:22,Take your hand off me and that one.
00:19:22,00:19:24,And that one.
00:19:24,00:19:27,"But I suppose if you can change your face all the time,"
00:19:27,00:19:31,"then you can-- if you don't like this one, I've got others."
00:19:31,00:19:32,I've just done my last boyfriend.
00:19:32,00:19:33,He had three arms.
00:19:33,00:19:37,Maybe the new one's got three arms.
00:19:37,00:19:39,So he got married.
00:19:39,00:19:41,And then he moved to London.
00:19:41,00:19:43,And he got married again.
00:19:43,00:19:45,"But he lived with his previous wife as well,"
00:19:45,00:19:47,who he called his mother.
00:19:47,00:19:49,And it seems that the second wife didn't know
00:19:49,00:19:52,that who he called his mother was actually his first wife.
00:19:52,00:19:54,"Oh, wow."
00:19:54,00:19:57,"Oh, for a Victorian Jeremy Kyle show."
00:19:57,00:20:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:00,00:20:02,"That's a-- well, he's a Jeremiah Kyle."
00:20:02,00:20:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:05,00:20:07,He's incredible.
00:20:07,00:20:08,That's true?
00:20:08,00:20:11,"Well, I mean, we should say actually at this point,"
00:20:11,00:20:12,because I said it's true.
00:20:12,00:20:14,"A lot of it is clouded in meth, isn't it?"
00:20:14,00:20:16,Because he was so famous.
00:20:16,00:20:19,And he was famous as like a Robin Hood kind of character.
00:20:19,00:20:21,So there were lots of stories about him.
00:20:21,00:20:24,"But according to people at the time, this is what happened."
00:20:24,00:20:28,He lived with his wife and his mother in Peckham.
00:20:28,00:20:30,And they used to have parties attended
00:20:30,00:20:34,"by all the rich people in Peckham, which they were at the time."
00:20:34,00:20:41,And they're all now since Del Boy won the lottery.
00:20:41,00:20:42,And then what would happen is Charlie
00:20:42,00:20:45,would get called out on some urgent business
00:20:45,00:20:46,during the party.
00:20:46,00:20:47,They would carry on the party.
00:20:47,00:20:48,"And then when all the guests got home,"
00:20:48,00:20:50,they all found they'd been burgled.
00:20:50,00:20:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:53,00:20:56,"Well, so just on disguises--"
00:20:56,00:21:00,because this guy was disguising himself a lot--
00:21:00,00:21:02,I tried to look up other people who had great disguises.
00:21:02,00:21:04,"So there was a guy, a bank robber called Willie Sutton."
00:21:04,00:21:06,And he was very crafty.
00:21:06,00:21:09,Because he was known in life as Slick Willie.
00:21:09,00:21:12,"And he-- night, come on now."
00:21:12,00:21:18,"He, in 1947, he escaped the Philadelphia County Prison,"
00:21:18,00:21:19,where he was being held.
00:21:19,00:21:21,And he escaped dressed as a prison guard.
00:21:21,00:21:24,And he was so crafty that the search light on the prison wall
00:21:24,00:21:24,found him.
00:21:24,00:21:25,But he was dressed as a prison guard.
00:21:25,00:21:27,"And he just shouted, it's OK."
00:21:27,00:21:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:28,00:21:31,And they kept going.
00:21:31,00:21:34,"That's so good, so good."
00:21:34,00:21:37,"I was-- yeah, so I was looking at some other good disguises,"
00:21:37,00:21:38,more modern burglars of tried.
00:21:38,00:21:41,Did you guys read about the guy I think last year
00:21:41,00:21:45,who dressed as a tree to rob a bank?
00:21:45,00:21:46,So--
00:21:46,00:21:46,Which one?
00:21:46,00:21:47,What's it?
00:21:47,00:21:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:49,00:21:57,So this is a new Hampshire.
00:21:57,00:22:00,And this is a guy who walks straight into a bank.
00:22:00,00:22:02,"And he just-- there's pictures of him, there's CCTV."
00:22:02,00:22:06,He had kind of leaves duct tape to his kind of face
00:22:06,00:22:08,and bits of his body.
00:22:08,00:22:08,He did.
00:22:08,00:22:10,He looked almost nothing like a tree.
00:22:10,00:22:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:12,00:22:14,"But he walked in and he said, give me all your money,"
00:22:14,00:22:14,and they gave him money.
00:22:14,00:22:17,"But then on CCTV, someone immediately recognized him."
00:22:17,00:22:18,Because he'd only covered about a quarter of his face
00:22:18,00:22:21,"with bits of twig and said that's not the ball,"
00:22:21,00:22:22,but whatever it was.
00:22:22,00:22:23,And he was cool.
00:22:23,00:22:24,"When it be grape, there was a police line up"
00:22:24,00:22:25,of genuine trees and just--
00:22:25,00:22:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:28,00:22:31,Do you know who you can tell an officer from MI5?
00:22:31,00:22:32,"Their spies, are they?"
00:22:32,00:22:33,They are spies.
00:22:33,00:22:35,So you wouldn't be able to tell them.
00:22:35,00:22:39,But there's a good chance that they will be dressed as a beggar.
00:22:39,00:22:41,Because this is a very good way of keeping surveillance
00:22:41,00:22:42,on a building.
00:22:42,00:22:45,Because a lot of people ignore the beggars or the homeless
00:22:45,00:22:47,or end and walk on by.
00:22:47,00:22:50,"And one guy from MI5 said that for operations,"
00:22:50,00:22:53,he would use my own clothes soaked in my own urine
00:22:53,00:22:55,to complement that cover.
00:22:55,00:22:57,So it is proper deep cover.
00:22:57,00:22:58,Wow.
00:22:58,00:23:00,I didn't see that James Bond film.
00:23:00,00:23:03,"Ah, Bond, we've got you these."
00:23:03,00:23:05,They're your trousers covered in gold.
00:23:05,00:23:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:09,00:23:11,"Just on spies, did you guys see the news today"
00:23:11,00:23:12,"that, you know, how every country at the moment"
00:23:12,00:23:15,"is sort of sending their Russian spies out,"
00:23:15,00:23:17,so Britain sent the Russian spies out?
00:23:17,00:23:19,New Zealand said that they would do the same.
00:23:19,00:23:23,"And then added, actually, we can't find any."
00:23:23,00:23:25,That could be that they're just really good stars.
00:23:25,00:23:26,"That's a thing, yeah."
00:23:26,00:23:28,"There are some weird new trees outside the last night,"
00:23:28,00:23:31,"see, but a lot of people come there in their own past."
00:23:31,00:23:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:34,00:23:36,Do you know the CIA has a chief of disguise?
00:23:36,00:23:38,So this is a real post in the CIA.
00:23:38,00:23:41,And there is someone who's just retired as the chief of disguise.
00:23:41,00:23:44,She's called Jonna Mendes.
00:23:44,00:23:46,And she said this in an interview.
00:23:46,00:23:48,I can't tell if she's joking or not.
00:23:48,00:23:49,I think she's being serious.
00:23:49,00:23:51,"She said that one message, the CIA--"
00:23:51,00:23:52,one-- sorry.
00:23:52,00:23:54,She said that one method the CIA might use
00:23:54,00:23:58,"to send a message to someone would be to shave a pet,"
00:23:58,00:24:00,"tattoo a message onto it, and then"
00:24:00,00:24:04,pass the animal on once the hair has grown back on the animal.
00:24:04,00:24:07,"Yeah, that's a historical thing, I think."
00:24:07,00:24:11,"Well, I've heard it with ancient creeps shaving the head"
00:24:11,00:24:11,of the slave.
00:24:11,00:24:15,But I'm very much like I do shaving a hamster and writing.
00:24:15,00:24:17,I think you go for a snake.
00:24:17,00:24:18,You can't shave a snake.
00:24:18,00:24:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:24,00:24:26,"Imagine if you wrote on, let's say, I don't know--"
00:24:26,00:24:28,"It's going to be something big, which I don't know."
00:24:28,00:24:30,"But yeah, if you got to the end of a dog,"
00:24:30,00:24:33,"and then you ran out of words, so you had to append a hamster"
00:24:33,00:24:34,to the dog.
00:24:34,00:24:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:36,00:24:40,"It's not the immediate messaging service of texting, is it?"
00:24:40,00:24:40,It's not.
00:24:40,00:24:42,"If it's we compromise, burn everything"
00:24:42,00:24:45,and get out of the country.
00:24:45,00:24:48,"OK, it's time to move on to our third fact."
00:24:48,00:24:49,And that is my fact.
00:24:49,00:24:52,"My fact this week is that if the British treated their monarchy,"
00:24:52,00:24:55,"the way that the ancient Egyptians did,"
00:24:55,00:24:57,"Queen Elizabeth, the second, would"
00:24:57,00:24:59,have to run around a racetrack every three years
00:24:59,00:25:01,to prove she was still fit for the job.
00:25:01,00:25:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:03,00:25:06,"So the idea of this is that in ancient Egypt,"
00:25:06,00:25:07,it said that what they used to have
00:25:07,00:25:09,was a festival called Hebset.
00:25:09,00:25:13,"And after a pharaoh had reached 30 years in ruling power,"
00:25:13,00:25:15,that were they still fit to run it.
00:25:15,00:25:16,That was a big question.
00:25:16,00:25:18,"And in order to prove that they were still fit,"
00:25:18,00:25:20,they would have to run around the complex of where
00:25:20,00:25:21,they were living.
00:25:21,00:25:22,And usually it was a racetrack.
00:25:22,00:25:24,And they would do it with a sort of animal tail
00:25:24,00:25:26,that was hanging behind them.
00:25:26,00:25:28,And everyone came to watch it.
00:25:28,00:25:30,And the first time you did it was after 30 years.
00:25:30,00:25:32,But then it was every subsequent three years
00:25:32,00:25:35,because they thought you might lose it in those three years' time.
00:25:35,00:25:38,"So if Queen Elizabeth the second had to do it,"
00:25:38,00:25:40,she would have done it 13 times by now.
00:25:40,00:25:43,"And we don't actually know why they did it, do we?"
00:25:43,00:25:43,No.
00:25:43,00:25:44,We're not quite sure.
00:25:44,00:25:46,There's a few different theories.
00:25:46,00:25:47,One theory that I quite like is that there
00:25:47,00:25:50,was an original thing they did where once you're
00:25:50,00:25:53,"in office for 30 years, you would just get killed."
00:25:53,00:25:54,"And then some smart pharaoh went, well,"
00:25:54,00:25:58,what if I do the running thing instead?
00:25:58,00:25:59,Or maybe they were trying to kill him
00:25:59,00:26:01,"and he was running away, yes, like that."
00:26:01,00:26:03,"But some people think that, other people,"
00:26:03,00:26:06,it's just like it proves that you're fit enough to do that.
00:26:06,00:26:09,I read it was a thing as well where it was sort of--
00:26:09,00:26:10,it was directly related to the afterlife.
00:26:10,00:26:12,"And by doing it, you were building up,"
00:26:12,00:26:13,"as it were, bonus points."
00:26:13,00:26:15,"I don't know what for, but--"
00:26:15,00:26:17,"you know, like how Mario collects coins."
00:26:17,00:26:21,And it was just-- and it would do something for your next life.
00:26:21,00:26:23,"I didn't see that theory, OK."
00:26:23,00:26:24,I love the ideas.
00:26:24,00:26:25,They were outrunning gold age.
00:26:25,00:26:27,That was all outrunning death.
00:26:27,00:26:28,That was another theory.
00:26:28,00:26:29,But you did?
00:26:29,00:26:31,They did really have to collect all the right stuff
00:26:31,00:26:32,"for the afterlife, didn't they?"
00:26:32,00:26:33,Egyptian pharaohs.
00:26:33,00:26:35,They're burying them with such a hassle.
00:26:35,00:26:38,It was like going on a holiday for the rest of your life.
00:26:38,00:26:40,So you have to pack everything you possibly needed.
00:26:40,00:26:45,So all ancient Egyptian royals were buried with many breweries
00:26:45,00:26:48,"so that they had all the alcohol they would need for the afterlife,"
00:26:48,00:26:49,which is quite good.
00:26:49,00:26:51,So it's like a really good source of how
00:26:51,00:26:53,we know how they brewed beer and stuff in ancient Egypt.
00:26:53,00:26:55,It's because if you look at all the tombs of people
00:26:55,00:26:58,"from 3,000 years ago, they all had a little brewery in them."
00:26:58,00:26:59,They all had micro-breweries.
00:26:59,00:27:03,They all had a micro-brewery bunch of hipsters.
00:27:03,00:27:06,With the beer and little beers.
00:27:06,00:27:07,And I've reached that before that.
00:27:07,00:27:09,They used to have slaves specifically
00:27:09,00:27:12,"to keep their wine cool, to fan their wine,"
00:27:12,00:27:13,which I don't know how well it works.
00:27:13,00:27:16,"But they just go around with the fan, fanning the wine."
00:27:16,00:27:18,"Well, there was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh"
00:27:18,00:27:20,called Pepe the Second.
00:27:20,00:27:23,And he used to have a thing where there
00:27:23,00:27:25,was so many flies that would hit you in ancient Egypt.
00:27:25,00:27:29,And it said that what he did was to make sure no flies ever landed on him.
00:27:29,00:27:31,He always took with him a servant or a slave
00:27:31,00:27:37,"who was coated completely in honey, so that any fly would immediately sit on that."
00:27:37,00:27:40,I learned that from horrible histories.
00:27:40,00:27:41,"It's good, sir."
00:27:41,00:27:41,"Yeah, good."
00:27:41,00:27:44,"Pepe the Second, he was, he reigned for 90 years,"
00:27:44,00:27:48,so it seems like he did this running thing 20 times.
00:27:48,00:27:49,He reigned for 90?
00:27:49,00:27:50,"90 years, yeah."
00:27:50,00:27:54,"Yeah, they can't decide because it comes from one source."
00:27:54,00:27:56,They think it might be that he reigned for about 64 years.
00:27:56,00:27:59,"On the Beards thing, they would always, they would shave."
00:27:59,00:28:03,"And then they would wear a false beard, which is supposed,"
00:28:03,00:28:04,"I think it was an imitation of the gods,"
00:28:04,00:28:07,because I think they said that Osiris the God had a beard just like this.
00:28:07,00:28:10,"And so if you shave and you put it on a false beard, just like this."
00:28:10,00:28:12,"So there was a female pharaoh, wasn't there?"
00:28:12,00:28:13,And she always wore a fake beard.
00:28:13,00:28:14,Exactly.
00:28:14,00:28:15,Or something.
00:28:15,00:28:16,Yeah.
00:28:16,00:28:19,"So the queen, if she was ancient, Egyptian would have to wear a fake beard as well."
00:28:19,00:28:20,Yeah.
00:28:20,00:28:26,"And on a hatch episode, there has just been a new image of her discovered."
00:28:26,00:28:28,"This is very exciting, brand new archaeological discovery."
00:28:28,00:28:32,And a new image of her has been found in Swansea.
00:28:32,00:28:32,Really?
00:28:32,00:28:33,"Yeah, really."
00:28:33,00:28:37,It's been in storage for 40 years at Swansea University's Egypt Center.
00:28:37,00:28:39,And they were just having a standard teaching session
00:28:39,00:28:40,going through a few of the images.
00:28:40,00:28:42,"And one of the professors, his name is Ken Griffin."
00:28:42,00:28:44,He was examining it.
00:28:44,00:28:46,"And he thought, that's a hatch episode."
00:28:46,00:28:50,"And it's very hard, because they're all wearing a beard and normal male clothes"
00:28:50,00:28:51,in these depictions.
00:28:51,00:28:52,So it's very hard to spot her.
00:28:52,00:28:53,What was she doing in Swansea?
00:28:53,00:28:55,Was that where she summit?
00:28:55,00:28:55,Or--
00:28:55,00:28:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:57,00:28:58,Weird.
00:28:58,00:28:58,I don't know.
00:28:58,00:29:03,We should say that a lot of the information that we have about ancient Egypt
00:29:03,00:29:05,comes from Greek sources.
00:29:05,00:29:06,So a lot of it comes from Herodotus.
00:29:06,00:29:09,"And he was a good historian, a lot of ways."
00:29:09,00:29:11,But then was sometimes a bit fanciful.
00:29:11,00:29:14,"But I really like this, which I think is Herodotus, about--"
00:29:14,00:29:16,"I'd never read this before, about the Persian king,"
00:29:16,00:29:19,"Kambeisis, who defeated Egyptian pharaoh"
00:29:19,00:29:22,called Samatek III.
00:29:22,00:29:24,"And he defeated him using his knowledge of Egyptian culture,"
00:29:24,00:29:28,"specifically the fact that Egyptians worship cats, which is quite well known."
00:29:28,00:29:31,So what he did was he was attacking the Egyptians.
00:29:31,00:29:32,And he had this big army.
00:29:32,00:29:36,"But then rather than actually attack their army with his army,"
00:29:36,00:29:38,he took a bunch of cats hostage.
00:29:38,00:29:42,And then he released them onto the battlefield as his front line.
00:29:42,00:29:45,"And actually, he had sort of backing them up a bunch of dogs, sheep,"
00:29:45,00:29:49,"ibises, and whatever other animals the Egyptians hold dear."
00:29:49,00:29:50,And the Egyptians just surrendered.
00:29:50,00:29:53,"They said, well, we can't kill any of those."
00:29:53,00:29:54,Because they're precious to us.
00:29:54,00:29:55,And they gave it.
00:29:55,00:29:56,How many cats was it?
00:29:56,00:29:57,"It was quite a lot, right?"
00:29:57,00:29:58,I think it was many.
00:29:58,00:29:59,Because that is quite--
00:29:59,00:30:03,"I mean, looking after cats like that and keeping them all in one place"
00:30:03,00:30:06,"and making them stand in a row, I think he deserves it."
00:30:06,00:30:07,I reckon that's why they ran away.
00:30:07,00:30:11,And I like this guy as a cat whisperer.
00:30:11,00:30:13,I read a thing if we're talking about pharaohs
00:30:13,00:30:15,and the weird things that they got up to.
00:30:15,00:30:17,There was one guy called pharaohs.
00:30:17,00:30:18,And he--
00:30:18,00:30:19,He gets a pharaoh called pharaohs.
00:30:19,00:30:22,"Yeah, I think so."
00:30:22,00:30:23,"Yeah, so the gnar was flooding."
00:30:23,00:30:25,And he got very angry about that.
00:30:25,00:30:27,"So he went down to it, and he threw a spirit at it"
00:30:27,00:30:31,"as if to say, get down and thought he could puncture it, maybe."
00:30:31,00:30:32,And the gods were furious that he did that.
00:30:32,00:30:34,So they blinded him.
00:30:34,00:30:36,"And as a result, he couldn't see."
00:30:36,00:30:38,"Obviously he was blind, but he really wanted to."
00:30:38,00:30:40,"So he spoke to, I believe it was an oracle,"
00:30:40,00:30:42,"and said, I want my sight back."
00:30:42,00:30:44,"And she said, what you have to do is you"
00:30:44,00:30:46,have to wash your eyes with the urine of a woman
00:30:46,00:30:49,who has never slept with anyone but her husband.
00:30:49,00:30:51,"So he thought, that's easy."
00:30:51,00:30:52,I'll just use my wives.
00:30:52,00:30:54,She's--
00:30:54,00:30:55,So it didn't work.
00:30:55,00:30:57,Yeah.
00:30:57,00:30:58,She got another lot of trouble.
00:30:58,00:31:01,"I mean, that's just not going to work anyway, though,"
00:31:01,00:31:01,is it?
00:31:01,00:31:04,There is no medical way that washing your blind eye
00:31:04,00:31:05,in urine is ever going to work.
00:31:05,00:31:07,"And he said that, but he got every woman in town to come."
00:31:07,00:31:08,And he sampled there--
00:31:08,00:31:10,"Oh, he put it there."
00:31:10,00:31:13,"He sampled their urine, and one eventually worked."
00:31:13,00:31:14,And he got his sight back.
00:31:14,00:31:15,So egg on your face.
00:31:15,00:31:18,Urine on your face.
00:31:18,00:31:20,"It's like the original Cinderella, really, isn't it?"
00:31:20,00:31:23,"It's pretty sharp, isn't it?"
00:31:23,00:31:27,"Touring the land, wind my eye, wind my eye."
00:31:27,00:31:28,"No, it's not this one."
00:31:28,00:31:29,James Bond turns up.
00:31:29,00:31:32,I think I can help with this.
00:31:32,00:31:35,"Oh, we're going to have to move on shortly to the next act."
00:31:35,00:31:38,I just have a fact about running that I've
00:31:38,00:31:39,wanted to say for a while.
00:31:39,00:31:42,"And that is that in ancient times, in ancient Egypt,"
00:31:42,00:31:45,they didn't know what you're splendid.
00:31:45,00:31:47,And so they would often remove it in long distance runners
00:31:47,00:31:50,to make them run faster.
00:31:50,00:31:51,"Well, this is amazing."
00:31:51,00:31:52,This is genuinely true.
00:31:52,00:31:54,"They basically, it was like a big organ"
00:31:54,00:31:56,"than they thought, if they got rid of it,"
00:31:56,00:31:57,maybe they'll just be a bit lighter
00:31:57,00:31:58,and you'd be able to run faster.
00:31:58,00:32:01,Because they didn't know what it did.
00:32:01,00:32:02,Does it-- does it work?
00:32:02,00:32:04,"Well, no."
00:32:04,00:32:05,Let's give it a go.
00:32:05,00:32:07,Is Paula Radcliffe missing a trick here?
00:32:07,00:32:09,So here is the amazing thing.
00:32:09,00:32:13,"In 1922, some scientists at Johns Hopkins University"
00:32:13,00:32:17,"removed the spleen from mice, and they ran faster."
00:32:17,00:32:18,OK.
00:32:18,00:32:21,And no one quite knows what causes a stitch.
00:32:21,00:32:26,But one theory is that it's too much blood going to your spleen.
00:32:26,00:32:29,"But apparently, it's possible that by removing a spleen,"
00:32:29,00:32:30,you might not have a stitch as much.
00:32:30,00:32:33,"Of course, you would-- everything that the spleen does,"
00:32:33,00:32:35,you'd be in trouble for.
00:32:35,00:32:36,"I think-- I mean, I don't know if this is"
00:32:36,00:32:38,"how you feel on the other side of me,"
00:32:38,00:32:39,"but I feel like we're all looking at you,"
00:32:39,00:32:42,"partly thinking, what a stupid idea, and partly thinking,"
00:32:42,00:32:45,but what exactly does the spleen do?
00:32:45,00:32:46,Yeah.
00:32:46,00:32:48,I think we're going to need to check the British cycling
00:32:48,00:32:51,team for spleens at the end of the next season.
00:32:51,00:32:52,But what does it explain yourself?
00:32:52,00:32:54,What does it do?
00:32:54,00:32:57,I think it's part of your immune system or something.
00:32:57,00:32:59,Some of them-- some of them will probably
00:32:59,00:33:02,50 people will come up and tell us after.
00:33:02,00:33:03,And then lots of people will tweet me.
00:33:03,00:33:05,But I think it's something to do with your immune system.
00:33:05,00:33:06,OK.
00:33:06,00:33:08,Can I tell you one quick thing about an Egyptian ferry
00:33:08,00:33:09,that I like?
00:33:09,00:33:10,Yeah.
00:33:10,00:33:13,"The ferry is Sassostris, who, whenever"
00:33:13,00:33:16,"Sassostris conquered a city or conquered an army,"
00:33:16,00:33:18,"if it had been a particularly easy conquest,"
00:33:18,00:33:21,then the first thing he would do was he'd
00:33:21,00:33:22,go up to all their pillars and he'd
00:33:22,00:33:25,draw a female genitalia all over them
00:33:25,00:33:28,"to imply that they were a bunch of cowards, which I know"
00:33:28,00:33:30,"is very anti-feminist, but it is also quite funny."
00:33:30,00:33:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:35,00:33:36,Wow.
00:33:36,00:33:37,OK.
00:33:37,00:33:39,It is time for a final fact of the show.
00:33:39,00:33:42,And that is Chazinsky.
00:33:42,00:33:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:33:42,00:33:45,My fact this week is that people who smuggle drugs one way
00:33:45,00:33:50,across a Sahara desert often smuggle pasta the other way.
00:33:50,00:33:54,And this is pasta smuggling.
00:33:54,00:33:55,It's a big deal.
00:33:55,00:33:56,I read this in the economist.
00:33:56,00:33:59,And so they did a little investigation.
00:33:59,00:34:02,"And it turns out that, if you're trafficking drugs,"
00:34:02,00:34:04,you have these big drugs that take them to a way
00:34:04,00:34:05,you need to drop off the drugs.
00:34:05,00:34:06,And then you've got empty trucks.
00:34:06,00:34:08,So you might as well fill them with something.
00:34:08,00:34:10,And so they stuffed pasta in them.
00:34:10,00:34:13,And the drugs go north over the Sahara.
00:34:13,00:34:16,And then they fill them up with pasta in countries
00:34:16,00:34:18,"like Libya or Algeria, because they have subsidized pasta"
00:34:18,00:34:19,prices.
00:34:19,00:34:21,So it means that pasta is much cheaper there.
00:34:21,00:34:23,So they shove their trucks full of tagliatelle
00:34:23,00:34:25,and then they drive them back down through the Sahara
00:34:25,00:34:30,"and deliver them in places like more southern places,"
00:34:30,00:34:34,"like the Ivory Coast, Storquac and Salmaco and Marley as well."
00:34:34,00:34:35,Yeah.
00:34:35,00:34:37,And the economist spoke to an expert who
00:34:37,00:34:42,"reckons that, by weight, pasta is the main product"
00:34:42,00:34:44,by weight that smuggled across the Sahara.
00:34:44,00:34:47,"Wow, just because you can make a profit on the other side."
00:34:47,00:34:48,"Yeah, exactly."
00:34:48,00:34:49,"You might as well, right, because you've got it."
00:34:49,00:34:51,But still driving a truck full of pasta by yourself
00:34:51,00:34:53,across the Sahara desert.
00:34:53,00:34:56,There must be a cannoli life.
00:34:56,00:34:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:57,00:35:06,"Mixed, mixed reaction."
00:35:06,00:35:09,Did you say how they weight marks on the way back?
00:35:09,00:35:13,"No, they put-- they stick spaghetti sticking out of the desert"
00:35:13,00:35:14,in the sand.
00:35:14,00:35:15,Right.
00:35:15,00:35:17,"So when's it going from Libya to Senegal,"
00:35:17,00:35:20,they're putting bits of spaghetti in so they know how
00:35:20,00:35:20,to get back to Libya?
00:35:20,00:35:21,Yes.
00:35:21,00:35:22,"Well, exactly."
00:35:22,00:35:23,How do they see it?
00:35:23,00:35:24,I don't know.
00:35:24,00:35:28,That's the worst color to put as a way marker on sand.
00:35:28,00:35:29,It is.
00:35:29,00:35:31,It is weird that they're confused me.
00:35:31,00:35:32,"I wanted to think maybe take lots together,"
00:35:32,00:35:34,"so at least it sticks up like a pole,"
00:35:34,00:35:35,because spaghetti isn't that long.
00:35:35,00:35:37,And that is very different in West Africa.
00:35:37,00:35:39,"But also, when they're going the other way,"
00:35:39,00:35:42,do they stick like cocaine in the world?
00:35:42,00:35:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:43,00:35:46,"So in the 13th century, they had pasta guilds in Italy."
00:35:46,00:35:48,And they were fighting over the right to make pasta
00:35:48,00:35:50,and hope got involved.
00:35:50,00:35:53,And the Pope was just trying to sort out tensions.
00:35:53,00:35:57,And he made a decree in 1641 requiring
00:35:57,00:36:01,that all pasta shops be at least 25 yards apart.
00:36:01,00:36:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:02,00:36:05,"So if you see two pasta shops that are closer than that apart,"
00:36:05,00:36:07,"then that's basically-- they're excommunicated, basically."
00:36:07,00:36:08,Wow.
00:36:08,00:36:09,Just to stop them fighting.
00:36:09,00:36:10,Yeah?
00:36:10,00:36:12,"Do you know in Italy, and please shout,"
00:36:12,00:36:14,"if you're Italian or you're fluent Italian,"
00:36:14,00:36:16,"and this isn't true, I think it was in the New York Times,"
00:36:16,00:36:18,"but in Italy, there's a specific word that"
00:36:18,00:36:20,refers to pasta without salt.
00:36:20,00:36:23,"And the word is shioka, or shioccha."
00:36:23,00:36:26,And it also means silly.
00:36:26,00:36:27,"So that's the word of a silly, which"
00:36:27,00:36:29,is also a pasta without salt.
00:36:29,00:36:31,That's a stupid idea.
00:36:31,00:36:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:32,00:36:35,"And in the 19th century, they made pasta"
00:36:35,00:36:37,"by getting huge troughs full of dough,"
00:36:37,00:36:41,"and they would trample them like wine, like wine grapes."
00:36:41,00:36:42,And that's how you made it.
00:36:42,00:36:43,Really?
00:36:43,00:36:45,And the King of Naples wanted to modernize
00:36:45,00:36:47,and wanted to find a new way of doing it.
00:36:47,00:36:49,And the only way he could find of doing it
00:36:49,00:36:51,was a huge mechanical man with bronze feet.
00:36:51,00:36:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:55,00:36:58,"Last year, officials in Sudan seized more than 70"
00:36:58,00:37:02,use with sexual organs sewn onto them.
00:37:02,00:37:03,So?
00:37:03,00:37:03,What?
00:37:03,00:37:04,"Sorry, can you?"
00:37:04,00:37:08,"So a U is a female sheep, and they"
00:37:08,00:37:13,sewed on male sheep sexual organs onto the female sheep.
00:37:13,00:37:16,And that's because you have to pay a lot of tax--
00:37:16,00:37:18,"You're sorry, you have to pay a lot of tax."
00:37:18,00:37:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:19,00:37:20,"Seems up, sir."
00:37:20,00:37:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:22,00:37:25,"One has to pay a lot of tax for female sheep,"
00:37:25,00:37:27,"because they're really good, and they"
00:37:27,00:37:29,can make lots of baby sheep and stuff.
00:37:29,00:37:32,"But actually, male sheep are not that important."
00:37:32,00:37:34,"And so if you're sending male sheep across,"
00:37:34,00:37:36,then you don't have to pay the tax.
00:37:36,00:37:37,"And so the way they did it is got the female ones,"
00:37:37,00:37:40,and just put little light sodson cock and balls on them.
00:37:40,00:37:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:43,00:37:44,"And obviously it didn't work in the end,"
00:37:44,00:37:46,because they got caught.
00:37:46,00:37:47,"No, it didn't."
00:37:47,00:37:47,They got caught.
00:37:47,00:37:49,But we only know the time they got caught.
00:37:49,00:37:51,This might have been happening for centuries.
00:37:51,00:37:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:53,00:37:55,"It was called owling, actually."
00:37:55,00:37:56,Wasn't it sheep smuggling?
00:37:56,00:37:58,"That's a version of owling, which"
00:37:58,00:38:00,was sort of the main version of smuggling
00:38:00,00:38:03,"that existed in England, specifically,"
00:38:03,00:38:06,"from about the 1,300 until the 1,800s,"
00:38:06,00:38:08,because they didn't want other countries
00:38:08,00:38:11,"to be creating their own wool, I think."
00:38:11,00:38:14,And so a lot we smothered wool out of England.
00:38:14,00:38:16,"And yeah, but confusingly called owling,"
00:38:16,00:38:19,"we don't know why, probably, to just"
00:38:19,00:38:21,bewilder custom officials.
00:38:21,00:38:25,"And weirdly, I found someone which combined smuggling"
00:38:25,00:38:27,and pasta in another sense.
00:38:27,00:38:27,OK.
00:38:27,00:38:29,But it turns out to be a very disappointing story.
00:38:29,00:38:30,I'm afraid.
00:38:30,00:38:32,"Basically, in 2012, there was smugglers"
00:38:32,00:38:35,who tried to smuggle four million fake cigarettes
00:38:35,00:38:36,into the West Midlands.
00:38:36,00:38:39,And they did so by hiding them in a pasta consignment.
00:38:39,00:38:41,And I was really excited.
00:38:41,00:38:42,And then it turned out that they just
00:38:42,00:38:45,"hid them behind Canaloni, actually."
00:38:45,00:38:47,"But they just hid them behind boxes of Canaloni,"
00:38:47,00:38:49,"rather than what I assumed they had done, which"
00:38:49,00:38:53,was put the fake cigarettes inside penny.
00:38:53,00:38:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:56,00:38:57,I was-- I kid you not.
00:38:57,00:38:58,I was so excited about it.
00:38:58,00:39:01,I'm really excited.
00:39:01,00:39:03,I'm glad you took us on your emotional journey there.
00:39:03,00:39:04,Thank you.
00:39:04,00:39:06,I wasn't strong enough fact without the emotional journey.
00:39:06,00:39:07,That's the problem.
00:39:07,00:39:08,No.
00:39:08,00:39:10,"I was reading about a modern smuggler who I really like,"
00:39:10,00:39:13,"a guy called Robert Kusak, who's a Californian."
00:39:13,00:39:16,And he was flying home from Thailand.
00:39:16,00:39:17,He had been on holiday in Thailand.
00:39:17,00:39:19,And he was undergoing a routine inspection
00:39:19,00:39:23,"at the airport when an exotic bird flew out of his bag,"
00:39:23,00:39:24,which was awkward.
00:39:24,00:39:25,And so they searched his bags.
00:39:25,00:39:27,And they found three more exotic birds.
00:39:27,00:39:29,And they also found 50 orchids.
00:39:29,00:39:32,"And then the security official said,"
00:39:32,00:39:34,do you have any other contraband to declare?
00:39:34,00:39:36,"And he immediately said, yes, I've got monkeys in my pants."
00:39:36,00:39:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:38,00:39:40,They pulled down his trousers.
00:39:40,00:39:44,And he did indeed have two pygmy monkeys down his pants.
00:39:44,00:39:48,I've got a modern smuggler as well called Jasmine Claire.
00:39:48,00:39:51,And she was caught off the back of a tip that
00:39:51,00:39:53,was given to the Homeland Security.
00:39:53,00:39:56,It was anonymously given saying that there
00:39:56,00:39:59,would be possible smuggling activity taking place
00:39:59,00:40:01,in the vicinity of a bed and breakfast
00:40:01,00:40:05,called the smugglers in.
00:40:05,00:40:09,"So they took it as a real tip, as opposed to thinking"
00:40:09,00:40:10,that was a bad joke.
00:40:10,00:40:12,And they set up a surveillance there.
00:40:12,00:40:14,And they eventually saw someone who
00:40:14,00:40:16,was doing the smuggling.
00:40:16,00:40:17,It was Jasmine Claire.
00:40:17,00:40:19,It turns out they were alerted to the fact
00:40:19,00:40:21,"it might be her, because the car that"
00:40:21,00:40:24,arrived had the vanity license plate smuggler--
00:40:24,00:40:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:26,00:40:26,--and it was her.
00:40:26,00:40:28,And she had blocks of cocaine.
00:40:28,00:40:29,Nine bricks of cocaine.
00:40:29,00:40:30,That's incredible.
00:40:30,00:40:30,Yeah.
00:40:30,00:40:33,Smugglers are in smuggler on the license plate.
00:40:33,00:40:35,It's the oldest double bluff I've ever heard.
00:40:35,00:40:36,"Sorry, it didn't work."
00:40:36,00:40:38,So I became a bit obsessed with trying
00:40:38,00:40:40,to find out-- I think we're all familiar with the term
00:40:40,00:40:41,budgie smugglers.
00:40:41,00:40:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:40:42,00:40:44,I'd get which other very tight swimsuits
00:40:44,00:40:47,"worn in Australia, and elsewhere."
00:40:47,00:40:48,And I became obsessed with trying
00:40:48,00:40:51,to find out if anyone has ever actually smuggled a budgie.
00:40:51,00:40:56,"And it was a very long search, and it's a hard search."
00:40:56,00:40:58,I tried typing in the Latin name of the species.
00:40:58,00:40:59,That didn't yield anything.
00:40:59,00:41:01,"I did find a paper called ""The Smuggled Budgie"""
00:41:01,00:41:04,from 2010 for exciting etymology paper
00:41:04,00:41:07,"about the origin of the word budgie, like that."
00:41:07,00:41:08,But--
00:41:08,00:41:11,That's emotional journey is amazing.
00:41:11,00:41:14,But I did find a guy in Cuba in 2014
00:41:14,00:41:16,"who-- this was pants based, as well."
00:41:16,00:41:18,He was detained trying to board a flight to the USA
00:41:18,00:41:22,with 66 birds inside his trousers.
00:41:22,00:41:24,And he made it through the metal detector.
00:41:24,00:41:26,"Obviously, birds are not made of metal."
00:41:26,00:41:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:28,00:41:30,So he's doing great.
00:41:30,00:41:33,"But there were loads of bulges in his trousers,"
00:41:33,00:41:34,and he was stopped in the airport.
00:41:34,00:41:38,"And when the authorities at the airport stopped him,"
00:41:38,00:41:39,"he said, OK, you got me."
00:41:39,00:41:43,I am concealing a pigeon as a gift for my grandson
00:41:43,00:41:44,in my trousers.
00:41:44,00:41:46,"I presume he thought they would say, OK, fine."
00:41:46,00:41:47,No questions asked.
00:41:47,00:41:49,Go on your way.
00:41:49,00:41:51,"Police forced him to remove his trousers,"
00:41:51,00:41:54,and they found dozens of finches and hummingbirds hidden
00:41:54,00:41:56,inside his trousers and his pants.
00:41:56,00:41:57,Yeah.
00:41:57,00:41:59,"And sometimes when people smuggle rare birds,"
00:41:59,00:42:02,they have to tape their beaks shut so they won't
00:42:02,00:42:04,sing like a canary.
00:42:04,00:42:06,"But also, some people who smuggle them"
00:42:06,00:42:09,have their beaks facing inwards on the crotch region.
00:42:09,00:42:11,"Oh, it's just like a massive hostage of fortune."
00:42:11,00:42:12,Why would they do that?
00:42:12,00:42:15,I think it's just the very small--
00:42:15,00:42:17,and I think it's the best place to hide them.
00:42:17,00:42:20,"Maybe it's pleasant, who knows."
00:42:20,00:42:22,But it'll be happening in Silicon Valley
00:42:22,00:42:25,with a fortnight of this podcast going out.
00:42:25,00:42:26,"I read about that guy, and the article"
00:42:26,00:42:31,specified that the two birds next to his genitals were dead.
00:42:31,00:42:34,"I don't know, kind of weird toxicity was happening there,"
00:42:34,00:42:38,but I killed two birds with one bone.
00:42:38,00:42:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:42:41,00:42:46,We're going to have to wrap up.
00:42:46,00:42:47,"OK, that is it."
00:42:47,00:42:49,That is all of our facts.
00:42:49,00:42:50,Thank you so much for listening.
00:42:50,00:42:52,If you would like to get in contact with any of us
00:42:52,00:42:54,about the things that we have said over the course
00:42:54,00:42:57,"of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts."
00:42:57,00:42:59,"I'm on @Streiberland, Andy."
00:42:59,00:43:00,"Andrew Hunter, Emma."
00:43:00,00:43:00,James.
00:43:00,00:43:01,That's James Harkin.
00:43:01,00:43:02,And Shazinski.
00:43:02,00:43:04,You can email Poghost@QI.com.
00:43:04,00:43:07,"Yeah, or you can go to our group account @nosuchthing,"
00:43:07,00:43:08,or a Facebook page.
00:43:08,00:43:11,"No such thing as a fish, or no such thing as a fish.com."
00:43:11,00:43:11,It's our website.
00:43:11,00:43:15,We have everything up there from links to our tour dates.
00:43:15,00:43:17,"We have our previous book that we released,"
00:43:17,00:43:21,and we also have a link to our new tape that we've released.
00:43:21,00:43:23,And we're about to give a copy of it away right now
00:43:23,00:43:26,to one of the members of our audience here in Belfast.
00:43:26,00:43:28,Yeah.
00:43:28,00:43:30,"So if the person who wins it, if you"
00:43:30,00:43:31,"can give us a shout when we say your fact,"
00:43:31,00:43:32,and the winner is Anna.
00:43:32,00:43:34,So it's Natasha Riley.
00:43:34,00:43:36,Are you here?
00:43:36,00:43:37,"Yeah, come get us at the end."
00:43:37,00:43:38,This is the fact.
00:43:38,00:43:40,When filming the battle scenes for Game of Thrones
00:43:40,00:43:42,"filmed in Northern Ireland, of course,"
00:43:42,00:43:44,the fighting was so intense that they
00:43:44,00:43:47,had to create a safe word in case someone got hurt.
00:43:47,00:43:50,So the safe word for Game of Thrones is banana.
00:43:50,00:43:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:43:53,00:43:55,That's awesome.
00:43:55,00:43:56,That's it.
00:43:56,00:43:57,That's all of our facts.
00:43:57,00:43:58,Thank you so much.
00:43:58,00:43:59,Good night.
00:43:59,00:44:02,[APPLAUSE]
