00:00:02,00:00:06,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:06,00:00:09,(upbeat music)
00:00:09,00:00:15,(audience cheering)
00:00:15,00:00:18,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:18,00:00:22,"of No Such Day As A Fish, a weekly podcast."
00:00:22,00:00:25,"This week, ""Conte Drive"" from Burma!"
00:00:25,00:00:28,(audience cheering)
00:00:29,00:00:31,(upbeat music)
00:00:31,00:00:34,"My name is Dan Schriver, I am sitting here"
00:00:34,00:00:36,"with Anna Tyshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:36,00:00:38,"and James Harkin, and once again,"
00:00:38,00:00:41,we have gathered 'round the microphones this time
00:00:41,00:00:43,"for our Christmas special, yeah!"
00:00:43,00:00:46,(audience cheering)
00:00:46,00:00:48,"And once again, we have gathered 'round"
00:00:48,00:00:50,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:50,00:00:54,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:54,00:00:57,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:57,00:01:00,"Okay, my fact this week is that the song,"
00:01:00,00:01:03,"when the red, red robin goes bobb, bobb, bobbin along,"
00:01:03,00:01:06,is actually about a thrush.
00:01:06,00:01:08,(audience laughing)
00:01:08,00:01:10,- But thrush didn't rhyme with bobbin?
00:01:10,00:01:12,(laughing)
00:01:12,00:01:13,"- It could be rushing along, couldn't he?"
00:01:13,00:01:15,- Should have been rushing along.
00:01:15,00:01:17,"- It is an American song, the red, red robin"
00:01:17,00:01:19,"goes bobb, bobb, bobbin along, I don't know"
00:01:19,00:01:20,"if you guys know it, when the red, red robin"
00:01:20,00:01:23,"goes bobb, bobb, bobbin along."
00:01:23,00:01:25,"It was written about the American robin,"
00:01:25,00:01:29,whose Latin name is Turdus migratorius.
00:01:29,00:01:30,(audience laughing)
00:01:30,00:01:33,"And as every childish person knows,"
00:01:33,00:01:36,the Latin word Turdus means thrush.
00:01:36,00:01:38,"And it's called a robin, that bird,"
00:01:38,00:01:41,"because when the early migrants got to America,"
00:01:41,00:01:43,it has a red breast and it reminded them
00:01:43,00:01:45,of the European robin.
00:01:45,00:01:45,- Right.
00:01:45,00:01:47,"- And so a lot of American songs,"
00:01:47,00:01:49,"like rockin' robin, for instance, is the same."
00:01:49,00:01:52,All these songs are actually about thrushes.
00:01:52,00:01:55,- So technically it should also be Batman and thrush.
00:01:55,00:01:58,(audience laughing)
00:01:58,00:02:01,Well that's another story of Batman's medical problems.
00:02:01,00:02:04,"- That is actually true, 'cause Robin was,"
00:02:04,00:02:08,"in some versions of the early Batman and Robin comics,"
00:02:08,00:02:10,he is named Robin 'cause he was born
00:02:10,00:02:11,on the first day of spring.
00:02:11,00:02:14,And the American Robin is associated with spring.
00:02:14,00:02:16,"So these songs, the red, red robin,"
00:02:16,00:02:18,"these are springtime songs, they're not Christmas songs."
00:02:18,00:02:20,"- Yeah, okay, cool, wow."
00:02:20,00:02:22,"- It's better looking than our thrush, isn't it?"
00:02:22,00:02:25,"I mean, the red breast does make a big difference."
00:02:25,00:02:26,"- Yeah, it's a nice bird, nice looking bird."
00:02:26,00:02:28,"It's like, it looks like, you know,"
00:02:28,00:02:31,"if you think about your classic European robin,"
00:02:31,00:02:34,it's quite fat and round and it's got a red breast.
00:02:34,00:02:36,"The American one is a bit more proud looking,"
00:02:36,00:02:38,"it's a bit bigger, it's got a slightly longer neck,"
00:02:38,00:02:40,but it still has the red color.
00:02:40,00:02:42,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:02:42,00:02:44,"And it's the most abundant bird in North America, apparently."
00:02:44,00:02:45,- Is it?
00:02:45,00:02:46,"- Yeah, it's all over the bloody place."
00:02:46,00:02:49,Although they're not shyer than our robins.
00:02:49,00:02:51,"The robin that we know is the European robin,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,"but in Britain, it's way more cocky and confident"
00:02:53,00:02:55,than all over the rest of Europe.
00:02:55,00:02:56,- Really?
00:02:56,00:02:57,"- Yeah, and this is just because"
00:02:57,00:02:59,we actually like robins so much.
00:02:59,00:03:02,"So in Europe, it's much more common to hunt robins"
00:03:02,00:03:04,"and, or has been historically,"
00:03:04,00:03:06,and they're not kind of treasured as much
00:03:06,00:03:07,as this kind of Christmas symbol.
00:03:07,00:03:09,So they're way shyer.
00:03:09,00:03:10,"And similarly in America, these guys,"
00:03:10,00:03:12,"they hide in the woods, whereas our robins,"
00:03:12,00:03:13,"you know, they chase you around the garden"
00:03:13,00:03:14,when you're digging out worms.
00:03:14,00:03:15,"- Yeah, of course, yeah."
00:03:15,00:03:17,Do you know why they do that?
00:03:17,00:03:18,- To get the worms you're digging out?
00:03:18,00:03:20,"- Well, yes, but it's because, basically,"
00:03:20,00:03:21,they think you're a pig.
00:03:21,00:03:22,So...
00:03:22,00:03:23,- What?
00:03:23,00:03:24,- So what?
00:03:24,00:03:25,- Joanna said all that nice stuff about robins.
00:03:25,00:03:27,"- Well, it's not reciprocated."
00:03:27,00:03:31,Robins basically evolve to follow wild boar
00:03:31,00:03:33,around forests.
00:03:33,00:03:34,- What do they do?
00:03:34,00:03:35,"- They truffle up food, don't they?"
00:03:35,00:03:37,"They dig for their food,"
00:03:37,00:03:38,and they will overturn a lot of earth
00:03:38,00:03:39,and they'll reveal lots of earthworms.
00:03:39,00:03:42,"So, you know, it thinks you're a pig and a boar."
00:03:42,00:03:43,Yeah.
00:03:43,00:03:44,(audience laughing)
00:03:44,00:03:46,"- I've got to say, who have offended?"
00:03:46,00:03:47,- Is it really bad at telling the difference
00:03:47,00:03:49,"between species, then?"
00:03:49,00:03:51,- I'm exaggerating a little for comic effect.
00:03:51,00:03:53,I don't know about its eyesight.
00:03:53,00:03:54,"It has got good eyesight, hasn't it?"
00:03:54,00:03:56,Or sort of something special about its eyes
00:03:56,00:03:58,that it can navigate?
00:03:58,00:04:00,"- Michael Titan there, perhaps, I reckon."
00:04:00,00:04:01,- Yeah.
00:04:01,00:04:02,- 'Cause they...
00:04:02,00:04:03,"- I think that's probably the American ones,"
00:04:03,00:04:04,'cause they migrate quite a lot
00:04:04,00:04:05,"down there, the American ones."
00:04:05,00:04:06,- Okay.
00:04:06,00:04:07,- They do.
00:04:07,00:04:08,"You almost never see them here,"
00:04:08,00:04:10,but did you read about the...
00:04:10,00:04:11,I think one of the last times
00:04:11,00:04:14,that American robin was seen in the UK
00:04:14,00:04:15,"was in 2004,"
00:04:15,00:04:17,and it was one of these.
00:04:17,00:04:19,"It was blown over the Atlantic,"
00:04:19,00:04:20,so it got lost on a migration.
00:04:20,00:04:21,(audience laughing)
00:04:21,00:04:23,"- That's a hell of a puff, isn't it,"
00:04:23,00:04:24,to get you over the Atlantic?
00:04:24,00:04:26,- It was a gusty day.
00:04:26,00:04:28,And it...
00:04:28,00:04:30,"So it turned up in Grimsby,"
00:04:30,00:04:32,and there was huge excitement.
00:04:32,00:04:33,"- Oh, God."
00:04:33,00:04:35,"I mean, your face bad enough, isn't it?"
00:04:35,00:04:36,(audience laughing)
00:04:36,00:04:37,You end up in Grimsby.
00:04:37,00:04:38,(audience laughing)
00:04:38,00:04:39,- That's a bad hangover.
00:04:39,00:04:41,What did I do last night?
00:04:41,00:04:44,"And the Twitchers, as they do, got very excited"
00:04:44,00:04:45,"and all communicated with each other to say,"
00:04:45,00:04:46,"""Come on, come on, see this American robin."
00:04:46,00:04:48,"""It's so rare to see them here."""
00:04:48,00:04:50,And they all arrived just in time
00:04:50,00:04:52,to see it get eaten by a sparrow hawk.
00:04:52,00:04:53,(audience laughing)
00:04:53,00:04:56,"- Oh, poor thing."
00:04:56,00:04:57,I love that...
00:04:57,00:04:59,I didn't know it was called turd migratus.
00:04:59,00:05:00,"- Turdus, yeah."
00:05:00,00:05:01,- Turdus.
00:05:01,00:05:02,- Not turd migratus.
00:05:02,00:05:03,- Turdus migratus.
00:05:03,00:05:04,Turdus. - Turdus.
00:05:04,00:05:05,- It still works nicely.
00:05:05,00:05:08,"- It's a very, very lazy Harry Potter spell, basically."
00:05:08,00:05:10,(audience laughing)
00:05:10,00:05:11,"- If you're a bit constipated,"
00:05:11,00:05:12,is that what you do?
00:05:12,00:05:14,(audience laughing)
00:05:14,00:05:17,"- Oh, if you hear that in the stall, yeah, next to you."
00:05:17,00:05:19,- Turdus migratus.
00:05:19,00:05:21,(audience laughing)
00:05:21,00:05:22,- Yeah.
00:05:22,00:05:23,(audience laughing)
00:05:23,00:05:25,- I would have thought exbellianus
00:05:25,00:05:26,would have been the better.
00:05:26,00:05:29,(audience cheering)
00:05:29,00:05:33,"- Okay, so on the word turdus,"
00:05:33,00:05:35,"the word sturdy,"
00:05:35,00:05:37,that supposedly comes from the Latin for thrush.
00:05:37,00:05:41,That's supposed to come from turdus as well.
00:05:41,00:05:43,"And the idea was,"
00:05:43,00:05:45,"if a thrush would eat lots of berries,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,it might get drunk.
00:05:47,00:05:50,And it would kind of sway around and sway around.
00:05:50,00:05:53,And so turdy meant swaying.
00:05:53,00:05:58,"And then sturdy came from non-drunk thrushes, yeah."
00:05:58,00:06:00,"That's according to the Oxford English Dictionary,"
00:06:00,00:06:02,"who I must say, I don't believe."
00:06:02,00:06:04,(audience laughing)
00:06:04,00:06:06,"There is a French saying, which is as drunk as a thrush,"
00:06:06,00:06:09,"which gives a little bit of credence to it, so."
00:06:09,00:06:11,- They are the most prone to get drunk
00:06:11,00:06:13,"on fermented berries, I think, aren't they?"
00:06:13,00:06:14,- They are the American rubies.
00:06:14,00:06:15,- Rubbies?
00:06:15,00:06:18,"That's what I called them, we're close."
00:06:18,00:06:22,"And it happens, so it tends to happen in spring,"
00:06:22,00:06:24,"but it can actually happen in autumn,"
00:06:24,00:06:26,"so basically it'll happen when the berries have frozen,"
00:06:26,00:06:28,"and so when frost hits them,"
00:06:28,00:06:30,then they'll start converting their starch to sugars.
00:06:30,00:06:33,"Then I think when they thaw, then that starts fermenting."
00:06:33,00:06:35,"And then they get eaten, and then they do funny things,"
00:06:35,00:06:37,like crashing to each other or fall off branches.
00:06:37,00:06:41,"But in Minnesota, in October, a couple of years ago,"
00:06:41,00:06:44,"there was an early frost that caused a big outbreak of this,"
00:06:44,00:06:47,and the police were called so many times
00:06:47,00:06:49,"that they actually had to put on a report out,"
00:06:49,00:06:53,saying there's no need to report drunk robins to the police.
00:06:53,00:06:55,They will sober up within a short period of time
00:06:55,00:06:56,and get over their lives.
00:06:56,00:06:57,(audience laughing)
00:06:57,00:06:59,- I read a really lovely story.
00:06:59,00:07:03,"In India, there was a species, a type of robin,"
00:07:03,00:07:06,that had made its way into the electrical box
00:07:06,00:07:08,of a very tiny town.
00:07:08,00:07:10,"So there's about 150 people that live in this town,"
00:07:10,00:07:13,and this box would be turned on every night
00:07:13,00:07:14,at 6 p.m. by one guy.
00:07:14,00:07:17,"And so he noticed that a robin,"
00:07:17,00:07:19,"this species, a robin had laid eggs"
00:07:19,00:07:23,and was using this electrical circuit board as its nest.
00:07:23,00:07:24,So he wrote on a WhatsApp group
00:07:24,00:07:26,"to all of the people in the village saying,"
00:07:26,00:07:29,"""Is it cool if we don't turn on the street lights"
00:07:29,00:07:31,at night time until they've hatched
00:07:31,00:07:33,"and the birds have flown away?"""
00:07:33,00:07:34,And the whole village all agreed.
00:07:34,00:07:39,"And so for over 35 days, they had no lights at night,"
00:07:39,00:07:42,"just to make sure that these little birds were born properly,"
00:07:42,00:07:43,"and then they flew away,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,and then he started turning them on again.
00:07:45,00:07:46,- That is a nice story.
00:07:46,00:07:49,- Did they have lots of traffic incidents?
00:07:49,00:07:51,"- There was, yeah, 90 fatalities."
00:07:51,00:07:53,(audience laughing)
00:07:53,00:07:56,"- Robins live really short lives most of the time,"
00:07:56,00:07:58,so they live for about 13 months.
00:07:58,00:08:01,"Very, very high mortality rate in their first year."
00:08:01,00:08:03,"But if they're through that,"
00:08:03,00:08:06,they stand a very good chance of surviving for a lot longer.
00:08:06,00:08:08,So the oldest ever robin known
00:08:08,00:08:11,"was recorded as being, it was ringed,"
00:08:11,00:08:13,"you know, with a ring around its foot or whatever."
00:08:13,00:08:16,It was 19 years and four months.
00:08:16,00:08:17,- Oh my God!
00:08:17,00:08:19,- Imagine if there were people just walking around
00:08:19,00:08:22,"who were 1,000 years old and they'd just got lucky."
00:08:22,00:08:23,- Oh my God!
00:08:23,00:08:25,"- Yeah, that's what it's like for robins."
00:08:25,00:08:26,"- When he said ringed,"
00:08:26,00:08:27,I thought he meant we cut it in half every year
00:08:27,00:08:28,and count the rings.
00:08:28,00:08:29,(audience laughing)
00:08:29,00:08:31,"- It was amazingly hardy, yeah."
00:08:31,00:08:32,(audience laughing)
00:08:32,00:08:35,This fact is about the fact that a robin
00:08:35,00:08:37,"is actually a thrush and a misnamed bird,"
00:08:37,00:08:38,and it's a Christmas bird.
00:08:38,00:08:39,That we're talking about.
00:08:39,00:08:42,And so I started looking into other Christmas birds.
00:08:42,00:08:45,And it turns out a lot of them are misnamed as well.
00:08:45,00:08:49,"So one of the great songs that we have,"
00:08:49,00:08:51,"the first day of Christmas, my true,"
00:08:51,00:08:54,"we have a bunch of birds in that song, don't we, right?"
00:08:54,00:08:56,"So, okay, turtle doves."
00:08:56,00:08:57,Turtle doves are given everything.
00:08:57,00:09:00,So we think that they're called turtle doves
00:09:00,00:09:02,because they make a tur tur sounds.
00:09:02,00:09:03,So that's the turtle.
00:09:03,00:09:04,"So as the article points out,"
00:09:04,00:09:07,"and this is according to a biologist called Pamela Remerson,"
00:09:07,00:09:09,no relation to turtles.
00:09:09,00:09:10,"So they're just, they're..."
00:09:10,00:09:12,(audience laughing)
00:09:12,00:09:13,- This is your facts?
00:09:13,00:09:14,The doves are not related to turtles.
00:09:14,00:09:17,"- Turtle doves, zero relation to turtles."
00:09:17,00:09:19,And myth busted.
00:09:19,00:09:21,(audience laughing)
00:09:21,00:09:23,"French hens, there's three French hens in it."
00:09:23,00:09:24,- Oh my God.
00:09:24,00:09:25,"- They're probably from France,"
00:09:25,00:09:28,but they're not actually a species called French hen.
00:09:28,00:09:30,"That doesn't exist, so myth busted."
00:09:30,00:09:34,"Second one down, calling birds."
00:09:34,00:09:36,"That sounds interesting, doesn't exist."
00:09:36,00:09:37,We don't have calling birds.
00:09:37,00:09:40,What they're probably talking about is for collie birds.
00:09:40,00:09:42,And we just misunderstood that.
00:09:42,00:09:44,We've called them calling birds.
00:09:44,00:09:46,"Andy, myth busted."
00:09:46,00:09:48,"- A collie bird is like a blackbird, right?"
00:09:48,00:09:50,Is it an old word for black?
00:09:50,00:09:51,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:09:51,00:09:52,"- It's called collet, right?"
00:09:52,00:09:52,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:09:52,00:09:54,Partridge in a pear tree.
00:09:54,00:09:55,They're ground birds.
00:09:55,00:09:57,They're never seen in trees.
00:09:57,00:09:57,(audience laughing)
00:09:57,00:09:58,"That is good, actually."
00:09:58,00:09:59,You say the best of luck.
00:09:59,00:10:01,Myth busted.
00:10:01,00:10:04,"- You do see the odd partridge in a tree, to be fair."
00:10:04,00:10:05,But they don't nest in trees.
00:10:05,00:10:07,- Are they drunk?
00:10:07,00:10:08,- Only when they're pissed.
00:10:08,00:10:09,They're like the opposite of all other birds.
00:10:09,00:10:11,They fall up trees when they're drunk.
00:10:11,00:10:13,(audience laughing)
00:10:13,00:10:14,"- The song ""When the Red Red Dropping"""
00:10:14,00:10:16,goes bob bob bobbing along.
00:10:16,00:10:17,Really quickly on that.
00:10:17,00:10:21,"It was written in 1926, or 1925."
00:10:21,00:10:25,"By 1926, it was a hit for Whispering Jack Smith,"
00:10:25,00:10:28,"Cliff Edwards, Paul Whiteman,"
00:10:28,00:10:31,"the Ipanama Troubadours, and Al Jolson."
00:10:31,00:10:34,"In the same year, it was a hit for all those people."
00:10:34,00:10:35,- Wow.
00:10:35,00:10:36,"- And it's not like one of those, you know,"
00:10:36,00:10:37,when you get a rap song and you've got
00:10:37,00:10:39,"20 different rappers on it,"
00:10:39,00:10:40,they all did their own version of it.
00:10:40,00:10:41,- That's amazing.
00:10:41,00:10:43,What was the first one called?
00:10:43,00:10:45,- It was Whispering Jack Smith.
00:10:45,00:10:46,- That sounds terrifying.
00:10:46,00:10:47,(audience laughing)
00:10:47,00:10:51,"""When the Red Red Dropping"" goes bob bobbing along."
00:10:51,00:10:55,"- It was most famous by Boddlestar, William Roth."
00:10:55,00:10:58,She's the most famous one who sang it.
00:10:58,00:11:00,"And she sang it when she was really young,"
00:11:00,00:11:02,when she was about 14 or 15.
00:11:02,00:11:04,And then she became not famous anymore.
00:11:04,00:11:06,"And then later on, she went on This Is Your Life,"
00:11:06,00:11:09,and she kind of was really honest about her alcoholism.
00:11:09,00:11:12,"And she got more than 40,000 letters"
00:11:12,00:11:14,when she went on This Is Your Life.
00:11:14,00:11:15,She wrote not a biography.
00:11:15,00:11:20,And then it got turned into a movie starring Susan Hayward.
00:11:20,00:11:22,And that was nominated for an Academy Award.
00:11:22,00:11:25,"So, 'cause her life was so amazing."
00:11:25,00:11:27,"And then when she kind of went on This Is Your Life,"
00:11:27,00:11:29,she became famous again.
00:11:29,00:11:31,And she had a huge sort of revival.
00:11:31,00:11:34,She went on Broadway and did her own song.
00:11:34,00:11:36,And the highlight of her act was singing
00:11:36,00:11:39,when the Red Red Robin came bob bobbing along.
00:11:39,00:11:42,But she sang it in the style of the person
00:11:42,00:11:45,"who played her in the movie, doing an impression of her."
00:11:45,00:11:47,- Jesus.
00:11:47,00:11:47,- Isn't that amazing?
00:11:47,00:11:48,- That's sad.
00:11:48,00:11:49,- You probably know the song most
00:11:49,00:11:52,"because I know you go to Charlton Athletic every now and then,"
00:11:52,00:11:54,and that's what they sing.
00:11:54,00:11:56,- Is that what they're trying to sing?
00:11:56,00:11:57,(audience laughing)
00:11:57,00:11:59,Jesus Christ.
00:11:59,00:12:01,"Really, are they doing it in the style of this woman?"
00:12:01,00:12:02,Do they get in the style of her?
00:12:02,00:12:05,- I think the dog is doing it in the style of some other bird.
00:12:05,00:12:06,- Wow.
00:12:06,00:12:08,Did you guys read that there's a type of thrush
00:12:08,00:12:13,that gets its prey to come to the top of the surface
00:12:13,00:12:14,by farting on the ground?
00:12:14,00:12:17,- What if it looms worms towards it?
00:12:17,00:12:20,"- Yeah, it just gets down and it just starts farting."
00:12:20,00:12:21,- What do the worms think of this thing?
00:12:21,00:12:23,"- I think you know that thing where it's kind of like,"
00:12:23,00:12:24,it feels like it's rain and it's coming up
00:12:24,00:12:26,and they hear vibrations and they come up.
00:12:26,00:12:29,"It turns out anyway, it's not true."
00:12:29,00:12:31,(audience laughing)
00:12:31,00:12:33,"- Dan, can I do the others?"
00:12:33,00:12:34,- Myth busted.
00:12:34,00:12:35,(audience laughing)
00:12:35,00:12:36,"- Thank you, Andy."
00:12:36,00:12:41,- It is time for fact number two and that is Andy.
00:12:41,00:12:43,- My fact is that nobody knows
00:12:43,00:12:47,"where Caravaggio's most Christmassy painting is,"
00:12:47,00:12:50,but the main theory is that it was eaten by pigs
00:12:50,00:12:51,in the 1970s.
00:12:51,00:12:54,(audience laughing)
00:12:54,00:12:58,"This is a painting, so Caravaggio's extremely famous"
00:12:58,00:13:01,"16th century artist, 16th, early 17th,"
00:13:01,00:13:02,and he painted a painting called
00:13:02,00:13:04,"""The Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence"""
00:13:04,00:13:07,and it was stolen.
00:13:07,00:13:09,It was in a church in Palermo in Italy
00:13:09,00:13:12,and it had been there for nearly 400 years.
00:13:12,00:13:14,It was incredibly well established there.
00:13:14,00:13:18,"And in 1969, it was nicked by persons unknown."
00:13:18,00:13:21,"It's worth, obviously, millions and millions."
00:13:21,00:13:22,There are not that many Caravaggio's
00:13:22,00:13:25,and no one knows where it is to this day.
00:13:25,00:13:28,It was cut from its frame and there are rumors
00:13:28,00:13:30,"about where it is, so some people say it's in Switzerland,"
00:13:30,00:13:32,"some people say there's no way it ever left Italy,"
00:13:32,00:13:34,there was no international gossip
00:13:34,00:13:35,"about where it might have ended up,"
00:13:35,00:13:37,but one mafia informer claimed
00:13:37,00:13:40,that it had been damaged in an earthquake
00:13:40,00:13:42,and then just left it alone for a bit
00:13:42,00:13:44,and then gnawed on by rats and pigs
00:13:44,00:13:47,until it was completely worthless and then they burned it.
00:13:47,00:13:50,"- Wow, weird. - We don't know, but yeah."
00:13:50,00:13:53,"- It seems very odd, this habit that all these mafia members,"
00:13:53,00:13:55,"it's the Cousin Ostra, isn't it?"
00:13:55,00:13:58,Members have of admitting to stealing the painting
00:13:58,00:14:00,and then telling the story of the painting
00:14:00,00:14:01,and you never know if they're telling the truth
00:14:01,00:14:03,and I think so these are like pentitos
00:14:03,00:14:06,"who go to the police and say, ""Oh, I've been in the mafia"
00:14:06,00:14:08,"""and I'm really sorry about it"
00:14:08,00:14:10,"""and I'll tell you where this nativity painting is."""
00:14:10,00:14:13,And I think the latest person is Guy Tano Grado
00:14:13,00:14:15,who said he helped to steal the painting
00:14:15,00:14:18,and then it somehow got into the hands of a mafia boss
00:14:18,00:14:20,who took it to a Swiss art dealer
00:14:20,00:14:24,"and I just like the scene, the dealer wept when he saw it"
00:14:24,00:14:26,"'cause it's such a beautiful, unbelievable painting."
00:14:26,00:14:29,"It's a Caravaggio, so the dealer burst and the tears sobbed"
00:14:29,00:14:31,"and then immediately said, ""We need to cut this into pieces"
00:14:31,00:14:33,"""so we can sell them discreetly"
00:14:33,00:14:35,"""otherwise people will know what it is."""
00:14:35,00:14:38,"- Right, so what do you do, do you buy up all the pieces"
00:14:38,00:14:40,and put them together like a jigsaw?
00:14:40,00:14:41,"- Yeah, it's not like that."
00:14:41,00:14:44,- I don't realise how fucking dangerous pigs are.
00:14:44,00:14:50,"Top tip, don't die next to a pig, it will eat you."
00:14:50,00:14:52,"- Yeah, but watch your dad, it doesn't really matter to him."
00:14:52,00:14:55,"- I know, but like if you were even in the process of dying"
00:14:55,00:14:57,"and you happened to fall next to a pig, you're a goner."
00:14:57,00:14:59,"- Yep, absolutely."
00:14:59,00:15:02,- And the Robin will watch from the side and laugh.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"- Well, to him, it's like a pig's eating a pig."
00:15:04,00:15:05,It's like cannibalism.
00:15:05,00:15:07,"- Cannibalism, it'll look like."
00:15:07,00:15:09,"No, seriously, last few years, just the headlines."
00:15:09,00:15:11,"2020, missing Polish farmer,"
00:15:11,00:15:13,"eaten by his own pigs, officials say."
00:15:13,00:15:18,"2019, woman eaten by a pig after she collapses while feeding."
00:15:18,00:15:20,"Basically, if you fall near a pig and you're asleep,"
00:15:20,00:15:22,"it will eat you. - It's quite famous that, I think."
00:15:22,00:15:25,"Like, is it Hannibal? - Is it a Hannibal book?"
00:15:25,00:15:28,"- Yeah, you've got to watch Hannibal, it's great."
00:15:28,00:15:30,"Most things of that scene, where you're eaten by pigs,"
00:15:30,00:15:32,it's a documentary about how it's very easy to get eaten by pigs
00:15:32,00:15:34,if you're not careful.
00:15:34,00:15:36,"- It's funny, because pigs do have a reputation"
00:15:36,00:15:38,for being very intelligent and quite friendly.
00:15:38,00:15:40,"They do, don't they? Like, babe."
00:15:40,00:15:41,"Yeah, like, babe."
00:15:41,00:15:43,"- You've got to watch... - Like, babe, drink, yeah."
00:15:43,00:15:46,"- Babe, drink, but babe eats the farmer, yeah."
00:15:46,00:15:48,"- Is that all dope, pig?"
00:15:48,00:15:52,- Do you guys know pig casso?
00:15:52,00:15:55,"- No. - Just speaking of art and pig,"
00:15:55,00:15:58,he's the first non-human to hold his own exhibition.
00:15:58,00:16:00,Art exhibition. - Really?
00:16:00,00:16:02,- Yeah. Born in 2016.
00:16:02,00:16:04,"- I mean, when we say ""hold"" his own art exhibition,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,did he book the venue? - Yes.
00:16:06,00:16:10,"- Did he do the catering? God, I can't imagine the catering, actually."
00:16:10,00:16:11,- He did all the admin.
00:16:11,00:16:14,"He finds it difficult to hold the phone, but he's overcoming it."
00:16:14,00:16:16,"No, he was born in 2016."
00:16:16,00:16:18,He was one of these people who was rescued and taken to a sanctuary
00:16:18,00:16:21,that was set up by this woman called Joanne Lebson
00:16:21,00:16:22,in South Africa.
00:16:22,00:16:25,"And she said the reason that he became a famous painter,"
00:16:25,00:16:30,"as he is now, is that she put him in a pen with loads and loads of stuff,"
00:16:30,00:16:33,"and he ate or destroyed everything in the stool,"
00:16:33,00:16:35,except that paintbrushes.
00:16:35,00:16:38,And so she deduced from that that he must love art.
00:16:38,00:16:40,(LAUGHTER)
00:16:40,00:16:41,He's since become a painter.
00:16:41,00:16:46,"He designed Swatches 2019 Swatch Design, which is called Flying Pig,"
00:16:46,00:16:48,and it's lots of purple and pink swirls.
00:16:48,00:16:52,"- Did they not find, like, a work of art"
00:16:52,00:16:55,and then maybe the shoes of an artist
00:16:55,00:16:57,that he just eats and the rest of the artist?
00:16:57,00:16:58,(LAUGHTER)
00:16:58,00:17:00,- It could be that.
00:17:00,00:17:02,- Does he draw with a pig pen?
00:17:02,00:17:03,(AUDIENCE GASPS)
00:17:03,00:17:05,- Don't boo that!
00:17:05,00:17:06,- What's the... - It's Christmas!
00:17:06,00:17:10,"- It's Christmas! I'm sorry, I've ruined Christmas."
00:17:10,00:17:13,- Shall we talk about Caravaggio? - I think we better.
00:17:13,00:17:16,"- Caravaggio, he was a bit of a badden, wasn't he?"
00:17:16,00:17:18,He was a bit of a badden.
00:17:18,00:17:23,"In 1604, the year, variously, he was arrested for assaulting a waiter"
00:17:23,00:17:28,"who had served him with a plate of artichokes dressed in butter rather than oil,"
00:17:28,00:17:33,"for throwing stones in the street next to a perfume maker and some prostitutes,"
00:17:33,00:17:37,"and for telling a policeman who was attempting to release him quietly,"
00:17:37,00:17:40,"even though he was carrying a sword, which he wasn't supposed to,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,you can stick it up your arse.
00:17:42,00:17:43,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:43,00:17:44,- Right.
00:17:44,00:17:47,- You've given very one-sided story there.
00:17:47,00:17:51,"I'm quite a fan of Caravaggio, and the artichoke story, for example,"
00:17:51,00:17:53,was sort of justifiable. It was a test.
00:17:53,00:17:57,"So it was... He ordered eight artichokes for lunch,"
00:17:57,00:18:01,and he ordered four to be fried in oil and four to be fried in butter.
00:18:01,00:18:03,"The artichokes arrived, and then he asked the waiter,"
00:18:03,00:18:05,"""Well, which of the four fried in oil?"""
00:18:05,00:18:07,And the waiter couldn't tell.
00:18:07,00:18:11,"- And then he picked up his sword, he had attacked the waiter,"
00:18:11,00:18:13,and then got a plate and smashed him in the face with it.
00:18:13,00:18:15,"- There's no excuse for bad service, James."
00:18:15,00:18:16,(LAUGHTER)
00:18:16,00:18:17,- The waiter was always right.
00:18:17,00:18:20,"- Speaking of bad service, he killed a man after a game of tennis,"
00:18:20,00:18:22,didn't he? - Did he?
00:18:22,00:18:24,"- Yeah, that's one of the most famous things about him."
00:18:24,00:18:30,So he had to leave Rome when he killed his opponent in a game of tennis.
00:18:30,00:18:33,"Now, we think possibly it wasn't because of the tennis"
00:18:33,00:18:36,"that he did this murder, and we think possibly"
00:18:36,00:18:38,he might not have been deliberately trying to kill the man.
00:18:38,00:18:41,He might have only been trying to cut off his testicles.
00:18:41,00:18:42,- Right.
00:18:42,00:18:44,- You're all right. My client was merely trying to cut off
00:18:44,00:18:46,this man's testicles with his sword.
00:18:46,00:18:47,"- New balls, please."
00:18:47,00:18:50,(LAUGHTER)
00:18:50,00:18:52,- Very strong.
00:18:52,00:18:54,"Yeah, it's very unclear, because they were having an argument"
00:18:54,00:18:57,"about a woman who was maybe one of Caravaggio's models,"
00:18:57,00:19:01,"but was also a prostitute, but was also working for the opponent."
00:19:01,00:19:02,"This man, Tomassini, was it?"
00:19:02,00:19:05,"- Yeah, so Tomassini was the pimp of this woman."
00:19:05,00:19:06,- Yes.
00:19:06,00:19:10,"- But also, when you're an artist, it was illegal for someone to sit for you,"
00:19:10,00:19:14,"especially naked, unless they were a prostitute, unless you were paying them."
00:19:14,00:19:16,"And so, basically, most of the artists around that time"
00:19:16,00:19:21,"were employing prostitutes to, or sex workers, I should say, to sit for them."
00:19:21,00:19:24,"And so, there was obviously something happening here."
00:19:24,00:19:25,We weren't quite sure.
00:19:25,00:19:28,"The woman was called Faleed Melendroni,"
00:19:28,00:19:31,and there's not much else about her.
00:19:31,00:19:35,She was once called a scandalous courtesan
00:19:35,00:19:40,"by the vicariat of Rome, no less, for refusing the sacrament."
00:19:40,00:19:43,"And later that year, she was arrested for possessing a weapon."
00:19:43,00:19:45,"So, she was a bit of a baddler, as well."
00:19:45,00:19:48,"- If that's the most scandalous thing you're doing, as a prostitute,"
00:19:48,00:19:53,"refusing the sacrament, then I think you've got to up your game."
00:19:53,00:19:57,"- He was a very, very naughty boy, Caravaggio."
00:19:57,00:19:58,"No, he was."
00:19:58,00:20:00,"No, we shouldn't be glamourising it, because he was a ron."
00:20:00,00:20:01,He was a rogue.
00:20:01,00:20:04,"There was a film. There's a film made about his life in 1986,"
00:20:04,00:20:08,"in which Sean Bean, it's one of Sean Bean's very earliest films,"
00:20:08,00:20:12,"he plays the guy Caravaggio had a deal with, Ranuccio Tomassoni."
00:20:12,00:20:15,"And that is also notable, because it's the first time"
00:20:15,00:20:17,that Sean Bean died onscreen.
00:20:17,00:20:19,"- Oh, no way! - Yes!"
00:20:19,00:20:23,"- Really? - Sean Bean has had a lot of screen deaths, if you don't know."
00:20:23,00:20:26,Sean Bean has been impaled on an anchor.
00:20:26,00:20:29,He's been stabbed. He's fallen off an antenna.
00:20:29,00:20:31,He's been buried alive and then died.
00:20:31,00:20:32,He's been hanged.
00:20:32,00:20:34,"He's been shot through the neck with a grappling hook,"
00:20:34,00:20:36,and then hanged.
00:20:36,00:20:38,"He's been torn into quarters by horses,"
00:20:38,00:20:40,decapitated and shot ten times.
00:20:40,00:20:44,"- Well, he's hard. He's a hard man, had he come back from all those things. - He's a hard man, had he come back from all those things."
00:20:44,00:20:47,"He's still swinging, but he's not the actor who's died most in films."
00:20:47,00:20:49,"- This is diversion now, but... - Uh-huh."
00:20:49,00:20:54,"- Danny, is it Trejo? - Yeah, I'm machete-y."
00:20:54,00:20:58,"- Machete, yeah. - He's died 65 times in different films."
00:20:58,00:21:01,"- Has he? - Yeah, he has been killed by topless prostitutes"
00:21:01,00:21:03,in two separate films.
00:21:03,00:21:09,"Wow, that's typecasting, starting to exert its baleful influence, I'm afraid."
00:21:09,00:21:13,"You know, he invented really incredible lighting for paintings,"
00:21:13,00:21:16,and two people have been massively influenced by it.
00:21:16,00:21:20,"David Hockney talks about it, saying he basically invented Hollywood lighting."
00:21:20,00:21:23,"It was just... It was in one direction, and he believes that he used..."
00:21:23,00:21:26,"- It was in one direction? - Yeah, he was multi-talented."
00:21:26,00:21:30,"He was... Yeah, he was a very influential character."
00:21:30,00:21:34,"He supposedly... He would use mirrors to sort of bend light towards,"
00:21:34,00:21:37,"and Martin Scorsese, when he would see his paintings,"
00:21:37,00:21:42,"was... A lot of Scorsese's movies, he says, were influenced by the lighting"
00:21:42,00:21:46,"that he saw in Caravaggio's paintings, and he's convinced that if he was in modern times,"
00:21:46,00:21:49,"he would have been one of our great directors, purely for that,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,purely for his understanding of light and composure.
00:21:51,00:21:54,"Yeah, but it was particularly dark. I've always thought they're too dark."
00:21:54,00:21:57,"It always looks like it's not very well lit in galleries, I think."
00:21:57,00:21:59,"- I agree. - It's basically 'cause it's all kind of black,"
00:21:59,00:22:01,except one shaft of light.
00:22:01,00:22:02,"- Yeah, it's like Blade Runner. - Yeah."
00:22:02,00:22:05,But he did get in trouble once with his landlord.
00:22:05,00:22:08,"In fact, he was evicted because he cut..."
00:22:08,00:22:11,"He was renting a room, and he cut a hole in the ceiling"
00:22:11,00:22:13,to get that single shaft of light.
00:22:13,00:22:15,- Cool. - And a lot of landlords hate that.
00:22:15,00:22:17,"Was it in the ceiling? So, Ren could get in."
00:22:17,00:22:19,"- In the roof. - Yes, yeah, yeah."
00:22:19,00:22:20,"I suppose that's gonna ruin the painting, isn't it?"
00:22:20,00:22:22,"- It didn't make a difference. - But also, he was in a ground floor flat,"
00:22:22,00:22:25,so he had to do every single thing.
00:22:25,00:22:28,"- Can we move on to the next fact? - Yes, please."
00:22:28,00:22:32,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:22:32,00:22:36,My fact this week is that Merry Christmas Park in Miami
00:22:36,00:22:38,"isn't named after the holiday,"
00:22:38,00:22:41,"but after a girl named Mary,"
00:22:41,00:22:45,"who was the daughter of the city's former mayor, Randy Christmas."
00:22:45,00:22:46,(LAUGHTER)
00:22:46,00:22:48,I love that song.
00:22:48,00:22:50,Have yourself a randy little Christmas.
00:22:50,00:22:53,We will hear a randy Christmas.
00:22:53,00:22:59,"So, Randy Christmas was the mayor of Miami from 1955 to 1957,"
00:22:59,00:23:02,"and he had a little daughter who he named Merry,"
00:23:02,00:23:04,"she felt M-E-R-R-I-E,"
00:23:04,00:23:08,"and Merry, unfortunately, was quite sick when she was born."
00:23:08,00:23:10,"She was born with only one kidney,"
00:23:10,00:23:13,which she was basically correctly diagnosed with
00:23:13,00:23:15,"when she was about three years old,"
00:23:15,00:23:18,"and they thought that she wasn't gonna make it, unfortunately."
00:23:18,00:23:21,And one of the things that Miami wanted to do
00:23:21,00:23:26,"to sort of talk about, you know, what an amazing and brave girl she was going through,"
00:23:26,00:23:28,"what she was going through, is to name this park after her."
00:23:28,00:23:30,"So, it's a very tiny little park,"
00:23:30,00:23:33,"and she was just, she was an amazing person."
00:23:33,00:23:36,"She continued, she had 12 operations."
00:23:36,00:23:38,"They thought she was only gonna live for a few months,"
00:23:38,00:23:40,but she had survived 12 more years.
00:23:40,00:23:43,"She used to go to the park once a year, she loved visiting it."
00:23:43,00:23:46,She would sometimes go to it during Christmas as well
00:23:46,00:23:50,"to visit Merry Christmas Park, her park, she used to say."
00:23:50,00:23:51,"She sadly passed away,"
00:23:51,00:23:55,"but she did get to experience this park for a long time, yeah."
00:23:55,00:23:59,And how many disappointed people would show up at the park every day throughout December
00:23:59,00:24:01,"are going, ""Where the hell's Santa Claus?"
00:24:01,00:24:04,"""Why is there a 12-year-old girl here instead?"""
00:24:04,00:24:06,It's good to look at the story that way as well.
00:24:06,00:24:09,She's letting a lot of people down.
00:24:09,00:24:12,"Yeah. ""Is this your fault, you little dick? What's this?"""
00:24:12,00:24:14,Get out your wheelchair and look me in the eye.
00:24:14,00:24:16,Yeah.
00:24:16,00:24:18,"Come on, Anna."
00:24:18,00:24:21,"So, the Christmas family, they said it took them three children"
00:24:21,00:24:24,for them to get up the nerve to call one of them Merry.
00:24:24,00:24:28,"Oh, really? Although, Merry Christmas did have her sister called Holly,"
00:24:28,00:24:29,who actually is still around.
00:24:29,00:24:33,"She was posted on the internet in June this year, so she's definitely still alive."
00:24:33,00:24:37,Some of the other children in the school would tease Merry Christmas
00:24:37,00:24:39,and call her Happy New Year.
00:24:39,00:24:41,LAUGHTER
00:24:41,00:24:43,"But when she died, she did die very young,"
00:24:43,00:24:47,but she was so popular that they had to put on buses to get people to the funeral.
00:24:47,00:24:50,"It was an absolutely massive funeral. Oh, wow."
00:24:50,00:24:55,And Randy Christmas's mother was called Leonora Pauline Pope Christmas.
00:24:55,00:25:00,"Her surname was Pope, so Pope married Christmas and had Randy."
00:25:00,00:25:02,LAUGHTER
00:25:02,00:25:05,"It seems like it's kind of degrading the family names there, doesn't it?"
00:25:05,00:25:07,"Yeah, and thank God it wasn't double-barrelled,"
00:25:07,00:25:11,because he could have been Randy Pope Christmas as the mayor of Miami.
00:25:11,00:25:17,"Gosh. There was a competition to find the most Christmassy name in the UK in 2017,"
00:25:17,00:25:21,and it was held by the British Christmas Tree Growers Association.
00:25:21,00:25:23,And there were various great entries.
00:25:23,00:25:26,"The eventual winner was a woman called Donna Rudolph,"
00:25:26,00:25:30,"which is good, because that's two of the reindeer, which is very impressive."
00:25:30,00:25:34,"But other winners included people like Val Spruce, Holly Berry,"
00:25:34,00:25:36,"which I think is really good,"
00:25:36,00:25:38,Chris Tingley...
00:25:38,00:25:40,LAUGHTER
00:25:40,00:25:41,"That's so great, Christmassy."
00:25:41,00:25:44,"But this is the thing, the prize was a Christmas tree, right?"
00:25:44,00:25:46,"A real Christmas tree, not an artificial one."
00:25:46,00:25:48,"And in her winning speech,"
00:25:48,00:25:50,Donna Rudolph said she was really happy to win
00:25:50,00:25:54,"because she'd never had in her whole life a real Christmas tree,"
00:25:54,00:25:56,and she would be having a real one from now on.
00:25:56,00:25:58,"This is, let's not forget,"
00:25:58,00:26:01,"promoted by the British Christmas Tree Growers Association,"
00:26:01,00:26:05,who I think may have fed her some copy in what she was going to say.
00:26:05,00:26:07,And the whole thing was to promote real trees.
00:26:07,00:26:09,"But I looked into this a bit further, guys."
00:26:09,00:26:13,"Donna Rudolph lived in Whiz Beach, right?"
00:26:13,00:26:16,"Which was fewer than 10 miles from the place,"
00:26:16,00:26:18,"which actually had the farm,"
00:26:18,00:26:21,where she collected her Christmas tree farm.
00:26:21,00:26:23,"So, I'm not... Wait a minute, how old was she?"
00:26:23,00:26:24,I think in her 30s?
00:26:24,00:26:26,"So, it's not going to be 30 years ago,"
00:26:26,00:26:30,they decided to scab that they were going to name her a weird Christmas name.
00:26:30,00:26:34,I'm not suggesting her parents named her to get her a free tree in 30 years.
00:26:34,00:26:37,I'm saying the Christmas tree growers may have picked her
00:26:37,00:26:39,because they wanted someone to turn up in person
00:26:39,00:26:41,and collect their tree from the farm.
00:26:41,00:26:43,It's not the biggest thing ever.
00:26:43,00:26:45,It's not the biggest thing to bust ever.
00:26:45,00:26:46,"It's not Dan Brown, is it?"
00:26:46,00:26:51,"I'm just saying, I think Chris Tingley might have been a bit rock."
00:26:51,00:26:54,"I think Holly Berry. I think Holly Berry is really good, isn't she?"
00:26:54,00:26:55,That's a great...
00:26:55,00:26:59,"Anyway, so that's my niche and illegally quite actionable..."
00:26:59,00:27:04,That's your panorama documentary-style expose there.
00:27:04,00:27:05,I looked the other way.
00:27:05,00:27:07,"I looked at people who were called ""Randy"""
00:27:07,00:27:10,"because I thought, ""That's a fun first name, if you pair it up with a surname."""
00:27:10,00:27:14,"So Wikipedia has just a really big list of different people called ""Randy."""
00:27:14,00:27:19,"So there's a Randy Baker, there's a Randy Farmer,"
00:27:19,00:27:22,"there's a Randy Gardner, there's Randy Love,"
00:27:22,00:27:24,"there's Randy Rogers,"
00:27:24,00:27:27,"Randy Messenger,"
00:27:27,00:27:29,which sounds like someone who'd slip into your DMs.
00:27:29,00:27:30,- I like that one. - Yeah.
00:27:30,00:27:33,"And in my favourite one of all, Randy Murray."
00:27:33,00:27:35,Oh!
00:27:35,00:27:37,Do you know anything about Randy Murray?
00:27:37,00:27:39,He's a Canadian guitarist.
00:27:39,00:27:43,He's amazing. He used to be in a band with a guy called Ronald McDonald.
00:27:43,00:27:44,- No. - No.
00:27:44,00:27:46,- That's as far as I got into his... - Wow.
00:27:46,00:27:50,"Let's get him on. Out of court replacement, do we think?"
00:27:50,00:27:53,We don't have to tweet one letter on the posters.
00:27:53,00:27:57,"There was a guy called Alistair Christmas who was born on Christmas Day,"
00:27:57,00:27:58,which is very exciting.
00:27:58,00:27:59,"He was interviewed by The Daily Mirror,"
00:27:59,00:28:02,and he said that on at least one occasion in his life
00:28:02,00:28:05,someone had refused to hand over a parcel that was for him
00:28:05,00:28:08,because they just couldn't possibly believe
00:28:08,00:28:10,that his name was Alistair Christmas.
00:28:10,00:28:13,Which I have to say is quite not especially unbelievable.
00:28:13,00:28:16,"But he said, of his name, when people find out he's called Alistair Christmas,"
00:28:16,00:28:20,"""People just see you and look at you as if you were magic."
00:28:20,00:28:22,"""You can see it in their eyes."
00:28:22,00:28:25,"""To them, it is like they have just met Santa."""
00:28:25,00:28:28,"Can I say? The delivery guy, right?"
00:28:28,00:28:31,He turns up with a parcel for Mr. A. Christmas.
00:28:31,00:28:34,"And then the guy comes out and says, ""I'm Mr. A. Christmas."""
00:28:34,00:28:36,"And then he says, ""I don't believe you."""
00:28:36,00:28:40,"- What was he expecting the person to say? - Who's this box for, then?"
00:28:40,00:28:42,"- Exactly. - Yeah, exactly."
00:28:42,00:28:44,Did he just take it home? I don't know.
00:28:44,00:28:48,There's the surname Christmas quite common in Essex and Sussex.
00:28:48,00:28:51,"And the theory is that it was probably, you know,"
00:28:51,00:28:54,people got their surnames in the olden days.
00:28:54,00:28:56,It was probably someone who was born on Christmas Day.
00:28:56,00:28:58,That's what we think.
00:28:58,00:29:00,"However, there is a guy called Henry Christmas"
00:29:00,00:29:04,who is a retired engineer who has spent decades
00:29:04,00:29:06,delving into the history of the name.
00:29:06,00:29:10,And he said in 2005 that the Christmas Day/Christmas connection
00:29:10,00:29:12,is too easy.
00:29:12,00:29:15,But I rather think that he's spent decades doing it
00:29:15,00:29:19,and realised that it's actually the obvious thing that everyone thinks.
00:29:19,00:29:23,- Yeah. - He's got to justify a lifetime wasted.
00:29:23,00:29:25,"- Yeah. - Sorry, Henry."
00:29:25,00:29:27,Do you guys know about Merry Christmas Clause and Santa Clause?
00:29:27,00:29:30,- The Nebraska couple. - No.
00:29:30,00:29:34,These are two people who legally changed their names in 2017.
00:29:34,00:29:35,They're so sweet.
00:29:35,00:29:39,So they won't give their real names to journalists who interviewed them.
00:29:39,00:29:41,"So they are now, the wife is Merry Christmas Clause,"
00:29:41,00:29:43,the husband is Santa Clause.
00:29:43,00:29:44,And they go and they dress up.
00:29:44,00:29:47,"They wear their dress reds at Christmas,"
00:29:47,00:29:50,which is the term for the Santa outfit.
00:29:50,00:29:53,"And for the rest of the year, Santa's a taxi driver."
00:29:53,00:29:55,"And yeah, they just decided they loved being in the mall so much,"
00:29:55,00:29:58,"having kids swarming around them, sitting on their laps and everything,"
00:29:58,00:30:01,that they've changed their names.
00:30:01,00:30:02,And it's so sweet.
00:30:02,00:30:06,"They met in December 2009, and she, Merry Christmas Clause,"
00:30:06,00:30:10,said she knew he was the one when he offered to make me dinner.
00:30:10,00:30:12,There aren't many men willing to cook a woman dinner.
00:30:12,00:30:14,I knew I'd found a keeper.
00:30:14,00:30:17,Which does imply a low bar.
00:30:17,00:30:23,"But she then says, ""But the pot gets even lower."""
00:30:23,00:30:25,"She said, ""What I love about Santa, my husband,"
00:30:25,00:30:28,"""is that he's so great at the kid-friendly jokes at Christmas."""
00:30:28,00:30:31,"So that's kind of, can someone explain this to me?"
00:30:31,00:30:34,"She says, ""When the kids ask for iPods,"
00:30:34,00:30:36,"""he says, 'Why an iPod?"
00:30:36,00:30:38,'Wouldn't you rather have a three-pod?'
00:30:38,00:30:43,"'There's three P's in a pod, but there's only one I in an iPod."
00:30:43,00:30:45,"'The parents roar with laughter over that.'"""
00:30:45,00:30:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:48,00:30:49,Does that make sense?
00:30:49,00:30:52,"I think, what does that mean, kind of?"
00:30:52,00:30:54,"I'm not, look, I made a pig-ped joke earlier."
00:30:54,00:30:56,I'm not going to slag off this guy.
00:30:56,00:30:58,He's doing his best.
00:30:58,00:31:01,He's doing his best.
00:31:01,00:31:03,"Wow. We're ignoring one very famous Christmas,"
00:31:03,00:31:06,it was a fictional Christmas.
00:31:06,00:31:08,"Christmas Jones, Bond character."
00:31:08,00:31:10,"Yes. Oh, here's that."
00:31:10,00:31:12,"In the world. The Pierce Brosnan flake, wasn't it?"
00:31:12,00:31:14,That was one of the Pierce Brosnan ones.
00:31:14,00:31:17,"Denise Richards, who's a nuclear physicist character."
00:31:17,00:31:19,"And it's basically, so there are a load of really,"
00:31:19,00:31:21,"really sort of cheap tacky gags, you know,"
00:31:21,00:31:24,"James Bond says, ""Ugh, I thought Christmas only came once a year."
00:31:24,00:31:26,"""It's had all of this."" Really, like, you know."
00:31:26,00:31:28,"It's aged poorly, and it was quite recent."
00:31:28,00:31:32,"So just off the back of this, and this is a tangent,"
00:31:32,00:31:37,"I apologize, I thought I'd try and find the worst role"
00:31:37,00:31:38,"that Denise Richards has ever had to play,"
00:31:38,00:31:41,"and I think I've found it, her first starring role"
00:31:41,00:31:44,"was in a film called ""Tammy and the T-Rex"", OK?"
00:31:44,00:31:47,"Which is a comedy about a girl whose boyfriend,"
00:31:47,00:31:50,"his brain is put into a T-Rex, right?"
00:31:50,00:31:51,"Yeah, I know, I've heard of us."
00:31:51,00:31:53,"OK, so it's a bit niche and a bit cult, but it's..."
00:31:53,00:31:55,What do you mean it's put into a T-Rex?
00:31:55,00:31:57,"Like, his consciousness goes into the T-Rex."
00:31:57,00:32:00,"What T-Rex? There is a T-Rex in the film, OK?"
00:32:00,00:32:01,"Well, I'm getting to that, I'm getting to that."
00:32:01,00:32:04,"A mad scientist has created a T-Rex, OK?"
00:32:04,00:32:07,"So this is the thing, I was reading about this film on IMDB,"
00:32:07,00:32:08,I cannot believe it.
00:32:08,00:32:10,"Basically, listen to this."
00:32:10,00:32:13,"The writer/director Stuart Raffle has said in an interview,"
00:32:13,00:32:15,"""The idea for the film only happened"
00:32:15,00:32:19,"""because they had access to a full-size T-Rex animatronic."""
00:32:19,00:32:20,"Someone phoned him up and said,"
00:32:20,00:32:22,"""Hey, we have this T-Rex for a month, what shall we do?"
00:32:22,00:32:24,"""Shall we make a film?"""
00:32:24,00:32:26,"They said, ""I'll start writing immediately."""
00:32:26,00:32:28,The whole reason for the film
00:32:28,00:32:30,is because they had access to this thing for a month.
00:32:30,00:32:33,"He was constantly writing scenes and then saying to his colleagues,"
00:32:33,00:32:36,"""And the cast and crew, do you have any better ideas"
00:32:36,00:32:38,"""for the next scene?"""
00:32:38,00:32:42,All locations were within 25 minutes of his house.
00:32:42,00:32:44,It's incredible. Sounds amazing.
00:32:44,00:32:47,"It's such a good film. Wow, yeah."
00:32:47,00:32:49,Dan will be watching that when he gets home tonight.
00:32:49,00:32:51,That's what's so sad about this.
00:32:51,00:32:52,"Anyway, tangent over, sorry."
00:32:52,00:32:55,"Hey, listen, I need to move us on to our final fact of the show."
00:32:55,00:32:59,"It is time for our final fact, and that is Anna."
00:32:59,00:33:02,My fact this week is that the Edible Advent Calendar
00:33:02,00:33:05,came before the Printed Picture Advent Calendar.
00:33:05,00:33:11,"This is my interpretation of what the first Advent Calendar was,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,"which was Gerhard Lang,"
00:33:13,00:33:16,who was the first person to print and sell Advent calendars.
00:33:16,00:33:21,"He did it in 1908, and he got his inspiration from his mum,"
00:33:21,00:33:26,"who, when he was young, she had a little cardboard box thing"
00:33:26,00:33:31,"to which she fixed a baked meringue pastry for each day of Advent,"
00:33:31,00:33:33,and she allowed him to eat one per day.
00:33:33,00:33:35,"Oh, yes. It's so charming."
00:33:35,00:33:39,"Yeah, in fact, it's something called ""Wiebele,"""
00:33:39,00:33:42,which I think is a specific German dish.
00:33:42,00:33:45,"It's a sweet-like meringue, which has a figure of eight shape."
00:33:45,00:33:48,"Yeah, he was inspired by that, and he's the father of the Advent Calendar."
00:33:48,00:33:52,"And then his later Advent calendars were called Munich calendars, weren't they?"
00:33:52,00:33:53,Yeah.
00:33:53,00:33:55,"And then something in the '30s happened,"
00:33:55,00:33:58,and he just wasn't very popular anymore outside of Germany.
00:33:58,00:33:59,Yeah.
00:33:59,00:34:00,It's really tragic.
00:34:00,00:34:03,"Carmel was rationed in the '30s, and they shut his company down."
00:34:03,00:34:06,"The German government in the '30s, the Nazi government shut..."
00:34:06,00:34:09,"Sorry, no one, sort of, you know, concealing that,"
00:34:09,00:34:12,but the Nazis made their own Advent calendars as well.
00:34:12,00:34:14,"Yeah, well, there was one company, wasn't there,"
00:34:14,00:34:16,"that they accepted that they could make them,"
00:34:16,00:34:18,but they accepted the company.
00:34:18,00:34:21,"And basically, yeah, if you got an Advent calendar in Nazi Germany,"
00:34:21,00:34:23,it was just Nazi symbolism.
00:34:23,00:34:24,"Yeah, it was..."
00:34:24,00:34:26,"Another swastika, basically, right?"
00:34:26,00:34:27,It was like a tank.
00:34:27,00:34:28,"No, no, no, there were tanks."
00:34:28,00:34:32,"There was Wotan, who was a Nordic god."
00:34:32,00:34:33,"It didn't mention Jesus at all,"
00:34:33,00:34:37,and there was advice on how to keep your children entertained over Christmas.
00:34:37,00:34:39,"Swastika biscuits for the SS,"
00:34:39,00:34:40,put a swastika at the top of the tree.
00:34:40,00:34:41,"Yeah, they were actually looking at it."
00:34:41,00:34:43,Now there are a lot of swastikas as well.
00:34:43,00:34:44,Yeah.
00:34:44,00:34:47,"'Cause they kind of, I think the Nazis tried to do away with..."
00:34:47,00:34:52,"Oh, they kept Christmas, but they made it like a celebration of Nazism, didn't they?"
00:34:52,00:34:54,"'Cause obviously Jesus was Jewish,"
00:34:54,00:34:56,and that didn't fit in with their ideas.
00:34:56,00:34:58,"Yeah, but they had a full..."
00:34:58,00:35:01,They couldn't be able to come up with their own pictures or stories.
00:35:01,00:35:06,"So they printed in 1943 a full calendar, full colour calendar,"
00:35:06,00:35:07,where I think each...
00:35:07,00:35:08,"I think this is around Christmas,"
00:35:08,00:35:11,"and each image was like a Christmassy type image,"
00:35:11,00:35:13,but with a different story attached.
00:35:13,00:35:15,"So there was Mary and Joseph and baby Jesus in a manger,"
00:35:15,00:35:18,"well, I think the three kings going up to them,"
00:35:18,00:35:21,"and it had text underneath explaining that's just a story about a woodcutter,"
00:35:21,00:35:23,a soldier and a king who get lost in the woods
00:35:23,00:35:25,and encounter a woman with a baby.
00:35:25,00:35:27,"Oh, wow."
00:35:27,00:35:29,"Come on, guys, be a bit imaginative."
00:35:29,00:35:33,"And so before this guy, was it called Gerhard Lang?"
00:35:33,00:35:34,Yeah.
00:35:34,00:35:37,"We think there were some kind of advent calendars,"
00:35:37,00:35:39,"but they weren't mass produced, they weren't a proper thing."
00:35:39,00:35:42,"They were just a thing that people did in villages and towns and stuff, right?"
00:35:42,00:35:46,"So in the 19th century, before that, so in the early 19th century,"
00:35:46,00:35:49,"you would have a load of chalk marks on the road,"
00:35:49,00:35:51,and every day you would rub one off.
00:35:51,00:35:53,Don't be disgusting.
00:35:53,00:35:58,"Timmy, what are we going to do together?"
00:35:58,00:36:00,"Sorry, OK, no, mind."
00:36:00,00:36:01,Too crude. Too crude.
00:36:01,00:36:06,"There was another one, there's a book by Elise Avedek"
00:36:06,00:36:10,"called Roland und Elisabeth, which came out in 1851,"
00:36:10,00:36:14,and in that they say that every evening a new picture is added to the wallpaper.
00:36:14,00:36:18,"This is before Christmas, and the children know then when all 24 pictures"
00:36:18,00:36:21,"are hanging on the wallpaper, then Christmas is here."
00:36:21,00:36:24,Right. So that was a thing in this book from the 1850s.
00:36:24,00:36:29,"And quite like Elise Avedek, she basically was a deaconess."
00:36:29,00:36:32,And she started this group of women who would organise
00:36:32,00:36:35,like all the charity and stuff in the area.
00:36:35,00:36:36,She was really awesome.
00:36:36,00:36:38,"And she had a motto, which was every person,"
00:36:38,00:36:43,"whether man or woman should learn as much and for as long as he or she can,"
00:36:43,00:36:45,one can never learn too much.
00:36:45,00:36:47,"OK. I think it's our kind of thing, isn't it?"
00:36:47,00:36:49,"Yeah, definitely. What's her name again?"
00:36:49,00:36:51,She's called Elise Avedek.
00:36:51,00:36:54,"I don't know if it's because we're doing a Christmas flow,"
00:36:54,00:36:56,"but every time you say that, in my head I'm going,"
00:36:56,00:37:01,"Elise Avedek, Elise Avedek, which is the Spanish Christmas."
00:37:01,00:37:03,Elise Avedek. OK.
00:37:03,00:37:05,"Oh, yay!"
00:37:05,00:37:07,It just scans in my head.
00:37:07,00:37:11,"The advent calendars have gone really stratospheric in the last few years,"
00:37:11,00:37:14,"I think there have been all, I mean, extreme novelty ones."
00:37:14,00:37:17,"So this year, you can get a sriracha advent calendar."
00:37:17,00:37:21,"Oh, nice. Which is marketed as the 12 days of sriracha."
00:37:21,00:37:26,"But then, surely, everything is just the same flavour of sriracha every time, though."
00:37:26,00:37:29,"James, I'm here to tell you you're wrong, wrong, wrong."
00:37:29,00:37:32,"Because it has 12 200 millilitre bottles of sriracha,"
00:37:32,00:37:35,which apparently you're getting through one of these things a day.
00:37:35,00:37:36,Really?
00:37:36,00:37:41,"Original mayo, yellow chilli, green chilli, wasabi, blackout, super hot,"
00:37:41,00:37:47,"extra garlic, smoky, black pepper, tikka and yuzu srirachas are available."
00:37:47,00:37:50,"And if you drink one of those every day, you will die."
00:37:50,00:37:52,LAUGHTER
00:37:52,00:37:53,Wow.
00:37:53,00:37:56,"Or if this one was a counteract, the product placement we were doing there."
00:37:56,00:37:59,"OK, well, are you hoping that you might get some free sriracha?"
00:37:59,00:38:01,"I actually don't really, I don't especially like sriracha,"
00:38:01,00:38:03,I don't know why I brought it up.
00:38:03,00:38:07,"Well, I was going to tell you about the 2017 Porsche advent calendar."
00:38:07,00:38:08,Oh!
00:38:08,00:38:11,That cost one million dollars each.
00:38:11,00:38:12,Wow.
00:38:12,00:38:15,There was only one allowed on each continent on Earth.
00:38:15,00:38:19,"But it was 1.75 metres in height, it was made from aluminium,"
00:38:19,00:38:25,it contained a gold watch designed by Porsche.
00:38:25,00:38:28,It supposedly contained a kitchen.
00:38:28,00:38:32,"But it's definitely not big enough, so maybe a voucher for a kitchen?"
00:38:32,00:38:33,I'm not really sure.
00:38:33,00:38:38,It had a voucher possibly as well for a yacht in there.
00:38:38,00:38:42,Also some sunglasses made from gold and some cuff links.
00:38:42,00:38:46,"Hang on, who are you handing this yacht voucher to?"
00:38:46,00:38:48,I love the idea of just like being a Tesco.
00:38:48,00:38:52,Do you have any vouchers to redeem against your transaction today?
00:38:52,00:38:54,"Yes, I've got this for one yacht, please."
00:38:54,00:38:56,LAUGHTER
00:38:56,00:38:57,So funny.
00:38:57,00:39:00,"I know, I'm telling you this, can you get all that stuff?"
00:39:00,00:39:01,"But how big is it, did you say?"
00:39:01,00:39:03,It was 1.75 metres.
00:39:03,00:39:06,"At least two of the seven things you named were vouchers,"
00:39:06,00:39:11,"and one was a wristwatch, so where's the size coming in here?"
00:39:11,00:39:14,"The sunglasses, the cuff links?"
00:39:14,00:39:15,No.
00:39:15,00:39:17,Was there a Porsche? Did you get a Porsche?
00:39:17,00:39:19,It didn't seem that way from what I saw.
00:39:19,00:39:20,That's a bit fucking disappointing.
00:39:20,00:39:23,"Like, you're getting a fucking yacht!"
00:39:23,00:39:26,"You're paying a million pounds for this,"
00:39:26,00:39:29,and you're not getting the feet that it's named after.
00:39:29,00:39:31,Do you know how much yachts cost a lot more than a million pounds?
00:39:31,00:39:33,"Yeah, but when do you use a yacht?"
00:39:33,00:39:35,When do you use a yacht?
00:39:35,00:39:37,You use cars every day.
00:39:37,00:39:38,A yacht?
00:39:38,00:39:40,You can't drive your kid to school in a yacht.
00:39:40,00:39:42,"Exactly, depends where you live."
00:39:42,00:39:43,"If you live on an archipelago,"
00:39:43,00:39:46,you absolutely can drive your kid to school in a yacht.
00:39:46,00:39:49,"I've been to some floating islands where people live,"
00:39:49,00:39:51,"and the school is a floating island,"
00:39:51,00:39:53,"and they definitely didn't use a yacht, I must admit."
00:39:53,00:39:56,They use more of a wicker boat.
00:39:56,00:40:00,"Well, imagine how impressive a yacht would look next to that."
00:40:00,00:40:04,"Anyway, if Portia wants to send me one of those, then I will accept it."
00:40:04,00:40:08,It's estimated that there are twice as many advent calendars for pets
00:40:08,00:40:10,than there are with pictures of Jesus on them.
00:40:10,00:40:13,"God, who really? No."
00:40:13,00:40:16,"Well, this is an estimate that has been made by a man"
00:40:16,00:40:20,who is the founder of one of Britain's explicitly Christian advent calendars.
00:40:20,00:40:23,"He reckons there are 400,000 Jesus ones sold each year,"
00:40:23,00:40:26,and over a million pet advent calendars.
00:40:26,00:40:28,I did read a story about a lady who bought her daughter
00:40:28,00:40:31,"a Garfield advent calendar and 11 days in,"
00:40:31,00:40:35,after she was complaining every day that the chocolate tastes a bit funky.
00:40:35,00:40:39,I realize that it was an advent calendar for her cat.
00:40:39,00:40:44,"For 11 days, her child was like, ""Wah!"""
00:40:44,00:40:48,"And she even looked at it, I think, and was like,"
00:40:48,00:40:50,"""Oh, it's green. It must be mint flavored."""
00:40:50,00:40:52,I don't know.
00:40:52,00:40:55,"OK, that is it. That is all of our facts."
00:40:55,00:40:56,Thank you so much for listening.
00:40:56,00:40:58,If you would like to get in contact with any of us
00:40:58,00:41:00,"about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,"

00:41:26,00:41:28,It's going to be awesome shows.
00:41:28,00:41:31,"There's eight more of them to go, so do come along."
00:41:31,00:41:35,"And before we wrap up tonight, just to let you know here at Birmingham,"
00:41:35,00:41:37,"it's quite a sad night for us,"
00:41:37,00:41:42,because the effectively fifth fish member of our tour is leaving us.
00:41:42,00:41:44,This is his final show tonight.
00:41:44,00:41:46,This is Ash Gardner.
00:41:46,00:41:49,"Ash, you will know in the background of NoSuchThing as a fish."
00:41:49,00:41:54,"He is the singer and writer of our theme tune, which is called Wasps."
00:41:54,00:41:57,"When you hear that, go check it out on Spotify."
00:41:57,00:42:00,"There's a full album by MPRES, and that's where we got our theme tune from."
00:42:00,00:42:02,"When we started as a podcast,"
00:42:02,00:42:05,he was the person who gave us the gear in order to record it
00:42:05,00:42:09,and taught us how to press play and how to do it all genuinely.
00:42:09,00:42:10,We used his stuff.
00:42:10,00:42:12,"When we first decided to do a live show,"
00:42:12,00:42:16,he was the guy who came and mic'd up the whole room and worked out how we could do it
00:42:16,00:42:18,so that could get out there.
00:42:18,00:42:20,He's fed us facts the whole way through.
00:42:20,00:42:21,He's been on every single tour with us.
00:42:21,00:42:25,"He's been the person that's basically been our emotional crutch for the tour,"
00:42:25,00:42:27,always making us happy.
00:42:27,00:42:28,Just such an awesome guy.
00:42:28,00:42:29,This is his last night.
00:42:29,00:42:32,So we're going to close the show tonight by having him come on stage
00:42:32,00:42:36,and sing the theme tune for you as we end the night.
00:42:36,00:42:39,"Yeah, we're missing him so much."
00:42:39,00:42:42,He's really just beating hard with our tour.
00:42:42,00:42:45,It's going to be horrible to do it without him.
00:42:45,00:42:46,But fuck him.
00:42:46,00:42:50,"He's moving to Australia, so tough luck."
00:42:50,00:42:51,"Anyway, that is it."
00:42:51,00:42:52,That is all of our facts.
00:42:52,00:42:54,We'll be back again next week.
00:42:54,00:42:54,We'll see you.
00:42:54,00:42:57,"Thank you so much, Bernie, and that is awesome."
00:42:57,00:42:59,We'll catch you next time.
00:42:59,00:43:00,Here we go.
00:43:00,00:43:06,"Ash Garner, get the music up."
00:43:18,00:43:19,"What's up, girls?"
00:43:19,00:43:21,Can we turn that up?
00:43:21,00:43:21,Crank it.
00:43:21,00:43:26,"Oh, we're going right through the chorus."
00:43:26,00:43:27,Let's not escape.
00:43:27,00:43:40,"They'll move from hive to hive, leaving nothing alive."
00:43:40,00:43:45,"So it's time to get together, show what we can do."
00:43:45,00:43:49,"You hold on to me, and I'll hold on to you."
00:43:49,00:43:54,"It's time to get together, show what we can do."
00:43:54,00:44:00,"You hold on to me, and I'll hold on to you."
00:44:00,00:44:02,"Thank you, guys."
00:44:02,00:44:03,Take care.
00:44:03,00:44:05,See you next time.
