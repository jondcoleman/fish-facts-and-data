00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.500
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.080
 (upbeat music)

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.420
 (audience cheering)

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.620
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.260
 of No Such Day As A Fish, a weekly podcast.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.920
 This week, "Conte Drive" from Burma!

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.920
 (audience cheering)

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.860
 (upbeat music)

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.360
 My name is Dan Schriver, I am sitting here

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.640
 with Anna Tyshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.700
 and James Harkin, and once again,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.180
 we have gathered 'round the microphones this time

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.800
 for our Christmas special, yeah!

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.480
 (audience cheering)

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.180
 And once again, we have gathered 'round

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.760
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.160
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.400
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.280
 Okay, my fact this week is that the song,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.920
 when the red, red robin goes bobb, bobb, bobbin along,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.080
 is actually about a thrush.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.480
 (audience laughing)

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.480
 - But thrush didn't rhyme with bobbin?

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.360
 (laughing)

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.880
 - It could be rushing along, couldn't he?

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.560
 - Should have been rushing along.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.800
 - It is an American song, the red, red robin

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.120
 goes bobb, bobb, bobbin along, I don't know

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.880
 if you guys know it, when the red, red robin

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.040
 goes bobb, bobb, bobbin along.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.840
 It was written about the American robin,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.260
 whose Latin name is Turdus migratorius.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.960
 (audience laughing)

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.440
 And as every childish person knows,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.480
 the Latin word Turdus means thrush.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.520
 And it's called a robin, that bird,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.440
 because when the early migrants got to America,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.720
 it has a red breast and it reminded them

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.040
 of the European robin.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.880
 - Right.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.160
 - And so a lot of American songs,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.560
 like rockin' robin, for instance, is the same.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.160
 All these songs are actually about thrushes.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.040
 - So technically it should also be Batman and thrush.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.720
 (audience laughing)

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.920
 Well that's another story of Batman's medical problems.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.800
 - That is actually true, 'cause Robin was,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.200
 in some versions of the early Batman and Robin comics,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 he is named Robin 'cause he was born

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.960
 on the first day of spring.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.680
 And the American Robin is associated with spring.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.240
 So these songs, the red, red robin,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.680
 these are springtime songs, they're not Christmas songs.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.520
 - Yeah, okay, cool, wow.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.800
 - It's better looking than our thrush, isn't it?

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.080
 I mean, the red breast does make a big difference.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.960
 - Yeah, it's a nice bird, nice looking bird.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.360
 It's like, it looks like, you know,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.200
 if you think about your classic European robin,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.720
 it's quite fat and round and it's got a red breast.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.960
 The American one is a bit more proud looking,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.960
 it's a bit bigger, it's got a slightly longer neck,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.720
 but it still has the red color.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.280
 And it's the most abundant bird in North America, apparently.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.120
 - Is it?

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.640
 - Yeah, it's all over the bloody place.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.000
 Although they're not shyer than our robins.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 The robin that we know is the European robin,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.800
 but in Britain, it's way more cocky and confident

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.280
 than all over the rest of Europe.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.120
 - Really?

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.600
 - Yeah, and this is just because

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.320
 we actually like robins so much.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.280
 So in Europe, it's much more common to hunt robins

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.280
 and, or has been historically,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.000
 and they're not kind of treasured as much

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.520
 as this kind of Christmas symbol.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.080
 So they're way shyer.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.600
 And similarly in America, these guys,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.400
 they hide in the woods, whereas our robins,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.880
 you know, they chase you around the garden

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.720
 when you're digging out worms.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.800
 - Yeah, of course, yeah.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.520
 Do you know why they do that?

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520
 - To get the worms you're digging out?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.240
 - Well, yes, but it's because, basically,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.680
 they think you're a pig.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.520
 So...

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.360
 - What?

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.200
 - So what?

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.840
 - Joanna said all that nice stuff about robins.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.720
 - Well, it's not reciprocated.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.400
 Robins basically evolve to follow wild boar

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.600
 around forests.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.440
 - What do they do?

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.760
 - They truffle up food, don't they?

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.080
 They dig for their food,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.400
 and they will overturn a lot of earth

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.840
 and they'll reveal lots of earthworms.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.520
 So, you know, it thinks you're a pig and a boar.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.360
 Yeah.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.840
 (audience laughing)

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.200
 - I've got to say, who have offended?

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.840
 - Is it really bad at telling the difference

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.040
 between species, then?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.840
 - I'm exaggerating a little for comic effect.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.440
 I don't know about its eyesight.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.880
 It has got good eyesight, hasn't it?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.600
 Or sort of something special about its eyes

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.320
 that it can navigate?

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.640
 - Michael Titan there, perhaps, I reckon.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.480
 - Yeah.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.320
 - 'Cause they...

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.640
 - I think that's probably the American ones,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.960
 'cause they migrate quite a lot

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.800
 down there, the American ones.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.640
 - Okay.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.480
 - They do.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.920
 You almost never see them here,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.560
 but did you read about the...

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.680
 I think one of the last times

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.200
 that American robin was seen in the UK

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.680
 was in 2004,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.240
 and it was one of these.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.080
 It was blown over the Atlantic,

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.560
 so it got lost on a migration.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.880
 (audience laughing)

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.120
 - That's a hell of a puff, isn't it,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.720
 to get you over the Atlantic?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.320
 - It was a gusty day.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.520
 And it...

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.520
 So it turned up in Grimsby,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.680
 and there was huge excitement.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.520
 - Oh, God.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.040
 I mean, your face bad enough, isn't it?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.320
 (audience laughing)

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.680
 You end up in Grimsby.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.520
 (audience laughing)

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.680
 - That's a bad hangover.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.760
 What did I do last night?

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.160
 And the Twitchers, as they do, got very excited

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.440
 and all communicated with each other to say,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.960
 "Come on, come on, see this American robin.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.600
 "It's so rare to see them here."

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.520
 And they all arrived just in time

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.360
 to see it get eaten by a sparrow hawk.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.680
 (audience laughing)

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.320
 - Oh, poor thing.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.160
 I love that...

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.520
 I didn't know it was called turd migratus.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.680
 - Turdus, yeah.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.520
 - Turdus.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.360
 - Not turd migratus.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.520
 - Turdus migratus.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.360
 Turdus. - Turdus.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.200
 - It still works nicely.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.200
 - It's a very, very lazy Harry Potter spell, basically.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.040
 (audience laughing)

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.320
 - If you're a bit constipated,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.160
 is that what you do?

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.840
 (audience laughing)

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.800
 - Oh, if you hear that in the stall, yeah, next to you.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.080
 - Turdus migratus.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.880
 (audience laughing)

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.720
 - Yeah.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.720
 (audience laughing)

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.240
 - I would have thought exbellianus

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.560
 would have been the better.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.560
 (audience cheering)

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.560
 - Okay, so on the word turdus,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.000
 the word sturdy,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.400
 that supposedly comes from the Latin for thrush.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.020
 That's supposed to come from turdus as well.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.440
 And the idea was,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.880
 if a thrush would eat lots of berries,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.360
 it might get drunk.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.480
 And it would kind of sway around and sway around.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.440
 And so turdy meant swaying.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.040
 And then sturdy came from non-drunk thrushes, yeah.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.320
 That's according to the Oxford English Dictionary,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.280
 who I must say, I don't believe.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.120
 (audience laughing)

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.960
 There is a French saying, which is as drunk as a thrush,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.040
 which gives a little bit of credence to it, so.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.200
 - They are the most prone to get drunk

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.240
 on fermented berries, I think, aren't they?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.320
 - They are the American rubies.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.160
 - Rubbies?

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.160
 That's what I called them, we're close.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.800
 And it happens, so it tends to happen in spring,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.080
 but it can actually happen in autumn,

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.600
 so basically it'll happen when the berries have frozen,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.560
 and so when frost hits them,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.800
 then they'll start converting their starch to sugars.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.760
 Then I think when they thaw, then that starts fermenting.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.640
 And then they get eaten, and then they do funny things,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.920
 like crashing to each other or fall off branches.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.960
 But in Minnesota, in October, a couple of years ago,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.560
 there was an early frost that caused a big outbreak of this,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.040
 and the police were called so many times

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.880
 that they actually had to put on a report out,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.280
 saying there's no need to report drunk robins to the police.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.360
 They will sober up within a short period of time

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.800
 and get over their lives.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800
 (audience laughing)

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.400
 - I read a really lovely story.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.200
 In India, there was a species, a type of robin,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.640
 that had made its way into the electrical box

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.000
 of a very tiny town.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.880
 So there's about 150 people that live in this town,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.280
 and this box would be turned on every night

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.960
 at 6 p.m. by one guy.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.240
 And so he noticed that a robin,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.520
 this species, a robin had laid eggs

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.280
 and was using this electrical circuit board as its nest.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.720
 So he wrote on a WhatsApp group

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.960
 to all of the people in the village saying,

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.360
 "Is it cool if we don't turn on the street lights

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.480
 at night time until they've hatched

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.000
 and the birds have flown away?"

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.920
 And the whole village all agreed.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.480
 And so for over 35 days, they had no lights at night,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.800
 just to make sure that these little birds were born properly,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.960
 and then they flew away,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.760
 and then he started turning them on again.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.840
 - That is a nice story.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.000
 - Did they have lots of traffic incidents?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.440
 - There was, yeah, 90 fatalities.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.960
 (audience laughing)

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.680
 - Robins live really short lives most of the time,

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.920
 so they live for about 13 months.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.520
 Very, very high mortality rate in their first year.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.240
 But if they're through that,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.680
 they stand a very good chance of surviving for a lot longer.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.800
 So the oldest ever robin known

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.360
 was recorded as being, it was ringed,

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.840
 you know, with a ring around its foot or whatever.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.280
 It was 19 years and four months.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.120
 - Oh my God!

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.360
 - Imagine if there were people just walking around

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.320
 who were 1,000 years old and they'd just got lucky.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.160
 - Oh my God!

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.240
 - Yeah, that's what it's like for robins.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.080
 - When he said ringed,

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.920
 I thought he meant we cut it in half every year

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.760
 and count the rings.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.600
 (audience laughing)

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.240
 - It was amazingly hardy, yeah.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.560
 (audience laughing)

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.560
 This fact is about the fact that a robin

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.720
 is actually a thrush and a misnamed bird,

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.760
 and it's a Christmas bird.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.720
 That we're talking about.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.720
 And so I started looking into other Christmas birds.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.420
 And it turns out a lot of them are misnamed as well.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.160
 So one of the great songs that we have,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.080
 the first day of Christmas, my true,

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.320
 we have a bunch of birds in that song, don't we, right?

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.360
 So, okay, turtle doves.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.880
 Turtle doves are given everything.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.240
 So we think that they're called turtle doves

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.360
 because they make a tur tur sounds.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.320
 So that's the turtle.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.520
 So as the article points out,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.600
 and this is according to a biologist called Pamela Remerson,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.000
 no relation to turtles.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.720
 So they're just, they're...

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.240
 (audience laughing)

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.280
 - This is your facts?

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.960
 The doves are not related to turtles.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.560
 - Turtle doves, zero relation to turtles.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.720
 And myth busted.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.040
 (audience laughing)

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.320
 French hens, there's three French hens in it.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.240
 - Oh my God.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.600
 - They're probably from France,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.400
 but they're not actually a species called French hen.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.760
 That doesn't exist, so myth busted.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.240
 Second one down, calling birds.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.520
 That sounds interesting, doesn't exist.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.840
 We don't have calling birds.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.960
 What they're probably talking about is for collie birds.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.960
 And we just misunderstood that.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.560
 We've called them calling birds.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.400
 Andy, myth busted.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.720
 - A collie bird is like a blackbird, right?

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.280
 Is it an old word for black?

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.120
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.080
 - It's called collet, right?

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.320
 Partridge in a pear tree.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.320
 They're ground birds.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.120
 They're never seen in trees.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.960
 (audience laughing)

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960
 That is good, actually.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.960
 You say the best of luck.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.040
 Myth busted.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.440
 - You do see the odd partridge in a tree, to be fair.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.800
 But they don't nest in trees.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.200
 - Are they drunk?

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.040
 - Only when they're pissed.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.440
 They're like the opposite of all other birds.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.480
 They fall up trees when they're drunk.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.040
 (audience laughing)

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.640
 - The song "When the Red Red Dropping"

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.320
 goes bob bob bobbing along.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.640
 Really quickly on that.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.400
 It was written in 1926, or 1925.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.920
 By 1926, it was a hit for Whispering Jack Smith,

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.480
 Cliff Edwards, Paul Whiteman,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.600
 the Ipanama Troubadours, and Al Jolson.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.120
 In the same year, it was a hit for all those people.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.000
 - Wow.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.400
 - And it's not like one of those, you know,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.760
 when you get a rap song and you've got

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.160
 20 different rappers on it,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.840
 they all did their own version of it.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.680
 - That's amazing.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.040
 What was the first one called?

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.000
 - It was Whispering Jack Smith.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.240
 - That sounds terrifying.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.320
 (audience laughing)

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.720
 "When the Red Red Dropping" goes bob bobbing along.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.960
 - It was most famous by Boddlestar, William Roth.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.240
 She's the most famous one who sang it.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.360
 And she sang it when she was really young,

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.200
 when she was about 14 or 15.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.320
 And then she became not famous anymore.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.480
 And then later on, she went on This Is Your Life,

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.680
 and she kind of was really honest about her alcoholism.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.640
 And she got more than 40,000 letters

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.120
 when she went on This Is Your Life.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.880
 She wrote not a biography.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.440
 And then it got turned into a movie starring Susan Hayward.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.960
 And that was nominated for an Academy Award.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.080
 So, 'cause her life was so amazing.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.640
 And then when she kind of went on This Is Your Life,

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.120
 she became famous again.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.800
 And she had a huge sort of revival.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.160
 She went on Broadway and did her own song.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.720
 And the highlight of her act was singing

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.000
 when the Red Red Robin came bob bobbing along.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.040
 But she sang it in the style of the person

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.880
 who played her in the movie, doing an impression of her.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.040
 - Jesus.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.880
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.720
 - That's sad.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.760
 - You probably know the song most

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.840
 because I know you go to Charlton Athletic every now and then,

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.400
 and that's what they sing.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.160
 - Is that what they're trying to sing?

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.560
 (audience laughing)

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.280
 Jesus Christ.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.080
 Really, are they doing it in the style of this woman?

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.160
 Do they get in the style of her?

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.640
 - I think the dog is doing it in the style of some other bird.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.480
 - Wow.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.560
 Did you guys read that there's a type of thrush

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.000
 that gets its prey to come to the top of the surface

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.600
 by farting on the ground?

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.960
 - What if it looms worms towards it?

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.200
 - Yeah, it just gets down and it just starts farting.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.560
 - What do the worms think of this thing?

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.080
 - I think you know that thing where it's kind of like,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.760
 it feels like it's rain and it's coming up

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.960
 and they hear vibrations and they come up.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.160
 It turns out anyway, it's not true.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.520
 (audience laughing)

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.280
 - Dan, can I do the others?

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.600
 - Myth busted.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.880
 (audience laughing)

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.720
 - Thank you, Andy.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.720
 - It is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.560
 - My fact is that nobody knows

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.160
 where Caravaggio's most Christmassy painting is,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.240
 but the main theory is that it was eaten by pigs

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.840
 in the 1970s.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.760
 (audience laughing)

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.640
 This is a painting, so Caravaggio's extremely famous

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.120
 16th century artist, 16th, early 17th,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.600
 and he painted a painting called

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.880
 "The Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence"

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.000
 and it was stolen.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.880
 It was in a church in Palermo in Italy

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.080
 and it had been there for nearly 400 years.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.480
 It was incredibly well established there.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.720
 And in 1969, it was nicked by persons unknown.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.000
 It's worth, obviously, millions and millions.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.640
 There are not that many Caravaggio's

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.320
 and no one knows where it is to this day.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.800
 It was cut from its frame and there are rumors

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.720
 about where it is, so some people say it's in Switzerland,

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.800
 some people say there's no way it ever left Italy,

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.160
 there was no international gossip

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.480
 about where it might have ended up,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.440
 but one mafia informer claimed

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.280
 that it had been damaged in an earthquake

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.360
 and then just left it alone for a bit

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.840
 and then gnawed on by rats and pigs

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.840
 until it was completely worthless and then they burned it.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.240
 - Wow, weird. - We don't know, but yeah.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.760
 - It seems very odd, this habit that all these mafia members,

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.600
 it's the Cousin Ostra, isn't it?

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.440
 Members have of admitting to stealing the painting

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.040
 and then telling the story of the painting

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.680
 and you never know if they're telling the truth

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.920
 and I think so these are like pentitos

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.960
 who go to the police and say, "Oh, I've been in the mafia

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.040
 "and I'm really sorry about it

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.520
 "and I'll tell you where this nativity painting is."

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.640
 And I think the latest person is Guy Tano Grado

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.880
 who said he helped to steal the painting

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.880
 and then it somehow got into the hands of a mafia boss

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.800
 who took it to a Swiss art dealer

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.080
 and I just like the scene, the dealer wept when he saw it

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.280
 'cause it's such a beautiful, unbelievable painting.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.480
 It's a Caravaggio, so the dealer burst and the tears sobbed

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.800
 and then immediately said, "We need to cut this into pieces

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.560
 "so we can sell them discreetly

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.440
 "otherwise people will know what it is."

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.560
 - Right, so what do you do, do you buy up all the pieces

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.040
 and put them together like a jigsaw?

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.400
 - Yeah, it's not like that.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.520
 - I don't realise how fucking dangerous pigs are.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:50.640
 Top tip, don't die next to a pig, it will eat you.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.840
 - Yeah, but watch your dad, it doesn't really matter to him.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.520
 - I know, but like if you were even in the process of dying

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.840
 and you happened to fall next to a pig, you're a goner.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.000
 - Yep, absolutely.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.320
 - And the Robin will watch from the side and laugh.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.600
 - Well, to him, it's like a pig's eating a pig.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.920
 It's like cannibalism.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.160
 - Cannibalism, it'll look like.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.400
 No, seriously, last few years, just the headlines.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.280
 2020, missing Polish farmer,

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.360
 eaten by his own pigs, officials say.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:18.040
 2019, woman eaten by a pig after she collapses while feeding.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.640
 Basically, if you fall near a pig and you're asleep,

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.840
 it will eat you. - It's quite famous that, I think.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.480
 Like, is it Hannibal? - Is it a Hannibal book?

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.160
 - Yeah, you've got to watch Hannibal, it's great.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.320
 Most things of that scene, where you're eaten by pigs,

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.920
 it's a documentary about how it's very easy to get eaten by pigs

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.560
 if you're not careful.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.080
 - It's funny, because pigs do have a reputation

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.240
 for being very intelligent and quite friendly.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.120
 They do, don't they? Like, babe.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.440
 Yeah, like, babe.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.920
 - You've got to watch... - Like, babe, drink, yeah.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.600
 - Babe, drink, but babe eats the farmer, yeah.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.280
 - Is that all dope, pig?

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.240
 - Do you guys know pig casso?

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.440
 - No. - Just speaking of art and pig,

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.880
 he's the first non-human to hold his own exhibition.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.640
 Art exhibition. - Really?

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.440
 - Yeah. Born in 2016.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.720
 - I mean, when we say "hold" his own art exhibition,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.840
 did he book the venue? - Yes.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.000
 - Did he do the catering? God, I can't imagine the catering, actually.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.200
 - He did all the admin.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.280
 He finds it difficult to hold the phone, but he's overcoming it.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.080
 No, he was born in 2016.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.280
 He was one of these people who was rescued and taken to a sanctuary

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.120
 that was set up by this woman called Joanne Lebson

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.320
 in South Africa.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.800
 And she said the reason that he became a famous painter,

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.320
 as he is now, is that she put him in a pen with loads and loads of stuff,

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.920
 and he ate or destroyed everything in the stool,

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.320
 except that paintbrushes.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.040
 And so she deduced from that that he must love art.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.200
 (LAUGHTER)

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.360
 He's since become a painter.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.880
 He designed Swatches 2019 Swatch Design, which is called Flying Pig,

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.880
 and it's lots of purple and pink swirls.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.360
 - Did they not find, like, a work of art

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.120
 and then maybe the shoes of an artist

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.120
 that he just eats and the rest of the artist?

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.960
 (LAUGHTER)

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.280
 - It could be that.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.200
 - Does he draw with a pig pen?

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.680
 (AUDIENCE GASPS)

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.200
 - Don't boo that!

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.720
 - What's the... - It's Christmas!

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.560
 - It's Christmas! I'm sorry, I've ruined Christmas.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.160
 - Shall we talk about Caravaggio? - I think we better.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.560
 - Caravaggio, he was a bit of a badden, wasn't he?

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.000
 He was a bit of a badden.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.480
 In 1604, the year, variously, he was arrested for assaulting a waiter

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:28.280
 who had served him with a plate of artichokes dressed in butter rather than oil,

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.440
 for throwing stones in the street next to a perfume maker and some prostitutes,

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.480
 and for telling a policeman who was attempting to release him quietly,

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.560
 even though he was carrying a sword, which he wasn't supposed to,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.320
 you can stick it up your arse.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.320
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.440
 - Right.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.480
 - You've given very one-sided story there.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.400
 I'm quite a fan of Caravaggio, and the artichoke story, for example,

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.520
 was sort of justifiable. It was a test.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.160
 So it was... He ordered eight artichokes for lunch,

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.160
 and he ordered four to be fried in oil and four to be fried in butter.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.960
 The artichokes arrived, and then he asked the waiter,

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.680
 "Well, which of the four fried in oil?"

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.720
 And the waiter couldn't tell.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.040
 - And then he picked up his sword, he had attacked the waiter,

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.040
 and then got a plate and smashed him in the face with it.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.200
 - There's no excuse for bad service, James.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.200
 (LAUGHTER)

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.360
 - The waiter was always right.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.800
 - Speaking of bad service, he killed a man after a game of tennis,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.520
 didn't he? - Did he?

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.720
 - Yeah, that's one of the most famous things about him.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.920
 So he had to leave Rome when he killed his opponent in a game of tennis.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.520
 Now, we think possibly it wasn't because of the tennis

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.200
 that he did this murder, and we think possibly

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.320
 he might not have been deliberately trying to kill the man.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.320
 He might have only been trying to cut off his testicles.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320
 - Right.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.720
 - You're all right. My client was merely trying to cut off

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.440
 this man's testicles with his sword.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.440
 - New balls, please.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.440
 (LAUGHTER)

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.440
 - Very strong.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.960
 Yeah, it's very unclear, because they were having an argument

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.920
 about a woman who was maybe one of Caravaggio's models,

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.120
 but was also a prostitute, but was also working for the opponent.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.720
 This man, Tomassini, was it?

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.440
 - Yeah, so Tomassini was the pimp of this woman.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.440
 - Yes.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.440
 - But also, when you're an artist, it was illegal for someone to sit for you,

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.120
 especially naked, unless they were a prostitute, unless you were paying them.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.640
 And so, basically, most of the artists around that time

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.120
 were employing prostitutes to, or sex workers, I should say, to sit for them.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.240
 And so, there was obviously something happening here.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.760
 We weren't quite sure.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.640
 The woman was called Faleed Melendroni,

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.520
 and there's not much else about her.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.120
 She was once called a scandalous courtesan

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.480
 by the vicariat of Rome, no less, for refusing the sacrament.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.640
 And later that year, she was arrested for possessing a weapon.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.440
 So, she was a bit of a baddler, as well.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.880
 - If that's the most scandalous thing you're doing, as a prostitute,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.280
 refusing the sacrament, then I think you've got to up your game.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.080
 - He was a very, very naughty boy, Caravaggio.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.080
 No, he was.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.560
 No, we shouldn't be glamourising it, because he was a ron.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.560
 He was a rogue.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.560
 There was a film. There's a film made about his life in 1986,

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.760
 in which Sean Bean, it's one of Sean Bean's very earliest films,

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.560
 he plays the guy Caravaggio had a deal with, Ranuccio Tomassoni.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.360
 And that is also notable, because it's the first time

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.800
 that Sean Bean died onscreen.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.640
 - Oh, no way! - Yes!

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.160
 - Really? - Sean Bean has had a lot of screen deaths, if you don't know.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.720
 Sean Bean has been impaled on an anchor.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.280
 He's been stabbed. He's fallen off an antenna.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.640
 He's been buried alive and then died.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.840
 He's been hanged.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.920
 He's been shot through the neck with a grappling hook,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.240
 and then hanged.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.160
 He's been torn into quarters by horses,

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.320
 decapitated and shot ten times.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.280
 - Well, he's hard. He's a hard man, had he come back from all those things. - He's a hard man, had he come back from all those things.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.480
 He's still swinging, but he's not the actor who's died most in films.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.840
 - This is diversion now, but... - Uh-huh.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.120
 - Danny, is it Trejo? - Yeah, I'm machete-y.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.280
 - Machete, yeah. - He's died 65 times in different films.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.440
 - Has he? - Yeah, he has been killed by topless prostitutes

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.560
 in two separate films.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:09.080
 Wow, that's typecasting, starting to exert its baleful influence, I'm afraid.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.360
 You know, he invented really incredible lighting for paintings,

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.120
 and two people have been massively influenced by it.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.120
 David Hockney talks about it, saying he basically invented Hollywood lighting.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.400
 It was just... It was in one direction, and he believes that he used...

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.840
 - It was in one direction? - Yeah, he was multi-talented.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.040
 He was... Yeah, he was a very influential character.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:34.120
 He supposedly... He would use mirrors to sort of bend light towards,

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.480
 and Martin Scorsese, when he would see his paintings,

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:42.040
 was... A lot of Scorsese's movies, he says, were influenced by the lighting

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.440
 that he saw in Caravaggio's paintings, and he's convinced that if he was in modern times,

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.280
 he would have been one of our great directors, purely for that,

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.760
 purely for his understanding of light and composure.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.800
 Yeah, but it was particularly dark. I've always thought they're too dark.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.400
 It always looks like it's not very well lit in galleries, I think.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.680
 - I agree. - It's basically 'cause it's all kind of black,

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.320
 except one shaft of light.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.920
 - Yeah, it's like Blade Runner. - Yeah.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.800
 But he did get in trouble once with his landlord.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.520
 In fact, he was evicted because he cut...

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.000
 He was renting a room, and he cut a hole in the ceiling

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.240
 to get that single shaft of light.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.600
 - Cool. - And a lot of landlords hate that.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.480
 Was it in the ceiling? So, Ren could get in.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.160
 - In the roof. - Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.680
 I suppose that's gonna ruin the painting, isn't it?

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.720
 - It didn't make a difference. - But also, he was in a ground floor flat,

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.280
 so he had to do every single thing.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.200
 - Can we move on to the next fact? - Yes, please.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.520
 My fact this week is that Merry Christmas Park in Miami

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.680
 isn't named after the holiday,

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.040
 but after a girl named Mary,

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.040
 who was the daughter of the city's former mayor, Randy Christmas.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.640
 (LAUGHTER)

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.680
 I love that song.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.560
 Have yourself a randy little Christmas.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.320
 We will hear a randy Christmas.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:59.440
 So, Randy Christmas was the mayor of Miami from 1955 to 1957,

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.480
 and he had a little daughter who he named Merry,

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.760
 she felt M-E-R-R-I-E,

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.400
 and Merry, unfortunately, was quite sick when she was born.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.840
 She was born with only one kidney,

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.560
 which she was basically correctly diagnosed with

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.480
 when she was about three years old,

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.480
 and they thought that she wasn't gonna make it, unfortunately.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.880
 And one of the things that Miami wanted to do

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.400
 to sort of talk about, you know, what an amazing and brave girl she was going through,

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.960
 what she was going through, is to name this park after her.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.760
 So, it's a very tiny little park,

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.600
 and she was just, she was an amazing person.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.280
 She continued, she had 12 operations.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.680
 They thought she was only gonna live for a few months,

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.680
 but she had survived 12 more years.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.680
 She used to go to the park once a year, she loved visiting it.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.640
 She would sometimes go to it during Christmas as well

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.640
 to visit Merry Christmas Park, her park, she used to say.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.760
 She sadly passed away,

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.440
 but she did get to experience this park for a long time, yeah.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.560
 And how many disappointed people would show up at the park every day throughout December

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.880
 are going, "Where the hell's Santa Claus?

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.240
 "Why is there a 12-year-old girl here instead?"

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.440
 It's good to look at the story that way as well.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.160
 She's letting a lot of people down.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.800
 Yeah. "Is this your fault, you little dick? What's this?"

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.680
 Get out your wheelchair and look me in the eye.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.360
 Yeah.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.000
 Come on, Anna.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.400
 So, the Christmas family, they said it took them three children

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.400
 for them to get up the nerve to call one of them Merry.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.440
 Oh, really? Although, Merry Christmas did have her sister called Holly,

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.960
 who actually is still around.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.680
 She was posted on the internet in June this year, so she's definitely still alive.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.280
 Some of the other children in the school would tease Merry Christmas

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.120
 and call her Happy New Year.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.920
 LAUGHTER

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.840
 But when she died, she did die very young,

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.920
 but she was so popular that they had to put on buses to get people to the funeral.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.120
 It was an absolutely massive funeral. Oh, wow.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:55.760
 And Randy Christmas's mother was called Leonora Pauline Pope Christmas.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.240
 Her surname was Pope, so Pope married Christmas and had Randy.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.560
 LAUGHTER

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.840
 It seems like it's kind of degrading the family names there, doesn't it?

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.560
 Yeah, and thank God it wasn't double-barrelled,

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.040
 because he could have been Randy Pope Christmas as the mayor of Miami.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:17.000
 Gosh. There was a competition to find the most Christmassy name in the UK in 2017,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.040
 and it was held by the British Christmas Tree Growers Association.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.920
 And there were various great entries.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.640
 The eventual winner was a woman called Donna Rudolph,

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.440
 which is good, because that's two of the reindeer, which is very impressive.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.360
 But other winners included people like Val Spruce, Holly Berry,

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.160
 which I think is really good,

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.000
 Chris Tingley...

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.240
 LAUGHTER

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.840
 That's so great, Christmassy.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.760
 But this is the thing, the prize was a Christmas tree, right?

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.800
 A real Christmas tree, not an artificial one.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.280
 And in her winning speech,

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.840
 Donna Rudolph said she was really happy to win

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.480
 because she'd never had in her whole life a real Christmas tree,

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.880
 and she would be having a real one from now on.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.400
 This is, let's not forget,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.520
 promoted by the British Christmas Tree Growers Association,

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.160
 who I think may have fed her some copy in what she was going to say.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.120
 And the whole thing was to promote real trees.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.280
 But I looked into this a bit further, guys.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.800
 Donna Rudolph lived in Whiz Beach, right?

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.680
 Which was fewer than 10 miles from the place,

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.400
 which actually had the farm,

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.000
 where she collected her Christmas tree farm.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.440
 So, I'm not... Wait a minute, how old was she?

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.640
 I think in her 30s?

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.400
 So, it's not going to be 30 years ago,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.120
 they decided to scab that they were going to name her a weird Christmas name.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.600
 I'm not suggesting her parents named her to get her a free tree in 30 years.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.640
 I'm saying the Christmas tree growers may have picked her

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.960
 because they wanted someone to turn up in person

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.680
 and collect their tree from the farm.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.440
 It's not the biggest thing ever.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.160
 It's not the biggest thing to bust ever.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.840
 It's not Dan Brown, is it?

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.440
 I'm just saying, I think Chris Tingley might have been a bit rock.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.520
 I think Holly Berry. I think Holly Berry is really good, isn't she?

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.920
 That's a great...

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.680
 Anyway, so that's my niche and illegally quite actionable...

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.080
 That's your panorama documentary-style expose there.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.440
 I looked the other way.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.280
 I looked at people who were called "Randy"

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.800
 because I thought, "That's a fun first name, if you pair it up with a surname."

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.800
 So Wikipedia has just a really big list of different people called "Randy."

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.120
 So there's a Randy Baker, there's a Randy Farmer,

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.600
 there's a Randy Gardner, there's Randy Love,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.360
 there's Randy Rogers,

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.200
 Randy Messenger,

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.200
 which sounds like someone who'd slip into your DMs.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.800
 - I like that one. - Yeah.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.680
 And in my favourite one of all, Randy Murray.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.920
 Oh!

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.520
 Do you know anything about Randy Murray?

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.480
 He's a Canadian guitarist.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.480
 He's amazing. He used to be in a band with a guy called Ronald McDonald.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.880
 - No. - No.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.840
 - That's as far as I got into his... - Wow.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.840
 Let's get him on. Out of court replacement, do we think?

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.800
 We don't have to tweet one letter on the posters.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.280
 There was a guy called Alistair Christmas who was born on Christmas Day,

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.280
 which is very exciting.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.920
 He was interviewed by The Daily Mirror,

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.360
 and he said that on at least one occasion in his life

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.520
 someone had refused to hand over a parcel that was for him

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.280
 because they just couldn't possibly believe

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.520
 that his name was Alistair Christmas.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.240
 Which I have to say is quite not especially unbelievable.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.480
 But he said, of his name, when people find out he's called Alistair Christmas,

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:20.680
 "People just see you and look at you as if you were magic.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.440
 "You can see it in their eyes.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.960
 "To them, it is like they have just met Santa."

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.080
 Can I say? The delivery guy, right?

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.640
 He turns up with a parcel for Mr. A. Christmas.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.360
 And then the guy comes out and says, "I'm Mr. A. Christmas."

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.560
 And then he says, "I don't believe you."

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.480
 - What was he expecting the person to say? - Who's this box for, then?

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.640
 - Exactly. - Yeah, exactly.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.320
 Did he just take it home? I don't know.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.360
 There's the surname Christmas quite common in Essex and Sussex.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.360
 And the theory is that it was probably, you know,

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.200
 people got their surnames in the olden days.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.880
 It was probably someone who was born on Christmas Day.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.280
 That's what we think.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.880
 However, there is a guy called Henry Christmas

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.520
 who is a retired engineer who has spent decades

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.640
 delving into the history of the name.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.360
 And he said in 2005 that the Christmas Day/Christmas connection

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.800
 is too easy.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.680
 But I rather think that he's spent decades doing it

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.680
 and realised that it's actually the obvious thing that everyone thinks.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.120
 - Yeah. - He's got to justify a lifetime wasted.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.120
 - Yeah. - Sorry, Henry.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.960
 Do you guys know about Merry Christmas Clause and Santa Clause?

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.680
 - The Nebraska couple. - No.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.160
 These are two people who legally changed their names in 2017.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.800
 They're so sweet.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.440
 So they won't give their real names to journalists who interviewed them.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.560
 So they are now, the wife is Merry Christmas Clause,

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.040
 the husband is Santa Clause.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.960
 And they go and they dress up.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.760
 They wear their dress reds at Christmas,

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.720
 which is the term for the Santa outfit.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.000
 And for the rest of the year, Santa's a taxi driver.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.760
 And yeah, they just decided they loved being in the mall so much,

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.600
 having kids swarming around them, sitting on their laps and everything,

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.000
 that they've changed their names.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.120
 And it's so sweet.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.080
 They met in December 2009, and she, Merry Christmas Clause,

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.400
 said she knew he was the one when he offered to make me dinner.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.840
 There aren't many men willing to cook a woman dinner.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.600
 I knew I'd found a keeper.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.680
 Which does imply a low bar.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:23.120
 But she then says, "But the pot gets even lower."

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.400
 She said, "What I love about Santa, my husband,

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.680
 "is that he's so great at the kid-friendly jokes at Christmas."

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.880
 So that's kind of, can someone explain this to me?

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.480
 She says, "When the kids ask for iPods,

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.640
 "he says, 'Why an iPod?

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.680
 'Wouldn't you rather have a three-pod?'

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:43.080
 'There's three P's in a pod, but there's only one I in an iPod.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.640
 'The parents roar with laughter over that.'"

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.560
 Does that make sense?

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.200
 I think, what does that mean, kind of?

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.840
 I'm not, look, I made a pig-ped joke earlier.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.400
 I'm not going to slag off this guy.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.800
 He's doing his best.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.080
 He's doing his best.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.920
 Wow. We're ignoring one very famous Christmas,

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.040
 it was a fictional Christmas.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.560
 Christmas Jones, Bond character.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.040
 Yes. Oh, here's that.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.560
 In the world. The Pierce Brosnan flake, wasn't it?

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.040
 That was one of the Pierce Brosnan ones.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.640
 Denise Richards, who's a nuclear physicist character.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.320
 And it's basically, so there are a load of really,

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.360
 really sort of cheap tacky gags, you know,

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.160
 James Bond says, "Ugh, I thought Christmas only came once a year.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.320
 "It's had all of this." Really, like, you know.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.800
 It's aged poorly, and it was quite recent.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.280
 So just off the back of this, and this is a tangent,

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:37.480
 I apologize, I thought I'd try and find the worst role

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.960
 that Denise Richards has ever had to play,

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.480
 and I think I've found it, her first starring role

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.040
 was in a film called "Tammy and the T-Rex", OK?

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.280
 Which is a comedy about a girl whose boyfriend,

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.200
 his brain is put into a T-Rex, right?

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.720
 Yeah, I know, I've heard of us.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.680
 OK, so it's a bit niche and a bit cult, but it's...

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.320
 What do you mean it's put into a T-Rex?

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.520
 Like, his consciousness goes into the T-Rex.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.200
 What T-Rex? There is a T-Rex in the film, OK?

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.760
 Well, I'm getting to that, I'm getting to that.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.640
 A mad scientist has created a T-Rex, OK?

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.520
 So this is the thing, I was reading about this film on IMDB,

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.920
 I cannot believe it.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.320
 Basically, listen to this.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.520
 The writer/director Stuart Raffle has said in an interview,

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.080
 "The idea for the film only happened

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.040
 "because they had access to a full-size T-Rex animatronic."

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.200
 Someone phoned him up and said,

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.920
 "Hey, we have this T-Rex for a month, what shall we do?

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.240
 "Shall we make a film?"

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.960
 They said, "I'll start writing immediately."

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.400
 The whole reason for the film

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.400
 is because they had access to this thing for a month.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.800
 He was constantly writing scenes and then saying to his colleagues,

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.560
 "And the cast and crew, do you have any better ideas

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.760
 "for the next scene?"

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.480
 All locations were within 25 minutes of his house.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.640
 It's incredible. Sounds amazing.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.160
 It's such a good film. Wow, yeah.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.320
 Dan will be watching that when he gets home tonight.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.440
 That's what's so sad about this.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.800
 Anyway, tangent over, sorry.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.600
 Hey, listen, I need to move us on to our final fact of the show.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.160
 It is time for our final fact, and that is Anna.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.160
 My fact this week is that the Edible Advent Calendar

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.400
 came before the Printed Picture Advent Calendar.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:11.320
 This is my interpretation of what the first Advent Calendar was,

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.120
 which was Gerhard Lang,

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.480
 who was the first person to print and sell Advent calendars.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.400
 He did it in 1908, and he got his inspiration from his mum,

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:26.920
 who, when he was young, she had a little cardboard box thing

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:31.080
 to which she fixed a baked meringue pastry for each day of Advent,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.280
 and she allowed him to eat one per day.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.600
 Oh, yes. It's so charming.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.880
 Yeah, in fact, it's something called "Wiebele,"

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.400
 which I think is a specific German dish.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.440
 It's a sweet-like meringue, which has a figure of eight shape.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.160
 Yeah, he was inspired by that, and he's the father of the Advent Calendar.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.760
 And then his later Advent calendars were called Munich calendars, weren't they?

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.760
 Yeah.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.520
 And then something in the '30s happened,

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.240
 and he just wasn't very popular anymore outside of Germany.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.240
 Yeah.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.560
 It's really tragic.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.280
 Carmel was rationed in the '30s, and they shut his company down.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.360
 The German government in the '30s, the Nazi government shut...

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:09.160
 Sorry, no one, sort of, you know, concealing that,

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.400
 but the Nazis made their own Advent calendars as well.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.600
 Yeah, well, there was one company, wasn't there,

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.560
 that they accepted that they could make them,

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.240
 but they accepted the company.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.360
 And basically, yeah, if you got an Advent calendar in Nazi Germany,

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.600
 it was just Nazi symbolism.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.600
 Yeah, it was...

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.440
 Another swastika, basically, right?

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.440
 It was like a tank.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.720
 No, no, no, there were tanks.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.040
 There was Wotan, who was a Nordic god.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.760
 It didn't mention Jesus at all,

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.280
 and there was advice on how to keep your children entertained over Christmas.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.320
 Swastika biscuits for the SS,

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.720
 put a swastika at the top of the tree.

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.720
 Yeah, they were actually looking at it.

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.520
 Now there are a lot of swastikas as well.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.520
 Yeah.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.680
 'Cause they kind of, I think the Nazis tried to do away with...

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:52.080
 Oh, they kept Christmas, but they made it like a celebration of Nazism, didn't they?

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.120
 'Cause obviously Jesus was Jewish,

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.960
 and that didn't fit in with their ideas.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.840
 Yeah, but they had a full...

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.960
 They couldn't be able to come up with their own pictures or stories.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.200
 So they printed in 1943 a full calendar, full colour calendar,

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.920
 where I think each...

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.960
 I think this is around Christmas,

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.880
 and each image was like a Christmassy type image,

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.240
 but with a different story attached.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.680
 So there was Mary and Joseph and baby Jesus in a manger,

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.080
 well, I think the three kings going up to them,

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.720
 and it had text underneath explaining that's just a story about a woodcutter,

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.960
 a soldier and a king who get lost in the woods

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.720
 and encounter a woman with a baby.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.040
 Oh, wow.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.240
 Come on, guys, be a bit imaginative.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:33.640
 And so before this guy, was it called Gerhard Lang?

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.640
 Yeah.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.280
 We think there were some kind of advent calendars,

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.440
 but they weren't mass produced, they weren't a proper thing.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.800
 They were just a thing that people did in villages and towns and stuff, right?

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.240
 So in the 19th century, before that, so in the early 19th century,

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.160
 you would have a load of chalk marks on the road,

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.480
 and every day you would rub one off.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.480
 Don't be disgusting.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:58.760
 Timmy, what are we going to do together?

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.480
 Sorry, OK, no, mind.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.720
 Too crude. Too crude.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:06.320
 There was another one, there's a book by Elise Avedek

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.680
 called Roland und Elisabeth, which came out in 1851,

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.800
 and in that they say that every evening a new picture is added to the wallpaper.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.480
 This is before Christmas, and the children know then when all 24 pictures

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.440
 are hanging on the wallpaper, then Christmas is here.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.480
 Right. So that was a thing in this book from the 1850s.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:29.600
 And quite like Elise Avedek, she basically was a deaconess.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.840
 And she started this group of women who would organise

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.000
 like all the charity and stuff in the area.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.160
 She was really awesome.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.600
 And she had a motto, which was every person,

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:43.800
 whether man or woman should learn as much and for as long as he or she can,

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.880
 one can never learn too much.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.840
 OK. I think it's our kind of thing, isn't it?

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.960
 Yeah, definitely. What's her name again?

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.800
 She's called Elise Avedek.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.240
 I don't know if it's because we're doing a Christmas flow,

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.240
 but every time you say that, in my head I'm going,

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.720
 Elise Avedek, Elise Avedek, which is the Spanish Christmas.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.240
 Elise Avedek. OK.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.240
 Oh, yay!

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.240
 It just scans in my head.

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:11.760
 The advent calendars have gone really stratospheric in the last few years,

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.440
 I think there have been all, I mean, extreme novelty ones.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.720
 So this year, you can get a sriracha advent calendar.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.040
 Oh, nice. Which is marketed as the 12 days of sriracha.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:26.120
 But then, surely, everything is just the same flavour of sriracha every time, though.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.120
 James, I'm here to tell you you're wrong, wrong, wrong.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.880
 Because it has 12 200 millilitre bottles of sriracha,

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.200
 which apparently you're getting through one of these things a day.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.200
 Really?

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:41.360
 Original mayo, yellow chilli, green chilli, wasabi, blackout, super hot,

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:47.480
 extra garlic, smoky, black pepper, tikka and yuzu srirachas are available.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.080
 And if you drink one of those every day, you will die.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.560
 LAUGHTER

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.560
 Wow.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.320
 Or if this one was a counteract, the product placement we were doing there.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.120
 OK, well, are you hoping that you might get some free sriracha?

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.600
 I actually don't really, I don't especially like sriracha,

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.360
 I don't know why I brought it up.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.560
 Well, I was going to tell you about the 2017 Porsche advent calendar.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.560
 Oh!

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.120
 That cost one million dollars each.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.120
 Wow.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.240
 There was only one allowed on each continent on Earth.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.720
 But it was 1.75 metres in height, it was made from aluminium,

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:25.080
 it contained a gold watch designed by Porsche.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.320
 It supposedly contained a kitchen.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.040
 But it's definitely not big enough, so maybe a voucher for a kitchen?

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.480
 I'm not really sure.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:38.080
 It had a voucher possibly as well for a yacht in there.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.520
 Also some sunglasses made from gold and some cuff links.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.400
 Hang on, who are you handing this yacht voucher to?

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.960
 I love the idea of just like being a Tesco.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.120
 Do you have any vouchers to redeem against your transaction today?

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.720
 Yes, I've got this for one yacht, please.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.600
 LAUGHTER

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.600
 So funny.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.120
 I know, I'm telling you this, can you get all that stuff?

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.720
 But how big is it, did you say?

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.840
 It was 1.75 metres.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.600
 At least two of the seven things you named were vouchers,

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:11.440
 and one was a wristwatch, so where's the size coming in here?

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.080
 The sunglasses, the cuff links?

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.080
 No.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.080
 Was there a Porsche? Did you get a Porsche?

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.120
 It didn't seem that way from what I saw.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.800
 That's a bit fucking disappointing.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.440
 Like, you're getting a fucking yacht!

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.600
 You're paying a million pounds for this,

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.000
 and you're not getting the feet that it's named after.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.680
 Do you know how much yachts cost a lot more than a million pounds?

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.640
 Yeah, but when do you use a yacht?

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.240
 When do you use a yacht?

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.800
 You use cars every day.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.800
 A yacht?

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.640
 You can't drive your kid to school in a yacht.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.200
 Exactly, depends where you live.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.480
 If you live on an archipelago,

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.040
 you absolutely can drive your kid to school in a yacht.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.760
 I've been to some floating islands where people live,

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.280
 and the school is a floating island,

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.440
 and they definitely didn't use a yacht, I must admit.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.640
 They use more of a wicker boat.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.680
 Well, imagine how impressive a yacht would look next to that.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.880
 Anyway, if Portia wants to send me one of those, then I will accept it.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.360
 It's estimated that there are twice as many advent calendars for pets

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.600
 than there are with pictures of Jesus on them.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.120
 God, who really? No.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.280
 Well, this is an estimate that has been made by a man

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.880
 who is the founder of one of Britain's explicitly Christian advent calendars.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.800
 He reckons there are 400,000 Jesus ones sold each year,

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.400
 and over a million pet advent calendars.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.880
 I did read a story about a lady who bought her daughter

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.840
 a Garfield advent calendar and 11 days in,

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.480
 after she was complaining every day that the chocolate tastes a bit funky.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.520
 I realize that it was an advent calendar for her cat.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.800
 For 11 days, her child was like, "Wah!"

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.160
 And she even looked at it, I think, and was like,

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.320
 "Oh, it's green. It must be mint flavored."

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.480
 I don't know.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.200
 OK, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.640
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.680

 All of our previous episodes are there, so do check them out.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.120
 Also, in January, we are going to be doing the final leg of our nerd immunity tour.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.920
 Do come and see us live.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.880
 It's going to be awesome shows.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.360
 There's eight more of them to go, so do come along.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.680
 And before we wrap up tonight, just to let you know here at Birmingham,

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.440
 it's quite a sad night for us,

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:42.800
 because the effectively fifth fish member of our tour is leaving us.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.400
 This is his final show tonight.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.000
 This is Ash Gardner.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.240
 Ash, you will know in the background of NoSuchThing as a fish.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:54.760
 He is the singer and writer of our theme tune, which is called Wasps.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.040
 When you hear that, go check it out on Spotify.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.760
 There's a full album by MPRES, and that's where we got our theme tune from.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.600
 When we started as a podcast,

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.880
 he was the person who gave us the gear in order to record it

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.640
 and taught us how to press play and how to do it all genuinely.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.920
 We used his stuff.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.920
 When we first decided to do a live show,

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.760
 he was the guy who came and mic'd up the whole room and worked out how we could do it

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.040
 so that could get out there.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.080
 He's fed us facts the whole way through.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.760
 He's been on every single tour with us.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:25.680
 He's been the person that's basically been our emotional crutch for the tour,

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.040
 always making us happy.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.280
 Just such an awesome guy.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.520
 This is his last night.

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.800
 So we're going to close the show tonight by having him come on stage

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.400
 and sing the theme tune for you as we end the night.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.560
 Yeah, we're missing him so much.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.320
 He's really just beating hard with our tour.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.840
 It's going to be horrible to do it without him.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.680
 But fuck him.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.320
 He's moving to Australia, so tough luck.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.760
 Anyway, that is it.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.800
 That is all of our facts.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.240
 We'll be back again next week.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:54.920
 We'll see you.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.640
 Thank you so much, Bernie, and that is awesome.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.280
 We'll catch you next time.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.760
 Here we go.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:06.800
 Ash Garner, get the music up.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:19.640
 What's up, girls?

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.280
 Can we turn that up?

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:21.760
 Crank it.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.640
 Oh, we're going right through the chorus.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.640
 Let's not escape.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:40.200
 They'll move from hive to hive, leaving nothing alive.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:45.400
 So it's time to get together, show what we can do.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:49.960
 You hold on to me, and I'll hold on to you.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:54.880
 It's time to get together, show what we can do.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:44:00.360
 You hold on to me, and I'll hold on to you.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.920
 Thank you, guys.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:03.640
 Take care.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.800
 See you next time.

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.800
 (audience applauds)

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:18.800
