1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,500
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,080
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,420
 (audience cheering)

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,620
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,260
 of No Such Day As A Fish, a weekly podcast.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,920
 This week, "Conte Drive" from Burma!

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,920
 (audience cheering)

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,860
 (upbeat music)

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,360
 My name is Dan Schriver, I am sitting here

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,640
 with Anna Tyshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray,

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,700
 and James Harkin, and once again,

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,180
 we have gathered 'round the microphones this time

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,800
 for our Christmas special, yeah!

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,480
 (audience cheering)

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,180
 And once again, we have gathered 'round

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,760
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,160
 and in no particular order, here we go.

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,400
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,280
 Okay, my fact this week is that the song,

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,920
 when the red, red robin goes bobb, bobb, bobbin along,

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,080
 is actually about a thrush.

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,480
 (audience laughing)

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,480
 - But thrush didn't rhyme with bobbin?

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,360
 (laughing)

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,880
 - It could be rushing along, couldn't he?

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,560
 - Should have been rushing along.

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,800
 - It is an American song, the red, red robin

29
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,120
 goes bobb, bobb, bobbin along, I don't know

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,880
 if you guys know it, when the red, red robin

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,040
 goes bobb, bobb, bobbin along.

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,840
 It was written about the American robin,

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,260
 whose Latin name is Turdus migratorius.

34
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,960
 (audience laughing)

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,440
 And as every childish person knows,

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,480
 the Latin word Turdus means thrush.

37
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,520
 And it's called a robin, that bird,

38
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,440
 because when the early migrants got to America,

39
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,720
 it has a red breast and it reminded them

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,040
 of the European robin.

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,880
 - Right.

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,160
 - And so a lot of American songs,

43
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,560
 like rockin' robin, for instance, is the same.

44
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,160
 All these songs are actually about thrushes.

45
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,040
 - So technically it should also be Batman and thrush.

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,720
 (audience laughing)

47
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,920
 Well that's another story of Batman's medical problems.

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,800
 - That is actually true, 'cause Robin was,

49
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,200
 in some versions of the early Batman and Robin comics,

50
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
 he is named Robin 'cause he was born

51
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,960
 on the first day of spring.

52
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,680
 And the American Robin is associated with spring.

53
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,240
 So these songs, the red, red robin,

54
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,680
 these are springtime songs, they're not Christmas songs.

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,520
 - Yeah, okay, cool, wow.

56
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,800
 - It's better looking than our thrush, isn't it?

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,080
 I mean, the red breast does make a big difference.

58
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,960
 - Yeah, it's a nice bird, nice looking bird.

59
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,360
 It's like, it looks like, you know,

60
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,200
 if you think about your classic European robin,

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,720
 it's quite fat and round and it's got a red breast.

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,960
 The American one is a bit more proud looking,

63
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,960
 it's a bit bigger, it's got a slightly longer neck,

64
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,720
 but it still has the red color.

65
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,280
 And it's the most abundant bird in North America, apparently.

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,120
 - Is it?

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,640
 - Yeah, it's all over the bloody place.

69
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,000
 Although they're not shyer than our robins.

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 The robin that we know is the European robin,

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,800
 but in Britain, it's way more cocky and confident

72
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,280
 than all over the rest of Europe.

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
 - Really?

74
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,600
 - Yeah, and this is just because

75
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,320
 we actually like robins so much.

76
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,280
 So in Europe, it's much more common to hunt robins

77
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
 and, or has been historically,

78
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,000
 and they're not kind of treasured as much

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,520
 as this kind of Christmas symbol.

80
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,080
 So they're way shyer.

81
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,600
 And similarly in America, these guys,

82
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,400
 they hide in the woods, whereas our robins,

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,880
 you know, they chase you around the garden

84
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,720
 when you're digging out worms.

85
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,800
 - Yeah, of course, yeah.

86
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,520
 Do you know why they do that?

87
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
 - To get the worms you're digging out?

88
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,240
 - Well, yes, but it's because, basically,

89
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,680
 they think you're a pig.

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,520
 So...

91
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,360
 - What?

92
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,200
 - So what?

93
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,840
 - Joanna said all that nice stuff about robins.

94
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,720
 - Well, it's not reciprocated.

95
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,400
 Robins basically evolve to follow wild boar

96
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,600
 around forests.

97
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,440
 - What do they do?

98
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,760
 - They truffle up food, don't they?

99
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,080
 They dig for their food,

100
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,400
 and they will overturn a lot of earth

101
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
 and they'll reveal lots of earthworms.

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,520
 So, you know, it thinks you're a pig and a boar.

103
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
 Yeah.

104
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,840
 (audience laughing)

105
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,200
 - I've got to say, who have offended?

106
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,840
 - Is it really bad at telling the difference

107
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
 between species, then?

108
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,840
 - I'm exaggerating a little for comic effect.

109
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,440
 I don't know about its eyesight.

110
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,880
 It has got good eyesight, hasn't it?

111
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,600
 Or sort of something special about its eyes

112
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,320
 that it can navigate?

113
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,640
 - Michael Titan there, perhaps, I reckon.

114
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,480
 - Yeah.

115
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,320
 - 'Cause they...

116
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,640
 - I think that's probably the American ones,

117
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,960
 'cause they migrate quite a lot

118
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
 down there, the American ones.

119
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,640
 - Okay.

120
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,480
 - They do.

121
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,920
 You almost never see them here,

122
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,560
 but did you read about the...

123
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,680
 I think one of the last times

124
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,200
 that American robin was seen in the UK

125
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,680
 was in 2004,

126
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,240
 and it was one of these.

127
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,080
 It was blown over the Atlantic,

128
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,560
 so it got lost on a migration.

129
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,880
 (audience laughing)

130
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,120
 - That's a hell of a puff, isn't it,

131
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,720
 to get you over the Atlantic?

132
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
 - It was a gusty day.

133
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,520
 And it...

134
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,520
 So it turned up in Grimsby,

135
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,680
 and there was huge excitement.

136
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
 - Oh, God.

137
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,040
 I mean, your face bad enough, isn't it?

138
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,320
 (audience laughing)

139
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,680
 You end up in Grimsby.

140
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,520
 (audience laughing)

141
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,680
 - That's a bad hangover.

142
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,760
 What did I do last night?

143
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,160
 And the Twitchers, as they do, got very excited

144
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,440
 and all communicated with each other to say,

145
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,960
 "Come on, come on, see this American robin.

146
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,600
 "It's so rare to see them here."

147
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,520
 And they all arrived just in time

148
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,360
 to see it get eaten by a sparrow hawk.

149
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,680
 (audience laughing)

150
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,320
 - Oh, poor thing.

151
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,160
 I love that...

152
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,520
 I didn't know it was called turd migratus.

153
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,680
 - Turdus, yeah.

154
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,520
 - Turdus.

155
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,360
 - Not turd migratus.

156
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,520
 - Turdus migratus.

157
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,360
 Turdus. - Turdus.

158
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,200
 - It still works nicely.

159
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,200
 - It's a very, very lazy Harry Potter spell, basically.

160
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,040
 (audience laughing)

161
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,320
 - If you're a bit constipated,

162
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,160
 is that what you do?

163
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,840
 (audience laughing)

164
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,800
 - Oh, if you hear that in the stall, yeah, next to you.

165
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,080
 - Turdus migratus.

166
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,880
 (audience laughing)

167
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,720
 - Yeah.

168
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
 (audience laughing)

169
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,240
 - I would have thought exbellianus

170
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,560
 would have been the better.

171
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,560
 (audience cheering)

172
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,560
 - Okay, so on the word turdus,

173
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,000
 the word sturdy,

174
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,400
 that supposedly comes from the Latin for thrush.

175
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,020
 That's supposed to come from turdus as well.

176
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,440
 And the idea was,

177
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,880
 if a thrush would eat lots of berries,

178
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,360
 it might get drunk.

179
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,480
 And it would kind of sway around and sway around.

180
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,440
 And so turdy meant swaying.

181
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,040
 And then sturdy came from non-drunk thrushes, yeah.

182
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,320
 That's according to the Oxford English Dictionary,

183
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,280
 who I must say, I don't believe.

184
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,120
 (audience laughing)

185
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,960
 There is a French saying, which is as drunk as a thrush,

186
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,040
 which gives a little bit of credence to it, so.

187
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,200
 - They are the most prone to get drunk

188
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,240
 on fermented berries, I think, aren't they?

189
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,320
 - They are the American rubies.

190
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,160
 - Rubbies?

191
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,160
 That's what I called them, we're close.

192
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,800
 And it happens, so it tends to happen in spring,

193
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,080
 but it can actually happen in autumn,

194
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,600
 so basically it'll happen when the berries have frozen,

195
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,560
 and so when frost hits them,

196
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,800
 then they'll start converting their starch to sugars.

197
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,760
 Then I think when they thaw, then that starts fermenting.

198
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,640
 And then they get eaten, and then they do funny things,

199
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,920
 like crashing to each other or fall off branches.

200
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,960
 But in Minnesota, in October, a couple of years ago,

201
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,560
 there was an early frost that caused a big outbreak of this,

202
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,040
 and the police were called so many times

203
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,880
 that they actually had to put on a report out,

204
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,280
 saying there's no need to report drunk robins to the police.

205
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,360
 They will sober up within a short period of time

206
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
 and get over their lives.

207
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
 (audience laughing)

208
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,400
 - I read a really lovely story.

209
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,200
 In India, there was a species, a type of robin,

210
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,640
 that had made its way into the electrical box

211
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,000
 of a very tiny town.

212
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,880
 So there's about 150 people that live in this town,

213
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,280
 and this box would be turned on every night

214
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,960
 at 6 p.m. by one guy.

215
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,240
 And so he noticed that a robin,

216
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,520
 this species, a robin had laid eggs

217
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,280
 and was using this electrical circuit board as its nest.

218
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,720
 So he wrote on a WhatsApp group

219
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,960
 to all of the people in the village saying,

220
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,360
 "Is it cool if we don't turn on the street lights

221
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,480
 at night time until they've hatched

222
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,000
 and the birds have flown away?"

223
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,920
 And the whole village all agreed.

224
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,480
 And so for over 35 days, they had no lights at night,

225
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,800
 just to make sure that these little birds were born properly,

226
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,960
 and then they flew away,

227
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,760
 and then he started turning them on again.

228
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,840
 - That is a nice story.

229
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,000
 - Did they have lots of traffic incidents?

230
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,440
 - There was, yeah, 90 fatalities.

231
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,960
 (audience laughing)

232
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,680
 - Robins live really short lives most of the time,

233
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,920
 so they live for about 13 months.

234
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,520
 Very, very high mortality rate in their first year.

235
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,240
 But if they're through that,

236
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,680
 they stand a very good chance of surviving for a lot longer.

237
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,800
 So the oldest ever robin known

238
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
 was recorded as being, it was ringed,

239
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,840
 you know, with a ring around its foot or whatever.

240
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,280
 It was 19 years and four months.

241
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,120
 - Oh my God!

242
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,360
 - Imagine if there were people just walking around

243
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,320
 who were 1,000 years old and they'd just got lucky.

244
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,160
 - Oh my God!

245
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,240
 - Yeah, that's what it's like for robins.

246
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,080
 - When he said ringed,

247
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,920
 I thought he meant we cut it in half every year

248
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,760
 and count the rings.

249
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,600
 (audience laughing)

250
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,240
 - It was amazingly hardy, yeah.

251
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,560
 (audience laughing)

252
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,560
 This fact is about the fact that a robin

253
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,720
 is actually a thrush and a misnamed bird,

254
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,760
 and it's a Christmas bird.

255
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,720
 That we're talking about.

256
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,720
 And so I started looking into other Christmas birds.

257
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,420
 And it turns out a lot of them are misnamed as well.

258
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,160
 So one of the great songs that we have,

259
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,080
 the first day of Christmas, my true,

260
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,320
 we have a bunch of birds in that song, don't we, right?

261
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,360
 So, okay, turtle doves.

262
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,880
 Turtle doves are given everything.

263
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,240
 So we think that they're called turtle doves

264
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,360
 because they make a tur tur sounds.

265
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,320
 So that's the turtle.

266
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,520
 So as the article points out,

267
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,600
 and this is according to a biologist called Pamela Remerson,

268
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,000
 no relation to turtles.

269
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,720
 So they're just, they're...

270
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,240
 (audience laughing)

271
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,280
 - This is your facts?

272
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,960
 The doves are not related to turtles.

273
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,560
 - Turtle doves, zero relation to turtles.

274
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,720
 And myth busted.

275
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,040
 (audience laughing)

276
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,320
 French hens, there's three French hens in it.

277
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,240
 - Oh my God.

278
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,600
 - They're probably from France,

279
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,400
 but they're not actually a species called French hen.

280
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,760
 That doesn't exist, so myth busted.

281
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,240
 Second one down, calling birds.

282
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,520
 That sounds interesting, doesn't exist.

283
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,840
 We don't have calling birds.

284
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,960
 What they're probably talking about is for collie birds.

285
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
 And we just misunderstood that.

286
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,560
 We've called them calling birds.

287
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,400
 Andy, myth busted.

288
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,720
 - A collie bird is like a blackbird, right?

289
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,280
 Is it an old word for black?

290
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,120
 - Yeah, exactly.

291
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,080
 - It's called collet, right?

292
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,920
 - Yeah, yeah.

293
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,320
 Partridge in a pear tree.

294
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
 They're ground birds.

295
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,120
 They're never seen in trees.

296
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,960
 (audience laughing)

297
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
 That is good, actually.

298
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
 You say the best of luck.

299
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,040
 Myth busted.

300
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,440
 - You do see the odd partridge in a tree, to be fair.

301
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,800
 But they don't nest in trees.

302
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,200
 - Are they drunk?

303
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,040
 - Only when they're pissed.

304
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,440
 They're like the opposite of all other birds.

305
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,480
 They fall up trees when they're drunk.

306
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,040
 (audience laughing)

307
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,640
 - The song "When the Red Red Dropping"

308
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,320
 goes bob bob bobbing along.

309
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,640
 Really quickly on that.

310
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,400
 It was written in 1926, or 1925.

311
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,920
 By 1926, it was a hit for Whispering Jack Smith,

312
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,480
 Cliff Edwards, Paul Whiteman,

313
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,600
 the Ipanama Troubadours, and Al Jolson.

314
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,120
 In the same year, it was a hit for all those people.

315
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,000
 - Wow.

316
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,400
 - And it's not like one of those, you know,

317
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,760
 when you get a rap song and you've got

318
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,160
 20 different rappers on it,

319
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,840
 they all did their own version of it.

320
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,680
 - That's amazing.

321
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,040
 What was the first one called?

322
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,000
 - It was Whispering Jack Smith.

323
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
 - That sounds terrifying.

324
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,320
 (audience laughing)

325
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,720
 "When the Red Red Dropping" goes bob bobbing along.

326
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,960
 - It was most famous by Boddlestar, William Roth.

327
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,240
 She's the most famous one who sang it.

328
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,360
 And she sang it when she was really young,

329
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,200
 when she was about 14 or 15.

330
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,320
 And then she became not famous anymore.

331
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,480
 And then later on, she went on This Is Your Life,

332
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,680
 and she kind of was really honest about her alcoholism.

333
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,640
 And she got more than 40,000 letters

334
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,120
 when she went on This Is Your Life.

335
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,880
 She wrote not a biography.

336
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,440
 And then it got turned into a movie starring Susan Hayward.

337
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,960
 And that was nominated for an Academy Award.

338
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,080
 So, 'cause her life was so amazing.

339
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,640
 And then when she kind of went on This Is Your Life,

340
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,120
 she became famous again.

341
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,800
 And she had a huge sort of revival.

342
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,160
 She went on Broadway and did her own song.

343
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,720
 And the highlight of her act was singing

344
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,000
 when the Red Red Robin came bob bobbing along.

345
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,040
 But she sang it in the style of the person

346
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,880
 who played her in the movie, doing an impression of her.

347
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,040
 - Jesus.

348
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,880
 - Isn't that amazing?

349
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,720
 - That's sad.

350
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,760
 - You probably know the song most

351
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,840
 because I know you go to Charlton Athletic every now and then,

352
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,400
 and that's what they sing.

353
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,160
 - Is that what they're trying to sing?

354
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,560
 (audience laughing)

355
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,280
 Jesus Christ.

356
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,080
 Really, are they doing it in the style of this woman?

357
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,160
 Do they get in the style of her?

358
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,640
 - I think the dog is doing it in the style of some other bird.

359
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,480
 - Wow.

360
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,560
 Did you guys read that there's a type of thrush

361
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,000
 that gets its prey to come to the top of the surface

362
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,600
 by farting on the ground?

363
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,960
 - What if it looms worms towards it?

364
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,200
 - Yeah, it just gets down and it just starts farting.

365
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,560
 - What do the worms think of this thing?

366
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,080
 - I think you know that thing where it's kind of like,

367
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,760
 it feels like it's rain and it's coming up

368
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,960
 and they hear vibrations and they come up.

369
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,160
 It turns out anyway, it's not true.

370
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,520
 (audience laughing)

371
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,280
 - Dan, can I do the others?

372
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,600
 - Myth busted.

373
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,880
 (audience laughing)

374
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,720
 - Thank you, Andy.

375
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,720
 - It is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

376
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,560
 - My fact is that nobody knows

377
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,160
 where Caravaggio's most Christmassy painting is,

378
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,240
 but the main theory is that it was eaten by pigs

379
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,840
 in the 1970s.

380
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,760
 (audience laughing)

381
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,640
 This is a painting, so Caravaggio's extremely famous

382
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,120
 16th century artist, 16th, early 17th,

383
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,600
 and he painted a painting called

384
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,880
 "The Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence"

385
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,000
 and it was stolen.

386
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,880
 It was in a church in Palermo in Italy

387
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,080
 and it had been there for nearly 400 years.

388
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,480
 It was incredibly well established there.

389
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,720
 And in 1969, it was nicked by persons unknown.

390
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,000
 It's worth, obviously, millions and millions.

391
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,640
 There are not that many Caravaggio's

392
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,320
 and no one knows where it is to this day.

393
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,800
 It was cut from its frame and there are rumors

394
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,720
 about where it is, so some people say it's in Switzerland,

395
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,800
 some people say there's no way it ever left Italy,

396
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,160
 there was no international gossip

397
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,480
 about where it might have ended up,

398
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,440
 but one mafia informer claimed

399
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,280
 that it had been damaged in an earthquake

400
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,360
 and then just left it alone for a bit

401
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,840
 and then gnawed on by rats and pigs

402
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,840
 until it was completely worthless and then they burned it.

403
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,240
 - Wow, weird. - We don't know, but yeah.

404
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,760
 - It seems very odd, this habit that all these mafia members,

405
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,600
 it's the Cousin Ostra, isn't it?

406
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,440
 Members have of admitting to stealing the painting

407
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,040
 and then telling the story of the painting

408
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,680
 and you never know if they're telling the truth

409
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,920
 and I think so these are like pentitos

410
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,960
 who go to the police and say, "Oh, I've been in the mafia

411
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,040
 "and I'm really sorry about it

412
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,520
 "and I'll tell you where this nativity painting is."

413
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,640
 And I think the latest person is Guy Tano Grado

414
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,880
 who said he helped to steal the painting

415
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,880
 and then it somehow got into the hands of a mafia boss

416
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,800
 who took it to a Swiss art dealer

417
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,080
 and I just like the scene, the dealer wept when he saw it

418
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,280
 'cause it's such a beautiful, unbelievable painting.

419
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,480
 It's a Caravaggio, so the dealer burst and the tears sobbed

420
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,800
 and then immediately said, "We need to cut this into pieces

421
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,560
 "so we can sell them discreetly

422
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,440
 "otherwise people will know what it is."

423
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,560
 - Right, so what do you do, do you buy up all the pieces

424
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,040
 and put them together like a jigsaw?

425
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,400
 - Yeah, it's not like that.

426
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,520
 - I don't realise how fucking dangerous pigs are.

427
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:50,640
 Top tip, don't die next to a pig, it will eat you.

428
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,840
 - Yeah, but watch your dad, it doesn't really matter to him.

429
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,520
 - I know, but like if you were even in the process of dying

430
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,840
 and you happened to fall next to a pig, you're a goner.

431
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,000
 - Yep, absolutely.

432
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,320
 - And the Robin will watch from the side and laugh.

433
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,600
 - Well, to him, it's like a pig's eating a pig.

434
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,920
 It's like cannibalism.

435
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,160
 - Cannibalism, it'll look like.

436
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,400
 No, seriously, last few years, just the headlines.

437
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,280
 2020, missing Polish farmer,

438
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,360
 eaten by his own pigs, officials say.

439
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,040
 2019, woman eaten by a pig after she collapses while feeding.

440
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,640
 Basically, if you fall near a pig and you're asleep,

441
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,840
 it will eat you. - It's quite famous that, I think.

442
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,480
 Like, is it Hannibal? - Is it a Hannibal book?

443
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,160
 - Yeah, you've got to watch Hannibal, it's great.

444
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,320
 Most things of that scene, where you're eaten by pigs,

445
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,920
 it's a documentary about how it's very easy to get eaten by pigs

446
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,560
 if you're not careful.

447
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,080
 - It's funny, because pigs do have a reputation

448
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,240
 for being very intelligent and quite friendly.

449
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,120
 They do, don't they? Like, babe.

450
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,440
 Yeah, like, babe.

451
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,920
 - You've got to watch... - Like, babe, drink, yeah.

452
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,600
 - Babe, drink, but babe eats the farmer, yeah.

453
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,280
 - Is that all dope, pig?

454
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,240
 - Do you guys know pig casso?

455
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,440
 - No. - Just speaking of art and pig,

456
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,880
 he's the first non-human to hold his own exhibition.

457
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,640
 Art exhibition. - Really?

458
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,440
 - Yeah. Born in 2016.

459
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,720
 - I mean, when we say "hold" his own art exhibition,

460
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,840
 did he book the venue? - Yes.

461
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,000
 - Did he do the catering? God, I can't imagine the catering, actually.

462
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,200
 - He did all the admin.

463
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,280
 He finds it difficult to hold the phone, but he's overcoming it.

464
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,080
 No, he was born in 2016.

465
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,280
 He was one of these people who was rescued and taken to a sanctuary

466
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,120
 that was set up by this woman called Joanne Lebson

467
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,320
 in South Africa.

468
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,800
 And she said the reason that he became a famous painter,

469
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,320
 as he is now, is that she put him in a pen with loads and loads of stuff,

470
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,920
 and he ate or destroyed everything in the stool,

471
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,320
 except that paintbrushes.

472
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,040
 And so she deduced from that that he must love art.

473
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,200
 (LAUGHTER)

474
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,360
 He's since become a painter.

475
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,880
 He designed Swatches 2019 Swatch Design, which is called Flying Pig,

476
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
 and it's lots of purple and pink swirls.

477
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,360
 - Did they not find, like, a work of art

478
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,120
 and then maybe the shoes of an artist

479
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
 that he just eats and the rest of the artist?

480
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,960
 (LAUGHTER)

481
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,280
 - It could be that.

482
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,200
 - Does he draw with a pig pen?

483
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,680
 (AUDIENCE GASPS)

484
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,200
 - Don't boo that!

485
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,720
 - What's the... - It's Christmas!

486
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,560
 - It's Christmas! I'm sorry, I've ruined Christmas.

487
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,160
 - Shall we talk about Caravaggio? - I think we better.

488
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,560
 - Caravaggio, he was a bit of a badden, wasn't he?

489
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,000
 He was a bit of a badden.

490
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,480
 In 1604, the year, variously, he was arrested for assaulting a waiter

491
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,280
 who had served him with a plate of artichokes dressed in butter rather than oil,

492
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,440
 for throwing stones in the street next to a perfume maker and some prostitutes,

493
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,480
 and for telling a policeman who was attempting to release him quietly,

494
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,560
 even though he was carrying a sword, which he wasn't supposed to,

495
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,320
 you can stick it up your arse.

496
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
 (LAUGHTER)

497
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,440
 - Right.

498
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,480
 - You've given very one-sided story there.

499
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,400
 I'm quite a fan of Caravaggio, and the artichoke story, for example,

500
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,520
 was sort of justifiable. It was a test.

501
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,160
 So it was... He ordered eight artichokes for lunch,

502
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,160
 and he ordered four to be fried in oil and four to be fried in butter.

503
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,960
 The artichokes arrived, and then he asked the waiter,

504
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,680
 "Well, which of the four fried in oil?"

505
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,720
 And the waiter couldn't tell.

506
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,040
 - And then he picked up his sword, he had attacked the waiter,

507
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
 and then got a plate and smashed him in the face with it.

508
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,200
 - There's no excuse for bad service, James.

509
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
 (LAUGHTER)

510
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,360
 - The waiter was always right.

511
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,800
 - Speaking of bad service, he killed a man after a game of tennis,

512
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,520
 didn't he? - Did he?

513
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,720
 - Yeah, that's one of the most famous things about him.

514
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,920
 So he had to leave Rome when he killed his opponent in a game of tennis.

515
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,520
 Now, we think possibly it wasn't because of the tennis

516
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,200
 that he did this murder, and we think possibly

517
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,320
 he might not have been deliberately trying to kill the man.

518
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,320
 He might have only been trying to cut off his testicles.

519
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
 - Right.

520
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,720
 - You're all right. My client was merely trying to cut off

521
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,440
 this man's testicles with his sword.

522
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
 - New balls, please.

523
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,440
 (LAUGHTER)

524
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
 - Very strong.

525
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,960
 Yeah, it's very unclear, because they were having an argument

526
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,920
 about a woman who was maybe one of Caravaggio's models,

527
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,120
 but was also a prostitute, but was also working for the opponent.

528
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,720
 This man, Tomassini, was it?

529
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,440
 - Yeah, so Tomassini was the pimp of this woman.

530
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
 - Yes.

531
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,440
 - But also, when you're an artist, it was illegal for someone to sit for you,

532
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,120
 especially naked, unless they were a prostitute, unless you were paying them.

533
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,640
 And so, basically, most of the artists around that time

534
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,120
 were employing prostitutes to, or sex workers, I should say, to sit for them.

535
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,240
 And so, there was obviously something happening here.

536
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,760
 We weren't quite sure.

537
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,640
 The woman was called Faleed Melendroni,

538
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,520
 and there's not much else about her.

539
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,120
 She was once called a scandalous courtesan

540
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,480
 by the vicariat of Rome, no less, for refusing the sacrament.

541
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,640
 And later that year, she was arrested for possessing a weapon.

542
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,440
 So, she was a bit of a baddler, as well.

543
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,880
 - If that's the most scandalous thing you're doing, as a prostitute,

544
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,280
 refusing the sacrament, then I think you've got to up your game.

545
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,080
 - He was a very, very naughty boy, Caravaggio.

546
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
 No, he was.

547
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,560
 No, we shouldn't be glamourising it, because he was a ron.

548
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
 He was a rogue.

549
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,560
 There was a film. There's a film made about his life in 1986,

550
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,760
 in which Sean Bean, it's one of Sean Bean's very earliest films,

551
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,560
 he plays the guy Caravaggio had a deal with, Ranuccio Tomassoni.

552
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,360
 And that is also notable, because it's the first time

553
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,800
 that Sean Bean died onscreen.

554
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,640
 - Oh, no way! - Yes!

555
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,160
 - Really? - Sean Bean has had a lot of screen deaths, if you don't know.

556
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,720
 Sean Bean has been impaled on an anchor.

557
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,280
 He's been stabbed. He's fallen off an antenna.

558
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,640
 He's been buried alive and then died.

559
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,840
 He's been hanged.

560
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,920
 He's been shot through the neck with a grappling hook,

561
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,240
 and then hanged.

562
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,160
 He's been torn into quarters by horses,

563
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,320
 decapitated and shot ten times.

564
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,280
 - Well, he's hard. He's a hard man, had he come back from all those things. - He's a hard man, had he come back from all those things.

565
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,480
 He's still swinging, but he's not the actor who's died most in films.

566
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,840
 - This is diversion now, but... - Uh-huh.

567
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,120
 - Danny, is it Trejo? - Yeah, I'm machete-y.

568
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,280
 - Machete, yeah. - He's died 65 times in different films.

569
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,440
 - Has he? - Yeah, he has been killed by topless prostitutes

570
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,560
 in two separate films.

571
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,080
 Wow, that's typecasting, starting to exert its baleful influence, I'm afraid.

572
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,360
 You know, he invented really incredible lighting for paintings,

573
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,120
 and two people have been massively influenced by it.

574
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,120
 David Hockney talks about it, saying he basically invented Hollywood lighting.

575
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,400
 It was just... It was in one direction, and he believes that he used...

576
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,840
 - It was in one direction? - Yeah, he was multi-talented.

577
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,040
 He was... Yeah, he was a very influential character.

578
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,120
 He supposedly... He would use mirrors to sort of bend light towards,

579
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,480
 and Martin Scorsese, when he would see his paintings,

580
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,040
 was... A lot of Scorsese's movies, he says, were influenced by the lighting

581
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,440
 that he saw in Caravaggio's paintings, and he's convinced that if he was in modern times,

582
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,280
 he would have been one of our great directors, purely for that,

583
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,760
 purely for his understanding of light and composure.

584
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,800
 Yeah, but it was particularly dark. I've always thought they're too dark.

585
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,400
 It always looks like it's not very well lit in galleries, I think.

586
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,680
 - I agree. - It's basically 'cause it's all kind of black,

587
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,320
 except one shaft of light.

588
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,920
 - Yeah, it's like Blade Runner. - Yeah.

589
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,800
 But he did get in trouble once with his landlord.

590
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,520
 In fact, he was evicted because he cut...

591
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,000
 He was renting a room, and he cut a hole in the ceiling

592
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,240
 to get that single shaft of light.

593
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,600
 - Cool. - And a lot of landlords hate that.

594
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,480
 Was it in the ceiling? So, Ren could get in.

595
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,160
 - In the roof. - Yes, yeah, yeah.

596
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,680
 I suppose that's gonna ruin the painting, isn't it?

597
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,720
 - It didn't make a difference. - But also, he was in a ground floor flat,

598
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,280
 so he had to do every single thing.

599
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,200
 - Can we move on to the next fact? - Yes, please.

600
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

601
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,520
 My fact this week is that Merry Christmas Park in Miami

602
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,680
 isn't named after the holiday,

603
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,040
 but after a girl named Mary,

604
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,040
 who was the daughter of the city's former mayor, Randy Christmas.

605
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,640
 (LAUGHTER)

606
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,680
 I love that song.

607
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,560
 Have yourself a randy little Christmas.

608
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,320
 We will hear a randy Christmas.

609
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:59,440
 So, Randy Christmas was the mayor of Miami from 1955 to 1957,

610
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,480
 and he had a little daughter who he named Merry,

611
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,760
 she felt M-E-R-R-I-E,

612
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,400
 and Merry, unfortunately, was quite sick when she was born.

613
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,840
 She was born with only one kidney,

614
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,560
 which she was basically correctly diagnosed with

615
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,480
 when she was about three years old,

616
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,480
 and they thought that she wasn't gonna make it, unfortunately.

617
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,880
 And one of the things that Miami wanted to do

618
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,400
 to sort of talk about, you know, what an amazing and brave girl she was going through,

619
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,960
 what she was going through, is to name this park after her.

620
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,760
 So, it's a very tiny little park,

621
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,600
 and she was just, she was an amazing person.

622
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,280
 She continued, she had 12 operations.

623
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,680
 They thought she was only gonna live for a few months,

624
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
 but she had survived 12 more years.

625
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,680
 She used to go to the park once a year, she loved visiting it.

626
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,640
 She would sometimes go to it during Christmas as well

627
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,640
 to visit Merry Christmas Park, her park, she used to say.

628
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,760
 She sadly passed away,

629
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,440
 but she did get to experience this park for a long time, yeah.

630
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,560
 And how many disappointed people would show up at the park every day throughout December

631
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,880
 are going, "Where the hell's Santa Claus?

632
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,240
 "Why is there a 12-year-old girl here instead?"

633
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,440
 It's good to look at the story that way as well.

634
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,160
 She's letting a lot of people down.

635
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,800
 Yeah. "Is this your fault, you little dick? What's this?"

636
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,680
 Get out your wheelchair and look me in the eye.

637
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,360
 Yeah.

638
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,000
 Come on, Anna.

639
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,400
 So, the Christmas family, they said it took them three children

640
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,400
 for them to get up the nerve to call one of them Merry.

641
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,440
 Oh, really? Although, Merry Christmas did have her sister called Holly,

642
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,960
 who actually is still around.

643
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,680
 She was posted on the internet in June this year, so she's definitely still alive.

644
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,280
 Some of the other children in the school would tease Merry Christmas

645
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,120
 and call her Happy New Year.

646
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,920
 LAUGHTER

647
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,840
 But when she died, she did die very young,

648
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,920
 but she was so popular that they had to put on buses to get people to the funeral.

649
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,120
 It was an absolutely massive funeral. Oh, wow.

650
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,760
 And Randy Christmas's mother was called Leonora Pauline Pope Christmas.

651
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,240
 Her surname was Pope, so Pope married Christmas and had Randy.

652
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,560
 LAUGHTER

653
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,840
 It seems like it's kind of degrading the family names there, doesn't it?

654
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,560
 Yeah, and thank God it wasn't double-barrelled,

655
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,040
 because he could have been Randy Pope Christmas as the mayor of Miami.

656
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,000
 Gosh. There was a competition to find the most Christmassy name in the UK in 2017,

657
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,040
 and it was held by the British Christmas Tree Growers Association.

658
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,920
 And there were various great entries.

659
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,640
 The eventual winner was a woman called Donna Rudolph,

660
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,440
 which is good, because that's two of the reindeer, which is very impressive.

661
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,360
 But other winners included people like Val Spruce, Holly Berry,

662
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,160
 which I think is really good,

663
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,000
 Chris Tingley...

664
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,240
 LAUGHTER

665
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,840
 That's so great, Christmassy.

666
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,760
 But this is the thing, the prize was a Christmas tree, right?

667
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,800
 A real Christmas tree, not an artificial one.

668
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,280
 And in her winning speech,

669
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,840
 Donna Rudolph said she was really happy to win

670
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,480
 because she'd never had in her whole life a real Christmas tree,

671
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,880
 and she would be having a real one from now on.

672
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,400
 This is, let's not forget,

673
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,520
 promoted by the British Christmas Tree Growers Association,

674
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,160
 who I think may have fed her some copy in what she was going to say.

675
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,120
 And the whole thing was to promote real trees.

676
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,280
 But I looked into this a bit further, guys.

677
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,800
 Donna Rudolph lived in Whiz Beach, right?

678
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,680
 Which was fewer than 10 miles from the place,

679
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,400
 which actually had the farm,

680
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,000
 where she collected her Christmas tree farm.

681
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,440
 So, I'm not... Wait a minute, how old was she?

682
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,640
 I think in her 30s?

683
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,400
 So, it's not going to be 30 years ago,

684
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,120
 they decided to scab that they were going to name her a weird Christmas name.

685
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,600
 I'm not suggesting her parents named her to get her a free tree in 30 years.

686
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,640
 I'm saying the Christmas tree growers may have picked her

687
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,960
 because they wanted someone to turn up in person

688
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,680
 and collect their tree from the farm.

689
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,440
 It's not the biggest thing ever.

690
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,160
 It's not the biggest thing to bust ever.

691
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,840
 It's not Dan Brown, is it?

692
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,440
 I'm just saying, I think Chris Tingley might have been a bit rock.

693
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,520
 I think Holly Berry. I think Holly Berry is really good, isn't she?

694
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,920
 That's a great...

695
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,680
 Anyway, so that's my niche and illegally quite actionable...

696
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,080
 That's your panorama documentary-style expose there.

697
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,440
 I looked the other way.

698
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,280
 I looked at people who were called "Randy"

699
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,800
 because I thought, "That's a fun first name, if you pair it up with a surname."

700
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,800
 So Wikipedia has just a really big list of different people called "Randy."

701
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,120
 So there's a Randy Baker, there's a Randy Farmer,

702
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,600
 there's a Randy Gardner, there's Randy Love,

703
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,360
 there's Randy Rogers,

704
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,200
 Randy Messenger,

705
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
 which sounds like someone who'd slip into your DMs.

706
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,800
 - I like that one. - Yeah.

707
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,680
 And in my favourite one of all, Randy Murray.

708
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,920
 Oh!

709
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,520
 Do you know anything about Randy Murray?

710
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,480
 He's a Canadian guitarist.

711
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,480
 He's amazing. He used to be in a band with a guy called Ronald McDonald.

712
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,880
 - No. - No.

713
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,840
 - That's as far as I got into his... - Wow.

714
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,840
 Let's get him on. Out of court replacement, do we think?

715
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,800
 We don't have to tweet one letter on the posters.

716
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,280
 There was a guy called Alistair Christmas who was born on Christmas Day,

717
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
 which is very exciting.

718
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,920
 He was interviewed by The Daily Mirror,

719
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,360
 and he said that on at least one occasion in his life

720
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,520
 someone had refused to hand over a parcel that was for him

721
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,280
 because they just couldn't possibly believe

722
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,520
 that his name was Alistair Christmas.

723
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,240
 Which I have to say is quite not especially unbelievable.

724
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,480
 But he said, of his name, when people find out he's called Alistair Christmas,

725
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,680
 "People just see you and look at you as if you were magic.

726
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,440
 "You can see it in their eyes.

727
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,960
 "To them, it is like they have just met Santa."

728
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,080
 Can I say? The delivery guy, right?

729
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,640
 He turns up with a parcel for Mr. A. Christmas.

730
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,360
 And then the guy comes out and says, "I'm Mr. A. Christmas."

731
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,560
 And then he says, "I don't believe you."

732
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,480
 - What was he expecting the person to say? - Who's this box for, then?

733
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,640
 - Exactly. - Yeah, exactly.

734
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,320
 Did he just take it home? I don't know.

735
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,360
 There's the surname Christmas quite common in Essex and Sussex.

736
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,360
 And the theory is that it was probably, you know,

737
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,200
 people got their surnames in the olden days.

738
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,880
 It was probably someone who was born on Christmas Day.

739
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,280
 That's what we think.

740
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,880
 However, there is a guy called Henry Christmas

741
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,520
 who is a retired engineer who has spent decades

742
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,640
 delving into the history of the name.

743
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,360
 And he said in 2005 that the Christmas Day/Christmas connection

744
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,800
 is too easy.

745
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,680
 But I rather think that he's spent decades doing it

746
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,680
 and realised that it's actually the obvious thing that everyone thinks.

747
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,120
 - Yeah. - He's got to justify a lifetime wasted.

748
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
 - Yeah. - Sorry, Henry.

749
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,960
 Do you guys know about Merry Christmas Clause and Santa Clause?

750
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,680
 - The Nebraska couple. - No.

751
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,160
 These are two people who legally changed their names in 2017.

752
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,800
 They're so sweet.

753
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,440
 So they won't give their real names to journalists who interviewed them.

754
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,560
 So they are now, the wife is Merry Christmas Clause,

755
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,040
 the husband is Santa Clause.

756
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,960
 And they go and they dress up.

757
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,760
 They wear their dress reds at Christmas,

758
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,720
 which is the term for the Santa outfit.

759
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,000
 And for the rest of the year, Santa's a taxi driver.

760
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,760
 And yeah, they just decided they loved being in the mall so much,

761
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,600
 having kids swarming around them, sitting on their laps and everything,

762
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,000
 that they've changed their names.

763
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,120
 And it's so sweet.

764
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,080
 They met in December 2009, and she, Merry Christmas Clause,

765
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,400
 said she knew he was the one when he offered to make me dinner.

766
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,840
 There aren't many men willing to cook a woman dinner.

767
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,600
 I knew I'd found a keeper.

768
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,680
 Which does imply a low bar.

769
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:23,120
 But she then says, "But the pot gets even lower."

770
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,400
 She said, "What I love about Santa, my husband,

771
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,680
 "is that he's so great at the kid-friendly jokes at Christmas."

772
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,880
 So that's kind of, can someone explain this to me?

773
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,480
 She says, "When the kids ask for iPods,

774
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,640
 "he says, 'Why an iPod?

775
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,680
 'Wouldn't you rather have a three-pod?'

776
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,080
 'There's three P's in a pod, but there's only one I in an iPod.

777
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,640
 'The parents roar with laughter over that.'"

778
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,440
 [LAUGHTER]

779
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,560
 Does that make sense?

780
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,200
 I think, what does that mean, kind of?

781
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,840
 I'm not, look, I made a pig-ped joke earlier.

782
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,400
 I'm not going to slag off this guy.

783
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,800
 He's doing his best.

784
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,080
 He's doing his best.

785
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,920
 Wow. We're ignoring one very famous Christmas,

786
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,040
 it was a fictional Christmas.

787
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,560
 Christmas Jones, Bond character.

788
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,040
 Yes. Oh, here's that.

789
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,560
 In the world. The Pierce Brosnan flake, wasn't it?

790
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,040
 That was one of the Pierce Brosnan ones.

791
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,640
 Denise Richards, who's a nuclear physicist character.

792
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,320
 And it's basically, so there are a load of really,

793
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,360
 really sort of cheap tacky gags, you know,

794
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,160
 James Bond says, "Ugh, I thought Christmas only came once a year.

795
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,320
 "It's had all of this." Really, like, you know.

796
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,800
 It's aged poorly, and it was quite recent.

797
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,280
 So just off the back of this, and this is a tangent,

798
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,480
 I apologize, I thought I'd try and find the worst role

799
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,960
 that Denise Richards has ever had to play,

800
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,480
 and I think I've found it, her first starring role

801
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,040
 was in a film called "Tammy and the T-Rex", OK?

802
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,280
 Which is a comedy about a girl whose boyfriend,

803
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,200
 his brain is put into a T-Rex, right?

804
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,720
 Yeah, I know, I've heard of us.

805
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,680
 OK, so it's a bit niche and a bit cult, but it's...

806
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,320
 What do you mean it's put into a T-Rex?

807
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,520
 Like, his consciousness goes into the T-Rex.

808
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,200
 What T-Rex? There is a T-Rex in the film, OK?

809
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,760
 Well, I'm getting to that, I'm getting to that.

810
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,640
 A mad scientist has created a T-Rex, OK?

811
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,520
 So this is the thing, I was reading about this film on IMDB,

812
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,920
 I cannot believe it.

813
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,320
 Basically, listen to this.

814
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,520
 The writer/director Stuart Raffle has said in an interview,

815
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,080
 "The idea for the film only happened

816
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,040
 "because they had access to a full-size T-Rex animatronic."

817
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,200
 Someone phoned him up and said,

818
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,920
 "Hey, we have this T-Rex for a month, what shall we do?

819
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,240
 "Shall we make a film?"

820
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,960
 They said, "I'll start writing immediately."

821
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,400
 The whole reason for the film

822
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
 is because they had access to this thing for a month.

823
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,800
 He was constantly writing scenes and then saying to his colleagues,

824
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,560
 "And the cast and crew, do you have any better ideas

825
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,760
 "for the next scene?"

826
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,480
 All locations were within 25 minutes of his house.

827
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,640
 It's incredible. Sounds amazing.

828
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,160
 It's such a good film. Wow, yeah.

829
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,320
 Dan will be watching that when he gets home tonight.

830
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,440
 That's what's so sad about this.

831
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,800
 Anyway, tangent over, sorry.

832
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,600
 Hey, listen, I need to move us on to our final fact of the show.

833
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,160
 It is time for our final fact, and that is Anna.

834
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,160
 My fact this week is that the Edible Advent Calendar

835
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,400
 came before the Printed Picture Advent Calendar.

836
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,320
 This is my interpretation of what the first Advent Calendar was,

837
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,120
 which was Gerhard Lang,

838
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,480
 who was the first person to print and sell Advent calendars.

839
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,400
 He did it in 1908, and he got his inspiration from his mum,

840
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,920
 who, when he was young, she had a little cardboard box thing

841
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,080
 to which she fixed a baked meringue pastry for each day of Advent,

842
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,280
 and she allowed him to eat one per day.

843
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,600
 Oh, yes. It's so charming.

844
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,880
 Yeah, in fact, it's something called "Wiebele,"

845
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,400
 which I think is a specific German dish.

846
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,440
 It's a sweet-like meringue, which has a figure of eight shape.

847
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,160
 Yeah, he was inspired by that, and he's the father of the Advent Calendar.

848
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,760
 And then his later Advent calendars were called Munich calendars, weren't they?

849
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
 Yeah.

850
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,520
 And then something in the '30s happened,

851
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,240
 and he just wasn't very popular anymore outside of Germany.

852
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
 Yeah.

853
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,560
 It's really tragic.

854
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,280
 Carmel was rationed in the '30s, and they shut his company down.

855
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,360
 The German government in the '30s, the Nazi government shut...

856
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,160
 Sorry, no one, sort of, you know, concealing that,

857
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,400
 but the Nazis made their own Advent calendars as well.

858
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,600
 Yeah, well, there was one company, wasn't there,

859
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,560
 that they accepted that they could make them,

860
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,240
 but they accepted the company.

861
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,360
 And basically, yeah, if you got an Advent calendar in Nazi Germany,

862
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,600
 it was just Nazi symbolism.

863
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
 Yeah, it was...

864
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,440
 Another swastika, basically, right?

865
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
 It was like a tank.

866
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,720
 No, no, no, there were tanks.

867
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,040
 There was Wotan, who was a Nordic god.

868
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,760
 It didn't mention Jesus at all,

869
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,280
 and there was advice on how to keep your children entertained over Christmas.

870
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,320
 Swastika biscuits for the SS,

871
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,720
 put a swastika at the top of the tree.

872
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
 Yeah, they were actually looking at it.

873
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,520
 Now there are a lot of swastikas as well.

874
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,520
 Yeah.

875
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,680
 'Cause they kind of, I think the Nazis tried to do away with...

876
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,080
 Oh, they kept Christmas, but they made it like a celebration of Nazism, didn't they?

877
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,120
 'Cause obviously Jesus was Jewish,

878
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,960
 and that didn't fit in with their ideas.

879
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,840
 Yeah, but they had a full...

880
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,960
 They couldn't be able to come up with their own pictures or stories.

881
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,200
 So they printed in 1943 a full calendar, full colour calendar,

882
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,920
 where I think each...

883
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,960
 I think this is around Christmas,

884
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,880
 and each image was like a Christmassy type image,

885
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,240
 but with a different story attached.

886
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,680
 So there was Mary and Joseph and baby Jesus in a manger,

887
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,080
 well, I think the three kings going up to them,

888
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,720
 and it had text underneath explaining that's just a story about a woodcutter,

889
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,960
 a soldier and a king who get lost in the woods

890
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,720
 and encounter a woman with a baby.

891
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,040
 Oh, wow.

892
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,240
 Come on, guys, be a bit imaginative.

893
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,640
 And so before this guy, was it called Gerhard Lang?

894
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,640
 Yeah.

895
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,280
 We think there were some kind of advent calendars,

896
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,440
 but they weren't mass produced, they weren't a proper thing.

897
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,800
 They were just a thing that people did in villages and towns and stuff, right?

898
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,240
 So in the 19th century, before that, so in the early 19th century,

899
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,160
 you would have a load of chalk marks on the road,

900
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,480
 and every day you would rub one off.

901
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
 Don't be disgusting.

902
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,760
 Timmy, what are we going to do together?

903
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,480
 Sorry, OK, no, mind.

904
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,720
 Too crude. Too crude.

905
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,320
 There was another one, there's a book by Elise Avedek

906
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,680
 called Roland und Elisabeth, which came out in 1851,

907
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,800
 and in that they say that every evening a new picture is added to the wallpaper.

908
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,480
 This is before Christmas, and the children know then when all 24 pictures

909
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,440
 are hanging on the wallpaper, then Christmas is here.

910
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,480
 Right. So that was a thing in this book from the 1850s.

911
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,600
 And quite like Elise Avedek, she basically was a deaconess.

912
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,840
 And she started this group of women who would organise

913
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,000
 like all the charity and stuff in the area.

914
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,160
 She was really awesome.

915
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,600
 And she had a motto, which was every person,

916
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,800
 whether man or woman should learn as much and for as long as he or she can,

917
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,880
 one can never learn too much.

918
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,840
 OK. I think it's our kind of thing, isn't it?

919
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,960
 Yeah, definitely. What's her name again?

920
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,800
 She's called Elise Avedek.

921
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,240
 I don't know if it's because we're doing a Christmas flow,

922
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,240
 but every time you say that, in my head I'm going,

923
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,720
 Elise Avedek, Elise Avedek, which is the Spanish Christmas.

924
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,240
 Elise Avedek. OK.

925
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,240
 Oh, yay!

926
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
 It just scans in my head.

927
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,760
 The advent calendars have gone really stratospheric in the last few years,

928
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,440
 I think there have been all, I mean, extreme novelty ones.

929
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,720
 So this year, you can get a sriracha advent calendar.

930
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,040
 Oh, nice. Which is marketed as the 12 days of sriracha.

931
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,120
 But then, surely, everything is just the same flavour of sriracha every time, though.

932
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,120
 James, I'm here to tell you you're wrong, wrong, wrong.

933
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,880
 Because it has 12 200 millilitre bottles of sriracha,

934
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,200
 which apparently you're getting through one of these things a day.

935
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
 Really?

936
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,360
 Original mayo, yellow chilli, green chilli, wasabi, blackout, super hot,

937
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:47,480
 extra garlic, smoky, black pepper, tikka and yuzu srirachas are available.

938
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,080
 And if you drink one of those every day, you will die.

939
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,560
 LAUGHTER

940
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
 Wow.

941
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,320
 Or if this one was a counteract, the product placement we were doing there.

942
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,120
 OK, well, are you hoping that you might get some free sriracha?

943
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,600
 I actually don't really, I don't especially like sriracha,

944
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,360
 I don't know why I brought it up.

945
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,560
 Well, I was going to tell you about the 2017 Porsche advent calendar.

946
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
 Oh!

947
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,120
 That cost one million dollars each.

948
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,120
 Wow.

949
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,240
 There was only one allowed on each continent on Earth.

950
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,720
 But it was 1.75 metres in height, it was made from aluminium,

951
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,080
 it contained a gold watch designed by Porsche.

952
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,320
 It supposedly contained a kitchen.

953
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,040
 But it's definitely not big enough, so maybe a voucher for a kitchen?

954
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,480
 I'm not really sure.

955
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,080
 It had a voucher possibly as well for a yacht in there.

956
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,520
 Also some sunglasses made from gold and some cuff links.

957
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,400
 Hang on, who are you handing this yacht voucher to?

958
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,960
 I love the idea of just like being a Tesco.

959
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,120
 Do you have any vouchers to redeem against your transaction today?

960
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,720
 Yes, I've got this for one yacht, please.

961
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,600
 LAUGHTER

962
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
 So funny.

963
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,120
 I know, I'm telling you this, can you get all that stuff?

964
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,720
 But how big is it, did you say?

965
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,840
 It was 1.75 metres.

966
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,600
 At least two of the seven things you named were vouchers,

967
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,440
 and one was a wristwatch, so where's the size coming in here?

968
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,080
 The sunglasses, the cuff links?

969
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,080
 No.

970
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,080
 Was there a Porsche? Did you get a Porsche?

971
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,120
 It didn't seem that way from what I saw.

972
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,800
 That's a bit fucking disappointing.

973
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,440
 Like, you're getting a fucking yacht!

974
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,600
 You're paying a million pounds for this,

975
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,000
 and you're not getting the feet that it's named after.

976
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,680
 Do you know how much yachts cost a lot more than a million pounds?

977
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,640
 Yeah, but when do you use a yacht?

978
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,240
 When do you use a yacht?

979
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,800
 You use cars every day.

980
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
 A yacht?

981
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,640
 You can't drive your kid to school in a yacht.

982
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,200
 Exactly, depends where you live.

983
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,480
 If you live on an archipelago,

984
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,040
 you absolutely can drive your kid to school in a yacht.

985
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,760
 I've been to some floating islands where people live,

986
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,280
 and the school is a floating island,

987
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,440
 and they definitely didn't use a yacht, I must admit.

988
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,640
 They use more of a wicker boat.

989
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,680
 Well, imagine how impressive a yacht would look next to that.

990
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,880
 Anyway, if Portia wants to send me one of those, then I will accept it.

991
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,360
 It's estimated that there are twice as many advent calendars for pets

992
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,600
 than there are with pictures of Jesus on them.

993
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,120
 God, who really? No.

994
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,280
 Well, this is an estimate that has been made by a man

995
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,880
 who is the founder of one of Britain's explicitly Christian advent calendars.

996
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,800
 He reckons there are 400,000 Jesus ones sold each year,

997
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,400
 and over a million pet advent calendars.

998
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,880
 I did read a story about a lady who bought her daughter

999
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,840
 a Garfield advent calendar and 11 days in,

1000
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,480
 after she was complaining every day that the chocolate tastes a bit funky.

1001
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,520
 I realize that it was an advent calendar for her cat.

1002
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,800
 For 11 days, her child was like, "Wah!"

1003
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,160
 And she even looked at it, I think, and was like,

1004
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,320
 "Oh, it's green. It must be mint flavored."

1005
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,480
 I don't know.

1006
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,200
 OK, that is it. That is all of our facts.

1007
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,640
 Thank you so much for listening.

1008
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,680
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us

1009
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,920
 about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,

1010
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,920
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

1011
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,960
 I'm on @Sriberland, Andy, @AndrewHunterM, James, @JamesHarken, and Anna.

1012
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,120
 You can email podcast@qi.com.

1013
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,720
 Or you can reach us on our group account, which is @NoSuchThing,

1014
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,640
 or you can find us on the website, NoSuchThing, as a fish.com.

1015
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,400
 All of our previous episodes are there, so do check them out.

1016
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,120
 Also, in January, we are going to be doing the final leg of our nerd immunity tour.

1017
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,920
 Do come and see us live.

1018
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,880
 It's going to be awesome shows.

1019
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,360
 There's eight more of them to go, so do come along.

1020
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,680
 And before we wrap up tonight, just to let you know here at Birmingham,

1021
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,440
 it's quite a sad night for us,

1022
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,800
 because the effectively fifth fish member of our tour is leaving us.

1023
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,400
 This is his final show tonight.

1024
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,000
 This is Ash Gardner.

1025
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,240
 Ash, you will know in the background of NoSuchThing as a fish.

1026
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:54,760
 He is the singer and writer of our theme tune, which is called Wasps.

1027
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,040
 When you hear that, go check it out on Spotify.

1028
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,760
 There's a full album by MPRES, and that's where we got our theme tune from.

1029
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,600
 When we started as a podcast,

1030
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,880
 he was the person who gave us the gear in order to record it

1031
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,640
 and taught us how to press play and how to do it all genuinely.

1032
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,920
 We used his stuff.

1033
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,920
 When we first decided to do a live show,

1034
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,760
 he was the guy who came and mic'd up the whole room and worked out how we could do it

1035
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,040
 so that could get out there.

1036
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,080
 He's fed us facts the whole way through.

1037
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,760
 He's been on every single tour with us.

1038
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,680
 He's been the person that's basically been our emotional crutch for the tour,

1039
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,040
 always making us happy.

1040
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,280
 Just such an awesome guy.

1041
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,520
 This is his last night.

1042
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,800
 So we're going to close the show tonight by having him come on stage

1043
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,400
 and sing the theme tune for you as we end the night.

1044
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,560
 Yeah, we're missing him so much.

1045
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,320
 He's really just beating hard with our tour.

1046
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,840
 It's going to be horrible to do it without him.

1047
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,680
 But fuck him.

1048
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,320
 He's moving to Australia, so tough luck.

1049
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,760
 Anyway, that is it.

1050
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,800
 That is all of our facts.

1051
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,240
 We'll be back again next week.

1052
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:54,920
 We'll see you.

1053
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,640
 Thank you so much, Bernie, and that is awesome.

1054
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,280
 We'll catch you next time.

1055
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,760
 Here we go.

1056
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:06,800
 Ash Garner, get the music up.

1057
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,640
 What's up, girls?

1058
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,280
 Can we turn that up?

1059
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:21,760
 Crank it.

1060
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,640
 Oh, we're going right through the chorus.

1061
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,640
 Let's not escape.

1062
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:40,200
 They'll move from hive to hive, leaving nothing alive.

1063
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,400
 So it's time to get together, show what we can do.

1064
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,960
 You hold on to me, and I'll hold on to you.

1065
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,880
 It's time to get together, show what we can do.

1066
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,360
 You hold on to me, and I'll hold on to you.

1067
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,920
 Thank you, guys.

1068
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,640
 Take care.

1069
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,800
 See you next time.

1070
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,800
 (audience applauds)

1071
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:18,800
