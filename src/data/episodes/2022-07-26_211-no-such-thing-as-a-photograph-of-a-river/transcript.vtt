00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 (bells ringing)

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.240
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.440
 (bells ringing)

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.120
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.840
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.120
 this week coming to you from Edinburgh!

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.120
 (audience cheering)

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.440
 My name is Dan Schreiber

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.000
 and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.160
 Andrew Hunter-Marie and James Harkin,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.560
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.320
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.320
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.040
 Starting with fact number one,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.800
 and that's my fact this week,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.920
 my fact is unmarried people are more likely

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.840
 to fall down stairs than married people.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.720
 (audience laughing)

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.680
 And previously married people fall down more

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.880
 than both of them.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.840
 (audience laughing)

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.000
 - It does, it's not just 'cause they're like,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.760
 it's my phone's ringing, my phone's ringing,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.520
 get it, because you're single, you're kind of, you know.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.560
 - Yeah, you're ready for the thing.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.960
 - I don't think we know why, do we?

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.320
 - We don't, so I read this in a Bill Bryson book

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.600
 called At Home, which is a fantastic book

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.040
 and he references in the chapter

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.200
 which he writes about stairs that he read this one book,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.360
 the only book that is a sort of academic look at staircases

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.200
 and it's by John Templer of MIT, it's called The Staircase,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.200
 Studies of Hazards Fall and Safe Designs.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.400
 - Yeah, and I have also read this book, there it is.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.240
 - That's it.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.640
 - It is the first theoretical,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.240
 historical and scientific analysis of the stair,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.200
 according to the blurb.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.240
 It is pretty hard going.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.760
 (audience laughing)

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.560
 And actually that was a little joke

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.920
 for you staircase enthusiasts out there

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.200
 because the going is the width of a stair.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.440
 (audience laughing)

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.080
 And all of my humour will be staircase based

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.280
 for the rest of the show.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.360
 (audience laughing)

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.680
 - John Templer's at home pissing himself

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.000
 on the other end of that.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.280
 - I mean, there's diagrams as, you know,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.200
 loads of tables and stuff like this.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.640
 There's tables.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.200
 - What are tables doing in the book?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.680
 (audience laughing)

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.680
 - There's like about three or four good facts

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.880
 in the first four pages

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.680
 and then the rest of it is just unbelievably tedious.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.520
 (audience laughing)

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.720
 - Did he lead with the unmarried and married tables?

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.720
 - Yeah, it's right near the start.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.920
 Another thing he says is that notable missteps

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.080
 happen once every 2,222 stair uses.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.360
 Minor accidents happen every 63,000 uses.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.360
 Disabling accidents every 734,210 uses.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.760
 Hospital treatments every 3,616,667 uses.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.880
 And deaths every 513,947,300 uses.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.760
 And that was one of the least boring.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.560
 (audience laughing)

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.960
 - Do you know why all these accidents happen?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.800
 - No, why?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.920
 - According to him, it's because every staircase

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.920
 is a compromise between going up and going down.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.720
 - Yeah, so you can have staircases

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.080
 which just for people going up, can't you?

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.720
 - Oh no, that would be that would be decadent, wouldn't it?

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.160
 (audience laughing)

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.600
 - His point being that how would you get down again

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.600
 as well, think of that.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.920
 - I'd have to in my house.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.920
 - Oh, I would have Harman's pole or a slide.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.080
 - Wait, so what do you mean by a compromise?

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.640
 Who's compromising with whom?

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.640
 Who's negotiating here?

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.720
 - The perfect staircase would be a staircase

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.440
 that would be able to adapt itself

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.120
 to whether or not you were going up or down

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.280
 for the length and the height and so on.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.240
 They're built in one way which plays advantage

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.760
 to either going up or going down.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.240
 Very different skills going up and down a staircase.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.240
 - Very different.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.640
 - And actually in this book, there are figures

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.640
 about how a staircase was if you're going up or down.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.320
 So if you're going up, there's a different

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.840
 wearing out of the stair than if you're going down.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.640
 - But you would have thought the wearing would be the same

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.040
 on all staircases unless you've just got a huge stockpile

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.960
 of 10,000 people at the top of the stairs at some point.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.840
 At some point everyone who goes up stairs

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.840
 does come down the stairs.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.240
 - I think there are a few like, for instance,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.760
 if you've got stairs coming up at a dock, say for instance,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.480
 people might use it for getting off the boat,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.280
 but to get on the boat they might use the pier.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.120
 - I see.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.120
 - So there are a few little things like that.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.720
 It's very interesting, actually, I don't know.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.520
 - And that's the origin of that saying, isn't it?

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.680
 What goes up stairs must come down stairs.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.840
 - Women fall downstairs more often than men

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.160
 or admit to falling downstairs more often than men.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.280
 So 38% of women, compared to 28% of men,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.120
 said they'd fallen downstairs or upstairs

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.760
 or tripped on stairs in the last year.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.880
 And also weirdly, this was a study that was done

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.960
 by the British Woodworking Federation

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.720
 who relied on for all rigorous scientific studies.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.720
 And their study also found that the northeast of England,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.440
 so it was a study that discovered England,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.240
 the northeast is the most at risk of falling downstairs.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.480
 So 48% of people there said they'd done it in the last year,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.800
 whereas Yorkshire and Humber, directly next to the northeast region,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.400
 had the least incidences, 26%.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.560
 What's going on there?

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.840
 It doesn't make any sense.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.720
 - I don't know, mate.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.320
 - I saw a really cool invention the other day

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.760
 'cause a lot of people are trying to work out

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.760
 how to stop people if they do fall over

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.160
 from properly hurting themselves.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.840
 So there's this new invention that they're trialing

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.800
 at the moment, which is like a big belt that you wear.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.760
 And it senses that you're falling over.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.840
 It's a sort of like, this is a movement

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.160
 that's not being expected.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.720
 I've gone, as a belt, I've gone over that way.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.160
 And what it does is it inflates these massive airbags.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.800
 Speaking of stair-based inventions, that sounds awesome.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.280
 There are scientists at Georgia Tech

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.520
 who have invented some stairs which walk you back.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.920
 - What, that doesn't make any sense?

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.040
 - Well, I understand all those words, but.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.080
 - Well, I've tried to, I've tried to sex it up a bit,

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.640
 and I don't think it's succeeded.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.040
 Basically, there are stairs which, as you walk on them,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.560
 they store your energy,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.480
 and then when you walk the other way,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.240
 so when you walk down the gravitational force

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.720
 of you descending, stalls energy in the stair,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.400
 and then when you walk back up, it springs you up.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.400
 Every step you take, every move you make.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.440
 (audience laughing)

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.000
 And when you go back up, it's 37% easier on your knee

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.720
 than it would be normally, so that could be huge.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.440
 - Yeah, and there are shoes that have just been invented

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.480
 to stop people from falling over,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.040
 which I think sound a bit less dramatic

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.720
 than embarrassing than the air bag solution,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.360
 because they're just shoes with battery on the back of them

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.920
 and a sensor, and they sense when you're starting

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.120
 to have your body weight in the wrong position,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.000
 and they automatically start a little motor

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.880
 that slides the shoes backwards,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.400
 so stops you falling over backwards.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.040
 - Like your moonwalking. - Wow.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.160
 - Exactly, like moonwalking,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.360
 but only if the option is falling over.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.280
 - That's amazing.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.760
 - And the person who invented them said,

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.920
 "It's great because it's not as noticeable as having a stick

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.280
 or a Zimmer frame, which some people don't want to have,

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.560
 "because it makes them feel like they've lost their mobility."

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.200
 And they just look like completely normal shoes,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.320
 which I watched the video,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.720
 and they've got a large motor on the back of each shoe.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.480
 (audience laughing)

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.520
 - Can I just ask about the staircase giving you the lift again?

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.840
 So presumably, if you were walking down,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.040
 it matches your body weight and type

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.480
 for what the spring it gives you on the way back up, right?

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.920
 So if I go down the staircase, but then my sun walks up it,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.400
 (audience laughing)

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.000
 is he not gonna be lobbed to the feet?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.440
 - Because in 1948, an elephant climbed up the stairs

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.600
 at the Eiffel Tower.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.440
 - No.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.560
 - And then climbed back down again, so imagine that.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.400
 - Are you serious? - Really?

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.240
 - Wow.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.560
 - There used to be a thing that people did in the Eiffel Tower,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.200
 they used to just climb up the stairs in funny ways.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.000
 There was a guy who did it in Stilts,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.160
 quite famously, a baker.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.720
 And then when Hitler took over Paris in the war,

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.480
 suddenly all of the lifts stopped working,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.280
 and they said, "Oh no, you're gonna have to walk up the stairs now."

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.440
 And he was like, "Oh, I'm not gonna do it then."

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.760
 - They were jeopardised, weren't they?

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.360
 The resistance cut all the lift cables in the Eiffel Tower,

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.680
 and there's someone who admitted to it,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.480
 and the end he wrote a book and said,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.600
 "It was me, I cut the cables in the Eiffel Tower

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.960
 to make the Nazis look like idiots."

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.880
 - But at the time they just said,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.320
 "Oh no, it's just not working."

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.800
 And then the day after he left, they're like,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.800
 "Oh, it's working again."

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.080
 (audience laughing)

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.520
 - Jeremy Corbyn can climb four flights of stairs

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.840
 faster than anyone else in the Labour Party.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.840
 (audience laughing)

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.160
 - That's not true. - Proof me wrong.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.160
 (audience laughing)

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.920
 - The fact that the Labour Party's wasting time

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.280
 figuring this out doesn't go a long way to explain it.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.120
 - Why are you saying that?

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.960
 I don't understand.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.800
 Is it a race they do?

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.640
 - He's not saying it.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.040
 It's according to his deputy, Tom Watson.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.200
 - Yeah, Tom Watson can do it that fast, can he?

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.800
 - No, but he didn't say it just,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.680
 he didn't say it was just faster than me, Tom Watson.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.680
 He said anyone else, I think in the parliamentary party,

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.160
 not the 500,000-strong membership,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.040
 but maybe anyway.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.080
 (audience laughing)

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.360
 - Do you know the most number of stairs

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.520
 climbed on your head?

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.360
 - What?

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.200
 - Oh.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.000
 - So you're on your head, you're like doing a headstand.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.840
 - Yeah.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.240
 - And then you have to bounce off onto the next step

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.360
 and you keep going up and how many can you do in a row

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.840
 while someone will drag on?

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.160
 - 15, 15, six.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.680
 - It's 36.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.680
 Do you know what the most stairs tumbled down

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.920
 in a stunt fall is?

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.760
 - Mm-hmm.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.600
 - Oh, cool.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.000
 - Do you reckon it's more or less than 36?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.240
 - It's more.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.240
 - I'll say it less.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.320
 - No, you were wrong to say that.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.880
 It was 134.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.880
 - Ooh.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.720
 - Yeah.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.720
 Do you know what the most consecutive stairs

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.480
 climbed along Juggling the Footballers?

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.320
 - Oh, Jesus.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.160
 - No.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.080
 - Are we to the part of the book

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.720
 where it stopped being interesting now?

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.040
 (audience laughing)

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.480
 - It's 4,698.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.280
 - Sorry, that was the climbing stairs juggling a football.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.120
 But it's a bit of a cheat

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.280
 'cause he just went of the same 18 stairs lots of times.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.560
 - Wait, Juggling a football?

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.960
 - Yeah, with your feet.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.160
 - I can keep your feet.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.000
 - Oh, that, sorry.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.520
 I thought you meant he was juggling one football

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.360
 with his hands.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360
 (audience laughing)

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.800
 I think I could do that.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.640
 (audience laughing)

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.720
 - I don't think you could.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.640
 I don't think you could go at 4,600 steps.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.120
 No wonder what the football's doing.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.440
 (audience laughing)

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.960
 And one more, most consecutive stairs climbed

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.720
 while balancing a person on your head.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.560
 Ah.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.320
 So you're walking up and it's like

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.680
 as if there's a mirror on your head

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.000
 'cause there's another person directly above you.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.840
 - What is it?

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.320
 - Are they standing on their head on your head?

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.640
 - Yeah, their head is on your head.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.120
 - And they're upside down.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.120
 - All right.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.960
 - What's the number?

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.120
 - 90.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:34.960
 - It's impressive.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.800
 - 90.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.640
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.480
 - More than the guy who just did it on his head.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.320
 - Yeah.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.160
 - Wow.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.600
 - I would say that is much easier.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.320
 They're still doing it on their feet.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.920
 - He has a man upside down on his head.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.440
 (audience laughing)

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.000
 - Well, these, 'cause do you guys know

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.600
 about competitive self-climing?

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.320
 - No.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.480
 - Which is, this is a really a growing sport.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.960
 So it's like an official sport.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.840
 There's this global circuit of competitive stair climbers.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.640
 They call themselves the most difficult sport

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.160
 that no one's ever heard of.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.320
 And it's basically they have these events all over the world

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.880
 where they race up really tall buildings.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.320
 So the three main races are in the US,

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.880
 the Empire State Building, Sears Tower and US Bank Tower.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.200
 And they have this big Facebook group

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.680
 and they call each other step brothers and step sisters,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.680
 which is real clever.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.440
 But they take it super seriously.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.480
 So like the men shave their legs and shave their head.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.760
 So they're more streamlined going up the stairs.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.760
 They wear glasses.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.960
 - That can't make much of a difference, I'll cut it.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.360
 - 'Cause you're in a stairwell.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.040
 There's gonna be that much air resistance.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:37.880
 - I guess so.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.720
 - Yeah.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.560
 - There's still air, isn't there?

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.400
 - There's still air.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.560
 - Although one thing they say is that

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.680
 the air in stairwells is actually quite bad.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.360
 So you get this really bad smoke

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.880
 as hacking cough as you're going up

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.120
 because the air's really dry.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.080
 So they recommend that you suck on a fruit suite

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.600
 or a lozenge as you're running up,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.480
 which I would have thought is a massive choking hazard

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.080
 as your sprinting up says.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.280
 - You must be absolutely exhausted

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.280
 by the time you get to the top.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.440
 - It's really tiring.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.160
 - That's true, a lot of spots so actually.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.000
 - Yeah.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.840
 - Like.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.080
 (audience laughs)

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.480
 - But then at the end of this,

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.360
 you've got to climb on top of another set of stairs.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.520
 - To podium.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.360
 - Yeah.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.360
 - Do you think some people kind of cheat

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.080
 and at the end, they pretend they've come second

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.760
 and then they race to the top one of the podium

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.600
 in the last minute.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.440
 - Corribate?

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.280
 (audience laughs)

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.520
 - We need to move on to our next facts very soon.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.680
 You guys got anything before we do?

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.000
 - This is massively off topic.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.840
 - Yeah.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.000
 - Just, I was reading about going upstairs two at a time

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.840
 and there's a guardian.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.360
 - That's quite on topic actually.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.200
 - Just you wait.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.720
 (audience laughs)

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.040
 - There's a guardian, notes and queries,

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.720
 you know, where they get questions from the public

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.040
 and they're really interesting questions.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.000
 And one of them was is taking the stairs two at a time.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.760
 Good for us.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.920
 And I looked up a few other notes and queries things.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.120
 One of them is, is it actually possible

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.320
 to take a photograph of a river?

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.080
 'Cause it moves, so, you know, what have you photographed?

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.920
 Right?

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.760
 (audience laughs)

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.600
 - It's genius.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.440
 It's genius.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.280
 - That's not genius.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.120
 - It's never again.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.640
 That bit of water is never there again.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.400
 - But that's true of time.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.960
 Like, if I take a photo of you now,

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.960
 then time has moved on and you're gonna be older

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.800
 than you are.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.120
 - That's one of the most popular answers.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.120
 (audience laughs)

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.920
 - Is it okay to do the crossword in the newspaper

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.480
 for cafe customers?

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.960
 Is it weird to be talking to myself so much?

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.440
 (audience laughs)

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.840
 And how many layers of paint would I need to apply

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.160
 to make opposite walls touch?

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.000
 (audience laughs)

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.640
 - I think the last layer is gonna be quite hard to do, isn't it?

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.640
 (audience laughs)

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.840
 - Just paint to yourself, not into a car, no, but into it.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.840
 (audience laughs)

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.440
 - All right, let's move on to our next bag.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.880
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.920
 - Okay, my fact this week is that there's a tanning salon

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.480
 in St. Andrews called Sun Tandrews.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.480
 (audience laughs)

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.360
 Now, don't get too excited, guys,

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.240
 because when I say verse,

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.760
 it's THERP apostrophe S, and it's short for there was,

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.760
 (audience laughs)

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.000
 because I check Google today,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.040
 and it's not there anymore.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.880
 - Wow.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.360
 - It's now a tanning salon called Abbott Hattan.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.560
 - What? - No, I don't get it.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.800
 A beta tan, a beta tan?

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.640
 - Oh, a beta tan?

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.880
 - A beta tan, yeah, a beta tan, actually.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.360
 It's still not great though, is it?

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.000
 - No, it's no Sun Tandrews, which is genius.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.960
 - It is, but this is just a fact, this was told to me

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.360
 by our colleague, Anne Miller,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.560
 who used to live up here,

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.920
 used to live in St. Andrews,

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.280
 and I just think it's awesome.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.480
 And I thought we could talk about maybe Sun Tans

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.360
 and tanning salons and stuff like that.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.560
 - We should, although I think we should say for Anne Miller's sake,

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.640
 that I don't think she's ever been in a tanning salon.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.960
 I don't want people to get the impression

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.560
 that she was on the sunbed every day.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.280
 - She's got a life for a pun, hasn't she?

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.600
 - She's got a life for a pun.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.400
 She's been in the punning salon, yeah.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.400
 (audience laughs)

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.000
 - There's a cool pun one in Edinburgh,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 and maybe you guys will know if this still exists,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.440
 but so there's a property shop,

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.000
 and it's called the property shop,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.080
 and right next to it, someone set up a cafe

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.040
 called the property shop, and so that just...

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.040
 (audience laughs)

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.400
 - It's the same company, it's in Stockbridge, isn't it?

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.160
 It's the same, so it was a state agency,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.840
 and it was the same guy said, let's have a cafe.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.680
 - Oh really?

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.880
 - It's cool. - It's hard of our thing, yeah.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.720
 - Okay, cool.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.440
 - On Sun Tans, I found out that,

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.760
 so obviously getting a Sun Tant is bad for you,

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.120
 in lots of ways, and there's no way of getting a tan

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.680
 without doing damage to the skin,

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.240
 as in the protection that you get in future,

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.000
 is the damage that you do,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.840
 except that there is a team at Massachusetts General Hospital,

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.440
 and they have invented a drug, which you can take,

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.240
 which will give you a Sun Tant, with no Sun.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.640
 - Wow. - Nice.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.440
 - And this is amazing, it produces melanin,

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.680
 which is the thing that protects you from skin cancer,

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.680
 and it could provide the elixir of tanning a red-haired tan.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.040
 - Oh. - Yeah, you could have,

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.880
 'cause people with red hair, they have a genetic mutation,

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.120
 which disrupts the process,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.280
 and makes it very hard for people with red hair to tan,

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.400
 this could create a big gray and...

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.400
 - Oh, wow.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.560
 (audience laughs)

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.840
 - That's very cool.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.120
 - Do you know, 'cause it is bad for you,

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.400
 and there's been a lot of publicity,

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.840
 now recently about it, you have to get your fingerprints checked

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.840
 in a lot of tanning salons,

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.320
 so like the tanning salon, the tanning shop,

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.160
 which has a lot of branches over the UK,

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160
 you're fingerprinted, and if you've come in

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.640
 and get before that day, they don't let you in.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.800
 - Oh, really? - Wow.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.640
 - Yeah. - That's quite good.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.200
 - These tanning salons and airports.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.760
 - But actually people didn't really care about,

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.160
 like, Sun Tant's did they, for ages and ages and ages,

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.240
 because basically having a Sun Tant meant that you were poor

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.840
 and you worked outside, you were a labourer,

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.280
 and so it was always thought that if you had light skin,

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.440
 it was better.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.240
 But then Coco Chanel accidentally got tanned

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.360
 when she went on a Mediterranean cruise in 1923,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.960
 and suddenly always everyone thought,

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.960
 this is the thing that we all need to have now.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.120
 So it's quite a relatively new thing.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.960
 - Yeah.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.440
 - You know, when Sun Tant's got popular,

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.000
 after the Coco Chanel incident,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.880
 then obviously a lot of kind of merchandise popped up

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.560
 around them, and popular science wrote an article

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.720
 about all the weird Sun Tanting technologies

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.440
 that have been invented since kind of 1920s, 1930s,

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.120
 and there were some crazy stuff people were doing.

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:21.160
 So in 1938, it wrote about a rotating Sun tub,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.720
 which is basically a tent that you brought to the beach,

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.800
 and it had like huge wooden kind of structure

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.920
 that you had to bring to the beach, and you erected it,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.520
 and it followed the Sun's movements.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.880
 So you lay inside it and you had a little steering wheel,

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.400
 and so you could steer the tent to point you

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.400
 towards the Sun.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.920
 - That's a really good idea.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.480
 - It's incredible.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.160
 - So you're in the wooden structure,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.760
 but there's a gap of sunlight for your body.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:45.600
 - Exactly.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.480
 - But are you kind of steering it towards the Sun,

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.960
 or does it do it automatically?

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.680
 - You have to steer.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.240
 - But you've got to do something.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.160
 Otherwise, it's boring.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.240
 - Fair enough.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.040
 You can get bacon smelling sunscreen.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:58.880
 - Why would you want that?

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.880
 - Well, because lots of people like bacon.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.360
 - Yeah.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.120
 - According to the website of this thing,

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.040
 science has shown us that 10 out of 10 people

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.080
 prefer the smell of bacon to coconut.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.920
 - Sorry.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.000
 (audience laughing)

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.640
 - Can't argue with science, Andy.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.120
 (audience laughing)

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.880
 - 10 out of 10, including vegetarian's and vegans.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.640
 - The smell, the smell of bacon.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.680
 - Is this another study done

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.400
 by one of Jeremy Corbyn's Cabinet?

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.920
 (audience laughing)

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.920
 - Very questionable.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.640
 - Last year, KFC sold sunscreen which smelled of KFC.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.160
 - Oh, yeah.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.600
 - It would protect your skin while the real fried chicken scent

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.480
 leaves you smelling delicious.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.880
 (audience laughing)

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.760
 They had 3,000 tubes and everyone was disappointed

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.760
 'cause they sold out in two hours.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.280
 But luckily, they learned the lesson

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.680
 and that was the last time KFC ever ran out of anything.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.520
 Ever again.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.520
 (audience laughing)

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.320
 - Speaking of artificial tanning,

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.720
 sometimes people can overdo it.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.400
 I just wanted to share this headline from the mail.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.640
 A young mother claims she was housebound for a week

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.080
 after a fake tan fail, left her looking,

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.960
 like she'd bathed in chocolate spread,

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.000
 with pals even mistaking her for a brown leather sofa.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.840
 (audience laughing)

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.680
 - That is, I mean, what, like, guys, stop sitting on me.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.160
 What are you doing?

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.160
 Did it change her whole body shape?

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.000
 - I don't know.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.440
 - It's interesting, the methods that people used to go

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.200
 about to try and get a tan back in the day.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.320
 And I read about one which I think people still occasionally

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.880
 try, which is to use tea bags.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.000
 So, what you do is just put a lot of tea bags

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.800
 into a hot bath, and you would get in the bath,

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.600
 and you would allow that to cook you into a pot.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.360
 - Have you put the milk in first?

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.000
 (audience laughing)

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.240
 They didn't say in the article.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.080
 - I heard that that was done in the wall,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.560
 where women wanted a tan, but obviously,

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.240
 there's no way of getting a tan,

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.080
 'cause you can't go on holiday in Greece anymore.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.920
 - What's the big problem there are people

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.080
 close to the Nazis?

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.080
 - Oh, yeah.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:00.920
 (audience laughing)

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.560
 - I knew I hated those guys.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.440
 But the thing I read is that, for people who try it these days,

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.280
 when they do it in a bath, they come across the same problem,

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.480
 which is how do you tan your face,

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.200
 because that's above water.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.400
 And in order to tan it, you need to be underwater

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.520
 for a long time.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.720
 So, a bunch of people bought snorkels, which they tried.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.720
 (audience laughing)

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.520
 But, that was just weird then, when they put it.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.760
 - I think once you've got us far as getting in a bath

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.160
 with a lot of tea bags, looking weird

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.480
 with the snorkels, at least you.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.920
 - But I think it's always a point where you go

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.640
 for no two-five, this is.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.840
 - And so, what did they work any for now in the end of,

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.680
 they should not be able to do that?

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.520
 - No, they'll just don't do it anymore.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.800
 - Well, the person in the article had a very white head

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.240
 regretted the whole experience.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.440
 But yeah, you then just do it outside of the bath,

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.480
 you just leave tea bags all over yourself.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.920
 (audience laughing)

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.720
 - Of course.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.400
 - It's a thing, it's a thing, yeah.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.400
 - Well, they also used to have milk spray,

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.040
 'cause people thought that milk could tan you better,

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.960
 stop me from burning, but give you a really nice tan,

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.200
 and there were motorized milk sprayers that, like,

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.840
 groups of mainly women in the 1930s would carry

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.800
 to wherever they wanted to tan on holiday,

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.400
 and like it was this big engine,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.480
 and then you stood in front of it,

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.440
 and it just showered you with milk.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.440
 And then you go on nice, even tan.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.640
 I like this, the Daily Mail, that spoke to some people

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.600
 about how bad it is, but it's loved to get really burned,

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.120
 and it found that eight, 10 million British people

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.400
 said that they burned every time they went on holiday,

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.280
 which is a large proportion of the population,

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.600
 and the person the mail interviewed to talk about this

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.200
 was a spokesman for Superdrug, chemist,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.880
 and he was called Martin Crisp.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.880
 (audience laughing)

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.720
 - Hi.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.160
 - We're gonna have to move on to our next hack soon.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.520
 - There's a planet called Kepler-13AB,

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.600
 where it rains sun cream.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.440
 - What?

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.280
 - What brand?

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.320
 (audience laughing)

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.800
 - It's kind of a titanium oxide precipitation,

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.520
 but it only falls on the dark side of the planet,

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.080
 so it's completely useless.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.080
 (audience laughing)

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.880
 - Just quickly, I was looking at some beauty salon stuff,

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.160
 you know, tanning salons.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.280
 Do you guys know about snail salons?

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.120
 - No.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.280
 - So snail slime is the new thing in beauty treatments.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.200
 It's really popular in, so places like Thailand

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.080
 and Japan, in Italy it's popular,

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.880
 and people who are running snail farms,

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.680
 because snail is obviously eaten all over the world,

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.480
 are diversifying their farms,

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.080
 and they hand select a few snails on the farm

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.040
 to be transferred to the salon,

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.240
 and then you book a session in the salon as a woman,

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.560
 you lie down, and you get a few snails on your face,

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.360
 just crawling all over it,

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.440
 and the claim is that it heals like your acne or scars

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.720
 or it slows down aging.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.800
 - I've actually tried this.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.640
 - Have you really?

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.480
 - It's good.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.560
 The service is unbelievably slow.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.560
 (audience laughing)

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.280
 - All right, let's move on, let's move on to our next hack.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.000
 It's time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.120
 - My fact is that during the second mobile,

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.560
 the US government considered making all American shoes

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.200
 deliberately ugly.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.600
 (audience laughing)

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.760
 So, this is the thing to do with rationing.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.400
 They were very low on rubber, very low on leather,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.720
 and they thought, "Well, how are we gonna do this?"

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.520
 Eventually, they decided to introduce shoe rationing.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.040
 They said, "Everybody can only have three pairs of shoes

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.120
 "a year, and if you wanted that extra pair of shoes,

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.880
 "you had to fill in a really long complicated form,

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.360
 "saying why you want more shoes."

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.680
 But you could only, as a manufacturer, make four colors,

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.280
 and you could only have two different tones on a shoe.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.040
 So, rationing was introduced, but the alternative plan

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.120
 that they did consider, I think, before rejecting it was,

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.520
 let's just make shoes really, really horrible.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.840
 - Some people don't want to buy them.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.680
 - Exactly.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.880
 - And the four colors that they were allowed were

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.520
 black, white, army, russet, and town, brown.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.680
 - Town. - Town, town, town.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.520
 Like a place where people live.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.520
 - Old tower.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.000
 - No, town, town. - No, town, town.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.440
 (audience laughing)

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.600
 Town.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.400
 - You know, when people live in a tower.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.400
 (audience laughing)

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.200
 - Sorry, I heard town, like the thing you rub yourself with.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.680
 - No, town. - Town, town.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.840
 - Town. - Town, yeah.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.160
 - Like a city without a cathedral?

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.000
 - Yes. - Right.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 (audience laughing)

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.160
 - Oh, why didn't you say that?

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.760
 (audience laughing)

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.360
 - So, do you say that two tone colors on shoes weren't allowed?

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.720
 - That was the maximum.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.400
 - Oh. - You couldn't have three tone shoes.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.120
 - Really, I saw that you could only have single tone,

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.320
 you couldn't have double tone.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.320
 - Oh, maybe wrong.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.960
 - You weren't allowed boots taller than 10 inches

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.880
 and you weren't allowed heels taller than two

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.200
 and five eighths inches.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.160
 And you weren't allowed fancy tongues.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.000
 - Mm-hmm. - No.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.720
 - You also. - Tongs.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.560
 - Tongs. - Sorry.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.560
 - No. - Tongs?

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.400
 - Sorry.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.720
 (audience laughing)

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.960
 - Tung, like a tongue. - Tung, yeah.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.040
 Sorry, it's my accent.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.880
 I know I do say the word tongue wrong,

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.320
 but it's the thing inside your mouth

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.480
 that you lick stuff with.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.440
 (audience laughing)

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.240
 - I don't know what I had to say this for everything now,

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.480
 and I say from now on.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.960
 (audience laughing)

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.200
 - Sorry, now it's a word that means you're not sure.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.240
 - But when you say tongues,

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.000
 you are referring to the thing on your shoe.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 - Sorry, yeah. - You're not saying

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.680
 you're not allowed elaborate tongues in your mouth.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.840
 - That was the thing, they were rationed

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.120
 during the second mobile, fancy tongues.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.160
 (audience laughing)

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.880
 - There was another thing where you could get

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.960
 a cheaper version of a shoe that would cost you less

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.600
 of your ration coupons, your clothing coupons that you had.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.680
 And it was a shoe that was designed with a wooden sole.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.800
 So, the problem with that is you get no bend

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.440
 as you're lifting up your foot,

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.600
 like any shoe that anyone is wearing in this room has,

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.600
 and so you would have to reinvent the way of how you walk

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.800
 with your shoe to avoid--

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.240
 - Okay, and the moment you're kind of

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.560
 waddling left and right, is that how they did it?

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.760
 - I mean, I'm putting myself into the place

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.760
 of the person with the shoe, and that's how I feel.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.120
 - The shoes don't bend, is that the problem?

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.240
 - Yeah. - 'Cause it's a wooden bottom.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.920
 - Just like a clog, I mean, with many with clogs.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.200
 Like a clog, thank you Anna, yeah.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.080
 - But people with clogs get around, okay, don't they?

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.920
 Nope, what? (audience laughing)

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.440
 What they then had to do is in order to make that

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.600
 a bit more of a useful shoe, they then cut a bit

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.160
 and they put a hinge in so that you could then walk,

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.080
 and the hinge would allow you the bend.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.920
 The problem is, is that while you were walking,

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.480
 the hinge would collect stones,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.160
 and so you would be stuck in the hinge position

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.480
 in a sort of leaning forward position.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.560
 Like the Michael Jackson lean.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.720
 - Yeah, 'cause he invented shoes, didn't he,

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.040
 that let him do that lean?

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.280
 - He did. - And he owned a patent for those shoes.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.120
 - Yeah.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.800
 - And they were, they kind of, I think you're allowed to say,

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.960
 they kind of, there was a bit in the stage,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.800
 and he kind of slotted them into the stage

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.440
 so that he could lean right forward,

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.000
 and he owned the patent for that thing.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.120
 - Which is weird, 'cause that's not really inventing a shoe,

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.200
 that's inventing a strap on the floor of a stage

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.200
 to put a shoe into. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.880
 - I thought though it had weights in it as well,

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.240
 I thought that it literally, you moved in a certain way,

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.160
 it kicked in a weight into function

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.080
 so that when you went forward, that would balance you as well.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:52.920
 - Yeah, might be.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.640
 - I don't, I've not followed the Michael Jackson shoe patent

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.200
 paper close enough.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.760
 - Do you know you can get shoes for your shoes now?

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.960
 - What?

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.680
 - This has been shown off at, I think,

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.600
 Paris Men's Fashion Week in the last couple of months.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.160
 Issues for your shoes have been designed.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.880
 They've been designed by a Chinese fashion designer

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.440
 called Sanquans, and it sneakers

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.480
 that then have kind of an outer layer, which is a sandal,

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.800
 and you can velcro the sandal on and off.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.120
 And it's so that, you know, if you're going out on dirty street

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.760
 and you've got new shoes, you don't have to get the shoes dirty.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.440
 - Yeah, but you just want about your outer shoes.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.960
 They're going to get dirty, I'm going to go through.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.080
 - The person did comment.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.160
 He said, we haven't got the triple layer stage yet,

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.520
 but who knows what the future holds.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.640
 - Well, I could tell you what it holds,

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.400
 the fourth layer of the triple layer.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.400
 (audience laughing)

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.520
 - God, it's the branding.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.280
 - Well, so that's a big thing in Japan, isn't it?

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.560
 So in Japan, it's very employed the way your shoes

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.520
 into someone's house.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.240
 Everyone takes off their shoes as soon as you get to

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.640
 a someone's house or a restaurant or whatever,

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.800
 and they give you a pair of slippers.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.480
 And it's very nice, and you walk around the restaurant

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.240
 in the slippers, and it's great, except that when you go

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.000
 to the Lou in the restaurant, they have to take you

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.560
 out of your normal slippers and put you

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.160
 in special toilet slippers.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.600
 And there's a real risk of social embarrassment

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.920
 that once you've been to the toilet,

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.160
 you then forget to take off your toilet slippers.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.000
 - Ah!

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:13.840
 - Because they're very different.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.680
 They look very different.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.960
 So one writer said, he walked back into a fancy restaurant

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.920
 wearing a pair of bright yellow slippers

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.120
 with a duck having a poo on the toes.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.120
 (audience laughing)

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.840
 And that was the design.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.760
 - And that was a picture of a duck having a poo on the sole.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.600
 - Yeah, it was.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.960
 (audience laughing)

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.800
 Yeah.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.120
 - In 13th century Italy.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.480
 So do you know my favorite fact about shoes?

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.760
 I've said it loads of times.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.320
 And that is in the 14th century,

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.440
 it was made explicitly illegal in France

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.680
 to make shoes that were shaped like penises.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.520
 - Yes.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.360
 - Okay.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.200
 I found out quite recently that Queen Mary made it illegal

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.560
 to make shoes shaped like vaginas.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.000
 - No way.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.520
 Oh my god, your two favorite facts can get married.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.920
 That's so nice.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.880
 (audience laughing)

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.560
 Or at least have sex with each other.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.120
 (audience laughing)

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.960
 - So in this all began in 13th century Italy

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.200
 and there was a thing, it was the cult of the Virgin Mary

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.480
 and basically everyone walked better

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.600
 way to pay tribute to the Virgin Mary.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.920
 (audience laughing)

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.800
 - Well, it wasn't like the Catholic church hated it,

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.200
 basically, so it was like a cult.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.600
 It wasn't like a, it wasn't just a thing.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.880
 Everyone liked the Virgin Mary, it was a cult, you think.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.080
 And they suddenly became really paid a lot of attention

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.280
 to the form of the perfect female body,

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.440
 which was supposed to be what the Virgin Mary had.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.280
 And so they invented these shoes

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.160
 and they were called duck spill shoes, they were really wide.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.280
 They were covered, they were heavily padded,

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.880
 they were covered in hair like material

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.200
 and they put slits in them

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.860
 and you wore pink hosiery

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:54.560
 and as you walked it was supposed to look like a vagina.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.400
 - Right.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.240
 - Wow.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.080
 - That is amazing.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.320
 - And this was high fashion in 13th century Italy.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.160
 - No.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.200
 - And then when Queen Mary came to the Crown in Britain,

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.960
 she wanted to curry favor with the Pope

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.720
 and so she banned them.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.040
 - I, it was supposed to look like a vagina.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.040
 - Yep.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:13.880
 - And the.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.720
 - Why?

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.560
 (audience laughing)

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.120
 - It was a hairy shoe that had a little slit

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.760
 which like pink sometimes.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.000
 - So hang on.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:23.840
 - Were the...

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.400
 (audience laughing)

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.920
 - Were the shoes just an act to me, guys?

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.840
 - Yeah, no, sure.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.360
 - So were the penis shoes a response to the vagina shoes?

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.480
 People saying sort of as a prank, you know?

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.400
 - No, no, no.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.440
 - My understanding is it's a complete coincidence

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.040
 that these two things come into this.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.040
 - I believe so.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.040
 - That's amazing.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.920
 - The gender wall was fought in a very different way

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.760
 in the Middle Ages.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.760
 - Some other World War II shoes that I found

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.280
 is there's a shoe that they were sort of invented

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.840
 to trick the enemy.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:01.200
 So the shoe would leave the footprints of the shoe

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.600
 would leave a barefoot footprint.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.600
 So it looked as if one of the locals had been in the area

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.200
 as opposed to a soldier who had a big boot.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.440
 So on the bottom of the boot was just the shape of a foot.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.440
 So we...

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.640
 - But locals wore the shoes.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.960
 (audience laughing)

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.720
 - This was Southeast Asia.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.560
 - Okay, yeah.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.560
 - I should have said the place.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.920
 - Did they make the footprints in the opposite direction

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.760
 to where you were walking?

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.600
 That would be clever.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.280
 - That would be very clever, yeah.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.800
 - We've said before some people did that

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.800
 or supposedly Australian outlaws put their horses shoes

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.800
 on backwards.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.640
 - You're right.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.520
 - So you don't think, oh, Nick Kelly's been through this way

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.600
 or has actually, Nick Kelly had been through this way

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.960
 but he was heading the other way.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.120
 But this is also in Bhutan, they say that yetis

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.960
 have the ability to take their foot off

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.280
 and put it on that way round.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.760
 (audience cheering)

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.080
 That's an actual Yeti fact.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.920
 - Yeah.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.200
 - I do know the fact about animals in your shoes.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.400
 - Right, yeah, as a few years ago, scientists put boots

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.520
 onto dung beetles to find out how they cope with heat.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.040
 This is so cool.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:05.080
 So dung beetles, they find a ball of poo

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.680
 and they roll it around and every so often,

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.320
 when it gets to the really hot bit of the day,

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.240
 they climb up on top of the ball of poo

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.720
 and then they rest there for a bit.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.200
 And scientists wondered, is that because it's really hot

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.920
 on the scientific desert where they're walking around?

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.760
 - Ah.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.760
 - So if you put boots on a dung beetle,

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.920
 you will theoretically find out whether that's the reason.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.760
 - Ah, yeah.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.400
 - And the scientists put, I think it was

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.720
 little silicon shoes on the dung beetles

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.240
 and they said afterwards, turns out,

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:37.240
 it's very, very, very difficult to shoe a dung beetle.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.400
 (audience laughing)

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.720
 'Cause they did, they managed it.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.400
 They got the boots on them and it turns out, yes.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.120
 When you have boots on as a dung beetle,

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.640
 you stop much less to climb onto your ball.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.640
 So that is why.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.960
 - Could it be that they don't want to get on their dung

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.440
 in case they get shit on the shoes?

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.600
 - Ah, yeah.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600
 (audience laughing)

00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.320
 - They're actually working on a set of new outer shoes

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.200
 for the dung beetles in a shoe.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.200
 (audience laughing)

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.680
 I read that in plow.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.480
 There's a tradition of when people go into the reef

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.720
 and they're going fishing and so on.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.520
 What they do is they take a sea sea cucumbers

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.120
 and they squeeze the internals of the sea cucumber out

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.040
 completely so the guts and everything go out

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.160
 and then they wear the rubbery shell on the reef

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.240
 so they don't cut their feet when they're in the reefs.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.880
 Improvised nature shoes.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:31.320
 - Why not just put some wetsuit feet on before you start diving?

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:34.120
 - No, this is in plow where they don't have necessarily.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.480
 - Oh, they're just fishing and so on and so on.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.560
 - The sea cucumber can eviscerate its organs.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.080
 That's the thing that they do.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.760
 But they stay alive after they do that.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.040
 So this feels a bit...

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.280
 - Oh god, I live while you're wearing them.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.120
 - What?

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.640
 - Well, they can stay alive because they regrow them

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.560
 and what they do is they kind of send out their organs

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.880
 and then hopefully like the fish eats the organs

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.960
 and they can swim away.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.400
 - Oh my god, can you imagine at the end of the day

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.040
 being a sea cucumber going,

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.840
 you're not going to believe what happens to me.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.760
 (audience laughing)

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.760
 - But also the anus of the sea cucumber

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.360
 which is where you're putting your foot.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.200
 - Yeah.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.840
 - Is they have fish living in those anuses.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.120
 So you might get fish in your feet as well.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:15.960
 - That's all right.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.080
 - You've caught a bit of the meal already then.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.280
 - I think if you've got your foot in a sea cucumber's anus,

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.960
 the fact that there's another fish present there

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.360
 adds very little to the overall horror of the situation.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.680
 (audience laughing)

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.640
 - I could do it like, you know, in shopping centers

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.080
 where the fish eat your...

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.400
 - Oh yeah, exactly.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.240
 It's exfoliating as well as being protective.

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.080
 - Yeah, that's great.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.680
 - I've had that once and all I could think

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.000
 while I was having it was reincarnation

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.240
 and just looking at the going,

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.160
 what the fuck did you do in your last life

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.360
 that you have come back to eat my feet?

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.240
 - I had it once and I think I've told you guys this,

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.040
 but I had it once in Cambodia and they had to ask me

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.920
 to take my feet out of the pond

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.440
 'cause you put your feet in with like five other people

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.640
 and my feet are so disgusting

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.560
 that they were all coming to my feet.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.960
 (audience laughing)

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.800
 - No one else is getting their money's worth.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.800
 (audience laughing)

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:11.480
 - It's real, real actually the low point pride wise me.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.200
 (audience laughing)

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.200
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.840
 and that is Chisinski.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.080
 - Yeah, my fact this week is that the etiquette experts

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.520
 de Bretts run classes that teach five-year-olds

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.040
 to have strong handshakes and navigate dinner parties.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.840
 (audience laughing)

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.720
 And this is, so I don't know how many people know

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:36.040
 about de Bretts, but they's basically a sort of guide

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.080
 to being a posh person, I guess.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:42.160
 And they started publishing their etiquette guides in the 1700s

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.400
 and they still go on today

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.120
 and it's kind of teaching people how to perform well socially.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.880
 And they recently started doing these classes

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.360
 which are called Signet Schools.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.040
 And it's for, it's meant to be for six to 12-year-olds I think,

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.120
 but actually there's been such a lot of demand

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.960
 that they're letting in five-year-olds.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.840
 And yeah, they teach them to do things like shake hands well

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.760
 and perform well at dinner party and talk to grownups.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.840
 And it's to teach children of primary school age,

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.160
 of early primary school age, social ease and confidence

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.720
 and charisma and charm to guarantee

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.320
 that they are both invited back to the next play date

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.320
 and successful in interviews.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.320
 (audience laughing)

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.400
 - Who's interviewing a five-year-old?

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.760
 - You know, business is getting really desperate.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.200
 - Well, I've just opened another 19th century factory

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.040
 that I need.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.400
 (audience laughing)

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.560
 - Like school interviews.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.400
 - Yeah.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.240
 - Yeah, all right.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.720
 - So there was a report by one of the mothers

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.040
 who sent her child on this.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.800
 And at the very end of the piece she wrote about it,

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.080
 she gave her review of the whole experience.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.480
 She said, "The pleases and thank yous trip off the tongue

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.360
 "and despite the occasional poop joke

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.000
 "and a little light nose-picking,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.680
 "he's become really quite charming."

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.640
 (audience laughing)

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.680
 - But you do pay for it.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:59.000
 So I think it starts at about 650 pounds for two hours

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.320
 to send your five-year-old to this.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.200
 But yeah, one woman who wrote a blog said,

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.760
 "I think I'd have a really strong handshake at the end of that."

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.680
 (audience laughing)

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.560
 I've got a proper bone crusher.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.680
 (audience laughing)

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.520
 - And that's just the start.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.360
 So the woman who wrote the blog paid 780 for two hours

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.720
 to get her handshaking son back.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.520
 - They saw her coming, didn't they?

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.200
 The normal price is 650 pounds to you, 780.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.640
 (audience laughing)

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.760
 - You know, the depress, the depress offer advice

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.120
 on eating bananas.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.920
 - Do they? - Do they?

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.680
 - It turns out, I think we're all doing it wrong.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.720
 They're coming to the press.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.320
 Apparently, if you'll seated at the table,

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.880
 the correct way to eat a banana is to peel it,

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.640
 then use a fork to cut the flesh into bite-sized pieces.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.840
 In other, more informal situations,

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.760
 we recommend peeling bit by bit

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.560
 and breaking bite-sized bits of the banana off.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.240
 - That's not the way to do it, is it?

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.480
 Do you always see on the internet

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.440
 that you're supposed to eat bananas upside down, aren't you?

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.240
 'Cause that's a way that monkeys do it or something like that.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.000
 I always break it, I always open it in the middle.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.160
 (audience laughing)

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.000
 - Do you?

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.400
 - I actually do do that.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.600
 I open it in the middle and then take the banana out

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.840
 and then eat it without the skin.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.680
 - Right.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.680
 - You're a psychopath.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.520
 - I think.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.560
 (audience laughing)

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.800
 Hang on, do you mean you snap it in too?

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.000
 - No, no, no, you get the banana

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.720
 and you kind of make a little hole in the middle of it

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.840
 and then you open it up and then you pull the banana out

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.120
 and you eat it.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.000
 - I'm sure there are other people who eat it.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.600
 - And then you reattach the skin

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.840
 to make it look like a whole banana.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.760
 You put it back on the shelf

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.440
 and then you leave the supermarket.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.200
 (audience laughing)

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.800
 - There's actually, Debrez has a whole section

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.080
 on difficult foods.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.000
 If you go to the website and enlist all the difficult foods

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.560
 to eat and so one example is grapes,

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.520
 which I always thought were quite an easy food,

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.720
 but a grape show off.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.560
 - Yeah.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.960
 (audience laughing)

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.080
 - No, they're very strict.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.480
 They say don't pick individual grapes from a bunch.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.840
 You have to remove a small bunch from the big bunch

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.280
 and then eat from that using either your fingers

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.640
 or grape scissors.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.480
 (audience laughing)

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.280
 - Grape scissors, I've seen those.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.720
 I've been to a cutlery collecting man's house.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.720
 (audience laughing)

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.560
 - Oh no.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.400
 - He showed me his grape scissors, they're really--

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.240
 - Oh wow.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.080
 - How do they differ from normal scissors?

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:05.920
 - They do not.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.840
 (audience laughing)

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.200
 - Are they quite small or?

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.440
 - They're quite, yeah, they're not massive shears.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.080
 You know, they're small, yeah.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:15.920
 - Why?

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.080
 - I struggled anyway with the my stock.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.200
 - Did he have, 'cause Debrez also says that

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.880
 if you're eating oranges, then if it's semi-difficult to peel,

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.680
 you should cut it in half and eat it with a teaspoon,

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.600
 which I'd never considered doing at all.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.680
 - I don't think anyone does any of this stuff,

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:29.520
 do they really?

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.360
 - No.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.160
 - I have eaten a banana with a knife in fork once

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.320
 and it was actually very nice.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.160
 So.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.640
 - Yeah, but that wasn't because of the way you were eating it, though.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.280
 - You know, you would have tasted the same

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.720
 if it had done my psychopath layer of eating it.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.160
 - No, I'd tell you what, it made me pace myself and enjoy it.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.320
 (audience laughing)

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.320
 Was there a special reason that you decided to try that?

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.160
 - Yeah, it was really odd.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.560
 I was on British Airways coming back from New York

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.480
 and they came and they put a banana down

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.680
 and a knife in fork and they walked away and...

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.680
 (audience laughing)

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:08.640
 It's so I thought I'd better challenge accepted.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.560
 (audience laughing)

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.040
 So, de Bratz also do, they've got some rules

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.200
 for polite social networking.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.600
 So, one they say is, this is I'm guessing for Facebook,

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.360
 think before you poke.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.720
 That's a first suggestion.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.000
 (audience laughing)

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.160
 Always wait 24 hours before accepting

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.920
 or removing someone as a friend.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.200
 The delay will help you gather your thoughts,

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.400
 which is just great philosophy, generally, isn't it?

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.240
 - 750 quid for that one.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.480
 (audience laughing)

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.640
 - No, that actually is a price.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.480
 - What?

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.560
 - 750 quid and it's for 13 to 16 year olds.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.400
 - No way.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.040
 We're just giving it away for free right now.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.040
 As you have got lucky, this is an absolute bargain.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.040
 - The guy who started de Bratz was called John de Bratz

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.400
 and he began his career with de Bratz Parridge,

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.280
 which was a buck about lords and ladies and stuff like that.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.120
 But he got into a huge argument with a guy

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.320
 who actually wrote it and he went bankrupt twice

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.200
 and he only managed to survive thanks to taking

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.360
 a huge amount of money from his wife.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.200
 - Really?

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.880
 - Which they don't teach you that in de Bratz, do they?

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.880
 - They do not.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.040
 - It's encouraged.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.000
 (audience laughing)

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.880
 - They're very strong on Perridge, though,

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.080
 and actually one of them is frequently asked questions.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.720
 One of the most frequent questions that's written

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.080
 into de Bratz is like how to address the royal family

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.520
 as if really anyone's coming up against them personally.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.440
 But they've got very detailed instructions

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.920
 as to how you address them.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.720
 And apparently, if you're writing to,

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.040
 so if you're writing to the queen,

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.880
 then you have to open your letter with,

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.520
 may it please your majesty,

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.680
 and then you have to begin the next sentence

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.240
 with with my humble duty.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.880
 But then if you're writing to other members,

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.280
 it tells you all the initials

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.840
 that have to come after everyone's name.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.680
 So let's say you're writing the Prince of Wales,

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.840
 if you're writing to Prince Charles,

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.040
 you have to say on the envelope to his,

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.160
 that's her royal hyenas, and then on a new line,

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.320
 you say, for example, the Prince of Wales,

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.400
 and then these are the initials that offer's name,

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.400
 KGKT, GCB, O-M-A-K-C-D-Q-S-O-P-C,

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.240
 that's all the things he is.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.840
 It's so great. - Wow.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:10.040
 - GCB is, he's a great master in principal night

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.480
 of the most honorable order of the bath,

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.880
 and that's about how they used to bathe nights.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.560
 So when you were knighted in medieval times,

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.640
 you had a bath first thing you did,

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.480
 and then if you're a great master

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.080
 of the most honorable order of the bath,

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.160
 it's about bathing when you become a knight.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.320
 Isn't that cool? - That's very cool, yeah.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.080
 - He's the only great master.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.760
 - Good for him. - Well done.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.480
 (audience laughing)

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.440
 - I was looking up general etiquette things.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.280
 - Yes, yes.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.720
 - There's a book by an author called Henry Hitchens,

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.120
 and it's called Sorry,

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.440
 and it's about English people and their manners,

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.880
 and he just lists advice from throughout the ages

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.520
 of etiquette varies, obviously,

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.080
 depending on your society.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.880
 So, for example, in the 15th century,

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.400
 the Duke of Gloucester's Usher advised

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.480
 that one should not scratch one's codpiece in public.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.440
 (audience laughing)

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:00.160
 I'm a sayingable.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.840
 Erasmus, the medieval writer,

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.040
 advised that one should cough to disguise a fart.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.680
 (audience laughing)

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.360
 - Erasmus actually, that book that he wrote,

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.520
 it was about children's etiquette, wasn't it?

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.040
 And it was the best-selling book in all of England

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.400
 in the 16th century apart from the Bible.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.560
 - No way.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.400
 - And some of the other things he said was,

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.320
 do not be afraid of vomiting.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.640
 It is not vomiting, but holding the vomiting

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:26.000
 in your throat that is foul.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.240
 - I disagree strongly with that, actually.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.880
 (audience laughing)

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.800
 - If you cannot swallow a piece of food,

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.400
 turn around discreetly and throw it somewhere.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.160
 (audience laughing)

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.600
 - Better don't teach that when you're 650 quink calls,

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.680
 I don't know.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.520
 - Actually, weirdly, did Brett say the opposite

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.520
 so how times have changed?

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.200
 They say a dinner party,

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.720
 when encountering an unexpected piece of gristle

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.760
 or something that may be chewed to no avail,

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.240
 it is polite to be brave and try and swallow it anyway.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.560
 (audience laughing)

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.200
 - Children troke all things.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.080
 - Well, you know you got a suffer for etiquette.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.040
 - I'd love to see the difference between Erasmus

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.880
 and the Brett's, that would be really awesome.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.800
 Another one, do not move back and forth on your chair.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.440
 Whoever does that gives the impression

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.480
 of constantly breaking or trying to break wind.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.480
 (audience laughing)

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:13.320
 - Well James.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.440
 (audience laughing)

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.440
 (audience laughing)

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.440
 (audience laughing)

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.560
 - Hey, we need to wrap up very soon.

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.200
 You guys got anything for you to do?

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.920
 - In Victorian times, women were advised to pinch their fingers

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.200
 so the ends would be nice and pointy.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.280
 (audience laughing)

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.360
 - Do they have what their fingers made of a plasticine?

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.880
 - I guess so.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.800
 - It was just a thought you meant to have nice pointy ends

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.880
 to fingers, nice and tapering, not sort of flat cut off fingers.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.960
 And one writer said that if your fingers are bad,

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.880
 your bad fingers, then just pinch them lots of times

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.360
 all the time.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.200
 - Oh, I know.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.600
 - And women were advised, and this is a thing

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.600
 that happens today, I believe, to fill all gloves with cream

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.640
 and then put on the old gloves full of cream,

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.360
 and then you get a bed at night.

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.880
 And that's the thing that still happens.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:01.880
 - No, it doesn't happen now.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.720
 - No, does anyone hear it?

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.160
 Someone said yes.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.360
 - Yeah, see all women's voices.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.240
 This is a conspiracy, there's a cap from men.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.920
 No men know about this.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.360
 - Guys, what kind of cream is it?

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.760
 Like, I think just any double cream.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.360
 (all laughing)

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:21.400
 This is a thing, I talk my girlfriend about this,

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.960
 and she said, Andy, we all do this all the time.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.400
 You've never paid any attention to anything.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.720
 Why do you think the bed is full of cream every morning?

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.160
 (all laughing)

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.320
 - I've never heard of it, but I'd be so creeped out

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.640
 if my partner was wearing gloves in bed, so.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.240
 - I was so weird.

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.440
 I think they're just on a murder or something.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.840
 (all laughing)

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.880
 - That is quite something, isn't it?

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.240
 But then you're just gonna have nice hands,

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.800
 but what about the rest of your body?

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.920
 You should really be wearing a full body suit.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.600
 - Yes, I'm covering it all in cream.

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.480
 - With a snorkel to keep you breathing.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.240
 (all laughing)

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.160
 - Okay, that is it.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.200
 That is all of our facts.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.920

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.280
 to send us in your favorite fact.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.280
 We've picked a winner and the winner is gonna get a copy

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.160
 of our cassette.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.800
 So we have the fact here.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.640
 - The fact is from Douglas Wood and the fact is this,

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:49.480
 at the first robot Olympics held in 1990 in Glasgow,

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.480
 the English competitor was disqualified from the climbing event

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.680
 because of inappropriate behavior in front of children.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.320
 (audience laughing)

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.720
 It tried to mount the Russian robot.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.720
 (audience laughing)

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.720
 (audience cheering)

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:12.320
 - So we're gonna be out of the back.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.840
 Come and say hi if you wanna cassette.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.840
 Please do get one.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:15.720
 That's all from us.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.560
 Thank you so much.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.360
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.200
 We'll see you again.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.040
 Goodbye.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.040
 (audience cheering)

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.620
 (upbeat music)

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.620
 (audience cheering)

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:31.200
 (upbeat music)
