00:00:00,00:00:02,(bells ringing)
00:00:02,00:00:05,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:05,00:00:07,(bells ringing)
00:00:07,00:00:15,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:15,00:00:18,"of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:00:18,00:00:22,this week coming to you from Edinburgh!
00:00:22,00:00:25,(audience cheering)
00:00:25,00:00:29,My name is Dan Schreiber
00:00:29,00:00:32,"and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,"
00:00:32,00:00:34,"Andrew Hunter-Marie and James Harkin,"
00:00:34,00:00:36,"and once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:36,00:00:39,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:39,00:00:42,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:44,"Starting with fact number one,"
00:00:44,00:00:45,"and that's my fact this week,"
00:00:45,00:00:48,my fact is unmarried people are more likely
00:00:48,00:00:51,to fall down stairs than married people.
00:00:51,00:00:53,(audience laughing)
00:00:53,00:00:56,And previously married people fall down more
00:00:56,00:00:57,than both of them.
00:00:57,00:01:00,(audience laughing)
00:01:00,00:01:03,"- It does, it's not just 'cause they're like,"
00:01:03,00:01:04,"it's my phone's ringing, my phone's ringing,"
00:01:04,00:01:07,"get it, because you're single, you're kind of, you know."
00:01:07,00:01:08,"- Yeah, you're ready for the thing."
00:01:08,00:01:09,"- I don't think we know why, do we?"
00:01:09,00:01:13,"- We don't, so I read this in a Bill Bryson book"
00:01:13,00:01:15,"called At Home, which is a fantastic book"
00:01:15,00:01:18,and he references in the chapter
00:01:18,00:01:21,"which he writes about stairs that he read this one book,"
00:01:21,00:01:25,the only book that is a sort of academic look at staircases
00:01:25,00:01:29,"and it's by John Templer of MIT, it's called The Staircase,"
00:01:29,00:01:32,Studies of Hazards Fall and Safe Designs.
00:01:32,00:01:35,"- Yeah, and I have also read this book, there it is."
00:01:35,00:01:36,- That's it.
00:01:36,00:01:40,"- It is the first theoretical,"
00:01:40,00:01:43,"historical and scientific analysis of the stair,"
00:01:43,00:01:45,according to the blurb.
00:01:45,00:01:47,It is pretty hard going.
00:01:47,00:01:49,(audience laughing)
00:01:49,00:01:51,And actually that was a little joke
00:01:51,00:01:53,for you staircase enthusiasts out there
00:01:53,00:01:57,because the going is the width of a stair.
00:01:57,00:01:59,(audience laughing)
00:01:59,00:02:02,And all of my humour will be staircase based
00:02:02,00:02:03,for the rest of the show.
00:02:03,00:02:04,(audience laughing)
00:02:04,00:02:06,- John Templer's at home pissing himself
00:02:06,00:02:08,on the other end of that.
00:02:08,00:02:11,"- I mean, there's diagrams as, you know,"
00:02:11,00:02:13,loads of tables and stuff like this.
00:02:13,00:02:14,There's tables.
00:02:14,00:02:16,- What are tables doing in the book?
00:02:16,00:02:18,(audience laughing)
00:02:18,00:02:20,- There's like about three or four good facts
00:02:20,00:02:21,in the first four pages
00:02:21,00:02:24,and then the rest of it is just unbelievably tedious.
00:02:24,00:02:25,(audience laughing)
00:02:25,00:02:27,- Did he lead with the unmarried and married tables?
00:02:27,00:02:28,"- Yeah, it's right near the start."
00:02:28,00:02:30,Another thing he says is that notable missteps
00:02:30,00:02:35,"happen once every 2,222 stair uses."
00:02:35,00:02:39,"Minor accidents happen every 63,000 uses."
00:02:39,00:02:44,"Disabling accidents every 734,210 uses."
00:02:44,00:02:49,"Hospital treatments every 3,616,667 uses."
00:02:50,00:02:55,"And deaths every 513,947,300 uses."
00:02:55,00:02:59,And that was one of the least boring.
00:02:59,00:03:02,(audience laughing)
00:03:02,00:03:03,- Do you know why all these accidents happen?
00:03:03,00:03:04,"- No, why?"
00:03:04,00:03:06,"- According to him, it's because every staircase"
00:03:06,00:03:11,is a compromise between going up and going down.
00:03:11,00:03:15,"- Yeah, so you can have staircases"
00:03:15,00:03:18,"which just for people going up, can't you?"
00:03:18,00:03:20,"- Oh no, that would be that would be decadent, wouldn't it?"
00:03:20,00:03:23,(audience laughing)
00:03:23,00:03:25,- His point being that how would you get down again
00:03:25,00:03:26,"as well, think of that."
00:03:26,00:03:27,- I'd have to in my house.
00:03:27,00:03:32,"- Oh, I would have Harman's pole or a slide."
00:03:32,00:03:37,"- Wait, so what do you mean by a compromise?"
00:03:37,00:03:38,Who's compromising with whom?
00:03:38,00:03:39,Who's negotiating here?
00:03:39,00:03:42,- The perfect staircase would be a staircase
00:03:42,00:03:44,that would be able to adapt itself
00:03:44,00:03:46,to whether or not you were going up or down
00:03:46,00:03:49,for the length and the height and so on.
00:03:49,00:03:52,They're built in one way which plays advantage
00:03:52,00:03:53,to either going up or going down.
00:03:53,00:03:56,Very different skills going up and down a staircase.
00:03:56,00:03:57,- Very different.
00:03:57,00:03:59,"- And actually in this book, there are figures"
00:03:59,00:04:03,about how a staircase was if you're going up or down.
00:04:03,00:04:05,"So if you're going up, there's a different"
00:04:05,00:04:07,wearing out of the stair than if you're going down.
00:04:07,00:04:10,- But you would have thought the wearing would be the same
00:04:10,00:04:14,on all staircases unless you've just got a huge stockpile
00:04:14,00:04:16,"of 10,000 people at the top of the stairs at some point."
00:04:16,00:04:18,At some point everyone who goes up stairs
00:04:18,00:04:19,does come down the stairs.
00:04:19,00:04:21,"- I think there are a few like, for instance,"
00:04:21,00:04:24,"if you've got stairs coming up at a dock, say for instance,"
00:04:24,00:04:26,"people might use it for getting off the boat,"
00:04:26,00:04:28,but to get on the boat they might use the pier.
00:04:28,00:04:29,- I see.
00:04:29,00:04:30,- So there are a few little things like that.
00:04:30,00:04:31,"It's very interesting, actually, I don't know."
00:04:31,00:04:34,"- And that's the origin of that saying, isn't it?"
00:04:34,00:04:37,What goes up stairs must come down stairs.
00:04:37,00:04:41,- Women fall downstairs more often than men
00:04:41,00:04:44,or admit to falling downstairs more often than men.
00:04:44,00:04:48,"So 38% of women, compared to 28% of men,"
00:04:48,00:04:50,said they'd fallen downstairs or upstairs
00:04:50,00:04:51,or tripped on stairs in the last year.
00:04:51,00:04:53,"And also weirdly, this was a study that was done"
00:04:53,00:04:55,by the British Woodworking Federation
00:04:55,00:04:58,who relied on for all rigorous scientific studies.
00:04:58,00:05:03,"And their study also found that the northeast of England,"
00:05:03,00:05:05,"so it was a study that discovered England,"
00:05:05,00:05:08,the northeast is the most at risk of falling downstairs.
00:05:08,00:05:11,"So 48% of people there said they'd done it in the last year,"
00:05:11,00:05:15,"whereas Yorkshire and Humber, directly next to the northeast region,"
00:05:15,00:05:18,"had the least incidences, 26%."
00:05:18,00:05:19,What's going on there?
00:05:19,00:05:20,It doesn't make any sense.
00:05:20,00:05:21,"- I don't know, mate."
00:05:21,00:05:23,- I saw a really cool invention the other day
00:05:23,00:05:25,'cause a lot of people are trying to work out
00:05:25,00:05:27,how to stop people if they do fall over
00:05:27,00:05:29,from properly hurting themselves.
00:05:29,00:05:30,So there's this new invention that they're trialing
00:05:30,00:05:34,"at the moment, which is like a big belt that you wear."
00:05:34,00:05:37,And it senses that you're falling over.
00:05:37,00:05:39,"It's a sort of like, this is a movement"
00:05:39,00:05:41,that's not being expected.
00:05:41,00:05:43,"I've gone, as a belt, I've gone over that way."
00:05:43,00:05:47,And what it does is it inflates these massive airbags.
00:05:47,00:05:50,"Speaking of stair-based inventions, that sounds awesome."
00:05:50,00:05:52,There are scientists at Georgia Tech
00:05:52,00:05:56,who have invented some stairs which walk you back.
00:05:56,00:05:57,"- What, that doesn't make any sense?"
00:05:57,00:06:00,"- Well, I understand all those words, but."
00:06:00,00:06:03,"- Well, I've tried to, I've tried to sex it up a bit,"
00:06:03,00:06:05,and I don't think it's succeeded.
00:06:05,00:06:08,"Basically, there are stairs which, as you walk on them,"
00:06:08,00:06:09,"they store your energy,"
00:06:09,00:06:11,"and then when you walk the other way,"
00:06:11,00:06:14,so when you walk down the gravitational force
00:06:14,00:06:16,"of you descending, stalls energy in the stair,"
00:06:16,00:06:19,"and then when you walk back up, it springs you up."
00:06:19,00:06:22,"Every step you take, every move you make."
00:06:22,00:06:25,(audience laughing)
00:06:25,00:06:29,"And when you go back up, it's 37% easier on your knee"
00:06:29,00:06:31,"than it would be normally, so that could be huge."
00:06:31,00:06:34,"- Yeah, and there are shoes that have just been invented"
00:06:34,00:06:36,"to stop people from falling over,"
00:06:36,00:06:38,which I think sound a bit less dramatic
00:06:38,00:06:39,"than embarrassing than the air bag solution,"
00:06:39,00:06:44,because they're just shoes with battery on the back of them
00:06:44,00:06:46,"and a sensor, and they sense when you're starting"
00:06:46,00:06:49,"to have your body weight in the wrong position,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,and they automatically start a little motor
00:06:51,00:06:52,"that slides the shoes backwards,"
00:06:52,00:06:54,so stops you falling over backwards.
00:06:54,00:06:56,- Like your moonwalking. - Wow.
00:06:56,00:06:57,"- Exactly, like moonwalking,"
00:06:57,00:06:59,but only if the option is falling over.
00:06:59,00:07:00,- That's amazing.
00:07:00,00:07:01,"- And the person who invented them said,"
00:07:01,00:07:04,"""It's great because it's not as noticeable as having a stick"
00:07:04,00:07:07,"or a Zimmer frame, which some people don't want to have,"
00:07:07,00:07:09,"""because it makes them feel like they've lost their mobility."""
00:07:09,00:07:12,"And they just look like completely normal shoes,"
00:07:12,00:07:13,"which I watched the video,"
00:07:13,00:07:15,and they've got a large motor on the back of each shoe.
00:07:15,00:07:18,(audience laughing)
00:07:18,00:07:21,- Can I just ask about the staircase giving you the lift again?
00:07:21,00:07:23,"So presumably, if you were walking down,"
00:07:23,00:07:27,it matches your body weight and type
00:07:27,00:07:29,"for what the spring it gives you on the way back up, right?"
00:07:29,00:07:32,"So if I go down the staircase, but then my sun walks up it,"
00:07:32,00:07:34,(audience laughing)
00:07:34,00:07:37,is he not gonna be lobbed to the feet?
00:07:37,00:07:40,"- Because in 1948, an elephant climbed up the stairs"
00:07:40,00:07:41,at the Eiffel Tower.
00:07:41,00:07:42,- No.
00:07:42,00:07:44,"- And then climbed back down again, so imagine that."
00:07:44,00:07:45,- Are you serious? - Really?
00:07:45,00:07:46,- Wow.
00:07:46,00:07:48,"- There used to be a thing that people did in the Eiffel Tower,"
00:07:48,00:07:52,they used to just climb up the stairs in funny ways.
00:07:52,00:07:54,"There was a guy who did it in Stilts,"
00:07:54,00:07:56,"quite famously, a baker."
00:07:56,00:07:59,"And then when Hitler took over Paris in the war,"
00:07:59,00:08:02,"suddenly all of the lifts stopped working,"
00:08:02,00:08:05,"and they said, ""Oh no, you're gonna have to walk up the stairs now."""
00:08:05,00:08:07,"And he was like, ""Oh, I'm not gonna do it then."""
00:08:07,00:08:08,"- They were jeopardised, weren't they?"
00:08:08,00:08:11,"The resistance cut all the lift cables in the Eiffel Tower,"
00:08:11,00:08:12,"and there's someone who admitted to it,"
00:08:12,00:08:14,"and the end he wrote a book and said,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,"""It was me, I cut the cables in the Eiffel Tower"
00:08:16,00:08:17,"to make the Nazis look like idiots."""
00:08:17,00:08:18,"- But at the time they just said,"
00:08:18,00:08:20,"""Oh no, it's just not working."""
00:08:20,00:08:21,"And then the day after he left, they're like,"
00:08:21,00:08:22,"""Oh, it's working again."""
00:08:22,00:08:25,(audience laughing)
00:08:25,00:08:27,- Jeremy Corbyn can climb four flights of stairs
00:08:27,00:08:29,faster than anyone else in the Labour Party.
00:08:29,00:08:33,(audience laughing)
00:08:33,00:08:36,- That's not true. - Proof me wrong.
00:08:36,00:08:40,(audience laughing)
00:08:40,00:08:41,- The fact that the Labour Party's wasting time
00:08:41,00:08:44,figuring this out doesn't go a long way to explain it.
00:08:44,00:08:45,- Why are you saying that?
00:08:45,00:08:45,I don't understand.
00:08:45,00:08:46,Is it a race they do?
00:08:46,00:08:47,- He's not saying it.
00:08:47,00:08:50,"It's according to his deputy, Tom Watson."
00:08:50,00:08:53,"- Yeah, Tom Watson can do it that fast, can he?"
00:08:53,00:08:54,"- No, but he didn't say it just,"
00:08:54,00:08:56,"he didn't say it was just faster than me, Tom Watson."
00:08:56,00:08:58,"He said anyone else, I think in the parliamentary party,"
00:08:58,00:09:02,"not the 500,000-strong membership,"
00:09:02,00:09:04,but maybe anyway.
00:09:04,00:09:06,(audience laughing)
00:09:06,00:09:08,- Do you know the most number of stairs
00:09:08,00:09:10,climbed on your head?
00:09:10,00:09:11,- What?
00:09:11,00:09:12,- Oh.
00:09:12,00:09:14,"- So you're on your head, you're like doing a headstand."
00:09:14,00:09:14,- Yeah.
00:09:14,00:09:16,- And then you have to bounce off onto the next step
00:09:16,00:09:18,and you keep going up and how many can you do in a row
00:09:18,00:09:19,while someone will drag on?
00:09:19,00:09:22,"- 15, 15, six."
00:09:22,00:09:23,- It's 36.
00:09:23,00:09:26,Do you know what the most stairs tumbled down
00:09:26,00:09:27,in a stunt fall is?
00:09:27,00:09:28,- Mm-hmm.
00:09:28,00:09:29,"- Oh, cool."
00:09:29,00:09:31,- Do you reckon it's more or less than 36?
00:09:31,00:09:32,- It's more.
00:09:32,00:09:33,- I'll say it less.
00:09:33,00:09:35,"- No, you were wrong to say that."
00:09:35,00:09:36,It was 134.
00:09:36,00:09:37,- Ooh.
00:09:37,00:09:38,- Yeah.
00:09:38,00:09:39,Do you know what the most consecutive stairs
00:09:39,00:09:41,climbed along Juggling the Footballers?
00:09:41,00:09:42,"- Oh, Jesus."
00:09:42,00:09:43,- No.
00:09:43,00:09:44,- Are we to the part of the book
00:09:44,00:09:45,where it stopped being interesting now?
00:09:45,00:09:48,(audience laughing)
00:09:48,00:09:50,"- It's 4,698."
00:09:50,00:09:53,"- Sorry, that was the climbing stairs juggling a football."
00:09:53,00:09:54,But it's a bit of a cheat
00:09:54,00:09:57,'cause he just went of the same 18 stairs lots of times.
00:09:57,00:09:58,"- Wait, Juggling a football?"
00:09:58,00:09:59,"- Yeah, with your feet."
00:09:59,00:10:01,- I can keep your feet.
00:10:01,00:10:02,"- Oh, that, sorry."
00:10:02,00:10:03,I thought you meant he was juggling one football
00:10:03,00:10:04,with his hands.
00:10:04,00:10:05,(audience laughing)
00:10:05,00:10:06,I think I could do that.
00:10:06,00:10:07,(audience laughing)
00:10:07,00:10:08,- I don't think you could.
00:10:08,00:10:11,"I don't think you could go at 4,600 steps."
00:10:11,00:10:13,No wonder what the football's doing.
00:10:13,00:10:14,(audience laughing)
00:10:14,00:10:16,"And one more, most consecutive stairs climbed"
00:10:16,00:10:19,while balancing a person on your head.
00:10:19,00:10:20,Ah.
00:10:20,00:10:22,So you're walking up and it's like
00:10:22,00:10:23,as if there's a mirror on your head
00:10:23,00:10:26,'cause there's another person directly above you.
00:10:26,00:10:26,- What is it?
00:10:26,00:10:28,- Are they standing on their head on your head?
00:10:28,00:10:29,"- Yeah, their head is on your head."
00:10:29,00:10:31,- And they're upside down.
00:10:31,00:10:32,- All right.
00:10:32,00:10:32,- What's the number?
00:10:32,00:10:34,- 90.
00:10:34,00:10:34,- It's impressive.
00:10:34,00:10:35,- 90.
00:10:35,00:10:36,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:10:36,00:10:38,- More than the guy who just did it on his head.
00:10:38,00:10:39,- Yeah.
00:10:39,00:10:40,- Wow.
00:10:40,00:10:41,- I would say that is much easier.
00:10:41,00:10:43,They're still doing it on their feet.
00:10:43,00:10:47,- He has a man upside down on his head.
00:10:47,00:10:50,(audience laughing)
00:10:50,00:10:52,"- Well, these, 'cause do you guys know"
00:10:52,00:10:53,about competitive self-climing?
00:10:53,00:10:55,- No.
00:10:55,00:10:58,"- Which is, this is a really a growing sport."
00:10:58,00:10:59,So it's like an official sport.
00:10:59,00:11:02,There's this global circuit of competitive stair climbers.
00:11:02,00:11:04,They call themselves the most difficult sport
00:11:04,00:11:06,that no one's ever heard of.
00:11:06,00:11:09,And it's basically they have these events all over the world
00:11:09,00:11:10,where they race up really tall buildings.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"So the three main races are in the US,"
00:11:13,00:11:16,"the Empire State Building, Sears Tower and US Bank Tower."
00:11:16,00:11:19,And they have this big Facebook group
00:11:19,00:11:21,"and they call each other step brothers and step sisters,"
00:11:21,00:11:23,which is real clever.
00:11:23,00:11:25,But they take it super seriously.
00:11:25,00:11:28,So like the men shave their legs and shave their head.
00:11:28,00:11:30,So they're more streamlined going up the stairs.
00:11:30,00:11:31,They wear glasses.
00:11:31,00:11:33,"- That can't make much of a difference, I'll cut it."
00:11:33,00:11:35,- 'Cause you're in a stairwell.
00:11:35,00:11:37,There's gonna be that much air resistance.
00:11:37,00:11:37,- I guess so.
00:11:37,00:11:38,- Yeah.
00:11:38,00:11:39,"- There's still air, isn't there?"
00:11:39,00:11:40,- There's still air.
00:11:40,00:11:41,- Although one thing they say is that
00:11:41,00:11:43,the air in stairwells is actually quite bad.
00:11:43,00:11:45,So you get this really bad smoke
00:11:45,00:11:46,as hacking cough as you're going up
00:11:46,00:11:48,because the air's really dry.
00:11:48,00:11:50,So they recommend that you suck on a fruit suite
00:11:50,00:11:51,"or a lozenge as you're running up,"
00:11:51,00:11:53,which I would have thought is a massive choking hazard
00:11:53,00:11:55,as your sprinting up says.
00:11:55,00:11:58,- You must be absolutely exhausted
00:11:58,00:11:59,by the time you get to the top.
00:11:59,00:12:00,- It's really tiring.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"- That's true, a lot of spots so actually."
00:12:02,00:12:03,- Yeah.
00:12:03,00:12:03,- Like.
00:12:03,00:12:05,(audience laughs)
00:12:05,00:12:06,"- But then at the end of this,"
00:12:06,00:12:09,you've got to climb on top of another set of stairs.
00:12:09,00:12:10,- To podium.
00:12:10,00:12:11,- Yeah.
00:12:11,00:12:14,- Do you think some people kind of cheat
00:12:14,00:12:16,"and at the end, they pretend they've come second"
00:12:16,00:12:17,and then they race to the top one of the podium
00:12:17,00:12:18,in the last minute.
00:12:18,00:12:19,- Corribate?
00:12:19,00:12:22,(audience laughs)
00:12:22,00:12:24,- We need to move on to our next facts very soon.
00:12:24,00:12:25,You guys got anything before we do?
00:12:25,00:12:27,- This is massively off topic.
00:12:27,00:12:27,- Yeah.
00:12:27,00:12:30,"- Just, I was reading about going upstairs two at a time"
00:12:30,00:12:30,and there's a guardian.
00:12:30,00:12:32,- That's quite on topic actually.
00:12:32,00:12:33,- Just you wait.
00:12:33,00:12:35,(audience laughs)
00:12:35,00:12:37,"- There's a guardian, notes and queries,"
00:12:37,00:12:38,"you know, where they get questions from the public"
00:12:38,00:12:40,and they're really interesting questions.
00:12:40,00:12:42,And one of them was is taking the stairs two at a time.
00:12:42,00:12:42,Good for us.
00:12:42,00:12:45,And I looked up a few other notes and queries things.
00:12:45,00:12:48,"One of them is, is it actually possible"
00:12:48,00:12:50,to take a photograph of a river?
00:12:50,00:12:53,"'Cause it moves, so, you know, what have you photographed?"
00:12:53,00:12:53,Right?
00:12:53,00:12:54,(audience laughs)
00:12:54,00:12:55,- It's genius.
00:12:55,00:12:56,It's genius.
00:12:56,00:12:57,- That's not genius.
00:12:57,00:12:58,- It's never again.
00:12:58,00:13:00,That bit of water is never there again.
00:13:00,00:13:02,- But that's true of time.
00:13:02,00:13:03,"Like, if I take a photo of you now,"
00:13:03,00:13:05,then time has moved on and you're gonna be older
00:13:05,00:13:06,than you are.
00:13:06,00:13:08,- That's one of the most popular answers.
00:13:08,00:13:11,(audience laughs)
00:13:11,00:13:15,- Is it okay to do the crossword in the newspaper
00:13:15,00:13:17,for cafe customers?
00:13:17,00:13:19,Is it weird to be talking to myself so much?
00:13:19,00:13:21,(audience laughs)
00:13:21,00:13:23,And how many layers of paint would I need to apply
00:13:23,00:13:26,to make opposite walls touch?
00:13:26,00:13:29,(audience laughs)
00:13:29,00:13:31,"- I think the last layer is gonna be quite hard to do, isn't it?"
00:13:31,00:13:34,(audience laughs)
00:13:34,00:13:38,"- Just paint to yourself, not into a car, no, but into it."
00:13:38,00:13:41,(audience laughs)
00:13:41,00:13:45,"- All right, let's move on to our next bag."
00:13:45,00:13:48,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:13:48,00:13:51,"- Okay, my fact this week is that there's a tanning salon"
00:13:51,00:13:55,in St. Andrews called Sun Tandrews.
00:13:55,00:13:58,(audience laughs)
00:13:58,00:14:04,"Now, don't get too excited, guys,"
00:14:04,00:14:07,"because when I say verse,"
00:14:07,00:14:11,"it's THERP apostrophe S, and it's short for there was,"
00:14:11,00:14:12,(audience laughs)
00:14:12,00:14:15,"because I check Google today,"
00:14:15,00:14:17,and it's not there anymore.
00:14:17,00:14:17,- Wow.
00:14:17,00:14:20,- It's now a tanning salon called Abbott Hattan.
00:14:20,00:14:23,"- What? - No, I don't get it."
00:14:23,00:14:25,"A beta tan, a beta tan?"
00:14:25,00:14:26,"- Oh, a beta tan?"
00:14:26,00:14:28,"- A beta tan, yeah, a beta tan, actually."
00:14:28,00:14:30,"It's still not great though, is it?"
00:14:30,00:14:34,"- No, it's no Sun Tandrews, which is genius."
00:14:34,00:14:36,"- It is, but this is just a fact, this was told to me"
00:14:36,00:14:38,"by our colleague, Anne Miller,"
00:14:38,00:14:39,"who used to live up here,"
00:14:39,00:14:40,"used to live in St. Andrews,"
00:14:40,00:14:42,and I just think it's awesome.
00:14:42,00:14:44,And I thought we could talk about maybe Sun Tans
00:14:44,00:14:46,and tanning salons and stuff like that.
00:14:46,00:14:48,"- We should, although I think we should say for Anne Miller's sake,"
00:14:48,00:14:50,that I don't think she's ever been in a tanning salon.
00:14:50,00:14:51,I don't want people to get the impression
00:14:51,00:14:54,that she was on the sunbed every day.
00:14:54,00:14:56,"- She's got a life for a pun, hasn't she?"
00:14:56,00:14:57,- She's got a life for a pun.
00:14:57,00:14:59,"She's been in the punning salon, yeah."
00:14:59,00:15:00,(audience laughs)
00:15:00,00:15:02,"- There's a cool pun one in Edinburgh,"
00:15:02,00:15:04,"and maybe you guys will know if this still exists,"
00:15:04,00:15:06,"but so there's a property shop,"
00:15:06,00:15:08,"and it's called the property shop,"
00:15:08,00:15:10,"and right next to it, someone set up a cafe"
00:15:10,00:15:13,"called the property shop, and so that just..."
00:15:13,00:15:14,(audience laughs)
00:15:14,00:15:16,"- It's the same company, it's in Stockbridge, isn't it?"
00:15:16,00:15:19,"It's the same, so it was a state agency,"
00:15:19,00:15:21,"and it was the same guy said, let's have a cafe."
00:15:21,00:15:22,- Oh really?
00:15:22,00:15:23,"- It's cool. - It's hard of our thing, yeah."
00:15:23,00:15:24,"- Okay, cool."
00:15:24,00:15:27,"- On Sun Tans, I found out that,"
00:15:27,00:15:29,"so obviously getting a Sun Tant is bad for you,"
00:15:29,00:15:32,"in lots of ways, and there's no way of getting a tan"
00:15:32,00:15:33,"without doing damage to the skin,"
00:15:33,00:15:35,"as in the protection that you get in future,"
00:15:35,00:15:37,"is the damage that you do,"
00:15:37,00:15:40,"except that there is a team at Massachusetts General Hospital,"
00:15:40,00:15:43,"and they have invented a drug, which you can take,"
00:15:43,00:15:46,"which will give you a Sun Tant, with no Sun."
00:15:46,00:15:47,- Wow. - Nice.
00:15:47,00:15:49,"- And this is amazing, it produces melanin,"
00:15:49,00:15:51,"which is the thing that protects you from skin cancer,"
00:15:51,00:15:56,and it could provide the elixir of tanning a red-haired tan.
00:15:56,00:16:01,"- Oh. - Yeah, you could have,"
00:16:01,00:16:02,"'cause people with red hair, they have a genetic mutation,"
00:16:02,00:16:04,"which disrupts the process,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,"and makes it very hard for people with red hair to tan,"
00:16:06,00:16:08,this could create a big gray and...
00:16:08,00:16:09,"- Oh, wow."
00:16:09,00:16:12,(audience laughs)
00:16:12,00:16:13,- That's very cool.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"- Do you know, 'cause it is bad for you,"
00:16:15,00:16:16,"and there's been a lot of publicity,"
00:16:16,00:16:19,"now recently about it, you have to get your fingerprints checked"
00:16:19,00:16:20,"in a lot of tanning salons,"
00:16:20,00:16:23,"so like the tanning salon, the tanning shop,"
00:16:23,00:16:25,"which has a lot of branches over the UK,"
00:16:25,00:16:27,"you're fingerprinted, and if you've come in"
00:16:27,00:16:29,"and get before that day, they don't let you in."
00:16:29,00:16:30,"- Oh, really? - Wow."
00:16:30,00:16:31,- Yeah. - That's quite good.
00:16:31,00:16:33,- These tanning salons and airports.
00:16:33,00:16:35,"- But actually people didn't really care about,"
00:16:35,00:16:38,"like, Sun Tant's did they, for ages and ages and ages,"
00:16:38,00:16:41,because basically having a Sun Tant meant that you were poor
00:16:41,00:16:43,"and you worked outside, you were a labourer,"
00:16:43,00:16:46,"and so it was always thought that if you had light skin,"
00:16:46,00:16:47,it was better.
00:16:47,00:16:50,But then Coco Chanel accidentally got tanned
00:16:50,00:16:53,"when she went on a Mediterranean cruise in 1923,"
00:16:53,00:16:54,"and suddenly always everyone thought,"
00:16:54,00:16:56,this is the thing that we all need to have now.
00:16:56,00:16:59,So it's quite a relatively new thing.
00:16:59,00:16:59,- Yeah.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"- You know, when Sun Tant's got popular,"
00:17:01,00:17:03,"after the Coco Chanel incident,"
00:17:03,00:17:06,then obviously a lot of kind of merchandise popped up
00:17:06,00:17:09,"around them, and popular science wrote an article"
00:17:09,00:17:11,about all the weird Sun Tanting technologies
00:17:11,00:17:14,"that have been invented since kind of 1920s, 1930s,"
00:17:14,00:17:16,and there were some crazy stuff people were doing.
00:17:16,00:17:21,"So in 1938, it wrote about a rotating Sun tub,"
00:17:21,00:17:23,"which is basically a tent that you brought to the beach,"
00:17:23,00:17:26,and it had like huge wooden kind of structure
00:17:26,00:17:28,"that you had to bring to the beach, and you erected it,"
00:17:28,00:17:30,and it followed the Sun's movements.
00:17:30,00:17:32,"So you lay inside it and you had a little steering wheel,"
00:17:32,00:17:35,and so you could steer the tent to point you
00:17:35,00:17:36,towards the Sun.
00:17:36,00:17:37,- That's a really good idea.
00:17:37,00:17:39,- It's incredible.
00:17:39,00:17:42,"- So you're in the wooden structure,"
00:17:42,00:17:44,but there's a gap of sunlight for your body.
00:17:44,00:17:45,- Exactly.
00:17:45,00:17:47,"- But are you kind of steering it towards the Sun,"
00:17:47,00:17:48,or does it do it automatically?
00:17:48,00:17:50,- You have to steer.
00:17:50,00:17:52,- But you've got to do something.
00:17:52,00:17:54,"Otherwise, it's boring."
00:17:54,00:17:55,- Fair enough.
00:17:55,00:17:58,You can get bacon smelling sunscreen.
00:17:58,00:17:58,- Why would you want that?
00:17:58,00:18:00,"- Well, because lots of people like bacon."
00:18:00,00:18:02,- Yeah.
00:18:02,00:18:04,"- According to the website of this thing,"
00:18:04,00:18:07,science has shown us that 10 out of 10 people
00:18:07,00:18:09,prefer the smell of bacon to coconut.
00:18:09,00:18:09,- Sorry.
00:18:09,00:18:12,(audience laughing)
00:18:12,00:18:13,"- Can't argue with science, Andy."
00:18:13,00:18:15,(audience laughing)
00:18:15,00:18:18,"- 10 out of 10, including vegetarian's and vegans."
00:18:18,00:18:20,"- The smell, the smell of bacon."
00:18:20,00:18:21,- Is this another study done
00:18:21,00:18:23,by one of Jeremy Corbyn's Cabinet?
00:18:23,00:18:24,(audience laughing)
00:18:24,00:18:25,- Very questionable.
00:18:25,00:18:29,"- Last year, KFC sold sunscreen which smelled of KFC."
00:18:29,00:18:31,"- Oh, yeah."
00:18:31,00:18:34,- It would protect your skin while the real fried chicken scent
00:18:34,00:18:36,leaves you smelling delicious.
00:18:36,00:18:37,(audience laughing)
00:18:37,00:18:40,"They had 3,000 tubes and everyone was disappointed"
00:18:40,00:18:43,'cause they sold out in two hours.
00:18:43,00:18:45,"But luckily, they learned the lesson"
00:18:45,00:18:47,and that was the last time KFC ever ran out of anything.
00:18:47,00:18:48,Ever again.
00:18:48,00:18:51,(audience laughing)
00:18:51,00:18:55,"- Speaking of artificial tanning,"
00:18:55,00:18:56,sometimes people can overdo it.
00:18:56,00:18:59,I just wanted to share this headline from the mail.
00:18:59,00:19:02,A young mother claims she was housebound for a week
00:19:02,00:19:05,"after a fake tan fail, left her looking,"
00:19:05,00:19:06,"like she'd bathed in chocolate spread,"
00:19:06,00:19:10,with pals even mistaking her for a brown leather sofa.
00:19:10,00:19:12,(audience laughing)
00:19:12,00:19:15,"- That is, I mean, what, like, guys, stop sitting on me."
00:19:15,00:19:17,What are you doing?
00:19:17,00:19:19,Did it change her whole body shape?
00:19:19,00:19:20,- I don't know.
00:19:20,00:19:22,"- It's interesting, the methods that people used to go"
00:19:22,00:19:24,about to try and get a tan back in the day.
00:19:24,00:19:27,And I read about one which I think people still occasionally
00:19:27,00:19:29,"try, which is to use tea bags."
00:19:29,00:19:34,"So, what you do is just put a lot of tea bags"
00:19:34,00:19:35,"into a hot bath, and you would get in the bath,"
00:19:35,00:19:38,and you would allow that to cook you into a pot.
00:19:38,00:19:40,- Have you put the milk in first?
00:19:40,00:19:44,(audience laughing)
00:19:44,00:19:46,They didn't say in the article.
00:19:46,00:19:48,"- I heard that that was done in the wall,"
00:19:48,00:19:51,"where women wanted a tan, but obviously,"
00:19:51,00:19:53,"there's no way of getting a tan,"
00:19:53,00:19:56,'cause you can't go on holiday in Greece anymore.
00:19:56,00:19:57,- What's the big problem there are people
00:19:57,00:19:59,close to the Nazis?
00:19:59,00:20:00,"- Oh, yeah."
00:20:00,00:20:00,(audience laughing)
00:20:00,00:20:02,- I knew I hated those guys.
00:20:02,00:20:06,"But the thing I read is that, for people who try it these days,"
00:20:06,00:20:09,"when they do it in a bath, they come across the same problem,"
00:20:09,00:20:12,"which is how do you tan your face,"
00:20:12,00:20:15,because that's above water.
00:20:15,00:20:17,"And in order to tan it, you need to be underwater"
00:20:17,00:20:18,for a long time.
00:20:18,00:20:21,"So, a bunch of people bought snorkels, which they tried."
00:20:21,00:20:22,(audience laughing)
00:20:22,00:20:25,"But, that was just weird then, when they put it."
00:20:25,00:20:27,- I think once you've got us far as getting in a bath
00:20:27,00:20:30,"with a lot of tea bags, looking weird"
00:20:30,00:20:31,"with the snorkels, at least you."
00:20:31,00:20:32,- But I think it's always a point where you go
00:20:32,00:20:34,"for no two-five, this is."
00:20:34,00:20:36,"- And so, what did they work any for now in the end of,"
00:20:36,00:20:37,they should not be able to do that?
00:20:37,00:20:38,"- No, they'll just don't do it anymore."
00:20:38,00:20:40,"- Well, the person in the article had a very white head"
00:20:40,00:20:43,regretted the whole experience.
00:20:43,00:20:46,"But yeah, you then just do it outside of the bath,"
00:20:46,00:20:48,you just leave tea bags all over yourself.
00:20:48,00:20:49,(audience laughing)
00:20:49,00:20:50,- Of course.
00:20:50,00:20:52,"- It's a thing, it's a thing, yeah."
00:20:52,00:20:54,"- Well, they also used to have milk spray,"
00:20:54,00:20:57,"'cause people thought that milk could tan you better,"
00:20:57,00:20:58,"stop me from burning, but give you a really nice tan,"
00:20:58,00:21:02,"and there were motorized milk sprayers that, like,"
00:21:02,00:21:04,groups of mainly women in the 1930s would carry
00:21:04,00:21:06,"to wherever they wanted to tan on holiday,"
00:21:06,00:21:08,"and like it was this big engine,"
00:21:08,00:21:09,"and then you stood in front of it,"
00:21:09,00:21:11,and it just showered you with milk.
00:21:11,00:21:14,"And then you go on nice, even tan."
00:21:14,00:21:18,"I like this, the Daily Mail, that spoke to some people"
00:21:18,00:21:21,"about how bad it is, but it's loved to get really burned,"
00:21:21,00:21:24,"and it found that eight, 10 million British people"
00:21:24,00:21:26,"said that they burned every time they went on holiday,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,"which is a large proportion of the population,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,and the person the mail interviewed to talk about this
00:21:30,00:21:33,"was a spokesman for Superdrug, chemist,"
00:21:33,00:21:34,and he was called Martin Crisp.
00:21:34,00:21:36,(audience laughing)
00:21:36,00:21:37,- Hi.
00:21:37,00:21:41,- We're gonna have to move on to our next hack soon.
00:21:41,00:21:44,"- There's a planet called Kepler-13AB,"
00:21:44,00:21:46,where it rains sun cream.
00:21:46,00:21:47,- What?
00:21:47,00:21:48,- What brand?
00:21:48,00:21:50,(audience laughing)
00:21:50,00:21:54,"- It's kind of a titanium oxide precipitation,"
00:21:54,00:21:57,"but it only falls on the dark side of the planet,"
00:21:57,00:21:59,so it's completely useless.
00:21:59,00:22:02,(audience laughing)
00:22:02,00:22:04,"- Just quickly, I was looking at some beauty salon stuff,"
00:22:04,00:22:06,"you know, tanning salons."
00:22:06,00:22:08,Do you guys know about snail salons?
00:22:08,00:22:09,- No.
00:22:09,00:22:12,- So snail slime is the new thing in beauty treatments.
00:22:12,00:22:15,"It's really popular in, so places like Thailand"
00:22:15,00:22:17,"and Japan, in Italy it's popular,"
00:22:17,00:22:18,"and people who are running snail farms,"
00:22:18,00:22:21,"because snail is obviously eaten all over the world,"
00:22:21,00:22:23,"are diversifying their farms,"
00:22:23,00:22:26,and they hand select a few snails on the farm
00:22:26,00:22:28,"to be transferred to the salon,"
00:22:28,00:22:30,"and then you book a session in the salon as a woman,"
00:22:30,00:22:32,"you lie down, and you get a few snails on your face,"
00:22:32,00:22:34,"just crawling all over it,"
00:22:34,00:22:37,and the claim is that it heals like your acne or scars
00:22:37,00:22:38,or it slows down aging.
00:22:38,00:22:39,- I've actually tried this.
00:22:39,00:22:40,- Have you really?
00:22:40,00:22:41,- It's good.
00:22:41,00:22:42,The service is unbelievably slow.
00:22:42,00:22:46,(audience laughing)
00:22:46,00:22:49,"- All right, let's move on, let's move on to our next hack."
00:22:49,00:22:53,"It's time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:22:53,00:22:55,"- My fact is that during the second mobile,"
00:22:55,00:22:58,the US government considered making all American shoes
00:22:58,00:23:00,deliberately ugly.
00:23:00,00:23:01,(audience laughing)
00:23:01,00:23:03,"So, this is the thing to do with rationing."
00:23:03,00:23:06,"They were very low on rubber, very low on leather,"
00:23:06,00:23:08,"and they thought, ""Well, how are we gonna do this?"""
00:23:08,00:23:11,"Eventually, they decided to introduce shoe rationing."
00:23:11,00:23:15,"They said, ""Everybody can only have three pairs of shoes"
00:23:15,00:23:17,"""a year, and if you wanted that extra pair of shoes,"
00:23:17,00:23:18,"""you had to fill in a really long complicated form,"
00:23:18,00:23:21,"""saying why you want more shoes."""
00:23:21,00:23:24,"But you could only, as a manufacturer, make four colors,"
00:23:24,00:23:27,and you could only have two different tones on a shoe.
00:23:27,00:23:30,"So, rationing was introduced, but the alternative plan"
00:23:30,00:23:32,"that they did consider, I think, before rejecting it was,"
00:23:32,00:23:34,"let's just make shoes really, really horrible."
00:23:34,00:23:35,- Some people don't want to buy them.
00:23:35,00:23:36,- Exactly.
00:23:36,00:23:38,- And the four colors that they were allowed were
00:23:38,00:23:42,"black, white, army, russet, and town, brown."
00:23:42,00:23:45,"- Town. - Town, town, town."
00:23:45,00:23:47,Like a place where people live.
00:23:47,00:23:48,- Old tower.
00:23:48,00:23:50,"- No, town, town. - No, town, town."
00:23:50,00:23:51,(audience laughing)
00:23:51,00:23:52,Town.
00:23:52,00:23:54,"- You know, when people live in a tower."
00:23:54,00:23:55,(audience laughing)
00:23:55,00:23:58,"- Sorry, I heard town, like the thing you rub yourself with."
00:23:58,00:24:00,"- No, town. - Town, town."
00:24:00,00:24:01,"- Town. - Town, yeah."
00:24:01,00:24:03,- Like a city without a cathedral?
00:24:03,00:24:04,- Yes. - Right.
00:24:04,00:24:07,(audience laughing)
00:24:07,00:24:08,"- Oh, why didn't you say that?"
00:24:08,00:24:09,(audience laughing)
00:24:09,00:24:13,"- So, do you say that two tone colors on shoes weren't allowed?"
00:24:13,00:24:14,- That was the maximum.
00:24:14,00:24:16,- Oh. - You couldn't have three tone shoes.
00:24:16,00:24:19,"- Really, I saw that you could only have single tone,"
00:24:19,00:24:20,you couldn't have double tone.
00:24:20,00:24:21,"- Oh, maybe wrong."
00:24:21,00:24:23,- You weren't allowed boots taller than 10 inches
00:24:23,00:24:25,and you weren't allowed heels taller than two
00:24:25,00:24:28,and five eighths inches.
00:24:28,00:24:30,And you weren't allowed fancy tongues.
00:24:30,00:24:31,- Mm-hmm. - No.
00:24:31,00:24:32,- You also. - Tongs.
00:24:32,00:24:33,- Tongs. - Sorry.
00:24:33,00:24:34,- No. - Tongs?
00:24:34,00:24:35,- Sorry.
00:24:35,00:24:36,(audience laughing)
00:24:36,00:24:38,"- Tung, like a tongue. - Tung, yeah."
00:24:38,00:24:40,"Sorry, it's my accent."
00:24:40,00:24:41,"I know I do say the word tongue wrong,"
00:24:41,00:24:43,but it's the thing inside your mouth
00:24:43,00:24:44,that you lick stuff with.
00:24:44,00:24:46,(audience laughing)
00:24:46,00:24:48,"- I don't know what I had to say this for everything now,"
00:24:48,00:24:49,and I say from now on.
00:24:49,00:24:50,(audience laughing)
00:24:50,00:24:54,"- Sorry, now it's a word that means you're not sure."
00:24:54,00:24:55,"- But when you say tongues,"
00:24:55,00:24:57,you are referring to the thing on your shoe.
00:24:57,00:24:58,"- Sorry, yeah. - You're not saying"
00:24:58,00:25:00,you're not allowed elaborate tongues in your mouth.
00:25:00,00:25:01,"- That was the thing, they were rationed"
00:25:01,00:25:04,"during the second mobile, fancy tongues."
00:25:04,00:25:05,(audience laughing)
00:25:05,00:25:06,- There was another thing where you could get
00:25:06,00:25:09,a cheaper version of a shoe that would cost you less
00:25:09,00:25:14,"of your ration coupons, your clothing coupons that you had."
00:25:14,00:25:17,And it was a shoe that was designed with a wooden sole.
00:25:17,00:25:21,"So, the problem with that is you get no bend"
00:25:21,00:25:23,"as you're lifting up your foot,"
00:25:23,00:25:26,"like any shoe that anyone is wearing in this room has,"
00:25:26,00:25:29,and so you would have to reinvent the way of how you walk
00:25:29,00:25:30,with your shoe to avoid--
00:25:30,00:25:32,"- Okay, and the moment you're kind of"
00:25:32,00:25:35,"waddling left and right, is that how they did it?"
00:25:35,00:25:37,"- I mean, I'm putting myself into the place"
00:25:37,00:25:39,"of the person with the shoe, and that's how I feel."
00:25:39,00:25:41,"- The shoes don't bend, is that the problem?"
00:25:41,00:25:43,- Yeah. - 'Cause it's a wooden bottom.
00:25:43,00:25:45,"- Just like a clog, I mean, with many with clogs."
00:25:45,00:25:48,"Like a clog, thank you Anna, yeah."
00:25:48,00:25:51,"- But people with clogs get around, okay, don't they?"
00:25:51,00:25:55,"Nope, what? (audience laughing)"
00:25:55,00:25:58,What they then had to do is in order to make that
00:25:58,00:26:01,"a bit more of a useful shoe, they then cut a bit"
00:26:01,00:26:04,"and they put a hinge in so that you could then walk,"
00:26:04,00:26:06,and the hinge would allow you the bend.
00:26:06,00:26:07,"The problem is, is that while you were walking,"
00:26:07,00:26:09,"the hinge would collect stones,"
00:26:09,00:26:13,and so you would be stuck in the hinge position
00:26:13,00:26:16,in a sort of leaning forward position.
00:26:16,00:26:17,Like the Michael Jackson lean.
00:26:17,00:26:19,"- Yeah, 'cause he invented shoes, didn't he,"
00:26:19,00:26:21,that let him do that lean?
00:26:21,00:26:23,- He did. - And he owned a patent for those shoes.
00:26:23,00:26:24,- Yeah.
00:26:24,00:26:26,"- And they were, they kind of, I think you're allowed to say,"
00:26:26,00:26:28,"they kind of, there was a bit in the stage,"
00:26:28,00:26:30,and he kind of slotted them into the stage
00:26:30,00:26:32,"so that he could lean right forward,"
00:26:32,00:26:34,and he owned the patent for that thing.
00:26:34,00:26:36,"- Which is weird, 'cause that's not really inventing a shoe,"
00:26:36,00:26:40,that's inventing a strap on the floor of a stage
00:26:40,00:26:42,"to put a shoe into. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:26:42,00:26:43,"- I thought though it had weights in it as well,"
00:26:43,00:26:47,"I thought that it literally, you moved in a certain way,"
00:26:47,00:26:49,it kicked in a weight into function
00:26:49,00:26:52,"so that when you went forward, that would balance you as well."
00:26:52,00:26:52,"- Yeah, might be."
00:26:52,00:26:56,"- I don't, I've not followed the Michael Jackson shoe patent"
00:26:56,00:26:58,paper close enough.
00:26:58,00:27:00,- Do you know you can get shoes for your shoes now?
00:27:00,00:27:01,- What?
00:27:01,00:27:04,"- This has been shown off at, I think,"
00:27:04,00:27:07,Paris Men's Fashion Week in the last couple of months.
00:27:07,00:27:09,Issues for your shoes have been designed.
00:27:09,00:27:11,They've been designed by a Chinese fashion designer
00:27:11,00:27:15,"called Sanquans, and it sneakers"
00:27:15,00:27:18,"that then have kind of an outer layer, which is a sandal,"
00:27:18,00:27:20,and you can velcro the sandal on and off.
00:27:20,00:27:24,"And it's so that, you know, if you're going out on dirty street"
00:27:24,00:27:26,"and you've got new shoes, you don't have to get the shoes dirty."
00:27:26,00:27:28,"- Yeah, but you just want about your outer shoes."
00:27:28,00:27:29,"They're going to get dirty, I'm going to go through."
00:27:29,00:27:31,- The person did comment.
00:27:31,00:27:34,"He said, we haven't got the triple layer stage yet,"
00:27:34,00:27:36,but who knows what the future holds.
00:27:36,00:27:37,"- Well, I could tell you what it holds,"
00:27:37,00:27:39,the fourth layer of the triple layer.
00:27:39,00:27:42,(audience laughing)
00:27:42,00:27:43,"- God, it's the branding."
00:27:43,00:27:45,"- Well, so that's a big thing in Japan, isn't it?"
00:27:45,00:27:47,"So in Japan, it's very employed the way your shoes"
00:27:47,00:27:48,into someone's house.
00:27:48,00:27:50,Everyone takes off their shoes as soon as you get to
00:27:50,00:27:52,"a someone's house or a restaurant or whatever,"
00:27:52,00:27:53,and they give you a pair of slippers.
00:27:53,00:27:55,"And it's very nice, and you walk around the restaurant"
00:27:55,00:27:58,"in the slippers, and it's great, except that when you go"
00:27:58,00:28:01,"to the Lou in the restaurant, they have to take you"
00:28:01,00:28:02,out of your normal slippers and put you
00:28:02,00:28:04,in special toilet slippers.
00:28:04,00:28:07,And there's a real risk of social embarrassment
00:28:07,00:28:08,"that once you've been to the toilet,"
00:28:08,00:28:12,you then forget to take off your toilet slippers.
00:28:12,00:28:13,- Ah!
00:28:13,00:28:13,- Because they're very different.
00:28:13,00:28:14,They look very different.
00:28:14,00:28:16,"So one writer said, he walked back into a fancy restaurant"
00:28:16,00:28:18,wearing a pair of bright yellow slippers
00:28:18,00:28:21,with a duck having a poo on the toes.
00:28:21,00:28:22,(audience laughing)
00:28:22,00:28:23,And that was the design.
00:28:23,00:28:26,- And that was a picture of a duck having a poo on the sole.
00:28:26,00:28:27,"- Yeah, it was."
00:28:27,00:28:28,(audience laughing)
00:28:28,00:28:29,Yeah.
00:28:29,00:28:33,- In 13th century Italy.
00:28:33,00:28:36,So do you know my favorite fact about shoes?
00:28:36,00:28:37,I've said it loads of times.
00:28:37,00:28:39,"And that is in the 14th century,"
00:28:39,00:28:41,it was made explicitly illegal in France
00:28:41,00:28:43,to make shoes that were shaped like penises.
00:28:43,00:28:44,- Yes.
00:28:44,00:28:45,- Okay.
00:28:45,00:28:50,I found out quite recently that Queen Mary made it illegal
00:28:50,00:28:52,to make shoes shaped like vaginas.
00:28:52,00:28:55,- No way.
00:28:55,00:28:57,"Oh my god, your two favorite facts can get married."
00:28:57,00:28:58,That's so nice.
00:28:58,00:29:00,(audience laughing)
00:29:00,00:29:02,Or at least have sex with each other.
00:29:02,00:29:04,(audience laughing)
00:29:04,00:29:06,- So in this all began in 13th century Italy
00:29:06,00:29:10,"and there was a thing, it was the cult of the Virgin Mary"
00:29:10,00:29:13,and basically everyone walked better
00:29:13,00:29:15,way to pay tribute to the Virgin Mary.
00:29:15,00:29:16,(audience laughing)
00:29:16,00:29:19,"- Well, it wasn't like the Catholic church hated it,"
00:29:19,00:29:21,"basically, so it was like a cult."
00:29:21,00:29:23,"It wasn't like a, it wasn't just a thing."
00:29:23,00:29:25,"Everyone liked the Virgin Mary, it was a cult, you think."
00:29:25,00:29:30,And they suddenly became really paid a lot of attention
00:29:30,00:29:33,"to the form of the perfect female body,"
00:29:33,00:29:35,which was supposed to be what the Virgin Mary had.
00:29:35,00:29:37,And so they invented these shoes
00:29:37,00:29:40,"and they were called duck spill shoes, they were really wide."
00:29:40,00:29:42,"They were covered, they were heavily padded,"
00:29:42,00:29:45,they were covered in hair like material
00:29:45,00:29:48,and they put slits in them
00:29:48,00:29:50,and you wore pink hosiery
00:29:50,00:29:54,and as you walked it was supposed to look like a vagina.
00:29:54,00:29:55,- Right.
00:29:55,00:29:56,- Wow.
00:29:56,00:29:57,- That is amazing.
00:29:57,00:30:00,- And this was high fashion in 13th century Italy.
00:30:00,00:30:01,- No.
00:30:01,00:30:04,"- And then when Queen Mary came to the Crown in Britain,"
00:30:04,00:30:06,she wanted to curry favor with the Pope
00:30:06,00:30:08,and so she banned them.
00:30:08,00:30:12,"- I, it was supposed to look like a vagina."
00:30:12,00:30:13,- Yep.
00:30:13,00:30:13,- And the.
00:30:13,00:30:14,- Why?
00:30:14,00:30:16,(audience laughing)
00:30:16,00:30:19,- It was a hairy shoe that had a little slit
00:30:19,00:30:21,which like pink sometimes.
00:30:21,00:30:23,- So hang on.
00:30:23,00:30:23,- Were the...
00:30:23,00:30:25,(audience laughing)
00:30:25,00:30:26,"- Were the shoes just an act to me, guys?"
00:30:26,00:30:27,"- Yeah, no, sure."
00:30:27,00:30:32,- So were the penis shoes a response to the vagina shoes?
00:30:32,00:30:35,"People saying sort of as a prank, you know?"
00:30:35,00:30:36,"- No, no, no."
00:30:36,00:30:38,- My understanding is it's a complete coincidence
00:30:38,00:30:40,that these two things come into this.
00:30:40,00:30:41,- I believe so.
00:30:41,00:30:42,- That's amazing.
00:30:42,00:30:45,- The gender wall was fought in a very different way
00:30:45,00:30:47,in the Middle Ages.
00:30:47,00:30:51,- Some other World War II shoes that I found
00:30:51,00:30:55,is there's a shoe that they were sort of invented
00:30:55,00:30:56,to trick the enemy.
00:30:56,00:31:01,So the shoe would leave the footprints of the shoe
00:31:01,00:31:03,would leave a barefoot footprint.
00:31:03,00:31:06,So it looked as if one of the locals had been in the area
00:31:06,00:31:09,as opposed to a soldier who had a big boot.
00:31:09,00:31:12,So on the bottom of the boot was just the shape of a foot.
00:31:12,00:31:13,So we...
00:31:13,00:31:15,- But locals wore the shoes.
00:31:15,00:31:16,(audience laughing)
00:31:16,00:31:18,- This was Southeast Asia.
00:31:18,00:31:19,"- Okay, yeah."
00:31:19,00:31:20,- I should have said the place.
00:31:20,00:31:23,- Did they make the footprints in the opposite direction
00:31:23,00:31:24,to where you were walking?
00:31:24,00:31:25,That would be clever.
00:31:25,00:31:27,"- That would be very clever, yeah."
00:31:27,00:31:28,- We've said before some people did that
00:31:28,00:31:32,or supposedly Australian outlaws put their horses shoes
00:31:32,00:31:33,on backwards.
00:31:33,00:31:34,- You're right.
00:31:34,00:31:36,"- So you don't think, oh, Nick Kelly's been through this way"
00:31:36,00:31:38,"or has actually, Nick Kelly had been through this way"
00:31:38,00:31:39,but he was heading the other way.
00:31:39,00:31:43,"But this is also in Bhutan, they say that yetis"
00:31:43,00:31:44,have the ability to take their foot off
00:31:44,00:31:46,and put it on that way round.
00:31:46,00:31:47,(audience cheering)
00:31:47,00:31:49,That's an actual Yeti fact.
00:31:49,00:31:49,- Yeah.
00:31:49,00:31:53,- I do know the fact about animals in your shoes.
00:31:53,00:31:56,"- Right, yeah, as a few years ago, scientists put boots"
00:31:56,00:32:00,onto dung beetles to find out how they cope with heat.
00:32:00,00:32:02,This is so cool.
00:32:02,00:32:05,"So dung beetles, they find a ball of poo"
00:32:05,00:32:07,"and they roll it around and every so often,"
00:32:07,00:32:09,"when it gets to the really hot bit of the day,"
00:32:09,00:32:11,they climb up on top of the ball of poo
00:32:11,00:32:12,and then they rest there for a bit.
00:32:12,00:32:15,"And scientists wondered, is that because it's really hot"
00:32:15,00:32:16,on the scientific desert where they're walking around?
00:32:16,00:32:17,- Ah.
00:32:17,00:32:20,"- So if you put boots on a dung beetle,"
00:32:20,00:32:24,you will theoretically find out whether that's the reason.
00:32:24,00:32:25,"- Ah, yeah."
00:32:25,00:32:28,"- And the scientists put, I think it was"
00:32:28,00:32:30,little silicon shoes on the dung beetles
00:32:30,00:32:32,"and they said afterwards, turns out,"
00:32:32,00:32:37,"it's very, very, very difficult to shoe a dung beetle."
00:32:37,00:32:39,(audience laughing)
00:32:39,00:32:40,"'Cause they did, they managed it."
00:32:40,00:32:44,"They got the boots on them and it turns out, yes."
00:32:44,00:32:46,"When you have boots on as a dung beetle,"
00:32:46,00:32:48,you stop much less to climb onto your ball.
00:32:48,00:32:49,So that is why.
00:32:49,00:32:52,- Could it be that they don't want to get on their dung
00:32:52,00:32:54,in case they get shit on the shoes?
00:32:54,00:32:55,"- Ah, yeah."
00:32:55,00:32:56,(audience laughing)
00:32:56,00:33:00,- They're actually working on a set of new outer shoes
00:33:00,00:33:02,for the dung beetles in a shoe.
00:33:02,00:33:04,(audience laughing)
00:33:04,00:33:05,I read that in plow.
00:33:05,00:33:09,There's a tradition of when people go into the reef
00:33:09,00:33:10,and they're going fishing and so on.
00:33:10,00:33:14,What they do is they take a sea sea cucumbers
00:33:14,00:33:18,and they squeeze the internals of the sea cucumber out
00:33:18,00:33:20,completely so the guts and everything go out
00:33:20,00:33:22,and then they wear the rubbery shell on the reef
00:33:22,00:33:24,so they don't cut their feet when they're in the reefs.
00:33:24,00:33:26,Improvised nature shoes.
00:33:26,00:33:31,- Why not just put some wetsuit feet on before you start diving?
00:33:31,00:33:34,"- No, this is in plow where they don't have necessarily."
00:33:34,00:33:37,"- Oh, they're just fishing and so on and so on."
00:33:37,00:33:40,- The sea cucumber can eviscerate its organs.
00:33:40,00:33:42,That's the thing that they do.
00:33:42,00:33:43,But they stay alive after they do that.
00:33:43,00:33:46,So this feels a bit...
00:33:46,00:33:48,"- Oh god, I live while you're wearing them."
00:33:48,00:33:49,- What?
00:33:49,00:33:51,"- Well, they can stay alive because they regrow them"
00:33:51,00:33:54,and what they do is they kind of send out their organs
00:33:54,00:33:56,and then hopefully like the fish eats the organs
00:33:56,00:33:57,and they can swim away.
00:33:57,00:34:00,"- Oh my god, can you imagine at the end of the day"
00:34:00,00:34:02,"being a sea cucumber going,"
00:34:02,00:34:03,you're not going to believe what happens to me.
00:34:03,00:34:05,(audience laughing)
00:34:05,00:34:07,- But also the anus of the sea cucumber
00:34:07,00:34:09,which is where you're putting your foot.
00:34:09,00:34:10,- Yeah.
00:34:10,00:34:12,- Is they have fish living in those anuses.
00:34:12,00:34:15,So you might get fish in your feet as well.
00:34:15,00:34:15,- That's all right.
00:34:15,00:34:18,- You've caught a bit of the meal already then.
00:34:18,00:34:21,"- I think if you've got your foot in a sea cucumber's anus,"
00:34:21,00:34:22,the fact that there's another fish present there
00:34:22,00:34:26,adds very little to the overall horror of the situation.
00:34:26,00:34:27,(audience laughing)
00:34:27,00:34:29,"- I could do it like, you know, in shopping centers"
00:34:29,00:34:31,where the fish eat your...
00:34:31,00:34:32,"- Oh yeah, exactly."
00:34:32,00:34:35,It's exfoliating as well as being protective.
00:34:35,00:34:36,"- Yeah, that's great."
00:34:36,00:34:37,- I've had that once and all I could think
00:34:37,00:34:40,while I was having it was reincarnation
00:34:40,00:34:41,"and just looking at the going,"
00:34:41,00:34:43,what the fuck did you do in your last life
00:34:43,00:34:46,that you have come back to eat my feet?
00:34:46,00:34:49,"- I had it once and I think I've told you guys this,"
00:34:49,00:34:53,but I had it once in Cambodia and they had to ask me
00:34:53,00:34:54,to take my feet out of the pond
00:34:54,00:34:57,'cause you put your feet in with like five other people
00:34:57,00:34:58,and my feet are so disgusting
00:34:58,00:35:00,that they were all coming to my feet.
00:35:00,00:35:01,(audience laughing)
00:35:01,00:35:03,- No one else is getting their money's worth.
00:35:03,00:35:06,(audience laughing)
00:35:06,00:35:11,"- It's real, real actually the low point pride wise me."
00:35:11,00:35:13,(audience laughing)
00:35:13,00:35:16,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:35:16,00:35:17,and that is Chisinski.
00:35:17,00:35:21,"- Yeah, my fact this week is that the etiquette experts"
00:35:21,00:35:24,de Bretts run classes that teach five-year-olds
00:35:24,00:35:28,to have strong handshakes and navigate dinner parties.
00:35:28,00:35:29,(audience laughing)
00:35:29,00:35:31,"And this is, so I don't know how many people know"
00:35:31,00:35:36,"about de Bretts, but they's basically a sort of guide"
00:35:36,00:35:38,"to being a posh person, I guess."
00:35:38,00:35:42,And they started publishing their etiquette guides in the 1700s
00:35:42,00:35:44,and they still go on today
00:35:44,00:35:47,and it's kind of teaching people how to perform well socially.
00:35:47,00:35:49,And they recently started doing these classes
00:35:49,00:35:52,which are called Signet Schools.
00:35:52,00:35:55,"And it's for, it's meant to be for six to 12-year-olds I think,"
00:35:55,00:35:57,but actually there's been such a lot of demand
00:35:57,00:35:58,that they're letting in five-year-olds.
00:35:58,00:36:01,"And yeah, they teach them to do things like shake hands well"
00:36:01,00:36:04,and perform well at dinner party and talk to grownups.
00:36:04,00:36:07,"And it's to teach children of primary school age,"
00:36:07,00:36:11,"of early primary school age, social ease and confidence"
00:36:11,00:36:13,and charisma and charm to guarantee
00:36:13,00:36:16,that they are both invited back to the next play date
00:36:16,00:36:18,and successful in interviews.
00:36:18,00:36:20,(audience laughing)
00:36:20,00:36:22,- Who's interviewing a five-year-old?
00:36:22,00:36:24,"- You know, business is getting really desperate."
00:36:24,00:36:27,"- Well, I've just opened another 19th century factory"
00:36:27,00:36:28,that I need.
00:36:28,00:36:30,(audience laughing)
00:36:30,00:36:31,- Like school interviews.
00:36:31,00:36:32,- Yeah.
00:36:32,00:36:33,"- Yeah, all right."
00:36:33,00:36:35,- So there was a report by one of the mothers
00:36:35,00:36:38,who sent her child on this.
00:36:38,00:36:40,"And at the very end of the piece she wrote about it,"
00:36:40,00:36:43,she gave her review of the whole experience.
00:36:43,00:36:46,"She said, ""The pleases and thank yous trip off the tongue"
00:36:46,00:36:48,"""and despite the occasional poop joke"
00:36:48,00:36:50,"""and a little light nose-picking,"
00:36:50,00:36:51,"""he's become really quite charming."""
00:36:51,00:36:53,(audience laughing)
00:36:53,00:36:54,- But you do pay for it.
00:36:54,00:36:59,So I think it starts at about 650 pounds for two hours
00:36:59,00:37:00,to send your five-year-old to this.
00:37:00,00:37:02,"But yeah, one woman who wrote a blog said,"
00:37:02,00:37:04,"""I think I'd have a really strong handshake at the end of that."""
00:37:04,00:37:06,(audience laughing)
00:37:06,00:37:08,I've got a proper bone crusher.
00:37:08,00:37:10,(audience laughing)
00:37:10,00:37:11,- And that's just the start.
00:37:11,00:37:14,So the woman who wrote the blog paid 780 for two hours
00:37:14,00:37:15,to get her handshaking son back.
00:37:15,00:37:17,"- They saw her coming, didn't they?"
00:37:17,00:37:20,"The normal price is 650 pounds to you, 780."
00:37:20,00:37:21,(audience laughing)
00:37:21,00:37:23,"- You know, the depress, the depress offer advice"
00:37:23,00:37:25,on eating bananas.
00:37:25,00:37:26,- Do they? - Do they?
00:37:26,00:37:28,"- It turns out, I think we're all doing it wrong."
00:37:28,00:37:29,They're coming to the press.
00:37:29,00:37:31,"Apparently, if you'll seated at the table,"
00:37:31,00:37:33,"the correct way to eat a banana is to peel it,"
00:37:33,00:37:38,then use a fork to cut the flesh into bite-sized pieces.
00:37:38,00:37:40,"In other, more informal situations,"
00:37:40,00:37:42,we recommend peeling bit by bit
00:37:42,00:37:45,and breaking bite-sized bits of the banana off.
00:37:45,00:37:47,"- That's not the way to do it, is it?"
00:37:47,00:37:48,Do you always see on the internet
00:37:48,00:37:51,"that you're supposed to eat bananas upside down, aren't you?"
00:37:51,00:37:54,'Cause that's a way that monkeys do it or something like that.
00:37:54,00:37:57,"I always break it, I always open it in the middle."
00:37:57,00:37:58,(audience laughing)
00:37:58,00:37:59,- Do you?
00:37:59,00:38:00,- I actually do do that.
00:38:00,00:38:02,I open it in the middle and then take the banana out
00:38:02,00:38:03,and then eat it without the skin.
00:38:03,00:38:04,- Right.
00:38:04,00:38:05,- You're a psychopath.
00:38:05,00:38:06,- I think.
00:38:06,00:38:08,(audience laughing)
00:38:08,00:38:10,"Hang on, do you mean you snap it in too?"
00:38:10,00:38:12,"- No, no, no, you get the banana"
00:38:12,00:38:14,and you kind of make a little hole in the middle of it
00:38:14,00:38:16,and then you open it up and then you pull the banana out
00:38:16,00:38:18,and you eat it.
00:38:18,00:38:20,- I'm sure there are other people who eat it.
00:38:20,00:38:21,- And then you reattach the skin
00:38:21,00:38:22,to make it look like a whole banana.
00:38:22,00:38:24,You put it back on the shelf
00:38:24,00:38:26,and then you leave the supermarket.
00:38:26,00:38:28,(audience laughing)
00:38:28,00:38:29,"- There's actually, Debrez has a whole section"
00:38:29,00:38:31,on difficult foods.
00:38:31,00:38:34,If you go to the website and enlist all the difficult foods
00:38:34,00:38:36,"to eat and so one example is grapes,"
00:38:36,00:38:38,"which I always thought were quite an easy food,"
00:38:38,00:38:40,but a grape show off.
00:38:40,00:38:41,- Yeah.
00:38:41,00:38:42,(audience laughing)
00:38:42,00:38:44,"- No, they're very strict."
00:38:44,00:38:46,They say don't pick individual grapes from a bunch.
00:38:46,00:38:50,You have to remove a small bunch from the big bunch
00:38:50,00:38:53,and then eat from that using either your fingers
00:38:53,00:38:54,or grape scissors.
00:38:54,00:38:55,(audience laughing)
00:38:55,00:38:57,"- Grape scissors, I've seen those."
00:38:57,00:38:59,I've been to a cutlery collecting man's house.
00:38:59,00:39:00,(audience laughing)
00:39:00,00:39:01,- Oh no.
00:39:01,00:39:03,"- He showed me his grape scissors, they're really--"
00:39:03,00:39:04,- Oh wow.
00:39:04,00:39:05,- How do they differ from normal scissors?
00:39:05,00:39:05,- They do not.
00:39:05,00:39:08,(audience laughing)
00:39:08,00:39:10,- Are they quite small or?
00:39:10,00:39:12,"- They're quite, yeah, they're not massive shears."
00:39:12,00:39:15,"You know, they're small, yeah."
00:39:15,00:39:15,- Why?
00:39:15,00:39:17,- I struggled anyway with the my stock.
00:39:17,00:39:19,"- Did he have, 'cause Debrez also says that"
00:39:19,00:39:22,"if you're eating oranges, then if it's semi-difficult to peel,"
00:39:22,00:39:24,"you should cut it in half and eat it with a teaspoon,"
00:39:24,00:39:26,which I'd never considered doing at all.
00:39:26,00:39:28,"- I don't think anyone does any of this stuff,"
00:39:28,00:39:29,do they really?
00:39:29,00:39:30,- No.
00:39:30,00:39:32,- I have eaten a banana with a knife in fork once
00:39:32,00:39:34,and it was actually very nice.
00:39:34,00:39:35,So.
00:39:35,00:39:37,"- Yeah, but that wasn't because of the way you were eating it, though."
00:39:37,00:39:39,"- You know, you would have tasted the same"
00:39:39,00:39:41,if it had done my psychopath layer of eating it.
00:39:41,00:39:45,"- No, I'd tell you what, it made me pace myself and enjoy it."
00:39:45,00:39:46,(audience laughing)
00:39:46,00:39:50,Was there a special reason that you decided to try that?
00:39:50,00:39:51,"- Yeah, it was really odd."
00:39:51,00:39:53,I was on British Airways coming back from New York
00:39:53,00:39:56,and they came and they put a banana down
00:39:56,00:39:58,and a knife in fork and they walked away and...
00:39:58,00:40:01,(audience laughing)
00:40:01,00:40:08,It's so I thought I'd better challenge accepted.
00:40:08,00:40:11,(audience laughing)
00:40:11,00:40:14,"So, de Bratz also do, they've got some rules"
00:40:14,00:40:17,for polite social networking.
00:40:17,00:40:20,"So, one they say is, this is I'm guessing for Facebook,"
00:40:20,00:40:22,think before you poke.
00:40:22,00:40:23,That's a first suggestion.
00:40:23,00:40:25,(audience laughing)
00:40:25,00:40:27,Always wait 24 hours before accepting
00:40:27,00:40:28,or removing someone as a friend.
00:40:28,00:40:31,"The delay will help you gather your thoughts,"
00:40:31,00:40:34,"which is just great philosophy, generally, isn't it?"
00:40:34,00:40:36,- 750 quid for that one.
00:40:36,00:40:37,(audience laughing)
00:40:37,00:40:38,"- No, that actually is a price."
00:40:38,00:40:39,- What?
00:40:39,00:40:42,- 750 quid and it's for 13 to 16 year olds.
00:40:42,00:40:43,- No way.
00:40:43,00:40:46,We're just giving it away for free right now.
00:40:46,00:40:49,"As you have got lucky, this is an absolute bargain."
00:40:49,00:40:52,- The guy who started de Bratz was called John de Bratz
00:40:52,00:40:54,"and he began his career with de Bratz Parridge,"
00:40:54,00:40:58,which was a buck about lords and ladies and stuff like that.
00:40:58,00:41:00,But he got into a huge argument with a guy
00:41:00,00:41:03,who actually wrote it and he went bankrupt twice
00:41:03,00:41:06,and he only managed to survive thanks to taking
00:41:06,00:41:08,a huge amount of money from his wife.
00:41:08,00:41:09,- Really?
00:41:09,00:41:10,"- Which they don't teach you that in de Bratz, do they?"
00:41:10,00:41:11,- They do not.
00:41:11,00:41:13,- It's encouraged.
00:41:13,00:41:15,(audience laughing)
00:41:15,00:41:16,"- They're very strong on Perridge, though,"
00:41:16,00:41:20,and actually one of them is frequently asked questions.
00:41:20,00:41:21,One of the most frequent questions that's written
00:41:21,00:41:24,into de Bratz is like how to address the royal family
00:41:24,00:41:26,as if really anyone's coming up against them personally.
00:41:26,00:41:28,But they've got very detailed instructions
00:41:28,00:41:29,as to how you address them.
00:41:29,00:41:32,"And apparently, if you're writing to,"
00:41:32,00:41:34,"so if you're writing to the queen,"
00:41:34,00:41:35,"then you have to open your letter with,"
00:41:35,00:41:37,"may it please your majesty,"
00:41:37,00:41:39,and then you have to begin the next sentence
00:41:39,00:41:41,with with my humble duty.
00:41:41,00:41:42,"But then if you're writing to other members,"
00:41:42,00:41:44,it tells you all the initials
00:41:44,00:41:45,that have to come after everyone's name.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"So let's say you're writing the Prince of Wales,"
00:41:47,00:41:48,"if you're writing to Prince Charles,"
00:41:48,00:41:51,"you have to say on the envelope to his,"
00:41:51,00:41:54,"that's her royal hyenas, and then on a new line,"
00:41:54,00:41:56,"you say, for example, the Prince of Wales,"
00:41:56,00:41:58,"and then these are the initials that offer's name,"
00:41:58,00:42:03,"KGKT, GCB, O-M-A-K-C-D-Q-S-O-P-C,"
00:42:03,00:42:05,that's all the things he is.
00:42:05,00:42:06,It's so great. - Wow.
00:42:06,00:42:10,"- GCB is, he's a great master in principal night"
00:42:10,00:42:12,"of the most honorable order of the bath,"
00:42:12,00:42:15,and that's about how they used to bathe nights.
00:42:15,00:42:17,"So when you were knighted in medieval times,"
00:42:17,00:42:19,"you had a bath first thing you did,"
00:42:19,00:42:21,and then if you're a great master
00:42:21,00:42:23,"of the most honorable order of the bath,"
00:42:23,00:42:25,it's about bathing when you become a knight.
00:42:25,00:42:27,"Isn't that cool? - That's very cool, yeah."
00:42:27,00:42:29,- He's the only great master.
00:42:29,00:42:30,- Good for him. - Well done.
00:42:30,00:42:33,(audience laughing)
00:42:33,00:42:35,- I was looking up general etiquette things.
00:42:35,00:42:36,"- Yes, yes."
00:42:36,00:42:38,"- There's a book by an author called Henry Hitchens,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,"and it's called Sorry,"
00:42:40,00:42:42,"and it's about English people and their manners,"
00:42:42,00:42:44,and he just lists advice from throughout the ages
00:42:44,00:42:46,"of etiquette varies, obviously,"
00:42:46,00:42:48,depending on your society.
00:42:48,00:42:50,"So, for example, in the 15th century,"
00:42:50,00:42:53,the Duke of Gloucester's Usher advised
00:42:53,00:42:56,that one should not scratch one's codpiece in public.
00:42:56,00:42:58,(audience laughing)
00:42:58,00:43:00,I'm a sayingable.
00:43:00,00:43:01,"Erasmus, the medieval writer,"
00:43:01,00:43:05,advised that one should cough to disguise a fart.
00:43:05,00:43:06,(audience laughing)
00:43:06,00:43:09,"- Erasmus actually, that book that he wrote,"
00:43:09,00:43:11,"it was about children's etiquette, wasn't it?"
00:43:11,00:43:14,And it was the best-selling book in all of England
00:43:14,00:43:16,in the 16th century apart from the Bible.
00:43:16,00:43:17,- No way.
00:43:17,00:43:19,"- And some of the other things he said was,"
00:43:19,00:43:21,do not be afraid of vomiting.
00:43:21,00:43:23,"It is not vomiting, but holding the vomiting"
00:43:23,00:43:26,in your throat that is foul.
00:43:26,00:43:28,"- I disagree strongly with that, actually."
00:43:28,00:43:29,(audience laughing)
00:43:29,00:43:31,"- If you cannot swallow a piece of food,"
00:43:31,00:43:34,turn around discreetly and throw it somewhere.
00:43:34,00:43:36,(audience laughing)
00:43:36,00:43:38,"- Better don't teach that when you're 650 quink calls,"
00:43:38,00:43:39,I don't know.
00:43:39,00:43:41,"- Actually, weirdly, did Brett say the opposite"
00:43:41,00:43:42,so how times have changed?
00:43:42,00:43:44,"They say a dinner party,"
00:43:44,00:43:46,when encountering an unexpected piece of gristle
00:43:46,00:43:49,"or something that may be chewed to no avail,"
00:43:49,00:43:53,it is polite to be brave and try and swallow it anyway.
00:43:53,00:43:54,(audience laughing)
00:43:54,00:43:56,- Children troke all things.
00:43:56,00:43:59,"- Well, you know you got a suffer for etiquette."
00:43:59,00:44:02,- I'd love to see the difference between Erasmus
00:44:02,00:44:03,"and the Brett's, that would be really awesome."
00:44:03,00:44:06,"Another one, do not move back and forth on your chair."
00:44:06,00:44:08,Whoever does that gives the impression
00:44:08,00:44:11,of constantly breaking or trying to break wind.
00:44:11,00:44:12,(audience laughing)
00:44:12,00:44:13,- Well James.
00:44:13,00:44:15,(audience laughing)
00:44:15,00:44:18,(audience laughing)
00:44:18,00:44:21,(audience laughing)
00:44:21,00:44:25,"- Hey, we need to wrap up very soon."
00:44:25,00:44:27,You guys got anything for you to do?
00:44:27,00:44:29,"- In Victorian times, women were advised to pinch their fingers"
00:44:29,00:44:32,so the ends would be nice and pointy.
00:44:32,00:44:34,(audience laughing)
00:44:34,00:44:36,- Do they have what their fingers made of a plasticine?
00:44:36,00:44:37,- I guess so.
00:44:37,00:44:39,- It was just a thought you meant to have nice pointy ends
00:44:39,00:44:42,"to fingers, nice and tapering, not sort of flat cut off fingers."
00:44:42,00:44:45,"And one writer said that if your fingers are bad,"
00:44:45,00:44:48,"your bad fingers, then just pinch them lots of times"
00:44:48,00:44:50,all the time.
00:44:50,00:44:51,"- Oh, I know."
00:44:51,00:44:52,"- And women were advised, and this is a thing"
00:44:52,00:44:55,"that happens today, I believe, to fill all gloves with cream"
00:44:55,00:44:57,"and then put on the old gloves full of cream,"
00:44:57,00:44:59,and then you get a bed at night.
00:44:59,00:45:00,And that's the thing that still happens.
00:45:00,00:45:01,"- No, it doesn't happen now."
00:45:01,00:45:02,"- No, does anyone hear it?"
00:45:02,00:45:04,Someone said yes.
00:45:04,00:45:06,"- Yeah, see all women's voices."
00:45:06,00:45:08,"This is a conspiracy, there's a cap from men."
00:45:08,00:45:09,No men know about this.
00:45:09,00:45:12,"- Guys, what kind of cream is it?"
00:45:12,00:45:14,"Like, I think just any double cream."
00:45:14,00:45:17,(all laughing)
00:45:17,00:45:21,"This is a thing, I talk my girlfriend about this,"
00:45:21,00:45:23,"and she said, Andy, we all do this all the time."
00:45:23,00:45:26,You've never paid any attention to anything.
00:45:26,00:45:28,Why do you think the bed is full of cream every morning?
00:45:28,00:45:31,(all laughing)
00:45:31,00:45:33,"- I've never heard of it, but I'd be so creeped out"
00:45:33,00:45:35,"if my partner was wearing gloves in bed, so."
00:45:35,00:45:37,- I was so weird.
00:45:37,00:45:40,I think they're just on a murder or something.
00:45:40,00:45:41,(all laughing)
00:45:41,00:45:43,"- That is quite something, isn't it?"
00:45:43,00:45:46,"But then you're just gonna have nice hands,"
00:45:46,00:45:47,but what about the rest of your body?
00:45:47,00:45:49,You should really be wearing a full body suit.
00:45:49,00:45:52,"- Yes, I'm covering it all in cream."
00:45:52,00:45:54,- With a snorkel to keep you breathing.
00:45:54,00:45:57,(all laughing)
00:45:57,00:45:59,"- Okay, that is it."
00:45:59,00:46:00,That is all of our facts.

00:46:45,00:46:49,"at the first robot Olympics held in 1990 in Glasgow,"
00:46:49,00:46:52,the English competitor was disqualified from the climbing event
00:46:52,00:46:55,because of inappropriate behavior in front of children.
00:46:55,00:46:58,(audience laughing)
00:46:58,00:47:00,It tried to mount the Russian robot.
00:47:00,00:47:03,(audience laughing)
