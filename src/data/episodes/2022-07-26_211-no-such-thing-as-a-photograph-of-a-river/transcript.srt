1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 (bells ringing)

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,440
 (bells ringing)

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:15,120
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,840
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,120
 this week coming to you from Edinburgh!

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,120
 (audience cheering)

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,440
 My name is Dan Schreiber

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,000
 and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,160
 Andrew Hunter-Marie and James Harkin,

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,560
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,320
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,320
 and in no particular order, here we go.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,040
 Starting with fact number one,

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,800
 and that's my fact this week,

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,920
 my fact is unmarried people are more likely

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,840
 to fall down stairs than married people.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,720
 (audience laughing)

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,680
 And previously married people fall down more

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,880
 than both of them.

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,840
 (audience laughing)

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,000
 - It does, it's not just 'cause they're like,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,760
 it's my phone's ringing, my phone's ringing,

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,520
 get it, because you're single, you're kind of, you know.

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,560
 - Yeah, you're ready for the thing.

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,960
 - I don't think we know why, do we?

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,320
 - We don't, so I read this in a Bill Bryson book

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,600
 called At Home, which is a fantastic book

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,040
 and he references in the chapter

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,200
 which he writes about stairs that he read this one book,

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,360
 the only book that is a sort of academic look at staircases

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,200
 and it's by John Templer of MIT, it's called The Staircase,

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,200
 Studies of Hazards Fall and Safe Designs.

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,400
 - Yeah, and I have also read this book, there it is.

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,240
 - That's it.

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,640
 - It is the first theoretical,

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,240
 historical and scientific analysis of the stair,

38
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,200
 according to the blurb.

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,240
 It is pretty hard going.

40
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,760
 (audience laughing)

41
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,560
 And actually that was a little joke

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,920
 for you staircase enthusiasts out there

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,200
 because the going is the width of a stair.

44
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,440
 (audience laughing)

45
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,080
 And all of my humour will be staircase based

46
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,280
 for the rest of the show.

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,360
 (audience laughing)

48
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,680
 - John Templer's at home pissing himself

49
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,000
 on the other end of that.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,280
 - I mean, there's diagrams as, you know,

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
 loads of tables and stuff like this.

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,640
 There's tables.

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,200
 - What are tables doing in the book?

54
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,680
 (audience laughing)

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,680
 - There's like about three or four good facts

56
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,880
 in the first four pages

57
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,680
 and then the rest of it is just unbelievably tedious.

58
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,520
 (audience laughing)

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,720
 - Did he lead with the unmarried and married tables?

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
 - Yeah, it's right near the start.

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,920
 Another thing he says is that notable missteps

62
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,080
 happen once every 2,222 stair uses.

63
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,360
 Minor accidents happen every 63,000 uses.

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,360
 Disabling accidents every 734,210 uses.

65
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,760
 Hospital treatments every 3,616,667 uses.

66
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,880
 And deaths every 513,947,300 uses.

67
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,760
 And that was one of the least boring.

68
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,560
 (audience laughing)

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,960
 - Do you know why all these accidents happen?

70
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
 - No, why?

71
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,920
 - According to him, it's because every staircase

72
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,920
 is a compromise between going up and going down.

73
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,720
 - Yeah, so you can have staircases

74
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,080
 which just for people going up, can't you?

75
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,720
 - Oh no, that would be that would be decadent, wouldn't it?

76
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,160
 (audience laughing)

77
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,600
 - His point being that how would you get down again

78
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
 as well, think of that.

79
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,920
 - I'd have to in my house.

80
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,920
 - Oh, I would have Harman's pole or a slide.

81
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,080
 - Wait, so what do you mean by a compromise?

82
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,640
 Who's compromising with whom?

83
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
 Who's negotiating here?

84
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,720
 - The perfect staircase would be a staircase

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,440
 that would be able to adapt itself

86
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,120
 to whether or not you were going up or down

87
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,280
 for the length and the height and so on.

88
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,240
 They're built in one way which plays advantage

89
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,760
 to either going up or going down.

90
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,240
 Very different skills going up and down a staircase.

91
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
 - Very different.

92
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,640
 - And actually in this book, there are figures

93
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,640
 about how a staircase was if you're going up or down.

94
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,320
 So if you're going up, there's a different

95
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,840
 wearing out of the stair than if you're going down.

96
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,640
 - But you would have thought the wearing would be the same

97
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,040
 on all staircases unless you've just got a huge stockpile

98
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,960
 of 10,000 people at the top of the stairs at some point.

99
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,840
 At some point everyone who goes up stairs

100
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
 does come down the stairs.

101
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,240
 - I think there are a few like, for instance,

102
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,760
 if you've got stairs coming up at a dock, say for instance,

103
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,480
 people might use it for getting off the boat,

104
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,280
 but to get on the boat they might use the pier.

105
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,120
 - I see.

106
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
 - So there are a few little things like that.

107
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,720
 It's very interesting, actually, I don't know.

108
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,520
 - And that's the origin of that saying, isn't it?

109
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,680
 What goes up stairs must come down stairs.

110
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840
 - Women fall downstairs more often than men

111
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,160
 or admit to falling downstairs more often than men.

112
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,280
 So 38% of women, compared to 28% of men,

113
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,120
 said they'd fallen downstairs or upstairs

114
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,760
 or tripped on stairs in the last year.

115
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,880
 And also weirdly, this was a study that was done

116
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,960
 by the British Woodworking Federation

117
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,720
 who relied on for all rigorous scientific studies.

118
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,720
 And their study also found that the northeast of England,

119
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,440
 so it was a study that discovered England,

120
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,240
 the northeast is the most at risk of falling downstairs.

121
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,480
 So 48% of people there said they'd done it in the last year,

122
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,800
 whereas Yorkshire and Humber, directly next to the northeast region,

123
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,400
 had the least incidences, 26%.

124
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,560
 What's going on there?

125
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,840
 It doesn't make any sense.

126
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,720
 - I don't know, mate.

127
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,320
 - I saw a really cool invention the other day

128
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,760
 'cause a lot of people are trying to work out

129
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,760
 how to stop people if they do fall over

130
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,160
 from properly hurting themselves.

131
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,840
 So there's this new invention that they're trialing

132
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,800
 at the moment, which is like a big belt that you wear.

133
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,760
 And it senses that you're falling over.

134
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,840
 It's a sort of like, this is a movement

135
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,160
 that's not being expected.

136
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,720
 I've gone, as a belt, I've gone over that way.

137
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,160
 And what it does is it inflates these massive airbags.

138
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,800
 Speaking of stair-based inventions, that sounds awesome.

139
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,280
 There are scientists at Georgia Tech

140
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,520
 who have invented some stairs which walk you back.

141
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,920
 - What, that doesn't make any sense?

142
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,040
 - Well, I understand all those words, but.

143
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,080
 - Well, I've tried to, I've tried to sex it up a bit,

144
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,640
 and I don't think it's succeeded.

145
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,040
 Basically, there are stairs which, as you walk on them,

146
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,560
 they store your energy,

147
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,480
 and then when you walk the other way,

148
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,240
 so when you walk down the gravitational force

149
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
 of you descending, stalls energy in the stair,

150
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,400
 and then when you walk back up, it springs you up.

151
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,400
 Every step you take, every move you make.

152
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,440
 (audience laughing)

153
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,000
 And when you go back up, it's 37% easier on your knee

154
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,720
 than it would be normally, so that could be huge.

155
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,440
 - Yeah, and there are shoes that have just been invented

156
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,480
 to stop people from falling over,

157
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,040
 which I think sound a bit less dramatic

158
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,720
 than embarrassing than the air bag solution,

159
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,360
 because they're just shoes with battery on the back of them

160
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,920
 and a sensor, and they sense when you're starting

161
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,120
 to have your body weight in the wrong position,

162
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,000
 and they automatically start a little motor

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,880
 that slides the shoes backwards,

164
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,400
 so stops you falling over backwards.

165
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,040
 - Like your moonwalking. - Wow.

166
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,160
 - Exactly, like moonwalking,

167
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,360
 but only if the option is falling over.

168
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,280
 - That's amazing.

169
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,760
 - And the person who invented them said,

170
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,920
 "It's great because it's not as noticeable as having a stick

171
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,280
 or a Zimmer frame, which some people don't want to have,

172
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,560
 "because it makes them feel like they've lost their mobility."

173
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,200
 And they just look like completely normal shoes,

174
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,320
 which I watched the video,

175
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,720
 and they've got a large motor on the back of each shoe.

176
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,480
 (audience laughing)

177
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,520
 - Can I just ask about the staircase giving you the lift again?

178
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,840
 So presumably, if you were walking down,

179
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,040
 it matches your body weight and type

180
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,480
 for what the spring it gives you on the way back up, right?

181
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,920
 So if I go down the staircase, but then my sun walks up it,

182
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,400
 (audience laughing)

183
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,000
 is he not gonna be lobbed to the feet?

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,440
 - Because in 1948, an elephant climbed up the stairs

185
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,600
 at the Eiffel Tower.

186
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,440
 - No.

187
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,560
 - And then climbed back down again, so imagine that.

188
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,400
 - Are you serious? - Really?

189
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,240
 - Wow.

190
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
 - There used to be a thing that people did in the Eiffel Tower,

191
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,200
 they used to just climb up the stairs in funny ways.

192
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,000
 There was a guy who did it in Stilts,

193
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,160
 quite famously, a baker.

194
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,720
 And then when Hitler took over Paris in the war,

195
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,480
 suddenly all of the lifts stopped working,

196
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,280
 and they said, "Oh no, you're gonna have to walk up the stairs now."

197
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,440
 And he was like, "Oh, I'm not gonna do it then."

198
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,760
 - They were jeopardised, weren't they?

199
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,360
 The resistance cut all the lift cables in the Eiffel Tower,

200
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,680
 and there's someone who admitted to it,

201
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,480
 and the end he wrote a book and said,

202
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,600
 "It was me, I cut the cables in the Eiffel Tower

203
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,960
 to make the Nazis look like idiots."

204
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,880
 - But at the time they just said,

205
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,320
 "Oh no, it's just not working."

206
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,800
 And then the day after he left, they're like,

207
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
 "Oh, it's working again."

208
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,080
 (audience laughing)

209
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,520
 - Jeremy Corbyn can climb four flights of stairs

210
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,840
 faster than anyone else in the Labour Party.

211
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,840
 (audience laughing)

212
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,160
 - That's not true. - Proof me wrong.

213
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,160
 (audience laughing)

214
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,920
 - The fact that the Labour Party's wasting time

215
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,280
 figuring this out doesn't go a long way to explain it.

216
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,120
 - Why are you saying that?

217
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,960
 I don't understand.

218
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,800
 Is it a race they do?

219
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,640
 - He's not saying it.

220
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,040
 It's according to his deputy, Tom Watson.

221
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,200
 - Yeah, Tom Watson can do it that fast, can he?

222
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
 - No, but he didn't say it just,

223
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,680
 he didn't say it was just faster than me, Tom Watson.

224
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,680
 He said anyone else, I think in the parliamentary party,

225
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,160
 not the 500,000-strong membership,

226
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,040
 but maybe anyway.

227
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,080
 (audience laughing)

228
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,360
 - Do you know the most number of stairs

229
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,520
 climbed on your head?

230
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,360
 - What?

231
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,200
 - Oh.

232
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,000
 - So you're on your head, you're like doing a headstand.

233
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,840
 - Yeah.

234
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,240
 - And then you have to bounce off onto the next step

235
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,360
 and you keep going up and how many can you do in a row

236
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,840
 while someone will drag on?

237
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,160
 - 15, 15, six.

238
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,680
 - It's 36.

239
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,680
 Do you know what the most stairs tumbled down

240
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,920
 in a stunt fall is?

241
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,760
 - Mm-hmm.

242
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,600
 - Oh, cool.

243
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
 - Do you reckon it's more or less than 36?

244
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,240
 - It's more.

245
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
 - I'll say it less.

246
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,320
 - No, you were wrong to say that.

247
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,880
 It was 134.

248
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
 - Ooh.

249
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,720
 - Yeah.

250
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
 Do you know what the most consecutive stairs

251
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,480
 climbed along Juggling the Footballers?

252
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,320
 - Oh, Jesus.

253
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,160
 - No.

254
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,080
 - Are we to the part of the book

255
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,720
 where it stopped being interesting now?

256
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,040
 (audience laughing)

257
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,480
 - It's 4,698.

258
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,280
 - Sorry, that was the climbing stairs juggling a football.

259
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,120
 But it's a bit of a cheat

260
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,280
 'cause he just went of the same 18 stairs lots of times.

261
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,560
 - Wait, Juggling a football?

262
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,960
 - Yeah, with your feet.

263
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,160
 - I can keep your feet.

264
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,000
 - Oh, that, sorry.

265
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,520
 I thought you meant he was juggling one football

266
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,360
 with his hands.

267
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
 (audience laughing)

268
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,800
 I think I could do that.

269
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,640
 (audience laughing)

270
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,720
 - I don't think you could.

271
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,640
 I don't think you could go at 4,600 steps.

272
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,120
 No wonder what the football's doing.

273
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,440
 (audience laughing)

274
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,960
 And one more, most consecutive stairs climbed

275
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,720
 while balancing a person on your head.

276
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,560
 Ah.

277
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,320
 So you're walking up and it's like

278
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,680
 as if there's a mirror on your head

279
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,000
 'cause there's another person directly above you.

280
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,840
 - What is it?

281
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,320
 - Are they standing on their head on your head?

282
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,640
 - Yeah, their head is on your head.

283
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,120
 - And they're upside down.

284
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
 - All right.

285
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,960
 - What's the number?

286
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,120
 - 90.

287
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,960
 - It's impressive.

288
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,800
 - 90.

289
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,640
 - Yeah, yeah.

290
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,480
 - More than the guy who just did it on his head.

291
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,320
 - Yeah.

292
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,160
 - Wow.

293
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,600
 - I would say that is much easier.

294
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,320
 They're still doing it on their feet.

295
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,920
 - He has a man upside down on his head.

296
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,440
 (audience laughing)

297
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,000
 - Well, these, 'cause do you guys know

298
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,600
 about competitive self-climing?

299
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,320
 - No.

300
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,480
 - Which is, this is a really a growing sport.

301
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,960
 So it's like an official sport.

302
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,840
 There's this global circuit of competitive stair climbers.

303
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,640
 They call themselves the most difficult sport

304
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,160
 that no one's ever heard of.

305
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,320
 And it's basically they have these events all over the world

306
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,880
 where they race up really tall buildings.

307
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,320
 So the three main races are in the US,

308
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,880
 the Empire State Building, Sears Tower and US Bank Tower.

309
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,200
 And they have this big Facebook group

310
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,680
 and they call each other step brothers and step sisters,

311
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
 which is real clever.

312
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,440
 But they take it super seriously.

313
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,480
 So like the men shave their legs and shave their head.

314
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,760
 So they're more streamlined going up the stairs.

315
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
 They wear glasses.

316
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,960
 - That can't make much of a difference, I'll cut it.

317
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,360
 - 'Cause you're in a stairwell.

318
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
 There's gonna be that much air resistance.

319
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,880
 - I guess so.

320
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,720
 - Yeah.

321
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,560
 - There's still air, isn't there?

322
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,400
 - There's still air.

323
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,560
 - Although one thing they say is that

324
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,680
 the air in stairwells is actually quite bad.

325
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,360
 So you get this really bad smoke

326
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,880
 as hacking cough as you're going up

327
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,120
 because the air's really dry.

328
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,080
 So they recommend that you suck on a fruit suite

329
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,600
 or a lozenge as you're running up,

330
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,480
 which I would have thought is a massive choking hazard

331
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,080
 as your sprinting up says.

332
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,280
 - You must be absolutely exhausted

333
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
 by the time you get to the top.

334
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,440
 - It's really tiring.

335
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,160
 - That's true, a lot of spots so actually.

336
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,000
 - Yeah.

337
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,840
 - Like.

338
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,080
 (audience laughs)

339
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,480
 - But then at the end of this,

340
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,360
 you've got to climb on top of another set of stairs.

341
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,520
 - To podium.

342
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,360
 - Yeah.

343
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,360
 - Do you think some people kind of cheat

344
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,080
 and at the end, they pretend they've come second

345
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,760
 and then they race to the top one of the podium

346
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,600
 in the last minute.

347
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,440
 - Corribate?

348
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,280
 (audience laughs)

349
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,520
 - We need to move on to our next facts very soon.

350
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,680
 You guys got anything before we do?

351
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,000
 - This is massively off topic.

352
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,840
 - Yeah.

353
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,000
 - Just, I was reading about going upstairs two at a time

354
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,840
 and there's a guardian.

355
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,360
 - That's quite on topic actually.

356
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,200
 - Just you wait.

357
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,720
 (audience laughs)

358
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,040
 - There's a guardian, notes and queries,

359
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,720
 you know, where they get questions from the public

360
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,040
 and they're really interesting questions.

361
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,000
 And one of them was is taking the stairs two at a time.

362
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,760
 Good for us.

363
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,920
 And I looked up a few other notes and queries things.

364
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,120
 One of them is, is it actually possible

365
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,320
 to take a photograph of a river?

366
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,080
 'Cause it moves, so, you know, what have you photographed?

367
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,920
 Right?

368
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,760
 (audience laughs)

369
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,600
 - It's genius.

370
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,440
 It's genius.

371
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,280
 - That's not genius.

372
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,120
 - It's never again.

373
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,640
 That bit of water is never there again.

374
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,400
 - But that's true of time.

375
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,960
 Like, if I take a photo of you now,

376
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
 then time has moved on and you're gonna be older

377
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,800
 than you are.

378
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,120
 - That's one of the most popular answers.

379
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,120
 (audience laughs)

380
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,920
 - Is it okay to do the crossword in the newspaper

381
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,480
 for cafe customers?

382
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,960
 Is it weird to be talking to myself so much?

383
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,440
 (audience laughs)

384
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,840
 And how many layers of paint would I need to apply

385
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,160
 to make opposite walls touch?

386
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,000
 (audience laughs)

387
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,640
 - I think the last layer is gonna be quite hard to do, isn't it?

388
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,640
 (audience laughs)

389
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,840
 - Just paint to yourself, not into a car, no, but into it.

390
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,840
 (audience laughs)

391
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,440
 - All right, let's move on to our next bag.

392
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,880
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

393
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,920
 - Okay, my fact this week is that there's a tanning salon

394
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,480
 in St. Andrews called Sun Tandrews.

395
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,480
 (audience laughs)

396
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,360
 Now, don't get too excited, guys,

397
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,240
 because when I say verse,

398
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,760
 it's THERP apostrophe S, and it's short for there was,

399
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
 (audience laughs)

400
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,000
 because I check Google today,

401
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,040
 and it's not there anymore.

402
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,880
 - Wow.

403
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,360
 - It's now a tanning salon called Abbott Hattan.

404
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,560
 - What? - No, I don't get it.

405
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,800
 A beta tan, a beta tan?

406
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,640
 - Oh, a beta tan?

407
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,880
 - A beta tan, yeah, a beta tan, actually.

408
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,360
 It's still not great though, is it?

409
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,000
 - No, it's no Sun Tandrews, which is genius.

410
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,960
 - It is, but this is just a fact, this was told to me

411
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,360
 by our colleague, Anne Miller,

412
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,560
 who used to live up here,

413
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,920
 used to live in St. Andrews,

414
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,280
 and I just think it's awesome.

415
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,480
 And I thought we could talk about maybe Sun Tans

416
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,360
 and tanning salons and stuff like that.

417
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,560
 - We should, although I think we should say for Anne Miller's sake,

418
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,640
 that I don't think she's ever been in a tanning salon.

419
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,960
 I don't want people to get the impression

420
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,560
 that she was on the sunbed every day.

421
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,280
 - She's got a life for a pun, hasn't she?

422
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,600
 - She's got a life for a pun.

423
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,400
 She's been in the punning salon, yeah.

424
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
 (audience laughs)

425
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,000
 - There's a cool pun one in Edinburgh,

426
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 and maybe you guys will know if this still exists,

427
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,440
 but so there's a property shop,

428
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,000
 and it's called the property shop,

429
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,080
 and right next to it, someone set up a cafe

430
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,040
 called the property shop, and so that just...

431
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
 (audience laughs)

432
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,400
 - It's the same company, it's in Stockbridge, isn't it?

433
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,160
 It's the same, so it was a state agency,

434
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,840
 and it was the same guy said, let's have a cafe.

435
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,680
 - Oh really?

436
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,880
 - It's cool. - It's hard of our thing, yeah.

437
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,720
 - Okay, cool.

438
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,440
 - On Sun Tans, I found out that,

439
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,760
 so obviously getting a Sun Tant is bad for you,

440
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,120
 in lots of ways, and there's no way of getting a tan

441
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,680
 without doing damage to the skin,

442
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,240
 as in the protection that you get in future,

443
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,000
 is the damage that you do,

444
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,840
 except that there is a team at Massachusetts General Hospital,

445
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,440
 and they have invented a drug, which you can take,

446
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,240
 which will give you a Sun Tant, with no Sun.

447
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,640
 - Wow. - Nice.

448
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,440
 - And this is amazing, it produces melanin,

449
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,680
 which is the thing that protects you from skin cancer,

450
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,680
 and it could provide the elixir of tanning a red-haired tan.

451
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,040
 - Oh. - Yeah, you could have,

452
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,880
 'cause people with red hair, they have a genetic mutation,

453
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,120
 which disrupts the process,

454
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,280
 and makes it very hard for people with red hair to tan,

455
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,400
 this could create a big gray and...

456
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
 - Oh, wow.

457
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,560
 (audience laughs)

458
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,840
 - That's very cool.

459
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,120
 - Do you know, 'cause it is bad for you,

460
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,400
 and there's been a lot of publicity,

461
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,840
 now recently about it, you have to get your fingerprints checked

462
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
 in a lot of tanning salons,

463
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,320
 so like the tanning salon, the tanning shop,

464
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,160
 which has a lot of branches over the UK,

465
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,160
 you're fingerprinted, and if you've come in

466
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,640
 and get before that day, they don't let you in.

467
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,800
 - Oh, really? - Wow.

468
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,640
 - Yeah. - That's quite good.

469
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,200
 - These tanning salons and airports.

470
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,760
 - But actually people didn't really care about,

471
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,160
 like, Sun Tant's did they, for ages and ages and ages,

472
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,240
 because basically having a Sun Tant meant that you were poor

473
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,840
 and you worked outside, you were a labourer,

474
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,280
 and so it was always thought that if you had light skin,

475
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,440
 it was better.

476
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,240
 But then Coco Chanel accidentally got tanned

477
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,360
 when she went on a Mediterranean cruise in 1923,

478
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,960
 and suddenly always everyone thought,

479
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
 this is the thing that we all need to have now.

480
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,120
 So it's quite a relatively new thing.

481
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,960
 - Yeah.

482
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,440
 - You know, when Sun Tant's got popular,

483
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,000
 after the Coco Chanel incident,

484
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,880
 then obviously a lot of kind of merchandise popped up

485
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,560
 around them, and popular science wrote an article

486
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,720
 about all the weird Sun Tanting technologies

487
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,440
 that have been invented since kind of 1920s, 1930s,

488
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,120
 and there were some crazy stuff people were doing.

489
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,160
 So in 1938, it wrote about a rotating Sun tub,

490
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,720
 which is basically a tent that you brought to the beach,

491
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,800
 and it had like huge wooden kind of structure

492
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,920
 that you had to bring to the beach, and you erected it,

493
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,520
 and it followed the Sun's movements.

494
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,880
 So you lay inside it and you had a little steering wheel,

495
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,400
 and so you could steer the tent to point you

496
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
 towards the Sun.

497
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,920
 - That's a really good idea.

498
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,480
 - It's incredible.

499
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,160
 - So you're in the wooden structure,

500
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,760
 but there's a gap of sunlight for your body.

501
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,600
 - Exactly.

502
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,480
 - But are you kind of steering it towards the Sun,

503
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,960
 or does it do it automatically?

504
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,680
 - You have to steer.

505
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,240
 - But you've got to do something.

506
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,160
 Otherwise, it's boring.

507
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,240
 - Fair enough.

508
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,040
 You can get bacon smelling sunscreen.

509
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,880
 - Why would you want that?

510
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
 - Well, because lots of people like bacon.

511
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,360
 - Yeah.

512
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,120
 - According to the website of this thing,

513
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,040
 science has shown us that 10 out of 10 people

514
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,080
 prefer the smell of bacon to coconut.

515
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,920
 - Sorry.

516
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,000
 (audience laughing)

517
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,640
 - Can't argue with science, Andy.

518
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,120
 (audience laughing)

519
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,880
 - 10 out of 10, including vegetarian's and vegans.

520
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,640
 - The smell, the smell of bacon.

521
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,680
 - Is this another study done

522
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,400
 by one of Jeremy Corbyn's Cabinet?

523
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,920
 (audience laughing)

524
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
 - Very questionable.

525
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,640
 - Last year, KFC sold sunscreen which smelled of KFC.

526
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,160
 - Oh, yeah.

527
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,600
 - It would protect your skin while the real fried chicken scent

528
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,480
 leaves you smelling delicious.

529
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,880
 (audience laughing)

530
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,760
 They had 3,000 tubes and everyone was disappointed

531
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,760
 'cause they sold out in two hours.

532
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,280
 But luckily, they learned the lesson

533
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,680
 and that was the last time KFC ever ran out of anything.

534
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,520
 Ever again.

535
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,520
 (audience laughing)

536
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,320
 - Speaking of artificial tanning,

537
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,720
 sometimes people can overdo it.

538
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,400
 I just wanted to share this headline from the mail.

539
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,640
 A young mother claims she was housebound for a week

540
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,080
 after a fake tan fail, left her looking,

541
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,960
 like she'd bathed in chocolate spread,

542
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
 with pals even mistaking her for a brown leather sofa.

543
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,840
 (audience laughing)

544
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,680
 - That is, I mean, what, like, guys, stop sitting on me.

545
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,160
 What are you doing?

546
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
 Did it change her whole body shape?

547
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,000
 - I don't know.

548
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,440
 - It's interesting, the methods that people used to go

549
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,200
 about to try and get a tan back in the day.

550
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,320
 And I read about one which I think people still occasionally

551
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,880
 try, which is to use tea bags.

552
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,000
 So, what you do is just put a lot of tea bags

553
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,800
 into a hot bath, and you would get in the bath,

554
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,600
 and you would allow that to cook you into a pot.

555
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,360
 - Have you put the milk in first?

556
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,000
 (audience laughing)

557
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,240
 They didn't say in the article.

558
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,080
 - I heard that that was done in the wall,

559
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,560
 where women wanted a tan, but obviously,

560
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,240
 there's no way of getting a tan,

561
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,080
 'cause you can't go on holiday in Greece anymore.

562
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,920
 - What's the big problem there are people

563
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,080
 close to the Nazis?

564
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
 - Oh, yeah.

565
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,920
 (audience laughing)

566
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,560
 - I knew I hated those guys.

567
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,440
 But the thing I read is that, for people who try it these days,

568
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,280
 when they do it in a bath, they come across the same problem,

569
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,480
 which is how do you tan your face,

570
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,200
 because that's above water.

571
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,400
 And in order to tan it, you need to be underwater

572
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,520
 for a long time.

573
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,720
 So, a bunch of people bought snorkels, which they tried.

574
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
 (audience laughing)

575
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,520
 But, that was just weird then, when they put it.

576
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,760
 - I think once you've got us far as getting in a bath

577
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,160
 with a lot of tea bags, looking weird

578
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,480
 with the snorkels, at least you.

579
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,920
 - But I think it's always a point where you go

580
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,640
 for no two-five, this is.

581
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,840
 - And so, what did they work any for now in the end of,

582
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,680
 they should not be able to do that?

583
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,520
 - No, they'll just don't do it anymore.

584
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,800
 - Well, the person in the article had a very white head

585
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,240
 regretted the whole experience.

586
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,440
 But yeah, you then just do it outside of the bath,

587
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,480
 you just leave tea bags all over yourself.

588
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,920
 (audience laughing)

589
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,720
 - Of course.

590
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,400
 - It's a thing, it's a thing, yeah.

591
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
 - Well, they also used to have milk spray,

592
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,040
 'cause people thought that milk could tan you better,

593
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,960
 stop me from burning, but give you a really nice tan,

594
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,200
 and there were motorized milk sprayers that, like,

595
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,840
 groups of mainly women in the 1930s would carry

596
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,800
 to wherever they wanted to tan on holiday,

597
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,400
 and like it was this big engine,

598
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,480
 and then you stood in front of it,

599
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,440
 and it just showered you with milk.

600
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,440
 And then you go on nice, even tan.

601
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,640
 I like this, the Daily Mail, that spoke to some people

602
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,600
 about how bad it is, but it's loved to get really burned,

603
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,120
 and it found that eight, 10 million British people

604
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,400
 said that they burned every time they went on holiday,

605
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,280
 which is a large proportion of the population,

606
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,600
 and the person the mail interviewed to talk about this

607
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,200
 was a spokesman for Superdrug, chemist,

608
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,880
 and he was called Martin Crisp.

609
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
 (audience laughing)

610
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,720
 - Hi.

611
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,160
 - We're gonna have to move on to our next hack soon.

612
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,520
 - There's a planet called Kepler-13AB,

613
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,600
 where it rains sun cream.

614
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,440
 - What?

615
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,280
 - What brand?

616
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,320
 (audience laughing)

617
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,800
 - It's kind of a titanium oxide precipitation,

618
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,520
 but it only falls on the dark side of the planet,

619
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,080
 so it's completely useless.

620
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,080
 (audience laughing)

621
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,880
 - Just quickly, I was looking at some beauty salon stuff,

622
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,160
 you know, tanning salons.

623
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,280
 Do you guys know about snail salons?

624
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,120
 - No.

625
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,280
 - So snail slime is the new thing in beauty treatments.

626
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,200
 It's really popular in, so places like Thailand

627
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,080
 and Japan, in Italy it's popular,

628
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,880
 and people who are running snail farms,

629
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,680
 because snail is obviously eaten all over the world,

630
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,480
 are diversifying their farms,

631
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,080
 and they hand select a few snails on the farm

632
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,040
 to be transferred to the salon,

633
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,240
 and then you book a session in the salon as a woman,

634
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,560
 you lie down, and you get a few snails on your face,

635
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,360
 just crawling all over it,

636
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,440
 and the claim is that it heals like your acne or scars

637
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,720
 or it slows down aging.

638
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,800
 - I've actually tried this.

639
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,640
 - Have you really?

640
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,480
 - It's good.

641
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,560
 The service is unbelievably slow.

642
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,560
 (audience laughing)

643
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,280
 - All right, let's move on, let's move on to our next hack.

644
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,000
 It's time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

645
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,120
 - My fact is that during the second mobile,

646
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,560
 the US government considered making all American shoes

647
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,200
 deliberately ugly.

648
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,600
 (audience laughing)

649
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,760
 So, this is the thing to do with rationing.

650
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,400
 They were very low on rubber, very low on leather,

651
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,720
 and they thought, "Well, how are we gonna do this?"

652
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,520
 Eventually, they decided to introduce shoe rationing.

653
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,040
 They said, "Everybody can only have three pairs of shoes

654
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,120
 "a year, and if you wanted that extra pair of shoes,

655
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,880
 "you had to fill in a really long complicated form,

656
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,360
 "saying why you want more shoes."

657
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,680
 But you could only, as a manufacturer, make four colors,

658
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,280
 and you could only have two different tones on a shoe.

659
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,040
 So, rationing was introduced, but the alternative plan

660
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,120
 that they did consider, I think, before rejecting it was,

661
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,520
 let's just make shoes really, really horrible.

662
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,840
 - Some people don't want to buy them.

663
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,680
 - Exactly.

664
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,880
 - And the four colors that they were allowed were

665
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,520
 black, white, army, russet, and town, brown.

666
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,680
 - Town. - Town, town, town.

667
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,520
 Like a place where people live.

668
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
 - Old tower.

669
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,000
 - No, town, town. - No, town, town.

670
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,440
 (audience laughing)

671
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,600
 Town.

672
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,400
 - You know, when people live in a tower.

673
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
 (audience laughing)

674
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,200
 - Sorry, I heard town, like the thing you rub yourself with.

675
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,680
 - No, town. - Town, town.

676
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,840
 - Town. - Town, yeah.

677
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,160
 - Like a city without a cathedral?

678
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,000
 - Yes. - Right.

679
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 (audience laughing)

680
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,160
 - Oh, why didn't you say that?

681
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,760
 (audience laughing)

682
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,360
 - So, do you say that two tone colors on shoes weren't allowed?

683
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,720
 - That was the maximum.

684
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,400
 - Oh. - You couldn't have three tone shoes.

685
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,120
 - Really, I saw that you could only have single tone,

686
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,320
 you couldn't have double tone.

687
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
 - Oh, maybe wrong.

688
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,960
 - You weren't allowed boots taller than 10 inches

689
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,880
 and you weren't allowed heels taller than two

690
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,200
 and five eighths inches.

691
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,160
 And you weren't allowed fancy tongues.

692
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,000
 - Mm-hmm. - No.

693
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,720
 - You also. - Tongs.

694
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,560
 - Tongs. - Sorry.

695
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
 - No. - Tongs?

696
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,400
 - Sorry.

697
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,720
 (audience laughing)

698
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,960
 - Tung, like a tongue. - Tung, yeah.

699
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,040
 Sorry, it's my accent.

700
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,880
 I know I do say the word tongue wrong,

701
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,320
 but it's the thing inside your mouth

702
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,480
 that you lick stuff with.

703
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,440
 (audience laughing)

704
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,240
 - I don't know what I had to say this for everything now,

705
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,480
 and I say from now on.

706
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,960
 (audience laughing)

707
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,200
 - Sorry, now it's a word that means you're not sure.

708
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,240
 - But when you say tongues,

709
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,000
 you are referring to the thing on your shoe.

710
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 - Sorry, yeah. - You're not saying

711
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,680
 you're not allowed elaborate tongues in your mouth.

712
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,840
 - That was the thing, they were rationed

713
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,120
 during the second mobile, fancy tongues.

714
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,160
 (audience laughing)

715
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,880
 - There was another thing where you could get

716
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,960
 a cheaper version of a shoe that would cost you less

717
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,600
 of your ration coupons, your clothing coupons that you had.

718
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,680
 And it was a shoe that was designed with a wooden sole.

719
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,800
 So, the problem with that is you get no bend

720
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,440
 as you're lifting up your foot,

721
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,600
 like any shoe that anyone is wearing in this room has,

722
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,600
 and so you would have to reinvent the way of how you walk

723
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,800
 with your shoe to avoid--

724
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,240
 - Okay, and the moment you're kind of

725
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,560
 waddling left and right, is that how they did it?

726
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,760
 - I mean, I'm putting myself into the place

727
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
 of the person with the shoe, and that's how I feel.

728
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,120
 - The shoes don't bend, is that the problem?

729
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,240
 - Yeah. - 'Cause it's a wooden bottom.

730
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,920
 - Just like a clog, I mean, with many with clogs.

731
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,200
 Like a clog, thank you Anna, yeah.

732
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,080
 - But people with clogs get around, okay, don't they?

733
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,920
 Nope, what? (audience laughing)

734
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,440
 What they then had to do is in order to make that

735
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,600
 a bit more of a useful shoe, they then cut a bit

736
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,160
 and they put a hinge in so that you could then walk,

737
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,080
 and the hinge would allow you the bend.

738
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,920
 The problem is, is that while you were walking,

739
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,480
 the hinge would collect stones,

740
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,160
 and so you would be stuck in the hinge position

741
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,480
 in a sort of leaning forward position.

742
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,560
 Like the Michael Jackson lean.

743
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,720
 - Yeah, 'cause he invented shoes, didn't he,

744
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,040
 that let him do that lean?

745
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,280
 - He did. - And he owned a patent for those shoes.

746
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,120
 - Yeah.

747
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,800
 - And they were, they kind of, I think you're allowed to say,

748
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,960
 they kind of, there was a bit in the stage,

749
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,800
 and he kind of slotted them into the stage

750
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,440
 so that he could lean right forward,

751
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,000
 and he owned the patent for that thing.

752
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,120
 - Which is weird, 'cause that's not really inventing a shoe,

753
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,200
 that's inventing a strap on the floor of a stage

754
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
 to put a shoe into. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

755
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,880
 - I thought though it had weights in it as well,

756
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,240
 I thought that it literally, you moved in a certain way,

757
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,160
 it kicked in a weight into function

758
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,080
 so that when you went forward, that would balance you as well.

759
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,920
 - Yeah, might be.

760
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,640
 - I don't, I've not followed the Michael Jackson shoe patent

761
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,200
 paper close enough.

762
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,760
 - Do you know you can get shoes for your shoes now?

763
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,960
 - What?

764
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,680
 - This has been shown off at, I think,

765
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,600
 Paris Men's Fashion Week in the last couple of months.

766
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,160
 Issues for your shoes have been designed.

767
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,880
 They've been designed by a Chinese fashion designer

768
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,440
 called Sanquans, and it sneakers

769
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,480
 that then have kind of an outer layer, which is a sandal,

770
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,800
 and you can velcro the sandal on and off.

771
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,120
 And it's so that, you know, if you're going out on dirty street

772
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,760
 and you've got new shoes, you don't have to get the shoes dirty.

773
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,440
 - Yeah, but you just want about your outer shoes.

774
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,960
 They're going to get dirty, I'm going to go through.

775
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,080
 - The person did comment.

776
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,160
 He said, we haven't got the triple layer stage yet,

777
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,520
 but who knows what the future holds.

778
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,640
 - Well, I could tell you what it holds,

779
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,400
 the fourth layer of the triple layer.

780
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,400
 (audience laughing)

781
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,520
 - God, it's the branding.

782
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,280
 - Well, so that's a big thing in Japan, isn't it?

783
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,560
 So in Japan, it's very employed the way your shoes

784
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,520
 into someone's house.

785
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,240
 Everyone takes off their shoes as soon as you get to

786
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,640
 a someone's house or a restaurant or whatever,

787
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,800
 and they give you a pair of slippers.

788
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,480
 And it's very nice, and you walk around the restaurant

789
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,240
 in the slippers, and it's great, except that when you go

790
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,000
 to the Lou in the restaurant, they have to take you

791
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,560
 out of your normal slippers and put you

792
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,160
 in special toilet slippers.

793
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,600
 And there's a real risk of social embarrassment

794
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,920
 that once you've been to the toilet,

795
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,160
 you then forget to take off your toilet slippers.

796
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,000
 - Ah!

797
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,840
 - Because they're very different.

798
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,680
 They look very different.

799
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,960
 So one writer said, he walked back into a fancy restaurant

800
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,920
 wearing a pair of bright yellow slippers

801
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,120
 with a duck having a poo on the toes.

802
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
 (audience laughing)

803
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,840
 And that was the design.

804
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,760
 - And that was a picture of a duck having a poo on the sole.

805
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,600
 - Yeah, it was.

806
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,960
 (audience laughing)

807
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,800
 Yeah.

808
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,120
 - In 13th century Italy.

809
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,480
 So do you know my favorite fact about shoes?

810
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,760
 I've said it loads of times.

811
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,320
 And that is in the 14th century,

812
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,440
 it was made explicitly illegal in France

813
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,680
 to make shoes that were shaped like penises.

814
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,520
 - Yes.

815
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,360
 - Okay.

816
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,200
 I found out quite recently that Queen Mary made it illegal

817
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,560
 to make shoes shaped like vaginas.

818
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,000
 - No way.

819
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,520
 Oh my god, your two favorite facts can get married.

820
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,920
 That's so nice.

821
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,880
 (audience laughing)

822
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,560
 Or at least have sex with each other.

823
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,120
 (audience laughing)

824
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,960
 - So in this all began in 13th century Italy

825
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,200
 and there was a thing, it was the cult of the Virgin Mary

826
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,480
 and basically everyone walked better

827
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,600
 way to pay tribute to the Virgin Mary.

828
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,920
 (audience laughing)

829
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,800
 - Well, it wasn't like the Catholic church hated it,

830
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,200
 basically, so it was like a cult.

831
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
 It wasn't like a, it wasn't just a thing.

832
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,880
 Everyone liked the Virgin Mary, it was a cult, you think.

833
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,080
 And they suddenly became really paid a lot of attention

834
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,280
 to the form of the perfect female body,

835
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,440
 which was supposed to be what the Virgin Mary had.

836
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,280
 And so they invented these shoes

837
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,160
 and they were called duck spill shoes, they were really wide.

838
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,280
 They were covered, they were heavily padded,

839
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,880
 they were covered in hair like material

840
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,200
 and they put slits in them

841
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,860
 and you wore pink hosiery

842
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,560
 and as you walked it was supposed to look like a vagina.

843
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,400
 - Right.

844
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,240
 - Wow.

845
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,080
 - That is amazing.

846
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,320
 - And this was high fashion in 13th century Italy.

847
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,160
 - No.

848
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,200
 - And then when Queen Mary came to the Crown in Britain,

849
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,960
 she wanted to curry favor with the Pope

850
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,720
 and so she banned them.

851
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,040
 - I, it was supposed to look like a vagina.

852
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
 - Yep.

853
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,880
 - And the.

854
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,720
 - Why?

855
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,560
 (audience laughing)

856
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,120
 - It was a hairy shoe that had a little slit

857
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,760
 which like pink sometimes.

858
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,000
 - So hang on.

859
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,840
 - Were the...

860
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,400
 (audience laughing)

861
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,920
 - Were the shoes just an act to me, guys?

862
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,840
 - Yeah, no, sure.

863
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,360
 - So were the penis shoes a response to the vagina shoes?

864
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,480
 People saying sort of as a prank, you know?

865
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,400
 - No, no, no.

866
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,440
 - My understanding is it's a complete coincidence

867
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,040
 that these two things come into this.

868
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
 - I believe so.

869
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
 - That's amazing.

870
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,920
 - The gender wall was fought in a very different way

871
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,760
 in the Middle Ages.

872
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,760
 - Some other World War II shoes that I found

873
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,280
 is there's a shoe that they were sort of invented

874
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,840
 to trick the enemy.

875
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,200
 So the shoe would leave the footprints of the shoe

876
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,600
 would leave a barefoot footprint.

877
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,600
 So it looked as if one of the locals had been in the area

878
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,200
 as opposed to a soldier who had a big boot.

879
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,440
 So on the bottom of the boot was just the shape of a foot.

880
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
 So we...

881
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,640
 - But locals wore the shoes.

882
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,960
 (audience laughing)

883
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,720
 - This was Southeast Asia.

884
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,560
 - Okay, yeah.

885
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
 - I should have said the place.

886
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,920
 - Did they make the footprints in the opposite direction

887
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,760
 to where you were walking?

888
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,600
 That would be clever.

889
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,280
 - That would be very clever, yeah.

890
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,800
 - We've said before some people did that

891
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,800
 or supposedly Australian outlaws put their horses shoes

892
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
 on backwards.

893
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,640
 - You're right.

894
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,520
 - So you don't think, oh, Nick Kelly's been through this way

895
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,600
 or has actually, Nick Kelly had been through this way

896
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,960
 but he was heading the other way.

897
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,120
 But this is also in Bhutan, they say that yetis

898
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,960
 have the ability to take their foot off

899
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,280
 and put it on that way round.

900
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,760
 (audience cheering)

901
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,080
 That's an actual Yeti fact.

902
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,920
 - Yeah.

903
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,200
 - I do know the fact about animals in your shoes.

904
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,400
 - Right, yeah, as a few years ago, scientists put boots

905
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,520
 onto dung beetles to find out how they cope with heat.

906
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,040
 This is so cool.

907
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,080
 So dung beetles, they find a ball of poo

908
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,680
 and they roll it around and every so often,

909
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,320
 when it gets to the really hot bit of the day,

910
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,240
 they climb up on top of the ball of poo

911
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,720
 and then they rest there for a bit.

912
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,200
 And scientists wondered, is that because it's really hot

913
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,920
 on the scientific desert where they're walking around?

914
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,760
 - Ah.

915
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,760
 - So if you put boots on a dung beetle,

916
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,920
 you will theoretically find out whether that's the reason.

917
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,760
 - Ah, yeah.

918
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,400
 - And the scientists put, I think it was

919
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,720
 little silicon shoes on the dung beetles

920
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,240
 and they said afterwards, turns out,

921
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,240
 it's very, very, very difficult to shoe a dung beetle.

922
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,400
 (audience laughing)

923
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,720
 'Cause they did, they managed it.

924
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,400
 They got the boots on them and it turns out, yes.

925
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,120
 When you have boots on as a dung beetle,

926
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,640
 you stop much less to climb onto your ball.

927
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,640
 So that is why.

928
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,960
 - Could it be that they don't want to get on their dung

929
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,440
 in case they get shit on the shoes?

930
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,600
 - Ah, yeah.

931
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
 (audience laughing)

932
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,320
 - They're actually working on a set of new outer shoes

933
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,200
 for the dung beetles in a shoe.

934
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
 (audience laughing)

935
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,680
 I read that in plow.

936
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,480
 There's a tradition of when people go into the reef

937
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,720
 and they're going fishing and so on.

938
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,520
 What they do is they take a sea sea cucumbers

939
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,120
 and they squeeze the internals of the sea cucumber out

940
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,040
 completely so the guts and everything go out

941
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,160
 and then they wear the rubbery shell on the reef

942
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,240
 so they don't cut their feet when they're in the reefs.

943
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,880
 Improvised nature shoes.

944
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,320
 - Why not just put some wetsuit feet on before you start diving?

945
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,120
 - No, this is in plow where they don't have necessarily.

946
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,480
 - Oh, they're just fishing and so on and so on.

947
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,560
 - The sea cucumber can eviscerate its organs.

948
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,080
 That's the thing that they do.

949
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,760
 But they stay alive after they do that.

950
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,040
 So this feels a bit...

951
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,280
 - Oh god, I live while you're wearing them.

952
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,120
 - What?

953
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,640
 - Well, they can stay alive because they regrow them

954
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,560
 and what they do is they kind of send out their organs

955
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,880
 and then hopefully like the fish eats the organs

956
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,960
 and they can swim away.

957
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,400
 - Oh my god, can you imagine at the end of the day

958
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,040
 being a sea cucumber going,

959
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,840
 you're not going to believe what happens to me.

960
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,760
 (audience laughing)

961
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,760
 - But also the anus of the sea cucumber

962
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,360
 which is where you're putting your foot.

963
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,200
 - Yeah.

964
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,840
 - Is they have fish living in those anuses.

965
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,120
 So you might get fish in your feet as well.

966
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,960
 - That's all right.

967
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,080
 - You've caught a bit of the meal already then.

968
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,280
 - I think if you've got your foot in a sea cucumber's anus,

969
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,960
 the fact that there's another fish present there

970
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,360
 adds very little to the overall horror of the situation.

971
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,680
 (audience laughing)

972
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,640
 - I could do it like, you know, in shopping centers

973
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,080
 where the fish eat your...

974
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,400
 - Oh yeah, exactly.

975
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,240
 It's exfoliating as well as being protective.

976
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,080
 - Yeah, that's great.

977
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,680
 - I've had that once and all I could think

978
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,000
 while I was having it was reincarnation

979
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,240
 and just looking at the going,

980
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,160
 what the fuck did you do in your last life

981
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,360
 that you have come back to eat my feet?

982
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,240
 - I had it once and I think I've told you guys this,

983
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,040
 but I had it once in Cambodia and they had to ask me

984
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,920
 to take my feet out of the pond

985
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,440
 'cause you put your feet in with like five other people

986
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,640
 and my feet are so disgusting

987
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,560
 that they were all coming to my feet.

988
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,960
 (audience laughing)

989
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,800
 - No one else is getting their money's worth.

990
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,800
 (audience laughing)

991
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,480
 - It's real, real actually the low point pride wise me.

992
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,200
 (audience laughing)

993
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,200
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

994
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,840
 and that is Chisinski.

995
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,080
 - Yeah, my fact this week is that the etiquette experts

996
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,520
 de Bretts run classes that teach five-year-olds

997
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,040
 to have strong handshakes and navigate dinner parties.

998
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,840
 (audience laughing)

999
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,720
 And this is, so I don't know how many people know

1000
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,040
 about de Bretts, but they's basically a sort of guide

1001
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,080
 to being a posh person, I guess.

1002
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,160
 And they started publishing their etiquette guides in the 1700s

1003
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,400
 and they still go on today

1004
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,120
 and it's kind of teaching people how to perform well socially.

1005
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,880
 And they recently started doing these classes

1006
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,360
 which are called Signet Schools.

1007
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,040
 And it's for, it's meant to be for six to 12-year-olds I think,

1008
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,120
 but actually there's been such a lot of demand

1009
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,960
 that they're letting in five-year-olds.

1010
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,840
 And yeah, they teach them to do things like shake hands well

1011
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,760
 and perform well at dinner party and talk to grownups.

1012
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,840
 And it's to teach children of primary school age,

1013
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,160
 of early primary school age, social ease and confidence

1014
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,720
 and charisma and charm to guarantee

1015
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,320
 that they are both invited back to the next play date

1016
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
 and successful in interviews.

1017
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
 (audience laughing)

1018
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,400
 - Who's interviewing a five-year-old?

1019
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,760
 - You know, business is getting really desperate.

1020
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,200
 - Well, I've just opened another 19th century factory

1021
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,040
 that I need.

1022
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,400
 (audience laughing)

1023
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,560
 - Like school interviews.

1024
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,400
 - Yeah.

1025
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,240
 - Yeah, all right.

1026
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,720
 - So there was a report by one of the mothers

1027
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,040
 who sent her child on this.

1028
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,800
 And at the very end of the piece she wrote about it,

1029
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,080
 she gave her review of the whole experience.

1030
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,480
 She said, "The pleases and thank yous trip off the tongue

1031
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,360
 "and despite the occasional poop joke

1032
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,000
 "and a little light nose-picking,

1033
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,680
 "he's become really quite charming."

1034
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,640
 (audience laughing)

1035
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,680
 - But you do pay for it.

1036
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,000
 So I think it starts at about 650 pounds for two hours

1037
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,320
 to send your five-year-old to this.

1038
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,200
 But yeah, one woman who wrote a blog said,

1039
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,760
 "I think I'd have a really strong handshake at the end of that."

1040
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,680
 (audience laughing)

1041
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,560
 I've got a proper bone crusher.

1042
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,680
 (audience laughing)

1043
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,520
 - And that's just the start.

1044
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,360
 So the woman who wrote the blog paid 780 for two hours

1045
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,720
 to get her handshaking son back.

1046
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,520
 - They saw her coming, didn't they?

1047
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,200
 The normal price is 650 pounds to you, 780.

1048
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,640
 (audience laughing)

1049
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,760
 - You know, the depress, the depress offer advice

1050
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,120
 on eating bananas.

1051
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,920
 - Do they? - Do they?

1052
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,680
 - It turns out, I think we're all doing it wrong.

1053
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,720
 They're coming to the press.

1054
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,320
 Apparently, if you'll seated at the table,

1055
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,880
 the correct way to eat a banana is to peel it,

1056
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,640
 then use a fork to cut the flesh into bite-sized pieces.

1057
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,840
 In other, more informal situations,

1058
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,760
 we recommend peeling bit by bit

1059
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,560
 and breaking bite-sized bits of the banana off.

1060
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,240
 - That's not the way to do it, is it?

1061
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,480
 Do you always see on the internet

1062
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,440
 that you're supposed to eat bananas upside down, aren't you?

1063
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,240
 'Cause that's a way that monkeys do it or something like that.

1064
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,000
 I always break it, I always open it in the middle.

1065
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,160
 (audience laughing)

1066
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,000
 - Do you?

1067
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,400
 - I actually do do that.

1068
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,600
 I open it in the middle and then take the banana out

1069
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,840
 and then eat it without the skin.

1070
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,680
 - Right.

1071
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,680
 - You're a psychopath.

1072
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,520
 - I think.

1073
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,560
 (audience laughing)

1074
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,800
 Hang on, do you mean you snap it in too?

1075
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,000
 - No, no, no, you get the banana

1076
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,720
 and you kind of make a little hole in the middle of it

1077
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,840
 and then you open it up and then you pull the banana out

1078
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,120
 and you eat it.

1079
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,000
 - I'm sure there are other people who eat it.

1080
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,600
 - And then you reattach the skin

1081
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,840
 to make it look like a whole banana.

1082
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,760
 You put it back on the shelf

1083
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,440
 and then you leave the supermarket.

1084
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,200
 (audience laughing)

1085
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,800
 - There's actually, Debrez has a whole section

1086
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,080
 on difficult foods.

1087
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,000
 If you go to the website and enlist all the difficult foods

1088
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,560
 to eat and so one example is grapes,

1089
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,520
 which I always thought were quite an easy food,

1090
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,720
 but a grape show off.

1091
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,560
 - Yeah.

1092
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,960
 (audience laughing)

1093
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,080
 - No, they're very strict.

1094
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,480
 They say don't pick individual grapes from a bunch.

1095
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,840
 You have to remove a small bunch from the big bunch

1096
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,280
 and then eat from that using either your fingers

1097
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,640
 or grape scissors.

1098
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,480
 (audience laughing)

1099
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,280
 - Grape scissors, I've seen those.

1100
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,720
 I've been to a cutlery collecting man's house.

1101
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
 (audience laughing)

1102
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,560
 - Oh no.

1103
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,400
 - He showed me his grape scissors, they're really--

1104
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,240
 - Oh wow.

1105
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,080
 - How do they differ from normal scissors?

1106
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,920
 - They do not.

1107
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,840
 (audience laughing)

1108
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,200
 - Are they quite small or?

1109
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,440
 - They're quite, yeah, they're not massive shears.

1110
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,080
 You know, they're small, yeah.

1111
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,920
 - Why?

1112
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,080
 - I struggled anyway with the my stock.

1113
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,200
 - Did he have, 'cause Debrez also says that

1114
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,880
 if you're eating oranges, then if it's semi-difficult to peel,

1115
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,680
 you should cut it in half and eat it with a teaspoon,

1116
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,600
 which I'd never considered doing at all.

1117
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,680
 - I don't think anyone does any of this stuff,

1118
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,520
 do they really?

1119
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,360
 - No.

1120
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,160
 - I have eaten a banana with a knife in fork once

1121
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,320
 and it was actually very nice.

1122
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,160
 So.

1123
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,640
 - Yeah, but that wasn't because of the way you were eating it, though.

1124
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,280
 - You know, you would have tasted the same

1125
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,720
 if it had done my psychopath layer of eating it.

1126
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,160
 - No, I'd tell you what, it made me pace myself and enjoy it.

1127
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,320
 (audience laughing)

1128
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,320
 Was there a special reason that you decided to try that?

1129
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,160
 - Yeah, it was really odd.

1130
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,560
 I was on British Airways coming back from New York

1131
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,480
 and they came and they put a banana down

1132
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,680
 and a knife in fork and they walked away and...

1133
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,680
 (audience laughing)

1134
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,640
 It's so I thought I'd better challenge accepted.

1135
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,560
 (audience laughing)

1136
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,040
 So, de Bratz also do, they've got some rules

1137
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,200
 for polite social networking.

1138
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,600
 So, one they say is, this is I'm guessing for Facebook,

1139
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,360
 think before you poke.

1140
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,720
 That's a first suggestion.

1141
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,000
 (audience laughing)

1142
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,160
 Always wait 24 hours before accepting

1143
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,920
 or removing someone as a friend.

1144
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,200
 The delay will help you gather your thoughts,

1145
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,400
 which is just great philosophy, generally, isn't it?

1146
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,240
 - 750 quid for that one.

1147
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,480
 (audience laughing)

1148
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,640
 - No, that actually is a price.

1149
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,480
 - What?

1150
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,560
 - 750 quid and it's for 13 to 16 year olds.

1151
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,400
 - No way.

1152
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,040
 We're just giving it away for free right now.

1153
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,040
 As you have got lucky, this is an absolute bargain.

1154
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,040
 - The guy who started de Bratz was called John de Bratz

1155
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,400
 and he began his career with de Bratz Parridge,

1156
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,280
 which was a buck about lords and ladies and stuff like that.

1157
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,120
 But he got into a huge argument with a guy

1158
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,320
 who actually wrote it and he went bankrupt twice

1159
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,200
 and he only managed to survive thanks to taking

1160
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,360
 a huge amount of money from his wife.

1161
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,200
 - Really?

1162
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,880
 - Which they don't teach you that in de Bratz, do they?

1163
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
 - They do not.

1164
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,040
 - It's encouraged.

1165
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,000
 (audience laughing)

1166
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,880
 - They're very strong on Perridge, though,

1167
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,080
 and actually one of them is frequently asked questions.

1168
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,720
 One of the most frequent questions that's written

1169
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,080
 into de Bratz is like how to address the royal family

1170
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,520
 as if really anyone's coming up against them personally.

1171
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,440
 But they've got very detailed instructions

1172
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,920
 as to how you address them.

1173
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,720
 And apparently, if you're writing to,

1174
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,040
 so if you're writing to the queen,

1175
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,880
 then you have to open your letter with,

1176
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,520
 may it please your majesty,

1177
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,680
 and then you have to begin the next sentence

1178
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,240
 with with my humble duty.

1179
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,880
 But then if you're writing to other members,

1180
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,280
 it tells you all the initials

1181
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,840
 that have to come after everyone's name.

1182
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,680
 So let's say you're writing the Prince of Wales,

1183
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,840
 if you're writing to Prince Charles,

1184
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,040
 you have to say on the envelope to his,

1185
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,160
 that's her royal hyenas, and then on a new line,

1186
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,320
 you say, for example, the Prince of Wales,

1187
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,400
 and then these are the initials that offer's name,

1188
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,400
 KGKT, GCB, O-M-A-K-C-D-Q-S-O-P-C,

1189
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,240
 that's all the things he is.

1190
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,840
 It's so great. - Wow.

1191
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,040
 - GCB is, he's a great master in principal night

1192
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,480
 of the most honorable order of the bath,

1193
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,880
 and that's about how they used to bathe nights.

1194
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,560
 So when you were knighted in medieval times,

1195
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,640
 you had a bath first thing you did,

1196
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,480
 and then if you're a great master

1197
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,080
 of the most honorable order of the bath,

1198
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,160
 it's about bathing when you become a knight.

1199
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,320
 Isn't that cool? - That's very cool, yeah.

1200
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,080
 - He's the only great master.

1201
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,760
 - Good for him. - Well done.

1202
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,480
 (audience laughing)

1203
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,440
 - I was looking up general etiquette things.

1204
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,280
 - Yes, yes.

1205
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,720
 - There's a book by an author called Henry Hitchens,

1206
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,120
 and it's called Sorry,

1207
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,440
 and it's about English people and their manners,

1208
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,880
 and he just lists advice from throughout the ages

1209
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,520
 of etiquette varies, obviously,

1210
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,080
 depending on your society.

1211
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,880
 So, for example, in the 15th century,

1212
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,400
 the Duke of Gloucester's Usher advised

1213
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,480
 that one should not scratch one's codpiece in public.

1214
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,440
 (audience laughing)

1215
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,160
 I'm a sayingable.

1216
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,840
 Erasmus, the medieval writer,

1217
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,040
 advised that one should cough to disguise a fart.

1218
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,680
 (audience laughing)

1219
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,360
 - Erasmus actually, that book that he wrote,

1220
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,520
 it was about children's etiquette, wasn't it?

1221
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,040
 And it was the best-selling book in all of England

1222
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,400
 in the 16th century apart from the Bible.

1223
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,560
 - No way.

1224
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,400
 - And some of the other things he said was,

1225
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,320
 do not be afraid of vomiting.

1226
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,640
 It is not vomiting, but holding the vomiting

1227
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,000
 in your throat that is foul.

1228
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,240
 - I disagree strongly with that, actually.

1229
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,880
 (audience laughing)

1230
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,800
 - If you cannot swallow a piece of food,

1231
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,400
 turn around discreetly and throw it somewhere.

1232
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,160
 (audience laughing)

1233
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,600
 - Better don't teach that when you're 650 quink calls,

1234
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,680
 I don't know.

1235
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,520
 - Actually, weirdly, did Brett say the opposite

1236
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
 so how times have changed?

1237
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,200
 They say a dinner party,

1238
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,720
 when encountering an unexpected piece of gristle

1239
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,760
 or something that may be chewed to no avail,

1240
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,240
 it is polite to be brave and try and swallow it anyway.

1241
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,560
 (audience laughing)

1242
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,200
 - Children troke all things.

1243
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,080
 - Well, you know you got a suffer for etiquette.

1244
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,040
 - I'd love to see the difference between Erasmus

1245
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,880
 and the Brett's, that would be really awesome.

1246
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,800
 Another one, do not move back and forth on your chair.

1247
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,440
 Whoever does that gives the impression

1248
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,480
 of constantly breaking or trying to break wind.

1249
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,480
 (audience laughing)

1250
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,320
 - Well James.

1251
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,440
 (audience laughing)

1252
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,440
 (audience laughing)

1253
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,440
 (audience laughing)

1254
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,560
 - Hey, we need to wrap up very soon.

1255
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,200
 You guys got anything for you to do?

1256
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,920
 - In Victorian times, women were advised to pinch their fingers

1257
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,200
 so the ends would be nice and pointy.

1258
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,280
 (audience laughing)

1259
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,360
 - Do they have what their fingers made of a plasticine?

1260
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,880
 - I guess so.

1261
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,800
 - It was just a thought you meant to have nice pointy ends

1262
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,880
 to fingers, nice and tapering, not sort of flat cut off fingers.

1263
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,960
 And one writer said that if your fingers are bad,

1264
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,880
 your bad fingers, then just pinch them lots of times

1265
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,360
 all the time.

1266
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,200
 - Oh, I know.

1267
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,600
 - And women were advised, and this is a thing

1268
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,600
 that happens today, I believe, to fill all gloves with cream

1269
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,640
 and then put on the old gloves full of cream,

1270
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,360
 and then you get a bed at night.

1271
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,880
 And that's the thing that still happens.

1272
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,880
 - No, it doesn't happen now.

1273
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,720
 - No, does anyone hear it?

1274
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,160
 Someone said yes.

1275
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,360
 - Yeah, see all women's voices.

1276
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,240
 This is a conspiracy, there's a cap from men.

1277
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,920
 No men know about this.

1278
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,360
 - Guys, what kind of cream is it?

1279
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,760
 Like, I think just any double cream.

1280
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,360
 (all laughing)

1281
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,400
 This is a thing, I talk my girlfriend about this,

1282
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,960
 and she said, Andy, we all do this all the time.

1283
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,400
 You've never paid any attention to anything.

1284
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,720
 Why do you think the bed is full of cream every morning?

1285
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,160
 (all laughing)

1286
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,320
 - I've never heard of it, but I'd be so creeped out

1287
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,640
 if my partner was wearing gloves in bed, so.

1288
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,240
 - I was so weird.

1289
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,440
 I think they're just on a murder or something.

1290
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,840
 (all laughing)

1291
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,880
 - That is quite something, isn't it?

1292
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,240
 But then you're just gonna have nice hands,

1293
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,800
 but what about the rest of your body?

1294
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,920
 You should really be wearing a full body suit.

1295
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,600
 - Yes, I'm covering it all in cream.

1296
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,480
 - With a snorkel to keep you breathing.

1297
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,240
 (all laughing)

1298
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,160
 - Okay, that is it.

1299
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,200
 That is all of our facts.

1300
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,920

 to send us in your favorite fact.

1319
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,280
 We've picked a winner and the winner is gonna get a copy

1320
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,160
 of our cassette.

1321
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,800
 So we have the fact here.

1322
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,640
 - The fact is from Douglas Wood and the fact is this,

1323
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,480
 at the first robot Olympics held in 1990 in Glasgow,

1324
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,480
 the English competitor was disqualified from the climbing event

1325
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,680
 because of inappropriate behavior in front of children.

1326
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,320
 (audience laughing)

1327
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,720
 It tried to mount the Russian robot.

1328
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,720
 (audience laughing)

1329
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,720
 (audience cheering)

1330
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,320
 - So we're gonna be out of the back.

1331
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,840
 Come and say hi if you wanna cassette.

1332
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,840
 Please do get one.

1333
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,720
 That's all from us.

1334
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,560
 Thank you so much.

1335
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,360
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

1336
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,200
 We'll see you again.

1337
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,040
 Goodbye.

1338
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,040
 (audience cheering)

1339
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,620
 (upbeat music)

1340
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:28,620

1341
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,200
 (upbeat music)
