00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,720
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Things A Fish coming to you from the

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,860
 QI offices in Covent Garden.

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,840
 My name's Anna Doshinsky, and I'm here with Alex Bell, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,840
 Murray.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,400
 What's again, we've gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,400
 the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, James Harkin.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,320
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1683, some people were ice skating in the Netherlands

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,000
 when the ice broke away and they floated all the way to Essex.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 [LAUGHTER]

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,760
 Well, it didn't happen.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
 No way.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,800
 Well, it happened according to some people.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,800
 So, this is from a book called The Thames and Its Tribute Trees by Charles McCoy.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,280
 It's an old book, and he says it's reported that this happened.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,520
 He says that some skate sliders upon those large icy plains were unawares driven to sea

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,520
 and arrived living, though almost perished with cold and hunger upon the sea coast of Essex.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,000
 Okay, and you know what?

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,720
 I don't really believe it, but it is a kind of thing that happened, and it's kind of related

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,040
 to the mini ice age that happened in the 17th century when it got really, really cold.

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,320
 And basically, the sea was freezing and all the rivers were freezing, and they had these

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,120
 frostfares in London.

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,840
 And there was lots of crazy stuff that happened, whether this happened, I don't really know,

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
 but...

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
 I believe it.

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
 Yeah.

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
 Because I don't want to.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
 Did they put a sail-up?

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,600
 Yeah, how big was the ice shelf?

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,720
 Well, that one sentence that I said is the sum total of all the information I have about

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
 this fact.

32
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,200
 Did they accidentally cut the raft off with their skates?

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,160
 Well, what used to happen is people would have these fairs on the rivers, and then they

34
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,800
 would try and keep them going as long as possible, because they were so much fun.

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,920
 But then, as the kind of ice got less and less and less, it would break up into icebergs

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,920
 and then people would get stuck on these little ice flows.

37
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,720
 And that definitely did happen.

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
 Yeah.

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,200
 They also tried to keep them going, because they were quite economically important.

40
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,120
 So the London-Temps frostfares happened partly because, when the temps freezes over, all

41
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,120
 the trade from the sea has to stop.

42
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,240
 And like, on one occasion, I think, was two months at the temps froze over.

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
 So...

44
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
 Wow.

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,960
 That all the people that are usually working on the docks and stuff like that had nothing to

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
 do.

47
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
 They had no income, all of a sudden.

48
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
 It was all very much as well.

49
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
 And they were really cheeky.

50
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,080
 So what they did, they would guard the access to the river, basically, because there are

51
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,160
 ladders and slipways, it's not just a case of walking straight out onto the river.

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,160
 And they would charge you two or three pennies to climb down the ladder and get onto the

53
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
 river.

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,000
 And then they would charge you another penny to leave.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,640
 Even if you left up the same ladder.

56
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,880
 Even if you left up the same ladder.

57
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
 Really?

58
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,240
 And you can't talk to the ticket inspector in the office and ask if you can get a refund

59
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
 on the register card.

60
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
 There's no office.

61
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
 There's no register card.

62
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
 There's no...

63
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,040
 I don't know about the incentive programmes they had to come and use the same ladder again.

64
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,760
 What happens, though, if you spend your last penny on a bit of, you know, candy floss

65
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,680
 or something, and then how do you get...

66
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
 You have to stay on the river.

67
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,880
 Or you float off to the Netherlands.

68
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,640
 They must have been so exciting, though, the Thames River Fairs.

69
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,800
 And partly because there weren't that many of them.

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,320
 So this little ice age, I think you were saying, was in the 1700s, but it sort of spanned

71
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,840
 from the 13th century to the 19th and reached its peak then.

72
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,040
 And there were only five Thames Frost Fairs, I thought, in that period, where properly the

73
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,800
 Thames froze over and all industry moved onto the Thames.

74
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,000
 So it must have been so thrilling when it happened.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Yeah.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,880
 You know, an elephant walked across, didn't it, in the 18...

77
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
 I remember that.

78
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
 1814, yeah.

79
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
 The last one, yeah.

80
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,520
 But what happened was the elephant walked across the river right next to Black Fry's Bridge,

81
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,960
 which seems unnecessarily dangerous, doesn't it?

82
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,040
 When you've got a bridge, you've got to use that bridge, then it will slap in the face

83
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
 of the bridge.

84
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,600
 They are kind of dangerous, because there was a bloke who, because a few people died falling

85
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
 through the ice.

86
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,560
 Like, really, really few compared with the number of people there.

87
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,200
 But one of them was a plumber who was carrying a load of lead across the river on the ice.

88
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,200
 And he, you know, clearly got to a weak bit of ice and fell it.

89
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,160
 But apparently, if that happened, a load of people and tents would just get dragged into

90
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,160
 a hole, which just sounds terrifying.

91
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,080
 That happened on a couple of occasions, like a huge chunk of ice and tents, and people

92
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
 would disappear.

93
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
 Oh.

94
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,480
 There was one time when the ice broke up, and there were things attached to a local building,

95
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,000
 and then the ice broke up and kind of drifted away and pulled this building down.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Oh, yeah.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I think it was a pub, wasn't it?

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,600
 And it was when a ship had been anchored to a pub near Rotherhise, and they just tied

99
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,480
 it around the beam of the pub, and then it dragged the pub down with it when the ice

100
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
 broke up.

101
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,480
 Like, when you take your dog to a pub and leave it outside and tie it up.

102
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,480
 It's the world's strongest dog.

103
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
 Clifford.

104
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,560
 Yeah, they put a cable around the beam in the middle of the pub, and then they put an anchor

105
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,400
 in the cellar of the pub to keep it there attached to the ship.

106
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,160
 I mean, you're just asking for the pub to be ripped out of its mooring kind of, yeah.

107
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
 Five people died, though.

108
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:03,680
 Apparently, the highlight in 1814 was they roasted an entire ox on the ice, and this guy

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,960
 called Ivan Day has replicated that and says it takes 24 hours to spit roast an ox and it

110
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,760
 would feed 800 people.

111
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,760
 It's also interesting that you could like fires.

112
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,640
 Apparently, a lot of the tents, like the shoemakers tents and things had fires in them to

113
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,440
 keep the people inside warm, and that worked somehow and didn't melt the ice, because it

114
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
 was really thick.

115
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,600
 They also had a lot of souvenirs, which you could get, right?

116
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,600
 But basically, they just had tat and books and toys and things that had been made in

117
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,280
 London, and they just took them onto the ice, put a label on them saying, sold on the

118
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,600
 icy Thames and then sold them for three times as much.

119
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
 I'd buy it.

120
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
 Wow.

121
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
 Yeah.

122
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,360
 Well, there was one book that was made in the Frostfare, it was called Frostiana, or a history

123
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,680
 of the River Thames in a frozen state, and the entire book was typeset and printed at

124
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,880
 a printing stall, which had been set up on the Thames.

125
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
 That is very cool.

126
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,640
 I haven't heard of any other book, which was printed at the place that it's about and the

127
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
 sold there as well.

128
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,000
 Do you know they had ice brothels today?

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Yeah.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Sounds very uncomfortable.

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 There were sex tents on the ice.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Nice.

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 I know.

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,480
 I think it's kind of one woman, the heat of her buttocks made such a great thought.

135
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,360
 She had leaf to drown the man of the law.

136
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
 So...

137
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
 I know.

138
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,600
 As I really said, it's probably not going to happen anymore.

139
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,480
 I mean, obviously, it hasn't happened for 200 years, but the reason it happened in the

140
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,080
 first place was that it happened near the Old London Bridge, right, and that had loads

141
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,400
 and loads and loads of arches.

142
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,880
 So it was really annoying for River Traffic because the arches meant you couldn't get

143
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,400
 big ships through there, and as a result, that slowed the flow of the water down and it

144
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,960
 meant that it was froze over much more easily.

145
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,920
 It actually sped the flow of the water up.

146
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,280
 What slowed the flow of the water down was that the Thames was much wider and shallower

147
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,880
 then because it hadn't been embanked.

148
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
 There was no embankment.

149
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,640
 So what the Old London Bridge did was the arches were much narrower, which meant that it

150
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,720
 was much easier for a block of ice that was flossing in to get stuck and sort of form

151
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,320
 the beginning of a dam which ice could then form across it.

152
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,880
 I reckon that we have the technology now to freeze the Thames if we wanted to.

153
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,360
 I was going to say, we're really cool if we did it again by just injecting...

154
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
 Probably.

155
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,640
 Yeah, I probably cost quite a bit, but Citi can, come on.

156
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,520
 I don't know if that one penny entrance and exit fee is going to pay for the technology

157
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,800
 of freezing the entire Thames.

158
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,680
 They used to play spots while it froze over on the Thames.

159
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,760
 They played football, for instance.

160
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,360
 They also played donkey racing, nine pin bowling, throwing at Cox.

161
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,360
 All right, sorry.

162
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,200
 Just go back because I read about the nine pin bowling and I want to know when they added

163
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
 the extra penny.

164
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,240
 But I like the way that I went nine pin bowling and throwing at Cox and it was nine

165
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,600
 pin bowling but you had a problem in.

166
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,240
 My understanding of nine pin bowling and ten pin bowling and this is going off really

167
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,960
 old knowledge is that they ban nine pin bowling for gambling and then they kind of put in

168
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,480
 an extra pin to try and get around the law.

169
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
 I see.

170
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
 Very clever.

171
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
 Yeah.

172
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,400
 Throwing at Cox actually sounds like it's the same as nine pin bowling really, doesn't it?

173
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,200
 It does, but with Cox instead of pins.

174
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
 Yeah, it's like an upgrade.

175
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
 Like the two.

176
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,040
 That's pretty much what it is apart from, so you get a chicken and you throw stuff at

177
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
 it.

178
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
 That's kind of how it happened.

179
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
 Nice.

180
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
 It was also shooting at Pricks.

181
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
 What's that?

182
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,160
 Yeah, it's not the same as throwing at Cox.

183
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,360
 It's kind of shooting at Pricks is an old name for a kind of archery, apparently.

184
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
 Wow.

185
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
 What was the Prick?

186
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,960
 I would imagine it must be the sharp bit at the end of your arrow.

187
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,120
 I would have thought that as well, but you don't shoot at that, do you?

188
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
 You're right.

189
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,480
 Are they throwing the board towards the arrow?

190
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
 No.

191
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,760
 It's an old word for a small indentation or something, so it's like a needle prick.

192
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,880
 So that's what you were aiming for, the little indentation was good.

193
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,200
 In 1540, the word Prick was a term of endearment for a man.

194
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,120
 So instead of darling or sweetheart, you would say my Prick.

195
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,840
 Is that because of the penis thing?

196
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,920
 Because the Prick, I'm sure, has meant penis for quite a long time.

197
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
 Yeah, I think it has.

198
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,160
 I think it's Shakespeareanish, isn't it?

199
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
 Yeah.

200
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,480
 So you say what's a cock?

201
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
 I do say cock.

202
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
 You say that all the time.

203
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
 And all the time.

204
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,760
 The cock is saying it to me.

205
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,640
 Well, in the 1960s, a spare Prick at a wedding was a bit of British slang for someone who is

206
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,720
 embarrassingly out of place in a particular situation.

207
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
 OK.

208
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,200
 I think that's worth putting it back.

209
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,560
 But not somebody with their cock out.

210
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,120
 That would be, I mean, that would work as well, isn't it?

211
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,120
 You wouldn't be out of place like that, and that's standard for a wedding, isn't it?

212
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,120
 We have just been to Dan's wedding, and I don't remember much of that going out

213
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
 on.

214
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
 Well, you were in the wrong room.

215
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
 Was that your room?

216
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
 Yeah.

217
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,680
 So Russia was quite used to these kind of things.

218
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,880
 It wasn't as exciting there.

219
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,920
 They were accustomed to their rivers freezing over and having big fairs and stuff on them.

220
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
 Still are.

221
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
 Still are.

222
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
 I've skied on the Moscow River.

223
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
 Have you?

224
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
 Well, I went to St. Petersburg.

225
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
 I saw a wedding actually happening on the frozen episode, too.

226
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
 It was amazing.

227
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
 It's been quite hard to stand up.

228
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
 Go down the aisle.

229
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
 Everyone's sliding around.

230
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
 Or to see the bride.

231
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
 Yeah.

232
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
 Well, that's...

233
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
 She's floated off the bit more.

234
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,920
 And I've accidentally married a snowman.

235
00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:04,040
 OK, moving on to fact number two, and that is from Alex Bell.

236
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,720
 My fact this week is that former Argentinian president Carlos Menem had such a reputation for

237
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,960
 bad luck that people would touch their left breast or testicle while shaking his hand.

238
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,760
 I find the wild shaking his hand a bit pretty insulting.

239
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
 I think they used the other hand.

240
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,400
 I understand, but it's fairly obvious what you're doing if your hand slides into your

241
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,760
 pocket as your shaking hands with the former president of your country.

242
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
 Yeah, absolutely.

243
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
 This guy is extraordinary.

244
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
 Yeah.

245
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,960
 We should call him the unnamable, because it's bad luck to say his name.

246
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,600
 So he's like Voldemort in many ways.

247
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
 Yeah.

248
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,000
 People instead say things like Mendes or Menen, where with Voldemort, you don't just say

249
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Voldemort.

250
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Yeah, that's true.

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Yeah.

252
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,200
 So he's supposedly not allowed to attend football matches, Argentina team football matches,

253
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,760
 because in 1990 in the World Cup, he visited when they were playing.

254
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,320
 And he approached the goalkeeper, Pumpido, to shake hands.

255
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,920
 And this was ages ago.

256
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,240
 So clearly the myth was established, even then, that he was cursed.

257
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,040
 The goalie refused to shake his hand because of the curse.

258
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,280
 He's just sort of put his hands up and said, "No, you're not going to, no."

259
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,080
 So then Menen laughed and he gave him a pass on the knee.

260
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,360
 And in the match that followed, A, Argentina lost and B, the goalkeeper fractured his knee.

261
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,520
 How do you pass on one's knee at such a stretch to get down there?

262
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,920
 He was probably aiming for the left testicle.

263
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,720
 Do you know that witchcraft is explicitly banned in Malawi?

264
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
 I think it is.

265
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,720
 In football.

266
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
 Is it?

267
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
 Yeah.

268
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,920
 As in, it's in their rules that you're not allowed to.

269
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
 Really?

270
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,920
 I don't think it's explicitly illegal in British football.

271
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,160
 But I did write to a referee about this to find out what the truth is.

272
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,600
 He hasn't replied weirdly enough.

273
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,200
 But I reckon that it would be unjentimally conduct, a yellow card and an indirect free kick.

274
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,200
 I don't think that matters, though, if you've just turned stoken to pigs.

275
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
 Yeah.

276
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,320
 Football is full of these superstitions, though.

277
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,040
 It's all, you do something once, you win a match and then you have to do it every time.

278
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
 Yeah.

279
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
 It's like scoring goals.

280
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
 Well, there's it.

281
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
 So there was a...

282
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,240
 Another Argentina guy, Carlos Bilado.

283
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,480
 In the quarterfinals, the goalie had to pee on the pitch because they were about to have

284
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,360
 a penalty shootout and there wasn't time for him to get back to the dressing room and

285
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,440
 have a pee there.

286
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,720
 So his teammates all surrounded him and they had a pee on the pitch.

287
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,480
 And then he blocked two shots and Argentina ended up going through.

288
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,880
 So the next match, every time there was a free kick and they made a wall, he peed against

289
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
 them.

290
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,520
 Next match, Bilado, made him pee on the pitch again because he thought it would be lucky.

291
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
 Right.

292
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
 Did it work?

293
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
 It did not work.

294
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
 They did not win the next match.

295
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
 It's going to be under pressure, aren't you?

296
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,520
 Like with, you know, 60,000 people watching it.

297
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,040
 So, yeah, back to menum and the reasons that people think he's bad luck.

298
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,160
 I like the fact that he shook the hand of the World Powerboat Racing Champion who was called

299
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,720
 Daniel Skioli in 1989 and immediately Skioli's boat crashed and he lost his arm.

300
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,360
 But then Skioli became an MP for Mr. Menum's party.

301
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,120
 Michael Schumacher, I think, he shook his hand and then Michael Schumacher was immediately

302
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
 shunted.

303
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
 Yeah, but then he narrowly won the next race.

304
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,600
 And if that's the curse of men, is that you win by slightly less than you're normally

305
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,400
 accustomed to.

306
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
 There's not much for curse.

307
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
 Yeah.

308
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,920
 He's also known as the father of the Debra State in 2001, Eacon and Wicca Laps, which is

309
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
 a pretty...

310
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
 That is bad.

311
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
 Heavy title to be taking.

312
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,160
 If you want to be the father of anything, it's not that.

313
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
 Yeah.

314
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
 Menum did become famous for his womanizing as well.

315
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,360
 So, he married a former Miss Universe when he was about 73 and a re-lock for her.

316
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
 A re-lock for her.

317
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
 A re-lock for her.

318
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
 I like this is confusing.

319
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,440
 So, there was an article listing all of his bad lucks and it ended on this.

320
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,400
 So, it went through all these people that he's cursed.

321
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,760
 It ended by saying, "The night before the 2000 US presidential elections, the unnamable,

322
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,920
 as in Menum, is said to have called his good friend George W. Bush to wish him good luck.

323
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
 Need I say more?"

324
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,800
 I mean, George was won that election.

325
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,320
 And actually, he's won that election despite losing that election.

326
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,600
 So, it's incredibly good luck.

327
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,800
 My favourite thing about him is that his surname is a palindrome.

328
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,680
 That's pretty much all I like about him.

329
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:15,280
 Which means he has something in common with ex-cambodian president Lon Null, who, as far as

330
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,640
 I can tell, is the only head of state ever to be a complete palindrome.

331
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
 Really?

332
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
 That's really good.

333
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
 Do you think they meet?

334
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
 Well, they have a little club.

335
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
 Yeah.

336
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
 One in the middle, somewhere in Panama.

337
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
 In Panama.

338
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
 Yes.

339
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,520
 In a canal in Panama, in a man in a canal in Panama.

340
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,560
 In his election campaign, one of the ways he won is that he swore he'd throw the Brits

341
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,760
 out of the Falklands.

342
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,440
 And then as soon as he did when he started really trying to ingratiate himself with

343
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,520
 Britain, to the extent that he angled desperately, according to the Guardian, for an invitation to

344
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,920
 Buckingham Palace.

345
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,560
 So many times did he announce that he had been invited to London, that the foreign office

346
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
 eventually had to let him come.

347
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,040
 Which, I didn't know you could do that.

348
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,000
 If you just announced repeatedly that the Queen's invited you to Buckingham Palace, she's

349
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,320
 eventually forced her to let you through the door.

350
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
 No, you weren't for any party.

351
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
 I'm coming tonight.

352
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
 I'm really looking forward to coming tonight.

353
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
 It's going to be great.

354
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
 I'm going to come into this party.

355
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
 I think that would work.

356
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
 Yeah.

357
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
 Do you think it would?

358
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,080
 Well, you're playing by a rule that other people don't recognise, or rather, you're

359
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,520
 not playing by a rule that other people do recognise.

360
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
 Yes.

361
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,560
 So if you just say, I am invited to this party, people will be embarrassed, even though it's

362
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,960
 nothing to do with them.

363
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,640
 It's all you embarrassing yourself, that the embarrassment will reflect on them.

364
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
 I'll be forced to.

365
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,640
 I'll be fine.

366
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
 Yeah, fine, whatever.

367
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,600
 It doesn't affect my life so much if they come to my party.

368
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
 Yeah.

369
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,480
 And I don't want to look like a rude idiot.

370
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
 Yeah.

371
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,160
 Weirdly, I did get a letter from the Queen yesterday asking if I wanted to attend her

372
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,400
 private reception next week, isn't it?

373
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,400
 I found a really questionable list on Quora.

374
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,800
 I think it was of some other superstitions in a discussion, by some other way.

375
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,160
 I like the way you said the word Quora in a real undertone in the hope that people might

376
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
 miss that.

377
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
 That is awesome.

378
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
 Yeah.

379
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,640
 My favourite ones were apparently it's bad luck to leave your purse lying open on the floor

380
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,720
 because that means that you'll lose money, obviously, somehow related.

381
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,320
 Also, if you eat watermelon with a glass of red wine, you will die.

382
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,800
 And apparently loads of Argentinians just like that's just a proper wise tell that people

383
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
 don't do that.

384
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
 You will die.

385
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,880
 I've heard things like that not just in Argentina because it used to be, I think, that you

386
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,320
 would have foods that were very hot foods and foods that were very cold foods.

387
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,840
 And even if they weren't necessarily hot or cold, they were felt that that's the effect

388
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,760
 they would have on your body.

389
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,160
 And the watermelon would be particularly cold and icy, whereas the wine would warm you

390
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
 up.

391
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,160
 And it would think that the two opposites would kind of clash, and it's Friday the 13th

392
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,840
 day, which is one reason we might be talking about superstitions.

393
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,720
 And there's a vet in Australia that has a promotion for Friday the 13th, where it's discounting

394
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,080
 its neutering for black cats.

395
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
 Oh.

396
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,800
 So we've got a black cat.

397
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,120
 I could fly to Australia and save loads of money getting it new to it.

398
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,920
 It's the aim so that there are fewer black cats because some people think they're bad luck.

399
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,240
 I think they're good luck.

400
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,120
 It depends which way they cross the road.

401
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,680
 If they cross from left to right it's one, if they cross from right to left the other.

402
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,640
 But is it different in the UK and the rest of Europe?

403
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
 That's a really good point.

404
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,560
 And also which way you're going on the road as well?

405
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
 No.

406
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
 You're coming towards the cat.

407
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,360
 So if it crosses from your left to your right, it's one.

408
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
 It's relative to you.

409
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,720
 Whereas someone walking the other way will experience opposite luck based on the movement

410
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
 of the cat.

411
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
 Right.

412
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
 You know left and right is always relative.

413
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
 Yeah.

414
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
 That's the thing about it.

415
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,640
 That is the interesting thing that it's impossible or there's not very many ways to explain

416
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,080
 to an alien, say, which is left and which is right if you don't have a similar field

417
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,080
 of reference.

418
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
 Yeah.

419
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,480
 I'd have more important things to talk about.

420
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
 All right.

421
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
 Yeah.

422
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
 I bet you'd freeze up.

423
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
 If it actually came to it.

424
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
 Yeah.

425
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
 I'd be very nervous.

426
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
 I don't know a good bit of new people.

427
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,480
 You've got your whole new species there.

428
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
 So I'm really looking forward to coming to your planet.

429
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
 Yeah.

430
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
 You've said that live time.

431
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
 Okay.

432
00:17:51,480 --> 00:18:00,880
 We should move on to fact number three and that is my fact.

433
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,800
 My fact this week is that Isambar Kingdom Bruno once spent six weeks with a coin stuck in

434
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,160
 his windpipe as a result of a magic trick that backfired.

435
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
 He did indeed.

436
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
 He did indeed.

437
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
 Yeah.

438
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
 So I've found this.

439
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,120
 I was, for some reason, I was looking him up in the British newspaper archive.

440
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,600
 It's a bit bored.

441
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,280
 And I found a no-bittery for him from 1862 and it said the closest he came to death was

442
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,200
 when he was trying to impress his children in 1843.

443
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
 Thank you.

444
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,000
 The closest he came to death was one second before he died.

445
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 The second closest he came to death, I'm sure they issued a correction the next day.

446
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,040
 He was trying to impress his children by doing a magic trick where he swallowed a half

447
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,880
 sovereign coin and then brought it out of his ear but instead the sovereign landed in

448
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
 his windpipe.

449
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
 So what happened?

450
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,320
 So what happened was he had chest pains for a while and quite bad coughing and he, because

451
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,560
 he's an engineer, as we know, possibly the most important thing he ever designed was a

452
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,480
 contraption in order to extract it.

453
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,280
 And I couldn't find any diagrams of it but apparently it was a movable platform with hinges

454
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,880
 on it which I think he strapped his body to and it bent his body over an 80 degree angle

455
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,120
 and then he was repeatedly struck on the back and the idea was that this would dislodge

456
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,120
 the coin.

457
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,920
 So he tried this out and it almost killed him one time so they didn't do that again.

458
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,760
 And then he took six weeks having various doctors fiddle about with him.

459
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,360
 All of them tried to get four steps in there and pull it out but he nearly died again.

460
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,760
 And then eventually he went back to the contraption but this time with an incision caught in his

461
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,160
 throat and he bent himself over on this contraption he designed and there was a incision on his

462
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,600
 throat which was, you know, when you have like a tracheotomy it was allowing him to breathe

463
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,320
 and so he then managed to choke the coin up and as it was rising up through his windpipe

464
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,280
 he was still able to breathe because the incision was there and his throat.

465
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,400
 And he coughed it up and he actually did say that the moment when he heard the gold

466
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,640
 piece strike against his upper front teeth was perhaps the most exquisite moment of his

467
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
 whole life.

468
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,640
 Wow.

469
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,160
 It was a really famous thing throughout the country.

470
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,480
 The isn't working through Brunelle Cointhick, everyone knew about it because he was very famous

471
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
 at the time.

472
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
 Yeah.

473
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,080
 So for example, there's a famous Victorian historian called Thomas Babbington McCauley.

474
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,760
 When he read the good news, supposedly he ran along the street yelling, "It's out, it's

475
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
 out!"

476
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,280
 And everybody knew what he was talking about because he was talking about the coin.

477
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,120
 It's an incredible story.

478
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,800
 It is so ingenious the way he got himself out of it.

479
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,520
 Yeah, and crazy that he got himself out of it and that, you know, all these dogs has tried

480
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,320
 and then he just built a machine.

481
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
 Yeah.

482
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,200
 Is he clever for getting himself out or is he stupid for getting himself into it?

483
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
 I'd say a bit of both.

484
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
 Technically he got itself out of him.

485
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
 That's true.

486
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
 Yeah.

487
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,840
 But yeah, I was actually looking him up because I visited recently the Brunelle Museum in

488
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,080
 Brother Heith, which if you are passing, it's really cool.

489
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,800
 It's absolutely tiny and it's the Mark Brunelle Museum.

490
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,520
 So it's about the Thames Tunnel, which is the first ever tunnel that was built under a river.

491
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,520
 And it was designed by Mark Brunelle and Isne Barbrunelle, his son helped him out.

492
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,800
 And it's a really cool place.

493
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
 Go there.

494
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
 It's an amazing story.

495
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,040
 It was like an unbelievable feat of engineering.

496
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,480
 And that's why he came third closest to dying as well.

497
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,720
 I got an extra act of the description of the conditions that the workers put up with

498
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
 that.

499
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,400
 They were showered in raw sewage and dodged flames from ignited methane gas whenever they

500
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
 worked.

501
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
 It was the worst job in the world.

502
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,200
 They only worked for our shifts because they collapsed after four hours and then would

503
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,640
 be replaced by men who were still breathing and then they would work for four hours and

504
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
 they'll be replaced by another shift.

505
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
 And they were constant.

506
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,560
 There were five floods, I think, one of which Brunelle was down there and nearly died.

507
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,920
 And it's just insane that they carried on.

508
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,840
 Why did they have showers of raw sewage?

509
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,360
 I think because there's constant leaking on the Thames, the service was coming in a lot.

510
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
 Disgusting, man.

511
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,840
 But you know when it froze up, would it just be like frozen turds everywhere?

512
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,560
 That's what it did, right?

513
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
 Bumpy skate ring.

514
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
 Yeah.

515
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
 I guess you have snow on top as well.

516
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
 Yeah.

517
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
 Yeah.

518
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,000
 So he brought a lot of this on himself in the tunnel.

519
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,600
 So he nearly drowned three times, right?

520
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
 He fell into a water tank once.

521
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
 But the fact it happened anyway.

522
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
 Exactly.

523
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
 So that's not so bad.

524
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,080
 But then there was a time where he was with a party of influential visitors in a rowing

525
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,680
 boat and he was trying to freak them out by rocking it from side to side.

526
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
 And nearly drowned.

527
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:19,680
 And it was the third time, the most deadly time, which we've just talked about, was because

528
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,120
 he was told you shouldn't dig through there.

529
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
 That's soft mud.

530
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,440
 That'll bring the river in.

531
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
 And he said, now it's fine.

532
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
 Don't worry about it.

533
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,120
 And he dug through that bit.

534
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
 River came in.

535
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
 Sealing collapsed.

536
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,000
 And he was pulled to safety.

537
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,520
 But six members of the evacuation crew died.

538
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,240
 Just quickly on the tunnel, something else you should look up is the painting that's been

539
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,440
 done of the banquet that they had inside it.

540
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,600
 So one time when it flooded to celebrate the fact that everyone hadn't died and it was still

541
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,560
 going, they held this enormous banquet and they invited all of high society there.

542
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
 That's asking for trouble.

543
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,840
 I was like, everyone almost died.

544
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
 What should we do?

545
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,120
 Let's get all of society back in the tunnel.

546
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,080
 Apart from everything else, you're basically asking for the riddler to attack.

547
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,280
 Well, it looks very exciting.

548
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
 Nobody died.

549
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
 So Christ is aversed.

550
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,080
 No, and it looks amazing.

551
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
 And they used to have stalls.

552
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,960
 So what did happen in the tunnel was they had lots of little market stalls running all

553
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
 the way through it.

554
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
 And it was a tourist attraction.

555
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,760
 It was much like the icefers and people would have to pay a few pennies to go into the tunnel.

556
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
 And they'd walk through it.

557
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,680
 I'm going to see the death tunnel of death.

558
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:23,480
 He also built an atmospheric railway, i.e. a vacuum railway, pumped along by pressure.

559
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,080
 And can we refer to it as the atmospheric caper, which is what they called it?

560
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,320
 It's the best name in the world.

561
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,640
 That's so cool.

562
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,480
 It didn't really work, unfortunately.

563
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,280
 So basically, it would be huge pipelines pumping out air to create a vacuum to push the

564
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,360
 train along with atmospheric pressure. But it's such a cool steam-punky reason it failed.

565
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,000
 The technology needed the air pipes to be sealed with leather flaps, right?

566
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,800
 They needed to be kept supple and moist.

567
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,840
 So they needed tallow kind of fat to be sort of smeared on them, right?

568
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,920
 Unfortunately, rats like eating tallow.

569
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,280
 So they ate a load of the flaps and stopped the system from working.

570
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,720
 So yeah, the system, the design was perfect.

571
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,200
 It was just the time when it was made.

572
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,720
 And it did work for seven months.

573
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,760
 It worked, successfully carrying people from Exeter to Plymouth, I think.

574
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,560
 And there is a pub now in a place called Starcross called The Atmospheric Railway,

575
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,400
 which sounds all modern, but it was from the mid-19th century.

576
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
 Really?

577
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
 Yeah.

578
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
 You'd be expecting a really atmospheric pub.

579
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,120
 I was going to say three days inside, really ironically.

580
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,040
 We should say the good thing about the atmospheric railway, the reason he made it, is

581
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,080
 because you don't need to carry your fuel with you, because there would be fuel planted along

582
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,600
 the way, so that the way that the vacuum was created was through piston action and every

583
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,520
 three miles, the pistons were fueled by steam, by little steam sheds.

584
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,800
 And so you didn't need to have all this heavy fuel that you carried with you on your train.

585
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,800
 So it would be efficient, but then we found electricity and we didn't need any more.

586
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:52,160
 So Mark Brunel, great engineer, isn't barking the Brunel, great engineer.

587
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,920
 So it's gone through the family.

588
00:24:53,920 --> 00:25:00,120
 And there is another direct descendant of Brunel called Moorwenna Wilson, who made a craft

589
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:06,080
 made entirely out of folded paper and managed to sail it on some water.

590
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,080
 Great engineer.

591
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
 Great engineer, right?

592
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
 It's amazing.

593
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:18,960
 It's completely made out of paper, apart from the keel, which is made out of wood and polystyrene.

594
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,960
 And the keel, I mean, what even is a keel?

595
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,360
 It can't be that important, right?

596
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,960
 That's pretty cool though.

597
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
 Yeah, no, it's good.

598
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
 That's awesome.

599
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,800
 So much people, two pennies, to get in it and sail it across the river.

600
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,800
 And then does she rock it from the side of the river?

601
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,080
 That's really tarnished, my view of it's working to Brunel, I think it was an absolute child.

602
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,720
 Well, he was a bit of a slave driver.

603
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,520
 Like, a lot of people died on the huge tunnel he built on the Great Western Railway.

604
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
 Box tunnel, yeah.

605
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
 Box tunnel, that's right.

606
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,200
 Yeah, it's supposedly about a hundred people died in the day of that.

607
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,360
 And he supposedly did it so that the sun shines down it on his birthday.

608
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,880
 I read that that's a myth though.

609
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
 Well, did you?

610
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,120
 Worked it out and we think it's pretty much not far away from being true.

611
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
 Oh, really?

612
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,280
 Whether he did it on purpose or not.

613
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,400
 We actually asked the railway company if we could go and check it out.

614
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,080
 And they said, no, there's high speed trades going through.

615
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,920
 Cool, one thing we asked you not to do is dress us on our railways.

616
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
 Yeah.

617
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
 So they wouldn't let us.

618
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,520
 But we reckon that at least it should pretty much work.

619
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,160
 Do you know one thing he did do in the box tunnel, speaking of high speed trains, is he used

620
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,560
 to quite like driving the steam train sometimes.

621
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,640
 And he was driving through the box tunnel once next to the driver and he was the one who

622
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
 was driving the train.

623
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,360
 And he suddenly saw a big obstacle in front of him to like to break and avoid it.

624
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,560
 And so James Bond put his foot down, like went full steam ahead and just blasted straight

625
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
 through it.

626
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,400
 That's what happened to our researcher.

627
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,320
 And it turned out that it was a carriage from another train that had accidentally fallen

628
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,160
 off the train and left on the track and he just blasted it into smithereens.

629
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
 Wow.

630
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
 Planned right through it.

631
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,200
 And action man, all of his work actually came from the time when he nearly drowned in

632
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,840
 the temps because he went to Converless for ages and Ages in Clifton near Bristol.

633
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,640
 And that's where he got hired for a load of jobs because he was thinking and writing and

634
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,960
 designing all the time he was converlessing.

635
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,920
 And at Clifton, so they had the two towers of the bridge.

636
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,360
 They didn't have the main body of the bridge, but they did have an inch and a half thick metal

637
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,880
 wire rope going across the gorge by the time while he was still alive.

638
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,360
 And he went across in a wicker basket on a pulley and it jammed while they were halfway

639
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
 across.

640
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,520
 And if you started rocking it, if you've seen the Clifton gorge, you know that is terrifying

641
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,400
 because it is so high at instant death if you fell.

642
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,920
 And he looked up, took off his hat, climbed up to the pulley, unjammed it and they continued

643
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
 along the way.

644
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,400
 Oh, that's the fourth closest he came to the bridge.

645
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,920
 Only the foundations of the Clifton suspension bridge were invented not by him, but by a lady

646
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,880
 called Sarah Guppey, who gave the plans to Brunel for free because she believed that women

647
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,480
 must not be boastful.

648
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
 Wow.

649
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,680
 Yeah, there's someone's written a book basically saying that Brunel was not nearly as good

650
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,680
 as we all think and he didn't design the Clifton suspension bridge.

651
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,320
 Hardly any of it was related to his original design even by the time that's fully made.

652
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,920
 I think it was pretty good.

653
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
 Well, read the book, Andy.

654
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:21,600
 I certainly haven't, but I read an article about it.

655
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,840
 Okay, we should move on to fact number four and that is Andy's fact.

656
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,320
 Yes, my fact is that to deal with violent or drunk people, Japanese police carry massive

657
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,560
 futons and roll the offender up in them to calm them down.

658
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
 This is fantastic.

659
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,080
 They genuinely, they turn criminals into burritos.

660
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,600
 And would that calm you down, do you think?

661
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
 I think it would.

662
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,400
 If you're rendered completely immobile and you're just sort of in your comfy foot on, I would,

663
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
 yeah, I'd calm down.

664
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,960
 Yeah, like when you put a bag over a horse's head and it stops.

665
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
 Yeah.

666
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,760
 Stop doing that, Alex.

667
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:56,320
 So this is from a podcast which is called My Perfect Country.

668
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,240
 Each episode is about a country that is doing something right in a particular aspect of

669
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,040
 law or society or whatever it is and you're doing it perfectly.

670
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:11,780
 So for example, this is about very low crime and particularly gun crime in Japan.

671
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,280
 It's almost impossible to get a gun in Japan.

672
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,280
 You have to do exams.

673
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,320
 You have to score more than 95% on a rifle range test.

674
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,520
 What, so if you do get a gun at least we know you'll be incredibly accurate.

675
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,520
 Yeah, there's no attempt to murder charges ever.

676
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,520
 Yeah.

677
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,880
 So that's what they should do.

678
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,440
 If you get less than 5% in the rifle range, they should give you help yourself.

679
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,680
 Yeah, and as a result there were six occasions last year when the Japanese police fired their

680
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,880
 guns in total and in 2014 there were six gun deaths.

681
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,120
 I mean, they just, they just don't really have them.

682
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
 That's good.

683
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,840
 We do have very similar stance with police people firing guns.

684
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:55,160
 Yeah, so anyway, this is about Japanese policing methods and how they roll people up.

685
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
 Yeah.

686
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,400
 It's from the sushi tradition basically.

687
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
 Is it?

688
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,480
 I think someone looks at some sushi and thought, wait a second, why don't we carry massive

689
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,320
 bits of seaweed around with us?

690
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,520
 What if that bit of cucumber was a violent offender?

691
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,920
 Yeah, I think it would be quite awkward as a police officer if for this very occasional

692
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,320
 time when you get a violent offender because like you say there's not many guns, but you

693
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,880
 always have to carry a massive food ton of that with you.

694
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,920
 They are slightly smaller in Japan, aren't they?

695
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,280
 So foodtons are a big thing in Japan.

696
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,720
 A lot of people sleep on foodtons and they're not like, I imagine, which is kind of a

697
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
 proper sofa that turns into a bed kind of thing.

698
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
 I'll know.

699
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,280
 Yeah, they're not - sorry, they're more like juvets than mattresses, aren't they?

700
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
 Basically.

701
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,280
 Kind of.

702
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
 It's a pretty supportive.

703
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,480
 It's a thin mattress that you sleep on, but do you know what else gets a food ton in

704
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,960
 Japan if you want it?

705
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
 Is your wallet?

706
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
 Yeah.

707
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
 So there's a food ton company.

708
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
 Yep.

709
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,200
 It's a food ton company called Naka Tagawa Foodtons, and they've started making sci-foodtons,

710
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,280
 which means wallet food ton, and it's made of high quality cotton.

711
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,200
 It includes a little cover, like a duvet cover for your wallet, and it includes a pillow

712
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,400
 for the head of your wallet, whichever end of your wallet is the head.

713
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,720
 It says it's been blessed from priests at Ashrine in Tokyo, and if you want to go more expensive,

714
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
 you can order a little bed that comes with it.

715
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,120
 I'm going to go out on the limb and say this company is not going to last very long.

716
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,560
 Do you see the amount they charge for these foodtons?

717
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
 Yeah.

718
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,920
 They cost about 115 quid, give or take for a food ton.

719
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,800
 For the food ton and bed is 340.

720
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,000
 So then you've got nothing to put in your wallet?

721
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,360
 Oh no, it's hilarious.

722
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,840
 They aren't beautiful, they look them up.

723
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,080
 I mean, I'd be tempted, but then I'm a sucker for this stuff like that.

724
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,200
 Have you heard of the Boroboroton?

725
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
 No, no.

726
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:45,360
 This is a legend, which is like an evil spirit described as a tattered food ton that comes

727
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,680
 to life at night.

728
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:52,360
 And it's basically part of a group of these kind of demons, these spirits called Sukumogami.

729
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,480
 They're basically household objects that either they're possessed by spirits or ghosts, or if

730
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,840
 you use them constantly for 90 to 100 years, they eventually become sentient and they will

731
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,480
 be fine and they'll just kind of behave like normal household objects unless they're feeling

732
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,480
 ignored or needless in which case they will come to life and try to strangle their owners

733
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,120
 and they'll float around to the house, or they will throw noisy parties with other members

734
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
 of this.

735
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,080
 So you'll get all your household objects having a party and then trying to kill you.

736
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,960
 But how do you stop a violence offender food ton?

737
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,400
 Back it up with a drunk person.

738
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,520
 So the police in North Wales a few years ago, this is in 2010, they hired a troop of actors

739
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,920
 to pretend to be drunk.

740
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
 Did they?

741
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,040
 It was to do a sting on a load of pubs in North Wales.

742
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,160
 They had about 50 pubs in order to check and see if they'd serve people who were obviously

743
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
 inebriated.

744
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,800
 So they hired a troop of actors to dress up as drunk and they gave them all the clothes

745
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,400
 and costumes as well, like they gave them shabby jackets, he trousers and shoes and they said

746
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
 go in.

747
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,920
 Pretend to be absolutely blind drunk and see if you can get served.

748
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
 Wow.

749
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,080
 But then you couldn't prosecute anyone because they're not drunk.

750
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,920
 I don't know, I imagine you could arrest on those grounds.

751
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
 And you don't think so?

752
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
 No.

753
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
 I mean either of us has tried it.

754
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
 Well I like this place.

755
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
 There used to be a landlord.

756
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,120
 There used to be a landlord for a pub.

757
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,680
 I had a personal landlord's license, yeah.

758
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,640
 What is that like having a drinks cabinet?

759
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640
 Is that just in your house.

760
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
 No, I'm not.

761
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,840
 The personal landlord's because I've got one of those.

762
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,840
 That means I could go to any pub and be officially by law, the landlord of that pub.

763
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,400
 So about 15 years ago they changed the law.

764
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,200
 It used to be that the building had the license, but then they changed it so that the landlord

765
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,360
 had the license.

766
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,840
 The reason they did it I think is because they had a lot of chain pubs and stuff like that.

767
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,200
 And I used to be an accountant for a pub company and I did my personal license.

768
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,360
 And so it meant that if there were like landlords on holiday I could go and work in the pub

769
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,360
 as the landlord.

770
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,520
 In fact I wouldn't even have to work, I could just be sat there while other people doing

771
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,200
 all the job, but I'd be kind of the one responsible.

772
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
 Wow.

773
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,920
 You can say, yeah, you can leave your ship outside, yeah, put the cable down here, that's fine.

774
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
 That's good to know.

775
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
 We should use that.

776
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
 I'm not anymore.

777
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,920
 It's slapsed.

778
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
 I mean it lapsed 15, 20 years ago.

779
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,920
 It lapsed.

780
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,160
 You're a pointless friend to us then.

781
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,800
 They have for drunk people on the streets of the UK.

782
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,800
 They've trialed drunk tax.

783
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
 What?

784
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
 They don't have drunk people on the streets of the UK.

785
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
 They're all acting.

786
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,760
 It's always my life.

787
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,760
 It's the Amdram capital of the world.

788
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,880
 No, they have drunk tanks now and the idea is that you get people out of A&E and you stop

789
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:29,480
 clogging up ambulances with drunk people and they've trialed this in Bristol and I think

790
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,600
 they've trialed it in other places as well and in 2014 for instance over one weekend it

791
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,320
 kept 15 people out of hospital because what they do is they had a mobile drunk tank which

792
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,640
 is just a lorry which if someone's really drunk and thinks they're really ill and collapses

793
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,200
 you shove them in the lorry and then let them have a nap.

794
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
 That sounds like a party.

795
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,000
 I mean I would get drunk and then be putting in a lorry.

796
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 That sounds brilliant.

797
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,120
 I think these people might have gone past the fun part of drunk.

798
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,560
 Oh that is going to be the most, it's going to be full of vomit and piss isn't it?

799
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,560
 It's going to stink yeah.

800
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
 Oh my god.

801
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
 Do you reckon they have futons in there?

802
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,560
 I don't think so.

803
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,880
 Everyone's all up in a futon.

804
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,200
 Actually they are just big futons made of metal then it's the same principle.

805
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
 Yes.

806
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,680
 I mean you can say anything's a futon made of something else, can't you?

807
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,480
 This building is a futon made of bricks.

808
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,680
 Excuse me, I've got a complaint about this sandwich.

809
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,480
 It's just a futon made of bread and cheese.

810
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,960
 You know you can buy speaking of bread and futon.

811
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,240
 You can buy a towel which is deliberately created in the likeness of a flour tortilla so

812
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,400
 you can wrap yourself up like a burrito.

813
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,400
 That's really good.

814
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
 Yeah.

815
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
 And sexy too.

816
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
 It's it.

817
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
 Oh yeah.

818
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,000
 People who invented this, they're a collective called ampersand friends.

819
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,520
 And friends or something.

820
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,480
 They told the Huffington Post that they were inspired by the fantasy of being a human burrito.

821
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
 Wow.

822
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,480
 We weird if they said that we were inspired by the collective works of Shakespeare.

823
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
 It makes sense.

824
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,480
 You are right.

825
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
 Of course.

826
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,480
 Odd reading of Hamlet.

827
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,120
 Actually there is a guy who's addicted to being rolled up in carpets.

828
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
 Is that?

829
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,120
 Yeah.

830
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
 Maybe he's part of this collective.

831
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,280
 I think he might be the inspiration for it.

832
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,800
 He's a guy called George OT.

833
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,520
 He didn't want to be known by his full name.

834
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,880
 He's in New York and he loves rolling himself up in a carpet and having people trample on

835
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,880
 him.

836
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,880
 It's charming.

837
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,600
 That's most charming it isn't ever heard of rolling up so much.

838
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,400
 It is quite sweet and now he hides himself out to parties and rolls up in a carpet and just

839
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
 trample all over him.

840
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
 He particularly likes women.

841
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
 He gets paid for that.

842
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
