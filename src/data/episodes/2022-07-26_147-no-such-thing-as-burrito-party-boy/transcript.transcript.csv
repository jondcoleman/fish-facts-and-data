00:00:14,00:00:18,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Things A Fish coming to you from the"
00:00:18,00:00:20,QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:20,00:00:25,"My name's Anna Doshinsky, and I'm here with Alex Bell, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter"
00:00:25,00:00:26,Murray.
00:00:26,00:00:30,"What's again, we've gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from"
00:00:30,00:00:36,"the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, James Harkin."
00:00:36,00:00:42,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 1683, some people were ice skating in the Netherlands"
00:00:42,00:00:46,when the ice broke away and they floated all the way to Essex.
00:00:46,00:00:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:00:48,00:00:50,"Well, it didn't happen."
00:00:50,00:00:51,No way.
00:00:51,00:00:54,"Well, it happened according to some people."
00:00:54,00:00:58,"So, this is from a book called The Thames and Its Tribute Trees by Charles McCoy."
00:00:58,00:01:03,"It's an old book, and he says it's reported that this happened."
00:01:03,00:01:09,He says that some skate sliders upon those large icy plains were unawares driven to sea
00:01:09,00:01:15,"and arrived living, though almost perished with cold and hunger upon the sea coast of Essex."
00:01:15,00:01:17,"Okay, and you know what?"
00:01:17,00:01:21,"I don't really believe it, but it is a kind of thing that happened, and it's kind of related"
00:01:21,00:01:28,"to the mini ice age that happened in the 17th century when it got really, really cold."
00:01:28,00:01:32,"And basically, the sea was freezing and all the rivers were freezing, and they had these"
00:01:32,00:01:34,frostfares in London.
00:01:34,00:01:37,"And there was lots of crazy stuff that happened, whether this happened, I don't really know,"
00:01:37,00:01:38,but...
00:01:38,00:01:39,I believe it.
00:01:39,00:01:40,Yeah.
00:01:40,00:01:41,Because I don't want to.
00:01:41,00:01:42,Did they put a sail-up?
00:01:42,00:01:44,"Yeah, how big was the ice shelf?"
00:01:44,00:01:48,"Well, that one sentence that I said is the sum total of all the information I have about"
00:01:48,00:01:49,this fact.
00:01:49,00:01:52,Did they accidentally cut the raft off with their skates?
00:01:52,00:01:58,"Well, what used to happen is people would have these fairs on the rivers, and then they"
00:01:58,00:02:01,"would try and keep them going as long as possible, because they were so much fun."
00:02:01,00:02:05,"But then, as the kind of ice got less and less and less, it would break up into icebergs"
00:02:05,00:02:08,and then people would get stuck on these little ice flows.
00:02:08,00:02:10,And that definitely did happen.
00:02:10,00:02:11,Yeah.
00:02:11,00:02:14,"They also tried to keep them going, because they were quite economically important."
00:02:14,00:02:20,"So the London-Temps frostfares happened partly because, when the temps freezes over, all"
00:02:20,00:02:22,the trade from the sea has to stop.
00:02:22,00:02:25,"And like, on one occasion, I think, was two months at the temps froze over."
00:02:25,00:02:26,So...
00:02:26,00:02:27,Wow.
00:02:27,00:02:28,That all the people that are usually working on the docks and stuff like that had nothing to
00:02:28,00:02:29,do.
00:02:29,00:02:30,"They had no income, all of a sudden."
00:02:30,00:02:31,It was all very much as well.
00:02:31,00:02:32,And they were really cheeky.
00:02:32,00:02:36,"So what they did, they would guard the access to the river, basically, because there are"
00:02:36,00:02:40,"ladders and slipways, it's not just a case of walking straight out onto the river."
00:02:40,00:02:44,And they would charge you two or three pennies to climb down the ladder and get onto the
00:02:44,00:02:45,river.
00:02:45,00:02:47,And then they would charge you another penny to leave.
00:02:47,00:02:48,Even if you left up the same ladder.
00:02:48,00:02:49,Even if you left up the same ladder.
00:02:49,00:02:50,Really?
00:02:50,00:02:53,And you can't talk to the ticket inspector in the office and ask if you can get a refund
00:02:53,00:02:54,on the register card.
00:02:54,00:02:55,There's no office.
00:02:55,00:02:56,There's no register card.
00:02:56,00:02:57,There's no...
00:02:57,00:03:01,I don't know about the incentive programmes they had to come and use the same ladder again.
00:03:01,00:03:04,"What happens, though, if you spend your last penny on a bit of, you know, candy floss"
00:03:04,00:03:06,"or something, and then how do you get..."
00:03:06,00:03:07,You have to stay on the river.
00:03:07,00:03:11,Or you float off to the Netherlands.
00:03:11,00:03:14,"They must have been so exciting, though, the Thames River Fairs."
00:03:14,00:03:16,And partly because there weren't that many of them.
00:03:16,00:03:21,"So this little ice age, I think you were saying, was in the 1700s, but it sort of spanned"
00:03:21,00:03:24,from the 13th century to the 19th and reached its peak then.
00:03:24,00:03:30,"And there were only five Thames Frost Fairs, I thought, in that period, where properly the"
00:03:30,00:03:32,Thames froze over and all industry moved onto the Thames.
00:03:32,00:03:35,So it must have been so thrilling when it happened.
00:03:35,00:03:36,Yeah.
00:03:36,00:03:38,"You know, an elephant walked across, didn't it, in the 18..."
00:03:38,00:03:39,I remember that.
00:03:39,00:03:40,"1814, yeah."
00:03:40,00:03:41,"The last one, yeah."
00:03:41,00:03:46,"But what happened was the elephant walked across the river right next to Black Fry's Bridge,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,"which seems unnecessarily dangerous, doesn't it?"
00:03:48,00:03:53,"When you've got a bridge, you've got to use that bridge, then it will slap in the face"
00:03:53,00:03:54,of the bridge.
00:03:54,00:03:57,"They are kind of dangerous, because there was a bloke who, because a few people died falling"
00:03:57,00:03:58,through the ice.
00:03:58,00:04:00,"Like, really, really few compared with the number of people there."
00:04:00,00:04:05,But one of them was a plumber who was carrying a load of lead across the river on the ice.
00:04:05,00:04:08,"And he, you know, clearly got to a weak bit of ice and fell it."
00:04:08,00:04:12,"But apparently, if that happened, a load of people and tents would just get dragged into"
00:04:12,00:04:14,"a hole, which just sounds terrifying."
00:04:14,00:04:18,"That happened on a couple of occasions, like a huge chunk of ice and tents, and people"
00:04:18,00:04:19,would disappear.
00:04:19,00:04:20,Oh.
00:04:20,00:04:25,"There was one time when the ice broke up, and there were things attached to a local building,"
00:04:25,00:04:29,and then the ice broke up and kind of drifted away and pulled this building down.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:30,00:04:31,"I think it was a pub, wasn't it?"
00:04:31,00:04:34,"And it was when a ship had been anchored to a pub near Rotherhise, and they just tied"
00:04:34,00:04:37,"it around the beam of the pub, and then it dragged the pub down with it when the ice"
00:04:37,00:04:38,broke up.
00:04:38,00:04:40,"Like, when you take your dog to a pub and leave it outside and tie it up."
00:04:40,00:04:42,It's the world's strongest dog.
00:04:42,00:04:43,Clifford.
00:04:43,00:04:48,"Yeah, they put a cable around the beam in the middle of the pub, and then they put an anchor"
00:04:48,00:04:52,in the cellar of the pub to keep it there attached to the ship.
00:04:52,00:04:56,"I mean, you're just asking for the pub to be ripped out of its mooring kind of, yeah."
00:04:56,00:04:57,"Five people died, though."
00:04:57,00:05:03,"Apparently, the highlight in 1814 was they roasted an entire ox on the ice, and this guy"
00:05:03,00:05:07,called Ivan Day has replicated that and says it takes 24 hours to spit roast an ox and it
00:05:07,00:05:09,would feed 800 people.
00:05:09,00:05:11,It's also interesting that you could like fires.
00:05:11,00:05:15,"Apparently, a lot of the tents, like the shoemakers tents and things had fires in them to"
00:05:15,00:05:19,"keep the people inside warm, and that worked somehow and didn't melt the ice, because it"
00:05:19,00:05:20,was really thick.
00:05:20,00:05:23,"They also had a lot of souvenirs, which you could get, right?"
00:05:23,00:05:29,"But basically, they just had tat and books and toys and things that had been made in"
00:05:29,00:05:33,"London, and they just took them onto the ice, put a label on them saying, sold on the"
00:05:33,00:05:35,icy Thames and then sold them for three times as much.
00:05:35,00:05:36,I'd buy it.
00:05:36,00:05:37,Wow.
00:05:37,00:05:38,Yeah.
00:05:38,00:05:41,"Well, there was one book that was made in the Frostfare, it was called Frostiana, or a history"
00:05:41,00:05:46,"of the River Thames in a frozen state, and the entire book was typeset and printed at"
00:05:46,00:05:48,"a printing stall, which had been set up on the Thames."
00:05:48,00:05:49,That is very cool.
00:05:49,00:05:53,"I haven't heard of any other book, which was printed at the place that it's about and the"
00:05:53,00:05:54,sold there as well.
00:05:54,00:05:57,Do you know they had ice brothels today?
00:05:57,00:05:58,Yeah.
00:05:58,00:05:59,Sounds very uncomfortable.
00:05:59,00:06:01,There were sex tents on the ice.
00:06:01,00:06:02,Nice.
00:06:02,00:06:03,I know.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"I think it's kind of one woman, the heat of her buttocks made such a great thought."
00:06:06,00:06:09,She had leaf to drown the man of the law.
00:06:09,00:06:10,So...
00:06:10,00:06:11,I know.
00:06:11,00:06:13,"As I really said, it's probably not going to happen anymore."
00:06:13,00:06:16,"I mean, obviously, it hasn't happened for 200 years, but the reason it happened in the"
00:06:16,00:06:22,"first place was that it happened near the Old London Bridge, right, and that had loads"
00:06:22,00:06:23,and loads and loads of arches.
00:06:23,00:06:26,So it was really annoying for River Traffic because the arches meant you couldn't get
00:06:26,00:06:30,"big ships through there, and as a result, that slowed the flow of the water down and it"
00:06:30,00:06:33,meant that it was froze over much more easily.
00:06:33,00:06:35,It actually sped the flow of the water up.
00:06:35,00:06:39,What slowed the flow of the water down was that the Thames was much wider and shallower
00:06:39,00:06:40,then because it hadn't been embanked.
00:06:40,00:06:41,There was no embankment.
00:06:41,00:06:45,"So what the Old London Bridge did was the arches were much narrower, which meant that it"
00:06:45,00:06:49,was much easier for a block of ice that was flossing in to get stuck and sort of form
00:06:49,00:06:52,the beginning of a dam which ice could then form across it.
00:06:52,00:06:55,I reckon that we have the technology now to freeze the Thames if we wanted to.
00:06:55,00:06:58,"I was going to say, we're really cool if we did it again by just injecting..."
00:06:58,00:06:59,Probably.
00:06:59,00:07:02,"Yeah, I probably cost quite a bit, but Citi can, come on."
00:07:02,00:07:06,I don't know if that one penny entrance and exit fee is going to pay for the technology
00:07:06,00:07:08,of freezing the entire Thames.
00:07:08,00:07:12,They used to play spots while it froze over on the Thames.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"They played football, for instance."
00:07:14,00:07:19,"They also played donkey racing, nine pin bowling, throwing at Cox."
00:07:19,00:07:20,"All right, sorry."
00:07:20,00:07:23,Just go back because I read about the nine pin bowling and I want to know when they added
00:07:23,00:07:24,the extra penny.
00:07:24,00:07:29,But I like the way that I went nine pin bowling and throwing at Cox and it was nine
00:07:29,00:07:31,pin bowling but you had a problem in.
00:07:31,00:07:36,My understanding of nine pin bowling and ten pin bowling and this is going off really
00:07:36,00:07:42,old knowledge is that they ban nine pin bowling for gambling and then they kind of put in
00:07:42,00:07:45,an extra pin to try and get around the law.
00:07:45,00:07:46,I see.
00:07:46,00:07:47,Very clever.
00:07:47,00:07:48,Yeah.
00:07:48,00:07:51,"Throwing at Cox actually sounds like it's the same as nine pin bowling really, doesn't it?"
00:07:51,00:07:53,"It does, but with Cox instead of pins."
00:07:53,00:07:54,"Yeah, it's like an upgrade."
00:07:54,00:07:55,Like the two.
00:07:55,00:07:59,"That's pretty much what it is apart from, so you get a chicken and you throw stuff at"
00:07:59,00:08:00,it.
00:08:00,00:08:01,That's kind of how it happened.
00:08:01,00:08:02,Nice.
00:08:02,00:08:04,It was also shooting at Pricks.
00:08:04,00:08:05,What's that?
00:08:05,00:08:08,"Yeah, it's not the same as throwing at Cox."
00:08:08,00:08:12,"It's kind of shooting at Pricks is an old name for a kind of archery, apparently."
00:08:12,00:08:13,Wow.
00:08:13,00:08:14,What was the Prick?
00:08:14,00:08:16,I would imagine it must be the sharp bit at the end of your arrow.
00:08:16,00:08:19,"I would have thought that as well, but you don't shoot at that, do you?"
00:08:19,00:08:20,You're right.
00:08:20,00:08:24,Are they throwing the board towards the arrow?
00:08:24,00:08:25,No.
00:08:25,00:08:30,"It's an old word for a small indentation or something, so it's like a needle prick."
00:08:30,00:08:33,"So that's what you were aiming for, the little indentation was good."
00:08:33,00:08:38,"In 1540, the word Prick was a term of endearment for a man."
00:08:38,00:08:43,"So instead of darling or sweetheart, you would say my Prick."
00:08:43,00:08:46,Is that because of the penis thing?
00:08:46,00:08:49,"Because the Prick, I'm sure, has meant penis for quite a long time."
00:08:49,00:08:50,"Yeah, I think it has."
00:08:50,00:08:52,"I think it's Shakespeareanish, isn't it?"
00:08:52,00:08:53,Yeah.
00:08:53,00:08:54,So you say what's a cock?
00:08:54,00:08:55,I do say cock.
00:08:55,00:08:56,You say that all the time.
00:08:56,00:08:57,And all the time.
00:08:57,00:08:59,The cock is saying it to me.
00:08:59,00:09:05,"Well, in the 1960s, a spare Prick at a wedding was a bit of British slang for someone who is"
00:09:05,00:09:08,embarrassingly out of place in a particular situation.
00:09:08,00:09:09,OK.
00:09:09,00:09:11,I think that's worth putting it back.
00:09:11,00:09:13,But not somebody with their cock out.
00:09:13,00:09:16,"That would be, I mean, that would work as well, isn't it?"
00:09:16,00:09:20,"You wouldn't be out of place like that, and that's standard for a wedding, isn't it?"
00:09:20,00:09:23,"We have just been to Dan's wedding, and I don't remember much of that going out"
00:09:23,00:09:24,on.
00:09:24,00:09:25,"Well, you were in the wrong room."
00:09:25,00:09:26,Was that your room?
00:09:26,00:09:27,Yeah.
00:09:27,00:09:28,So Russia was quite used to these kind of things.
00:09:28,00:09:29,It wasn't as exciting there.
00:09:29,00:09:33,They were accustomed to their rivers freezing over and having big fairs and stuff on them.
00:09:33,00:09:34,Still are.
00:09:34,00:09:35,Still are.
00:09:35,00:09:36,I've skied on the Moscow River.
00:09:36,00:09:37,Have you?
00:09:37,00:09:38,"Well, I went to St. Petersburg."
00:09:38,00:09:39,"I saw a wedding actually happening on the frozen episode, too."
00:09:39,00:09:40,It was amazing.
00:09:40,00:09:42,It's been quite hard to stand up.
00:09:42,00:09:43,Go down the aisle.
00:09:43,00:09:44,Everyone's sliding around.
00:09:44,00:09:45,Or to see the bride.
00:09:45,00:09:46,Yeah.
00:09:46,00:09:47,"Well, that's..."
00:09:47,00:09:49,She's floated off the bit more.
00:09:49,00:09:52,And I've accidentally married a snowman.
00:09:52,00:10:04,"OK, moving on to fact number two, and that is from Alex Bell."
00:10:04,00:10:09,My fact this week is that former Argentinian president Carlos Menem had such a reputation for
00:10:09,00:10:13,bad luck that people would touch their left breast or testicle while shaking his hand.
00:10:13,00:10:16,I find the wild shaking his hand a bit pretty insulting.
00:10:16,00:10:18,I think they used the other hand.
00:10:18,00:10:22,"I understand, but it's fairly obvious what you're doing if your hand slides into your"
00:10:22,00:10:26,pocket as your shaking hands with the former president of your country.
00:10:26,00:10:27,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:10:27,00:10:28,This guy is extraordinary.
00:10:28,00:10:29,Yeah.
00:10:29,00:10:32,"We should call him the unnamable, because it's bad luck to say his name."
00:10:32,00:10:34,So he's like Voldemort in many ways.
00:10:34,00:10:35,Yeah.
00:10:35,00:10:39,"People instead say things like Mendes or Menen, where with Voldemort, you don't just say"
00:10:39,00:10:40,Voldemort.
00:10:40,00:10:41,"Yeah, that's true."
00:10:41,00:10:42,Yeah.
00:10:42,00:10:47,"So he's supposedly not allowed to attend football matches, Argentina team football matches,"
00:10:47,00:10:50,"because in 1990 in the World Cup, he visited when they were playing."
00:10:50,00:10:54,"And he approached the goalkeeper, Pumpido, to shake hands."
00:10:54,00:10:55,And this was ages ago.
00:10:55,00:10:59,"So clearly the myth was established, even then, that he was cursed."
00:10:59,00:11:02,The goalie refused to shake his hand because of the curse.
00:11:02,00:11:05,"He's just sort of put his hands up and said, ""No, you're not going to, no."""
00:11:05,00:11:08,So then Menen laughed and he gave him a pass on the knee.
00:11:08,00:11:12,"And in the match that followed, A, Argentina lost and B, the goalkeeper fractured his knee."
00:11:12,00:11:16,How do you pass on one's knee at such a stretch to get down there?
00:11:16,00:11:18,He was probably aiming for the left testicle.
00:11:18,00:11:23,Do you know that witchcraft is explicitly banned in Malawi?
00:11:23,00:11:24,I think it is.
00:11:24,00:11:25,In football.
00:11:25,00:11:26,Is it?
00:11:26,00:11:27,Yeah.
00:11:27,00:11:29,"As in, it's in their rules that you're not allowed to."
00:11:29,00:11:30,Really?
00:11:30,00:11:34,I don't think it's explicitly illegal in British football.
00:11:34,00:11:39,But I did write to a referee about this to find out what the truth is.
00:11:39,00:11:41,He hasn't replied weirdly enough.
00:11:41,00:11:47,"But I reckon that it would be unjentimally conduct, a yellow card and an indirect free kick."
00:11:47,00:11:54,"I don't think that matters, though, if you've just turned stoken to pigs."
00:11:54,00:11:55,Yeah.
00:11:55,00:11:57,"Football is full of these superstitions, though."
00:11:57,00:12:01,"It's all, you do something once, you win a match and then you have to do it every time."
00:12:01,00:12:02,Yeah.
00:12:02,00:12:03,It's like scoring goals.
00:12:03,00:12:04,"Well, there's it."
00:12:04,00:12:05,So there was a...
00:12:05,00:12:08,"Another Argentina guy, Carlos Bilado."
00:12:08,00:12:11,"In the quarterfinals, the goalie had to pee on the pitch because they were about to have"
00:12:11,00:12:14,a penalty shootout and there wasn't time for him to get back to the dressing room and
00:12:14,00:12:15,have a pee there.
00:12:15,00:12:19,So his teammates all surrounded him and they had a pee on the pitch.
00:12:19,00:12:22,And then he blocked two shots and Argentina ended up going through.
00:12:22,00:12:26,"So the next match, every time there was a free kick and they made a wall, he peed against"
00:12:26,00:12:27,them.
00:12:27,00:12:34,"Next match, Bilado, made him pee on the pitch again because he thought it would be lucky."
00:12:34,00:12:35,Right.
00:12:35,00:12:36,Did it work?
00:12:36,00:12:37,It did not work.
00:12:37,00:12:38,They did not win the next match.
00:12:38,00:12:39,"It's going to be under pressure, aren't you?"
00:12:39,00:12:44,"Like with, you know, 60,000 people watching it."
00:12:44,00:12:49,"So, yeah, back to menum and the reasons that people think he's bad luck."
00:12:49,00:12:54,I like the fact that he shook the hand of the World Powerboat Racing Champion who was called
00:12:54,00:12:59,Daniel Skioli in 1989 and immediately Skioli's boat crashed and he lost his arm.
00:12:59,00:13:03,But then Skioli became an MP for Mr. Menum's party.
00:13:03,00:13:07,"Michael Schumacher, I think, he shook his hand and then Michael Schumacher was immediately"
00:13:07,00:13:08,shunted.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"Yeah, but then he narrowly won the next race."
00:13:10,00:13:13,"And if that's the curse of men, is that you win by slightly less than you're normally"
00:13:13,00:13:14,accustomed to.
00:13:14,00:13:15,There's not much for curse.
00:13:15,00:13:16,Yeah.
00:13:16,00:13:19,"He's also known as the father of the Debra State in 2001, Eacon and Wicca Laps, which is"
00:13:19,00:13:20,a pretty...
00:13:20,00:13:21,That is bad.
00:13:21,00:13:22,Heavy title to be taking.
00:13:22,00:13:25,"If you want to be the father of anything, it's not that."
00:13:25,00:13:26,Yeah.
00:13:26,00:13:28,Menum did become famous for his womanizing as well.
00:13:28,00:13:33,"So, he married a former Miss Universe when he was about 73 and a re-lock for her."
00:13:33,00:13:34,A re-lock for her.
00:13:34,00:13:35,A re-lock for her.
00:13:35,00:13:36,I like this is confusing.
00:13:36,00:13:40,"So, there was an article listing all of his bad lucks and it ended on this."
00:13:40,00:13:42,"So, it went through all these people that he's cursed."
00:13:42,00:13:47,"It ended by saying, ""The night before the 2000 US presidential elections, the unnamable,"
00:13:47,00:13:52,"as in Menum, is said to have called his good friend George W. Bush to wish him good luck."
00:13:52,00:13:53,"Need I say more?"""
00:13:53,00:13:56,"I mean, George was won that election."
00:13:56,00:14:00,"And actually, he's won that election despite losing that election."
00:14:00,00:14:02,"So, it's incredibly good luck."
00:14:02,00:14:05,My favourite thing about him is that his surname is a palindrome.
00:14:05,00:14:08,That's pretty much all I like about him.
00:14:08,00:14:15,"Which means he has something in common with ex-cambodian president Lon Null, who, as far as"
00:14:15,00:14:18,"I can tell, is the only head of state ever to be a complete palindrome."
00:14:18,00:14:19,Really?
00:14:19,00:14:20,That's really good.
00:14:20,00:14:21,Do you think they meet?
00:14:21,00:14:22,"Well, they have a little club."
00:14:22,00:14:23,Yeah.
00:14:23,00:14:24,"One in the middle, somewhere in Panama."
00:14:24,00:14:25,In Panama.
00:14:25,00:14:26,Yes.
00:14:26,00:14:31,"In a canal in Panama, in a man in a canal in Panama."
00:14:31,00:14:34,"In his election campaign, one of the ways he won is that he swore he'd throw the Brits"
00:14:34,00:14:35,out of the Falklands.
00:14:35,00:14:38,And then as soon as he did when he started really trying to ingratiate himself with
00:14:38,00:14:43,"Britain, to the extent that he angled desperately, according to the Guardian, for an invitation to"
00:14:43,00:14:44,Buckingham Palace.
00:14:44,00:14:48,"So many times did he announce that he had been invited to London, that the foreign office"
00:14:48,00:14:50,eventually had to let him come.
00:14:50,00:14:52,"Which, I didn't know you could do that."
00:14:52,00:14:55,"If you just announced repeatedly that the Queen's invited you to Buckingham Palace, she's"
00:14:55,00:14:57,eventually forced her to let you through the door.
00:14:57,00:14:58,"No, you weren't for any party."
00:14:58,00:14:59,I'm coming tonight.
00:14:59,00:15:00,I'm really looking forward to coming tonight.
00:15:00,00:15:01,It's going to be great.
00:15:01,00:15:02,I'm going to come into this party.
00:15:02,00:15:03,I think that would work.
00:15:03,00:15:04,Yeah.
00:15:04,00:15:05,Do you think it would?
00:15:05,00:15:08,"Well, you're playing by a rule that other people don't recognise, or rather, you're"
00:15:08,00:15:10,not playing by a rule that other people do recognise.
00:15:10,00:15:11,Yes.
00:15:11,00:15:15,"So if you just say, I am invited to this party, people will be embarrassed, even though it's"
00:15:15,00:15:16,nothing to do with them.
00:15:16,00:15:20,"It's all you embarrassing yourself, that the embarrassment will reflect on them."
00:15:20,00:15:21,I'll be forced to.
00:15:21,00:15:22,I'll be fine.
00:15:22,00:15:23,"Yeah, fine, whatever."
00:15:23,00:15:26,It doesn't affect my life so much if they come to my party.
00:15:26,00:15:27,Yeah.
00:15:27,00:15:29,And I don't want to look like a rude idiot.
00:15:29,00:15:30,Yeah.
00:15:30,00:15:34,"Weirdly, I did get a letter from the Queen yesterday asking if I wanted to attend her"
00:15:34,00:15:37,"private reception next week, isn't it?"
00:15:37,00:15:40,I found a really questionable list on Quora.
00:15:40,00:15:43,"I think it was of some other superstitions in a discussion, by some other way."
00:15:43,00:15:47,I like the way you said the word Quora in a real undertone in the hope that people might
00:15:47,00:15:48,miss that.
00:15:48,00:15:49,That is awesome.
00:15:49,00:15:50,Yeah.
00:15:50,00:15:54,My favourite ones were apparently it's bad luck to leave your purse lying open on the floor
00:15:54,00:15:59,"because that means that you'll lose money, obviously, somehow related."
00:15:59,00:16:03,"Also, if you eat watermelon with a glass of red wine, you will die."
00:16:03,00:16:06,And apparently loads of Argentinians just like that's just a proper wise tell that people
00:16:06,00:16:07,don't do that.
00:16:07,00:16:08,You will die.
00:16:08,00:16:13,"I've heard things like that not just in Argentina because it used to be, I think, that you"
00:16:13,00:16:18,would have foods that were very hot foods and foods that were very cold foods.
00:16:18,00:16:21,"And even if they weren't necessarily hot or cold, they were felt that that's the effect"
00:16:21,00:16:23,they would have on your body.
00:16:23,00:16:28,"And the watermelon would be particularly cold and icy, whereas the wine would warm you"
00:16:28,00:16:29,up.
00:16:29,00:16:35,"And it would think that the two opposites would kind of clash, and it's Friday the 13th"
00:16:35,00:16:39,"day, which is one reason we might be talking about superstitions."
00:16:39,00:16:44,"And there's a vet in Australia that has a promotion for Friday the 13th, where it's discounting"
00:16:44,00:16:47,its neutering for black cats.
00:16:47,00:16:48,Oh.
00:16:48,00:16:49,So we've got a black cat.
00:16:49,00:16:54,I could fly to Australia and save loads of money getting it new to it.
00:16:54,00:16:56,It's the aim so that there are fewer black cats because some people think they're bad luck.
00:16:56,00:16:58,I think they're good luck.
00:16:58,00:17:00,It depends which way they cross the road.
00:17:00,00:17:02,"If they cross from left to right it's one, if they cross from right to left the other."
00:17:02,00:17:04,But is it different in the UK and the rest of Europe?
00:17:04,00:17:06,That's a really good point.
00:17:06,00:17:09,And also which way you're going on the road as well?
00:17:09,00:17:10,No.
00:17:10,00:17:11,You're coming towards the cat.
00:17:11,00:17:14,"So if it crosses from your left to your right, it's one."
00:17:14,00:17:15,It's relative to you.
00:17:15,00:17:18,Whereas someone walking the other way will experience opposite luck based on the movement
00:17:18,00:17:19,of the cat.
00:17:19,00:17:20,Right.
00:17:20,00:17:21,You know left and right is always relative.
00:17:21,00:17:22,Yeah.
00:17:22,00:17:23,That's the thing about it.
00:17:23,00:17:28,That is the interesting thing that it's impossible or there's not very many ways to explain
00:17:28,00:17:33,"to an alien, say, which is left and which is right if you don't have a similar field"
00:17:33,00:17:34,of reference.
00:17:34,00:17:35,Yeah.
00:17:35,00:17:36,I'd have more important things to talk about.
00:17:36,00:17:37,All right.
00:17:37,00:17:38,Yeah.
00:17:38,00:17:39,I bet you'd freeze up.
00:17:39,00:17:40,If it actually came to it.
00:17:40,00:17:41,Yeah.
00:17:41,00:17:42,I'd be very nervous.
00:17:42,00:17:43,I don't know a good bit of new people.
00:17:43,00:17:46,You've got your whole new species there.
00:17:46,00:17:48,So I'm really looking forward to coming to your planet.
00:17:48,00:17:49,Yeah.
00:17:49,00:17:50,You've said that live time.
00:17:50,00:17:51,Okay.
00:17:51,00:18:00,We should move on to fact number three and that is my fact.
00:18:00,00:18:05,My fact this week is that Isambar Kingdom Bruno once spent six weeks with a coin stuck in
00:18:05,00:18:09,his windpipe as a result of a magic trick that backfired.
00:18:09,00:18:10,He did indeed.
00:18:10,00:18:11,He did indeed.
00:18:11,00:18:12,Yeah.
00:18:12,00:18:13,So I've found this.
00:18:13,00:18:16,"I was, for some reason, I was looking him up in the British newspaper archive."
00:18:16,00:18:17,It's a bit bored.
00:18:17,00:18:23,And I found a no-bittery for him from 1862 and it said the closest he came to death was
00:18:23,00:18:26,when he was trying to impress his children in 1843.
00:18:26,00:18:27,Thank you.
00:18:27,00:18:33,The closest he came to death was one second before he died.
00:18:33,00:18:39,"The second closest he came to death, I'm sure they issued a correction the next day."
00:18:39,00:18:43,He was trying to impress his children by doing a magic trick where he swallowed a half
00:18:43,00:18:47,sovereign coin and then brought it out of his ear but instead the sovereign landed in
00:18:47,00:18:48,his windpipe.
00:18:48,00:18:49,So what happened?
00:18:49,00:18:54,"So what happened was he had chest pains for a while and quite bad coughing and he, because"
00:18:54,00:18:58,"he's an engineer, as we know, possibly the most important thing he ever designed was a"
00:18:58,00:19:01,contraption in order to extract it.
00:19:01,00:19:05,And I couldn't find any diagrams of it but apparently it was a movable platform with hinges
00:19:05,00:19:10,on it which I think he strapped his body to and it bent his body over an 80 degree angle
00:19:10,00:19:14,and then he was repeatedly struck on the back and the idea was that this would dislodge
00:19:14,00:19:15,the coin.
00:19:15,00:19:19,So he tried this out and it almost killed him one time so they didn't do that again.
00:19:19,00:19:23,And then he took six weeks having various doctors fiddle about with him.
00:19:23,00:19:27,All of them tried to get four steps in there and pull it out but he nearly died again.
00:19:27,00:19:31,And then eventually he went back to the contraption but this time with an incision caught in his
00:19:31,00:19:37,throat and he bent himself over on this contraption he designed and there was a incision on his
00:19:37,00:19:41,"throat which was, you know, when you have like a tracheotomy it was allowing him to breathe"
00:19:41,00:19:46,and so he then managed to choke the coin up and as it was rising up through his windpipe
00:19:46,00:19:49,he was still able to breathe because the incision was there and his throat.
00:19:49,00:19:53,And he coughed it up and he actually did say that the moment when he heard the gold
00:19:53,00:19:57,piece strike against his upper front teeth was perhaps the most exquisite moment of his
00:19:57,00:19:58,whole life.
00:19:58,00:19:59,Wow.
00:19:59,00:20:02,It was a really famous thing throughout the country.
00:20:02,00:20:05,"The isn't working through Brunelle Cointhick, everyone knew about it because he was very famous"
00:20:05,00:20:06,at the time.
00:20:06,00:20:07,Yeah.
00:20:07,00:20:12,"So for example, there's a famous Victorian historian called Thomas Babbington McCauley."
00:20:12,00:20:16,"When he read the good news, supposedly he ran along the street yelling, ""It's out, it's"
00:20:16,00:20:17,"out!"""
00:20:17,00:20:21,And everybody knew what he was talking about because he was talking about the coin.
00:20:21,00:20:24,It's an incredible story.
00:20:24,00:20:26,It is so ingenious the way he got himself out of it.
00:20:26,00:20:29,"Yeah, and crazy that he got himself out of it and that, you know, all these dogs has tried"
00:20:29,00:20:31,and then he just built a machine.
00:20:31,00:20:32,Yeah.
00:20:32,00:20:34,Is he clever for getting himself out or is he stupid for getting himself into it?
00:20:34,00:20:35,I'd say a bit of both.
00:20:35,00:20:37,Technically he got itself out of him.
00:20:37,00:20:38,That's true.
00:20:38,00:20:39,Yeah.
00:20:39,00:20:44,"But yeah, I was actually looking him up because I visited recently the Brunelle Museum in"
00:20:44,00:20:48,"Brother Heith, which if you are passing, it's really cool."
00:20:48,00:20:51,It's absolutely tiny and it's the Mark Brunelle Museum.
00:20:51,00:20:56,"So it's about the Thames Tunnel, which is the first ever tunnel that was built under a river."
00:20:56,00:21:00,"And it was designed by Mark Brunelle and Isne Barbrunelle, his son helped him out."
00:21:00,00:21:01,And it's a really cool place.
00:21:01,00:21:02,Go there.
00:21:02,00:21:03,It's an amazing story.
00:21:03,00:21:05,It was like an unbelievable feat of engineering.
00:21:05,00:21:07,And that's why he came third closest to dying as well.
00:21:07,00:21:12,I got an extra act of the description of the conditions that the workers put up with
00:21:12,00:21:13,that.
00:21:13,00:21:18,They were showered in raw sewage and dodged flames from ignited methane gas whenever they
00:21:18,00:21:19,worked.
00:21:19,00:21:20,It was the worst job in the world.
00:21:20,00:21:23,They only worked for our shifts because they collapsed after four hours and then would
00:21:23,00:21:26,be replaced by men who were still breathing and then they would work for four hours and
00:21:26,00:21:27,they'll be replaced by another shift.
00:21:27,00:21:28,And they were constant.
00:21:28,00:21:32,"There were five floods, I think, one of which Brunelle was down there and nearly died."
00:21:32,00:21:34,And it's just insane that they carried on.
00:21:34,00:21:37,Why did they have showers of raw sewage?
00:21:37,00:21:42,"I think because there's constant leaking on the Thames, the service was coming in a lot."
00:21:42,00:21:43,"Disgusting, man."
00:21:43,00:21:47,"But you know when it froze up, would it just be like frozen turds everywhere?"
00:21:47,00:21:49,"That's what it did, right?"
00:21:49,00:21:50,Bumpy skate ring.
00:21:50,00:21:51,Yeah.
00:21:51,00:21:52,I guess you have snow on top as well.
00:21:52,00:21:53,Yeah.
00:21:53,00:21:54,Yeah.
00:21:54,00:21:57,So he brought a lot of this on himself in the tunnel.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"So he nearly drowned three times, right?"
00:21:59,00:22:01,He fell into a water tank once.
00:22:01,00:22:03,But the fact it happened anyway.
00:22:03,00:22:04,Exactly.
00:22:04,00:22:05,So that's not so bad.
00:22:05,00:22:09,But then there was a time where he was with a party of influential visitors in a rowing
00:22:09,00:22:12,boat and he was trying to freak them out by rocking it from side to side.
00:22:12,00:22:13,And nearly drowned.
00:22:13,00:22:19,"And it was the third time, the most deadly time, which we've just talked about, was because"
00:22:19,00:22:22,he was told you shouldn't dig through there.
00:22:22,00:22:23,That's soft mud.
00:22:23,00:22:24,That'll bring the river in.
00:22:24,00:22:25,"And he said, now it's fine."
00:22:25,00:22:26,Don't worry about it.
00:22:26,00:22:28,And he dug through that bit.
00:22:28,00:22:29,River came in.
00:22:29,00:22:30,Sealing collapsed.
00:22:30,00:22:32,And he was pulled to safety.
00:22:32,00:22:34,But six members of the evacuation crew died.
00:22:34,00:22:38,"Just quickly on the tunnel, something else you should look up is the painting that's been"
00:22:38,00:22:40,done of the banquet that they had inside it.
00:22:40,00:22:43,So one time when it flooded to celebrate the fact that everyone hadn't died and it was still
00:22:43,00:22:47,"going, they held this enormous banquet and they invited all of high society there."
00:22:47,00:22:48,That's asking for trouble.
00:22:48,00:22:50,"I was like, everyone almost died."
00:22:50,00:22:51,What should we do?
00:22:51,00:22:54,Let's get all of society back in the tunnel.
00:22:54,00:22:57,"Apart from everything else, you're basically asking for the riddler to attack."
00:22:57,00:23:00,"Well, it looks very exciting."
00:23:00,00:23:01,Nobody died.
00:23:01,00:23:02,So Christ is aversed.
00:23:02,00:23:04,"No, and it looks amazing."
00:23:04,00:23:05,And they used to have stalls.
00:23:05,00:23:07,So what did happen in the tunnel was they had lots of little market stalls running all
00:23:07,00:23:08,the way through it.
00:23:08,00:23:09,And it was a tourist attraction.
00:23:09,00:23:13,It was much like the icefers and people would have to pay a few pennies to go into the tunnel.
00:23:13,00:23:14,And they'd walk through it.
00:23:14,00:23:17,I'm going to see the death tunnel of death.
00:23:17,00:23:23,"He also built an atmospheric railway, i.e. a vacuum railway, pumped along by pressure."
00:23:23,00:23:27,"And can we refer to it as the atmospheric caper, which is what they called it?"
00:23:27,00:23:28,It's the best name in the world.
00:23:28,00:23:29,That's so cool.
00:23:29,00:23:31,"It didn't really work, unfortunately."
00:23:31,00:23:35,"So basically, it would be huge pipelines pumping out air to create a vacuum to push the"
00:23:35,00:23:41,train along with atmospheric pressure. But it's such a cool steam-punky reason it failed.
00:23:41,00:23:46,"The technology needed the air pipes to be sealed with leather flaps, right?"
00:23:46,00:23:47,They needed to be kept supple and moist.
00:23:47,00:23:51,"So they needed tallow kind of fat to be sort of smeared on them, right?"
00:23:51,00:23:54,"Unfortunately, rats like eating tallow."
00:23:54,00:24:00,So they ate a load of the flaps and stopped the system from working.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"So yeah, the system, the design was perfect."
00:24:02,00:24:04,It was just the time when it was made.
00:24:04,00:24:05,And it did work for seven months.
00:24:05,00:24:08,"It worked, successfully carrying people from Exeter to Plymouth, I think."
00:24:08,00:24:12,"And there is a pub now in a place called Starcross called The Atmospheric Railway,"
00:24:12,00:24:16,"which sounds all modern, but it was from the mid-19th century."
00:24:16,00:24:17,Really?
00:24:17,00:24:18,Yeah.
00:24:18,00:24:20,You'd be expecting a really atmospheric pub.
00:24:20,00:24:22,"I was going to say three days inside, really ironically."
00:24:22,00:24:25,"We should say the good thing about the atmospheric railway, the reason he made it, is"
00:24:25,00:24:29,"because you don't need to carry your fuel with you, because there would be fuel planted along"
00:24:29,00:24:33,"the way, so that the way that the vacuum was created was through piston action and every"
00:24:33,00:24:38,"three miles, the pistons were fueled by steam, by little steam sheds."
00:24:38,00:24:41,And so you didn't need to have all this heavy fuel that you carried with you on your train.
00:24:41,00:24:45,"So it would be efficient, but then we found electricity and we didn't need any more."
00:24:45,00:24:52,"So Mark Brunel, great engineer, isn't barking the Brunel, great engineer."
00:24:52,00:24:53,So it's gone through the family.
00:24:53,00:25:00,"And there is another direct descendant of Brunel called Moorwenna Wilson, who made a craft"
00:25:00,00:25:06,made entirely out of folded paper and managed to sail it on some water.
00:25:06,00:25:07,Great engineer.
00:25:07,00:25:08,"Great engineer, right?"
00:25:08,00:25:09,It's amazing.
00:25:09,00:25:18,"It's completely made out of paper, apart from the keel, which is made out of wood and polystyrene."
00:25:18,00:25:20,"And the keel, I mean, what even is a keel?"
00:25:20,00:25:23,"It can't be that important, right?"
00:25:23,00:25:24,That's pretty cool though.
00:25:24,00:25:25,"Yeah, no, it's good."
00:25:25,00:25:26,That's awesome.
00:25:26,00:25:30,"So much people, two pennies, to get in it and sail it across the river."
00:25:30,00:25:33,And then does she rock it from the side of the river?
00:25:33,00:25:38,"That's really tarnished, my view of it's working to Brunel, I think it was an absolute child."
00:25:38,00:25:39,"Well, he was a bit of a slave driver."
00:25:39,00:25:44,"Like, a lot of people died on the huge tunnel he built on the Great Western Railway."
00:25:44,00:25:45,"Box tunnel, yeah."
00:25:45,00:25:46,"Box tunnel, that's right."
00:25:46,00:25:49,"Yeah, it's supposedly about a hundred people died in the day of that."
00:25:49,00:25:53,And he supposedly did it so that the sun shines down it on his birthday.
00:25:53,00:25:54,I read that that's a myth though.
00:25:54,00:25:55,"Well, did you?"
00:25:55,00:26:00,Worked it out and we think it's pretty much not far away from being true.
00:26:00,00:26:01,"Oh, really?"
00:26:01,00:26:03,Whether he did it on purpose or not.
00:26:03,00:26:08,We actually asked the railway company if we could go and check it out.
00:26:08,00:26:11,"And they said, no, there's high speed trades going through."
00:26:11,00:26:13,"Cool, one thing we asked you not to do is dress us on our railways."
00:26:13,00:26:14,Yeah.
00:26:14,00:26:15,So they wouldn't let us.
00:26:15,00:26:20,But we reckon that at least it should pretty much work.
00:26:20,00:26:25,"Do you know one thing he did do in the box tunnel, speaking of high speed trains, is he used"
00:26:25,00:26:27,to quite like driving the steam train sometimes.
00:26:27,00:26:31,And he was driving through the box tunnel once next to the driver and he was the one who
00:26:31,00:26:32,was driving the train.
00:26:32,00:26:37,And he suddenly saw a big obstacle in front of him to like to break and avoid it.
00:26:37,00:26:42,"And so James Bond put his foot down, like went full steam ahead and just blasted straight"
00:26:42,00:26:43,through it.
00:26:43,00:26:46,That's what happened to our researcher.
00:26:46,00:26:49,And it turned out that it was a carriage from another train that had accidentally fallen
00:26:49,00:26:52,off the train and left on the track and he just blasted it into smithereens.
00:26:52,00:26:53,Wow.
00:26:53,00:26:54,Planned right through it.
00:26:54,00:26:58,"And action man, all of his work actually came from the time when he nearly drowned in"
00:26:58,00:27:02,the temps because he went to Converless for ages and Ages in Clifton near Bristol.
00:27:02,00:27:05,And that's where he got hired for a load of jobs because he was thinking and writing and
00:27:05,00:27:07,designing all the time he was converlessing.
00:27:07,00:27:10,"And at Clifton, so they had the two towers of the bridge."
00:27:10,00:27:15,"They didn't have the main body of the bridge, but they did have an inch and a half thick metal"
00:27:15,00:27:20,wire rope going across the gorge by the time while he was still alive.
00:27:20,00:27:26,And he went across in a wicker basket on a pulley and it jammed while they were halfway
00:27:26,00:27:27,across.
00:27:27,00:27:32,"And if you started rocking it, if you've seen the Clifton gorge, you know that is terrifying"
00:27:32,00:27:35,because it is so high at instant death if you fell.
00:27:35,00:27:41,"And he looked up, took off his hat, climbed up to the pulley, unjammed it and they continued"
00:27:41,00:27:42,along the way.
00:27:42,00:27:46,"Oh, that's the fourth closest he came to the bridge."
00:27:46,00:27:51,"Only the foundations of the Clifton suspension bridge were invented not by him, but by a lady"
00:27:51,00:27:56,"called Sarah Guppey, who gave the plans to Brunel for free because she believed that women"
00:27:56,00:27:58,must not be boastful.
00:27:58,00:27:59,Wow.
00:27:59,00:28:02,"Yeah, there's someone's written a book basically saying that Brunel was not nearly as good"
00:28:02,00:28:05,as we all think and he didn't design the Clifton suspension bridge.
00:28:05,00:28:09,Hardly any of it was related to his original design even by the time that's fully made.
00:28:09,00:28:10,I think it was pretty good.
00:28:10,00:28:11,"Well, read the book, Andy."
00:28:11,00:28:21,"I certainly haven't, but I read an article about it."
00:28:21,00:28:25,"Okay, we should move on to fact number four and that is Andy's fact."
00:28:25,00:28:30,"Yes, my fact is that to deal with violent or drunk people, Japanese police carry massive"
00:28:30,00:28:34,futons and roll the offender up in them to calm them down.
00:28:34,00:28:35,This is fantastic.
00:28:35,00:28:39,"They genuinely, they turn criminals into burritos."
00:28:39,00:28:40,"And would that calm you down, do you think?"
00:28:40,00:28:41,I think it would.
00:28:41,00:28:45,"If you're rendered completely immobile and you're just sort of in your comfy foot on, I would,"
00:28:45,00:28:46,"yeah, I'd calm down."
00:28:46,00:28:48,"Yeah, like when you put a bag over a horse's head and it stops."
00:28:48,00:28:49,Yeah.
00:28:49,00:28:52,"Stop doing that, Alex."
00:28:52,00:28:56,So this is from a podcast which is called My Perfect Country.
00:28:56,00:29:01,Each episode is about a country that is doing something right in a particular aspect of
00:29:01,00:29:05,law or society or whatever it is and you're doing it perfectly.
00:29:05,00:29:11,"So for example, this is about very low crime and particularly gun crime in Japan."
00:29:11,00:29:14,It's almost impossible to get a gun in Japan.
00:29:14,00:29:15,You have to do exams.
00:29:15,00:29:18,You have to score more than 95% on a rifle range test.
00:29:18,00:29:22,"What, so if you do get a gun at least we know you'll be incredibly accurate."
00:29:22,00:29:25,"Yeah, there's no attempt to murder charges ever."
00:29:25,00:29:26,Yeah.
00:29:26,00:29:27,So that's what they should do.
00:29:27,00:29:32,"If you get less than 5% in the rifle range, they should give you help yourself."
00:29:32,00:29:38,"Yeah, and as a result there were six occasions last year when the Japanese police fired their"
00:29:38,00:29:41,guns in total and in 2014 there were six gun deaths.
00:29:41,00:29:44,"I mean, they just, they just don't really have them."
00:29:44,00:29:45,That's good.
00:29:45,00:29:48,We do have very similar stance with police people firing guns.
00:29:48,00:29:55,"Yeah, so anyway, this is about Japanese policing methods and how they roll people up."
00:29:55,00:29:56,Yeah.
00:29:56,00:29:57,It's from the sushi tradition basically.
00:29:57,00:29:58,Is it?
00:29:58,00:30:01,"I think someone looks at some sushi and thought, wait a second, why don't we carry massive"
00:30:01,00:30:03,bits of seaweed around with us?
00:30:03,00:30:07,What if that bit of cucumber was a violent offender?
00:30:07,00:30:12,"Yeah, I think it would be quite awkward as a police officer if for this very occasional"
00:30:12,00:30:16,"time when you get a violent offender because like you say there's not many guns, but you"
00:30:16,00:30:19,always have to carry a massive food ton of that with you.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"They are slightly smaller in Japan, aren't they?"
00:30:21,00:30:23,So foodtons are a big thing in Japan.
00:30:23,00:30:26,"A lot of people sleep on foodtons and they're not like, I imagine, which is kind of a"
00:30:26,00:30:28,proper sofa that turns into a bed kind of thing.
00:30:28,00:30:29,I'll know.
00:30:29,00:30:33,"Yeah, they're not - sorry, they're more like juvets than mattresses, aren't they?"
00:30:33,00:30:34,Basically.
00:30:34,00:30:35,Kind of.
00:30:35,00:30:36,It's a pretty supportive.
00:30:36,00:30:39,"It's a thin mattress that you sleep on, but do you know what else gets a food ton in"
00:30:39,00:30:40,Japan if you want it?
00:30:40,00:30:41,Is your wallet?
00:30:41,00:30:42,Yeah.
00:30:42,00:30:43,So there's a food ton company.
00:30:43,00:30:44,Yep.
00:30:44,00:30:50,"It's a food ton company called Naka Tagawa Foodtons, and they've started making sci-foodtons,"
00:30:50,00:30:54,"which means wallet food ton, and it's made of high quality cotton."
00:30:54,00:30:58,"It includes a little cover, like a duvet cover for your wallet, and it includes a pillow"
00:30:58,00:31:02,"for the head of your wallet, whichever end of your wallet is the head."
00:31:02,00:31:08,"It says it's been blessed from priests at Ashrine in Tokyo, and if you want to go more expensive,"
00:31:08,00:31:10,you can order a little bed that comes with it.
00:31:10,00:31:14,I'm going to go out on the limb and say this company is not going to last very long.
00:31:14,00:31:16,Do you see the amount they charge for these foodtons?
00:31:16,00:31:17,Yeah.
00:31:17,00:31:19,"They cost about 115 quid, give or take for a food ton."
00:31:19,00:31:21,For the food ton and bed is 340.
00:31:21,00:31:25,So then you've got nothing to put in your wallet?
00:31:25,00:31:28,"Oh no, it's hilarious."
00:31:28,00:31:29,"They aren't beautiful, they look them up."
00:31:29,00:31:35,"I mean, I'd be tempted, but then I'm a sucker for this stuff like that."
00:31:35,00:31:37,Have you heard of the Boroboroton?
00:31:37,00:31:38,"No, no."
00:31:38,00:31:45,"This is a legend, which is like an evil spirit described as a tattered food ton that comes"
00:31:45,00:31:46,to life at night.
00:31:46,00:31:52,"And it's basically part of a group of these kind of demons, these spirits called Sukumogami."
00:31:52,00:31:56,"They're basically household objects that either they're possessed by spirits or ghosts, or if"
00:31:56,00:32:02,"you use them constantly for 90 to 100 years, they eventually become sentient and they will"
00:32:02,00:32:07,be fine and they'll just kind of behave like normal household objects unless they're feeling
00:32:07,00:32:11,ignored or needless in which case they will come to life and try to strangle their owners
00:32:11,00:32:16,"and they'll float around to the house, or they will throw noisy parties with other members"
00:32:16,00:32:17,of this.
00:32:17,00:32:20,So you'll get all your household objects having a party and then trying to kill you.
00:32:20,00:32:24,But how do you stop a violence offender food ton?
00:32:24,00:32:29,Back it up with a drunk person.
00:32:29,00:32:34,"So the police in North Wales a few years ago, this is in 2010, they hired a troop of actors"
00:32:34,00:32:35,to pretend to be drunk.
00:32:35,00:32:36,Did they?
00:32:36,00:32:39,It was to do a sting on a load of pubs in North Wales.
00:32:39,00:32:42,They had about 50 pubs in order to check and see if they'd serve people who were obviously
00:32:42,00:32:43,inebriated.
00:32:43,00:32:47,So they hired a troop of actors to dress up as drunk and they gave them all the clothes
00:32:47,00:32:52,"and costumes as well, like they gave them shabby jackets, he trousers and shoes and they said"
00:32:52,00:32:53,go in.
00:32:53,00:32:55,Pretend to be absolutely blind drunk and see if you can get served.
00:32:55,00:32:56,Wow.
00:32:56,00:32:59,But then you couldn't prosecute anyone because they're not drunk.
00:32:59,00:33:01,"I don't know, I imagine you could arrest on those grounds."
00:33:01,00:33:02,And you don't think so?
00:33:02,00:33:03,No.
00:33:03,00:33:04,I mean either of us has tried it.
00:33:04,00:33:05,Well I like this place.
00:33:05,00:33:06,There used to be a landlord.
00:33:06,00:33:09,There used to be a landlord for a pub.
00:33:09,00:33:11,"I had a personal landlord's license, yeah."
00:33:11,00:33:13,What is that like having a drinks cabinet?
00:33:13,00:33:14,Is that just in your house.
00:33:14,00:33:15,"No, I'm not."
00:33:15,00:33:16,The personal landlord's because I've got one of those.
00:33:16,00:33:21,"That means I could go to any pub and be officially by law, the landlord of that pub."
00:33:21,00:33:24,So about 15 years ago they changed the law.
00:33:24,00:33:29,"It used to be that the building had the license, but then they changed it so that the landlord"
00:33:29,00:33:30,had the license.
00:33:30,00:33:33,The reason they did it I think is because they had a lot of chain pubs and stuff like that.
00:33:33,00:33:39,And I used to be an accountant for a pub company and I did my personal license.
00:33:39,00:33:43,And so it meant that if there were like landlords on holiday I could go and work in the pub
00:33:43,00:33:44,as the landlord.
00:33:44,00:33:47,"In fact I wouldn't even have to work, I could just be sat there while other people doing"
00:33:47,00:33:50,"all the job, but I'd be kind of the one responsible."
00:33:50,00:33:51,Wow.
00:33:51,00:33:57,"You can say, yeah, you can leave your ship outside, yeah, put the cable down here, that's fine."
00:33:57,00:33:58,That's good to know.
00:33:58,00:33:59,We should use that.
00:33:59,00:34:00,I'm not anymore.
00:34:00,00:34:01,It's slapsed.
00:34:01,00:34:02,"I mean it lapsed 15, 20 years ago."
00:34:02,00:34:03,It lapsed.
00:34:03,00:34:06,You're a pointless friend to us then.
00:34:06,00:34:08,They have for drunk people on the streets of the UK.
00:34:08,00:34:09,They've trialed drunk tax.
00:34:09,00:34:10,What?
00:34:10,00:34:12,They don't have drunk people on the streets of the UK.
00:34:12,00:34:13,They're all acting.
00:34:13,00:34:16,It's always my life.
00:34:16,00:34:18,It's the Amdram capital of the world.
00:34:18,00:34:23,"No, they have drunk tanks now and the idea is that you get people out of A&E and you stop"
00:34:23,00:34:29,clogging up ambulances with drunk people and they've trialed this in Bristol and I think
00:34:29,00:34:33,they've trialed it in other places as well and in 2014 for instance over one weekend it
00:34:33,00:34:37,kept 15 people out of hospital because what they do is they had a mobile drunk tank which
00:34:37,00:34:41,is just a lorry which if someone's really drunk and thinks they're really ill and collapses
00:34:41,00:34:44,you shove them in the lorry and then let them have a nap.
00:34:44,00:34:45,That sounds like a party.
00:34:45,00:34:49,I mean I would get drunk and then be putting in a lorry.
00:34:49,00:34:50,That sounds brilliant.
00:34:50,00:34:53,I think these people might have gone past the fun part of drunk.
00:34:53,00:34:56,"Oh that is going to be the most, it's going to be full of vomit and piss isn't it?"
00:34:56,00:34:57,It's going to stink yeah.
00:34:57,00:34:58,Oh my god.
00:34:58,00:35:00,Do you reckon they have futons in there?
00:35:00,00:35:01,I don't think so.
00:35:01,00:35:02,Everyone's all up in a futon.
00:35:02,00:35:06,Actually they are just big futons made of metal then it's the same principle.
00:35:06,00:35:07,Yes.
00:35:07,00:35:09,"I mean you can say anything's a futon made of something else, can't you?"
00:35:09,00:35:12,This building is a futon made of bricks.
00:35:12,00:35:15,"Excuse me, I've got a complaint about this sandwich."
00:35:15,00:35:19,It's just a futon made of bread and cheese.
00:35:19,00:35:24,You know you can buy speaking of bread and futon.
00:35:24,00:35:31,You can buy a towel which is deliberately created in the likeness of a flour tortilla so
00:35:31,00:35:33,you can wrap yourself up like a burrito.
00:35:33,00:35:34,That's really good.
00:35:34,00:35:35,Yeah.
00:35:35,00:35:36,And sexy too.
00:35:36,00:35:37,It's it.
00:35:37,00:35:38,Oh yeah.
00:35:38,00:35:43,"People who invented this, they're a collective called ampersand friends."
00:35:43,00:35:44,And friends or something.
00:35:44,00:35:49,They told the Huffington Post that they were inspired by the fantasy of being a human burrito.
00:35:49,00:35:50,Wow.
00:35:50,00:35:53,We weird if they said that we were inspired by the collective works of Shakespeare.
00:35:53,00:35:54,It makes sense.
00:35:54,00:35:55,You are right.
00:35:55,00:35:56,Of course.
00:35:56,00:35:58,Odd reading of Hamlet.
00:35:58,00:36:02,Actually there is a guy who's addicted to being rolled up in carpets.
00:36:02,00:36:03,Is that?
00:36:03,00:36:04,Yeah.
00:36:04,00:36:05,Maybe he's part of this collective.
00:36:05,00:36:07,I think he might be the inspiration for it.
00:36:07,00:36:08,He's a guy called George OT.
00:36:08,00:36:10,He didn't want to be known by his full name.
00:36:10,00:36:14,He's in New York and he loves rolling himself up in a carpet and having people trample on
00:36:14,00:36:15,him.
00:36:15,00:36:16,It's charming.
00:36:16,00:36:18,That's most charming it isn't ever heard of rolling up so much.
00:36:18,00:36:23,It is quite sweet and now he hides himself out to parties and rolls up in a carpet and just
00:36:23,00:36:24,trample all over him.
00:36:24,00:36:25,He particularly likes women.
00:36:25,00:36:26,He gets paid for that.
00:36:26,00:36:27,He doesn't make it does he?
00:36:27,00:36:29,People will pay up to $200 for him to perform.
00:36:29,00:36:30,Yeah.
00:36:30,00:36:34,"I mean it's lovely isn't it when you're weird, perverted, fetish, concerned it's your"
00:36:34,00:36:35,job.
00:36:35,00:36:41,So if anyone would like a burrito boy to turn up at the house.
00:36:41,00:36:48,"OK, that's all about facts for this week."
00:36:48,00:36:52,"If you want to get in touch with any of us, you can get in touch on Twitter, Alex is on."
