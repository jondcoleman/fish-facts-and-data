00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.720
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Things A Fish coming to you from the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.860
 QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.840
 My name's Anna Doshinsky, and I'm here with Alex Bell, James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.840
 Murray.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.400
 What's again, we've gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.400
 the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, James Harkin.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.320
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1683, some people were ice skating in the Netherlands

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.000
 when the ice broke away and they floated all the way to Essex.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.760
 Well, it didn't happen.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.760
 No way.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.800
 Well, it happened according to some people.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 So, this is from a book called The Thames and Its Tribute Trees by Charles McCoy.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.280
 It's an old book, and he says it's reported that this happened.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.520
 He says that some skate sliders upon those large icy plains were unawares driven to sea

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.520
 and arrived living, though almost perished with cold and hunger upon the sea coast of Essex.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.000
 Okay, and you know what?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.720
 I don't really believe it, but it is a kind of thing that happened, and it's kind of related

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.040
 to the mini ice age that happened in the 17th century when it got really, really cold.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.320
 And basically, the sea was freezing and all the rivers were freezing, and they had these

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.120
 frostfares in London.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.840
 And there was lots of crazy stuff that happened, whether this happened, I don't really know,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 but...

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.840
 I believe it.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.840
 Yeah.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.840
 Because I don't want to.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.840
 Did they put a sail-up?

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600
 Yeah, how big was the ice shelf?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.720
 Well, that one sentence that I said is the sum total of all the information I have about

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.720
 this fact.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.200
 Did they accidentally cut the raft off with their skates?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.160
 Well, what used to happen is people would have these fairs on the rivers, and then they

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.800
 would try and keep them going as long as possible, because they were so much fun.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.920
 But then, as the kind of ice got less and less and less, it would break up into icebergs

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.920
 and then people would get stuck on these little ice flows.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.720
 And that definitely did happen.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.720
 Yeah.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.200
 They also tried to keep them going, because they were quite economically important.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.120
 So the London-Temps frostfares happened partly because, when the temps freezes over, all

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.120
 the trade from the sea has to stop.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.240
 And like, on one occasion, I think, was two months at the temps froze over.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240
 So...

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.240
 Wow.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.960
 That all the people that are usually working on the docks and stuff like that had nothing to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.960
 do.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.960
 They had no income, all of a sudden.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.960
 It was all very much as well.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.960
 And they were really cheeky.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.080
 So what they did, they would guard the access to the river, basically, because there are

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.160
 ladders and slipways, it's not just a case of walking straight out onto the river.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.160
 And they would charge you two or three pennies to climb down the ladder and get onto the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.160
 river.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.000
 And then they would charge you another penny to leave.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.640
 Even if you left up the same ladder.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.880
 Even if you left up the same ladder.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.880
 Really?

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.240
 And you can't talk to the ticket inspector in the office and ask if you can get a refund

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.240
 on the register card.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.240
 There's no office.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.240
 There's no register card.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.240
 There's no...

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.040
 I don't know about the incentive programmes they had to come and use the same ladder again.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.760
 What happens, though, if you spend your last penny on a bit of, you know, candy floss

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.680
 or something, and then how do you get...

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.680
 You have to stay on the river.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.880
 Or you float off to the Netherlands.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.640
 They must have been so exciting, though, the Thames River Fairs.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.800
 And partly because there weren't that many of them.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.320
 So this little ice age, I think you were saying, was in the 1700s, but it sort of spanned

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.840
 from the 13th century to the 19th and reached its peak then.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.040
 And there were only five Thames Frost Fairs, I thought, in that period, where properly the

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.800
 Thames froze over and all industry moved onto the Thames.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.000
 So it must have been so thrilling when it happened.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Yeah.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.880
 You know, an elephant walked across, didn't it, in the 18...

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.880
 I remember that.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.880
 1814, yeah.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.880
 The last one, yeah.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.520
 But what happened was the elephant walked across the river right next to Black Fry's Bridge,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.960
 which seems unnecessarily dangerous, doesn't it?

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.040
 When you've got a bridge, you've got to use that bridge, then it will slap in the face

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.040
 of the bridge.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.600
 They are kind of dangerous, because there was a bloke who, because a few people died falling

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.600
 through the ice.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.560
 Like, really, really few compared with the number of people there.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.200
 But one of them was a plumber who was carrying a load of lead across the river on the ice.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.200
 And he, you know, clearly got to a weak bit of ice and fell it.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.160
 But apparently, if that happened, a load of people and tents would just get dragged into

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.160
 a hole, which just sounds terrifying.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.080
 That happened on a couple of occasions, like a huge chunk of ice and tents, and people

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.080
 would disappear.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.080
 Oh.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.480
 There was one time when the ice broke up, and there were things attached to a local building,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.000
 and then the ice broke up and kind of drifted away and pulled this building down.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 I think it was a pub, wasn't it?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.600
 And it was when a ship had been anchored to a pub near Rotherhise, and they just tied

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.480
 it around the beam of the pub, and then it dragged the pub down with it when the ice

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.480
 broke up.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.480
 Like, when you take your dog to a pub and leave it outside and tie it up.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.480
 It's the world's strongest dog.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.480
 Clifford.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.560
 Yeah, they put a cable around the beam in the middle of the pub, and then they put an anchor

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.400
 in the cellar of the pub to keep it there attached to the ship.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.160
 I mean, you're just asking for the pub to be ripped out of its mooring kind of, yeah.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.160
 Five people died, though.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.680
 Apparently, the highlight in 1814 was they roasted an entire ox on the ice, and this guy

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.960
 called Ivan Day has replicated that and says it takes 24 hours to spit roast an ox and it

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.760
 would feed 800 people.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.760
 It's also interesting that you could like fires.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.640
 Apparently, a lot of the tents, like the shoemakers tents and things had fires in them to

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.440
 keep the people inside warm, and that worked somehow and didn't melt the ice, because it

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.440
 was really thick.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.600
 They also had a lot of souvenirs, which you could get, right?

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.600
 But basically, they just had tat and books and toys and things that had been made in

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.280
 London, and they just took them onto the ice, put a label on them saying, sold on the

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.600
 icy Thames and then sold them for three times as much.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.600
 I'd buy it.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.600
 Wow.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600
 Yeah.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.360
 Well, there was one book that was made in the Frostfare, it was called Frostiana, or a history

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.680
 of the River Thames in a frozen state, and the entire book was typeset and printed at

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.880
 a printing stall, which had been set up on the Thames.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.880
 That is very cool.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.640
 I haven't heard of any other book, which was printed at the place that it's about and the

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.640
 sold there as well.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.000
 Do you know they had ice brothels today?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Yeah.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Sounds very uncomfortable.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 There were sex tents on the ice.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Nice.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 I know.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.480
 I think it's kind of one woman, the heat of her buttocks made such a great thought.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.360
 She had leaf to drown the man of the law.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.360
 So...

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.360
 I know.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.600
 As I really said, it's probably not going to happen anymore.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.480
 I mean, obviously, it hasn't happened for 200 years, but the reason it happened in the

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.080
 first place was that it happened near the Old London Bridge, right, and that had loads

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.400
 and loads and loads of arches.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.880
 So it was really annoying for River Traffic because the arches meant you couldn't get

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.400
 big ships through there, and as a result, that slowed the flow of the water down and it

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.960
 meant that it was froze over much more easily.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.920
 It actually sped the flow of the water up.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.280
 What slowed the flow of the water down was that the Thames was much wider and shallower

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.880
 then because it hadn't been embanked.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.880
 There was no embankment.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.640
 So what the Old London Bridge did was the arches were much narrower, which meant that it

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.720
 was much easier for a block of ice that was flossing in to get stuck and sort of form

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.320
 the beginning of a dam which ice could then form across it.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.880
 I reckon that we have the technology now to freeze the Thames if we wanted to.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.360
 I was going to say, we're really cool if we did it again by just injecting...

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.360
 Probably.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.640
 Yeah, I probably cost quite a bit, but Citi can, come on.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.520
 I don't know if that one penny entrance and exit fee is going to pay for the technology

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.800
 of freezing the entire Thames.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.680
 They used to play spots while it froze over on the Thames.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.760
 They played football, for instance.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.360
 They also played donkey racing, nine pin bowling, throwing at Cox.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.360
 All right, sorry.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.200
 Just go back because I read about the nine pin bowling and I want to know when they added

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.200
 the extra penny.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.240
 But I like the way that I went nine pin bowling and throwing at Cox and it was nine

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.600
 pin bowling but you had a problem in.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.240
 My understanding of nine pin bowling and ten pin bowling and this is going off really

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:42.960
 old knowledge is that they ban nine pin bowling for gambling and then they kind of put in

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.480
 an extra pin to try and get around the law.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.480
 I see.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.480
 Very clever.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.480
 Yeah.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.400
 Throwing at Cox actually sounds like it's the same as nine pin bowling really, doesn't it?

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.200
 It does, but with Cox instead of pins.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.200
 Yeah, it's like an upgrade.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.200
 Like the two.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.040
 That's pretty much what it is apart from, so you get a chicken and you throw stuff at

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.040
 it.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.040
 That's kind of how it happened.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.040
 Nice.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.040
 It was also shooting at Pricks.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.040
 What's that?

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.160
 Yeah, it's not the same as throwing at Cox.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.360
 It's kind of shooting at Pricks is an old name for a kind of archery, apparently.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.360
 Wow.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.360
 What was the Prick?

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.960
 I would imagine it must be the sharp bit at the end of your arrow.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.120
 I would have thought that as well, but you don't shoot at that, do you?

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.120
 You're right.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.480
 Are they throwing the board towards the arrow?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.480
 No.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.760
 It's an old word for a small indentation or something, so it's like a needle prick.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.880
 So that's what you were aiming for, the little indentation was good.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.200
 In 1540, the word Prick was a term of endearment for a man.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.120
 So instead of darling or sweetheart, you would say my Prick.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.840
 Is that because of the penis thing?

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.920
 Because the Prick, I'm sure, has meant penis for quite a long time.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.920
 Yeah, I think it has.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.160
 I think it's Shakespeareanish, isn't it?

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.160
 Yeah.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.480
 So you say what's a cock?

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.480
 I do say cock.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.480
 You say that all the time.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.480
 And all the time.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.760
 The cock is saying it to me.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.640
 Well, in the 1960s, a spare Prick at a wedding was a bit of British slang for someone who is

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.720
 embarrassingly out of place in a particular situation.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.720
 OK.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.200
 I think that's worth putting it back.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.560
 But not somebody with their cock out.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.120
 That would be, I mean, that would work as well, isn't it?

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.120
 You wouldn't be out of place like that, and that's standard for a wedding, isn't it?

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.120
 We have just been to Dan's wedding, and I don't remember much of that going out

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.120
 on.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.120
 Well, you were in the wrong room.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.120
 Was that your room?

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.120
 Yeah.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.680
 So Russia was quite used to these kind of things.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.880
 It wasn't as exciting there.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.920
 They were accustomed to their rivers freezing over and having big fairs and stuff on them.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.920
 Still are.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.920
 Still are.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:36.920
 I've skied on the Moscow River.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.920
 Have you?

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.920
 Well, I went to St. Petersburg.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.920
 I saw a wedding actually happening on the frozen episode, too.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.920
 It was amazing.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.920
 It's been quite hard to stand up.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.920
 Go down the aisle.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920
 Everyone's sliding around.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.920
 Or to see the bride.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.920
 Yeah.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.920
 Well, that's...

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.920
 She's floated off the bit more.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.920
 And I've accidentally married a snowman.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:10:04.040
 OK, moving on to fact number two, and that is from Alex Bell.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.720
 My fact this week is that former Argentinian president Carlos Menem had such a reputation for

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.960
 bad luck that people would touch their left breast or testicle while shaking his hand.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.760
 I find the wild shaking his hand a bit pretty insulting.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.760
 I think they used the other hand.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.400
 I understand, but it's fairly obvious what you're doing if your hand slides into your

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.760
 pocket as your shaking hands with the former president of your country.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.760
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.760
 This guy is extraordinary.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.760
 Yeah.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.960
 We should call him the unnamable, because it's bad luck to say his name.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.600
 So he's like Voldemort in many ways.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.600
 Yeah.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.000
 People instead say things like Mendes or Menen, where with Voldemort, you don't just say

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Voldemort.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 Yeah, that's true.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Yeah.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.200
 So he's supposedly not allowed to attend football matches, Argentina team football matches,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.760
 because in 1990 in the World Cup, he visited when they were playing.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.320
 And he approached the goalkeeper, Pumpido, to shake hands.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.920
 And this was ages ago.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.240
 So clearly the myth was established, even then, that he was cursed.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.040
 The goalie refused to shake his hand because of the curse.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.280
 He's just sort of put his hands up and said, "No, you're not going to, no."

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.080
 So then Menen laughed and he gave him a pass on the knee.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.360
 And in the match that followed, A, Argentina lost and B, the goalkeeper fractured his knee.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.520
 How do you pass on one's knee at such a stretch to get down there?

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.920
 He was probably aiming for the left testicle.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.720
 Do you know that witchcraft is explicitly banned in Malawi?

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720
 I think it is.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.720
 In football.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720
 Is it?

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.720
 Yeah.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.920
 As in, it's in their rules that you're not allowed to.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.920
 Really?

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.920
 I don't think it's explicitly illegal in British football.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.160
 But I did write to a referee about this to find out what the truth is.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.600
 He hasn't replied weirdly enough.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.200
 But I reckon that it would be unjentimally conduct, a yellow card and an indirect free kick.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:54.200
 I don't think that matters, though, if you've just turned stoken to pigs.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.200
 Yeah.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.320
 Football is full of these superstitions, though.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.040
 It's all, you do something once, you win a match and then you have to do it every time.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.040
 Yeah.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.040
 It's like scoring goals.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.040
 Well, there's it.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.040
 So there was a...

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.240
 Another Argentina guy, Carlos Bilado.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.480
 In the quarterfinals, the goalie had to pee on the pitch because they were about to have

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.360
 a penalty shootout and there wasn't time for him to get back to the dressing room and

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.440
 have a pee there.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.720
 So his teammates all surrounded him and they had a pee on the pitch.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.480
 And then he blocked two shots and Argentina ended up going through.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.880
 So the next match, every time there was a free kick and they made a wall, he peed against

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.880
 them.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:34.520
 Next match, Bilado, made him pee on the pitch again because he thought it would be lucky.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.520
 Right.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.520
 Did it work?

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.520
 It did not work.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.520
 They did not win the next match.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.520
 It's going to be under pressure, aren't you?

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.520
 Like with, you know, 60,000 people watching it.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.040
 So, yeah, back to menum and the reasons that people think he's bad luck.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.160
 I like the fact that he shook the hand of the World Powerboat Racing Champion who was called

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.720
 Daniel Skioli in 1989 and immediately Skioli's boat crashed and he lost his arm.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.360
 But then Skioli became an MP for Mr. Menum's party.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.120
 Michael Schumacher, I think, he shook his hand and then Michael Schumacher was immediately

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.120
 shunted.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.120
 Yeah, but then he narrowly won the next race.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.600
 And if that's the curse of men, is that you win by slightly less than you're normally

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.400
 accustomed to.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.400
 There's not much for curse.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.400
 Yeah.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.920
 He's also known as the father of the Debra State in 2001, Eacon and Wicca Laps, which is

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.920
 a pretty...

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.920
 That is bad.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.920
 Heavy title to be taking.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.160
 If you want to be the father of anything, it's not that.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.160
 Yeah.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.160
 Menum did become famous for his womanizing as well.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.360
 So, he married a former Miss Universe when he was about 73 and a re-lock for her.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.360
 A re-lock for her.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.360
 A re-lock for her.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.360
 I like this is confusing.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.440
 So, there was an article listing all of his bad lucks and it ended on this.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.400
 So, it went through all these people that he's cursed.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.760
 It ended by saying, "The night before the 2000 US presidential elections, the unnamable,

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.920
 as in Menum, is said to have called his good friend George W. Bush to wish him good luck.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.920
 Need I say more?"

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.800
 I mean, George was won that election.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.320
 And actually, he's won that election despite losing that election.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.600
 So, it's incredibly good luck.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.800
 My favourite thing about him is that his surname is a palindrome.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.680
 That's pretty much all I like about him.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:15.280
 Which means he has something in common with ex-cambodian president Lon Null, who, as far as

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.640
 I can tell, is the only head of state ever to be a complete palindrome.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.640
 Really?

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.640
 That's really good.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.640
 Do you think they meet?

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.640
 Well, they have a little club.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.640
 Yeah.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.640
 One in the middle, somewhere in Panama.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.640
 In Panama.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.640
 Yes.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:31.520
 In a canal in Panama, in a man in a canal in Panama.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.560
 In his election campaign, one of the ways he won is that he swore he'd throw the Brits

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.760
 out of the Falklands.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.440
 And then as soon as he did when he started really trying to ingratiate himself with

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.520
 Britain, to the extent that he angled desperately, according to the Guardian, for an invitation to

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.920
 Buckingham Palace.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.560
 So many times did he announce that he had been invited to London, that the foreign office

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.560
 eventually had to let him come.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.040
 Which, I didn't know you could do that.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.000
 If you just announced repeatedly that the Queen's invited you to Buckingham Palace, she's

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.320
 eventually forced her to let you through the door.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.320
 No, you weren't for any party.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.320
 I'm coming tonight.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.320
 I'm really looking forward to coming tonight.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.320
 It's going to be great.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.320
 I'm going to come into this party.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.320
 I think that would work.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.320
 Yeah.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.320
 Do you think it would?

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.080
 Well, you're playing by a rule that other people don't recognise, or rather, you're

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.520
 not playing by a rule that other people do recognise.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.520
 Yes.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.560
 So if you just say, I am invited to this party, people will be embarrassed, even though it's

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.960
 nothing to do with them.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.640
 It's all you embarrassing yourself, that the embarrassment will reflect on them.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.640
 I'll be forced to.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.640
 I'll be fine.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.640
 Yeah, fine, whatever.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.600
 It doesn't affect my life so much if they come to my party.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.600
 Yeah.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.480
 And I don't want to look like a rude idiot.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.480
 Yeah.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.160
 Weirdly, I did get a letter from the Queen yesterday asking if I wanted to attend her

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.400
 private reception next week, isn't it?

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.400
 I found a really questionable list on Quora.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.800
 I think it was of some other superstitions in a discussion, by some other way.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.160
 I like the way you said the word Quora in a real undertone in the hope that people might

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.160
 miss that.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.160
 That is awesome.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.160
 Yeah.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.640
 My favourite ones were apparently it's bad luck to leave your purse lying open on the floor

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:59.720
 because that means that you'll lose money, obviously, somehow related.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.320
 Also, if you eat watermelon with a glass of red wine, you will die.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.800
 And apparently loads of Argentinians just like that's just a proper wise tell that people

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.800
 don't do that.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.800
 You will die.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.880
 I've heard things like that not just in Argentina because it used to be, I think, that you

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.320
 would have foods that were very hot foods and foods that were very cold foods.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.840
 And even if they weren't necessarily hot or cold, they were felt that that's the effect

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.760
 they would have on your body.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.160
 And the watermelon would be particularly cold and icy, whereas the wine would warm you

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.160
 up.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:35.160
 And it would think that the two opposites would kind of clash, and it's Friday the 13th

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.840
 day, which is one reason we might be talking about superstitions.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.720
 And there's a vet in Australia that has a promotion for Friday the 13th, where it's discounting

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.080
 its neutering for black cats.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.080
 Oh.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.800
 So we've got a black cat.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.120
 I could fly to Australia and save loads of money getting it new to it.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.920
 It's the aim so that there are fewer black cats because some people think they're bad luck.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.240
 I think they're good luck.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.120
 It depends which way they cross the road.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.680
 If they cross from left to right it's one, if they cross from right to left the other.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.640
 But is it different in the UK and the rest of Europe?

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.640
 That's a really good point.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.560
 And also which way you're going on the road as well?

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.560
 No.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.560
 You're coming towards the cat.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.360
 So if it crosses from your left to your right, it's one.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.360
 It's relative to you.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.720
 Whereas someone walking the other way will experience opposite luck based on the movement

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.720
 of the cat.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.720
 Right.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.720
 You know left and right is always relative.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.720
 Yeah.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.720
 That's the thing about it.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.640
 That is the interesting thing that it's impossible or there's not very many ways to explain

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.080
 to an alien, say, which is left and which is right if you don't have a similar field

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.080
 of reference.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.080
 Yeah.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.480
 I'd have more important things to talk about.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.480
 All right.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.480
 Yeah.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.480
 I bet you'd freeze up.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.480
 If it actually came to it.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.480
 Yeah.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.480
 I'd be very nervous.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.480
 I don't know a good bit of new people.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.480
 You've got your whole new species there.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.480
 So I'm really looking forward to coming to your planet.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.480
 Yeah.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.480
 You've said that live time.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.480
 Okay.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:18:00.880
 We should move on to fact number three and that is my fact.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.800
 My fact this week is that Isambar Kingdom Bruno once spent six weeks with a coin stuck in

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.160
 his windpipe as a result of a magic trick that backfired.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.160
 He did indeed.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.160
 He did indeed.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160
 Yeah.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.160
 So I've found this.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.120
 I was, for some reason, I was looking him up in the British newspaper archive.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.600
 It's a bit bored.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:23.280
 And I found a no-bittery for him from 1862 and it said the closest he came to death was

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.200
 when he was trying to impress his children in 1843.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.200
 Thank you.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:33.000
 The closest he came to death was one second before he died.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 The second closest he came to death, I'm sure they issued a correction the next day.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.040
 He was trying to impress his children by doing a magic trick where he swallowed a half

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.880
 sovereign coin and then brought it out of his ear but instead the sovereign landed in

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.880
 his windpipe.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.880
 So what happened?

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.320
 So what happened was he had chest pains for a while and quite bad coughing and he, because

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.560
 he's an engineer, as we know, possibly the most important thing he ever designed was a

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.480
 contraption in order to extract it.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.280
 And I couldn't find any diagrams of it but apparently it was a movable platform with hinges

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.880
 on it which I think he strapped his body to and it bent his body over an 80 degree angle

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.120
 and then he was repeatedly struck on the back and the idea was that this would dislodge

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.120
 the coin.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.920
 So he tried this out and it almost killed him one time so they didn't do that again.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.760
 And then he took six weeks having various doctors fiddle about with him.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.360
 All of them tried to get four steps in there and pull it out but he nearly died again.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.760
 And then eventually he went back to the contraption but this time with an incision caught in his

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:37.160
 throat and he bent himself over on this contraption he designed and there was a incision on his

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.600
 throat which was, you know, when you have like a tracheotomy it was allowing him to breathe

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.320
 and so he then managed to choke the coin up and as it was rising up through his windpipe

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.280
 he was still able to breathe because the incision was there and his throat.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.400
 And he coughed it up and he actually did say that the moment when he heard the gold

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.640
 piece strike against his upper front teeth was perhaps the most exquisite moment of his

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.640
 whole life.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.640
 Wow.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.160
 It was a really famous thing throughout the country.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.480
 The isn't working through Brunelle Cointhick, everyone knew about it because he was very famous

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.480
 at the time.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.480
 Yeah.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.080
 So for example, there's a famous Victorian historian called Thomas Babbington McCauley.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.760
 When he read the good news, supposedly he ran along the street yelling, "It's out, it's

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.760
 out!"

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.280
 And everybody knew what he was talking about because he was talking about the coin.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.120
 It's an incredible story.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.800
 It is so ingenious the way he got himself out of it.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.520
 Yeah, and crazy that he got himself out of it and that, you know, all these dogs has tried

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.320
 and then he just built a machine.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.320
 Yeah.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.200
 Is he clever for getting himself out or is he stupid for getting himself into it?

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.200
 I'd say a bit of both.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.200
 Technically he got itself out of him.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.200
 That's true.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.200
 Yeah.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:44.840
 But yeah, I was actually looking him up because I visited recently the Brunelle Museum in

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.080
 Brother Heith, which if you are passing, it's really cool.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.800
 It's absolutely tiny and it's the Mark Brunelle Museum.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.520
 So it's about the Thames Tunnel, which is the first ever tunnel that was built under a river.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.520
 And it was designed by Mark Brunelle and Isne Barbrunelle, his son helped him out.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.800
 And it's a really cool place.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.800
 Go there.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.800
 It's an amazing story.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.040
 It was like an unbelievable feat of engineering.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.480
 And that's why he came third closest to dying as well.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.720
 I got an extra act of the description of the conditions that the workers put up with

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.720
 that.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.400
 They were showered in raw sewage and dodged flames from ignited methane gas whenever they

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.400
 worked.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.400
 It was the worst job in the world.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.200
 They only worked for our shifts because they collapsed after four hours and then would

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.640
 be replaced by men who were still breathing and then they would work for four hours and

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.640
 they'll be replaced by another shift.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.640
 And they were constant.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.560
 There were five floods, I think, one of which Brunelle was down there and nearly died.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.920
 And it's just insane that they carried on.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.840
 Why did they have showers of raw sewage?

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.360
 I think because there's constant leaking on the Thames, the service was coming in a lot.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.360
 Disgusting, man.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.840
 But you know when it froze up, would it just be like frozen turds everywhere?

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.560
 That's what it did, right?

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.560
 Bumpy skate ring.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.560
 Yeah.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.560
 I guess you have snow on top as well.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.560
 Yeah.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.560
 Yeah.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.000
 So he brought a lot of this on himself in the tunnel.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.600
 So he nearly drowned three times, right?

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.600
 He fell into a water tank once.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.600
 But the fact it happened anyway.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.600
 Exactly.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.600
 So that's not so bad.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.080
 But then there was a time where he was with a party of influential visitors in a rowing

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.680
 boat and he was trying to freak them out by rocking it from side to side.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.680
 And nearly drowned.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:19.680
 And it was the third time, the most deadly time, which we've just talked about, was because

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.120
 he was told you shouldn't dig through there.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.120
 That's soft mud.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.440
 That'll bring the river in.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.440
 And he said, now it's fine.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.440
 Don't worry about it.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.120
 And he dug through that bit.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.120
 River came in.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.120
 Sealing collapsed.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.000
 And he was pulled to safety.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.520
 But six members of the evacuation crew died.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.240
 Just quickly on the tunnel, something else you should look up is the painting that's been

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.440
 done of the banquet that they had inside it.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.600
 So one time when it flooded to celebrate the fact that everyone hadn't died and it was still

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.560
 going, they held this enormous banquet and they invited all of high society there.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.560
 That's asking for trouble.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.840
 I was like, everyone almost died.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.840
 What should we do?

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.120
 Let's get all of society back in the tunnel.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.080
 Apart from everything else, you're basically asking for the riddler to attack.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.280
 Well, it looks very exciting.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.280
 Nobody died.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.280
 So Christ is aversed.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.080
 No, and it looks amazing.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.080
 And they used to have stalls.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.960
 So what did happen in the tunnel was they had lots of little market stalls running all

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.960
 the way through it.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.960
 And it was a tourist attraction.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.760
 It was much like the icefers and people would have to pay a few pennies to go into the tunnel.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.760
 And they'd walk through it.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.680
 I'm going to see the death tunnel of death.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:23.480
 He also built an atmospheric railway, i.e. a vacuum railway, pumped along by pressure.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.080
 And can we refer to it as the atmospheric caper, which is what they called it?

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.320
 It's the best name in the world.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.640
 That's so cool.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.480
 It didn't really work, unfortunately.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.280
 So basically, it would be huge pipelines pumping out air to create a vacuum to push the

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:41.360
 train along with atmospheric pressure. But it's such a cool steam-punky reason it failed.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.000
 The technology needed the air pipes to be sealed with leather flaps, right?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.800
 They needed to be kept supple and moist.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:51.840
 So they needed tallow kind of fat to be sort of smeared on them, right?

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.920
 Unfortunately, rats like eating tallow.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:24:00.280
 So they ate a load of the flaps and stopped the system from working.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.720
 So yeah, the system, the design was perfect.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.200
 It was just the time when it was made.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.720
 And it did work for seven months.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.760
 It worked, successfully carrying people from Exeter to Plymouth, I think.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.560
 And there is a pub now in a place called Starcross called The Atmospheric Railway,

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.400
 which sounds all modern, but it was from the mid-19th century.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.400
 Really?

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.400
 Yeah.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.400
 You'd be expecting a really atmospheric pub.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.120
 I was going to say three days inside, really ironically.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.040
 We should say the good thing about the atmospheric railway, the reason he made it, is

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.080
 because you don't need to carry your fuel with you, because there would be fuel planted along

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.600
 the way, so that the way that the vacuum was created was through piston action and every

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.520
 three miles, the pistons were fueled by steam, by little steam sheds.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.800
 And so you didn't need to have all this heavy fuel that you carried with you on your train.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.800
 So it would be efficient, but then we found electricity and we didn't need any more.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:52.160
 So Mark Brunel, great engineer, isn't barking the Brunel, great engineer.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.920
 So it's gone through the family.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:00.120
 And there is another direct descendant of Brunel called Moorwenna Wilson, who made a craft

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:06.080
 made entirely out of folded paper and managed to sail it on some water.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.080
 Great engineer.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.080
 Great engineer, right?

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.080
 It's amazing.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:18.960
 It's completely made out of paper, apart from the keel, which is made out of wood and polystyrene.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.960
 And the keel, I mean, what even is a keel?

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.360
 It can't be that important, right?

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.960
 That's pretty cool though.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.960
 Yeah, no, it's good.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.960
 That's awesome.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.800
 So much people, two pennies, to get in it and sail it across the river.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.800
 And then does she rock it from the side of the river?

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.080
 That's really tarnished, my view of it's working to Brunel, I think it was an absolute child.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.720
 Well, he was a bit of a slave driver.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.520
 Like, a lot of people died on the huge tunnel he built on the Great Western Railway.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.520
 Box tunnel, yeah.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.520
 Box tunnel, that's right.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.200
 Yeah, it's supposedly about a hundred people died in the day of that.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.360
 And he supposedly did it so that the sun shines down it on his birthday.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.880
 I read that that's a myth though.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.880
 Well, did you?

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.120
 Worked it out and we think it's pretty much not far away from being true.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.120
 Oh, really?

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.280
 Whether he did it on purpose or not.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:08.400
 We actually asked the railway company if we could go and check it out.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.080
 And they said, no, there's high speed trades going through.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.920
 Cool, one thing we asked you not to do is dress us on our railways.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.920
 Yeah.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.920
 So they wouldn't let us.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.520
 But we reckon that at least it should pretty much work.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:25.160
 Do you know one thing he did do in the box tunnel, speaking of high speed trains, is he used

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.560
 to quite like driving the steam train sometimes.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.640
 And he was driving through the box tunnel once next to the driver and he was the one who

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.640
 was driving the train.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.360
 And he suddenly saw a big obstacle in front of him to like to break and avoid it.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.560
 And so James Bond put his foot down, like went full steam ahead and just blasted straight

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.560
 through it.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.400
 That's what happened to our researcher.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.320
 And it turned out that it was a carriage from another train that had accidentally fallen

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.160
 off the train and left on the track and he just blasted it into smithereens.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.160
 Wow.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.160
 Planned right through it.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.200
 And action man, all of his work actually came from the time when he nearly drowned in

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.840
 the temps because he went to Converless for ages and Ages in Clifton near Bristol.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.640
 And that's where he got hired for a load of jobs because he was thinking and writing and

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.960
 designing all the time he was converlessing.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.920
 And at Clifton, so they had the two towers of the bridge.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.360
 They didn't have the main body of the bridge, but they did have an inch and a half thick metal

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:20.880
 wire rope going across the gorge by the time while he was still alive.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.360
 And he went across in a wicker basket on a pulley and it jammed while they were halfway

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.360
 across.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.520
 And if you started rocking it, if you've seen the Clifton gorge, you know that is terrifying

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.400
 because it is so high at instant death if you fell.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:41.920
 And he looked up, took off his hat, climbed up to the pulley, unjammed it and they continued

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:42.920
 along the way.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.400
 Oh, that's the fourth closest he came to the bridge.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.920
 Only the foundations of the Clifton suspension bridge were invented not by him, but by a lady

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.880
 called Sarah Guppey, who gave the plans to Brunel for free because she believed that women

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.480
 must not be boastful.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.480
 Wow.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.680
 Yeah, there's someone's written a book basically saying that Brunel was not nearly as good

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.680
 as we all think and he didn't design the Clifton suspension bridge.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.320
 Hardly any of it was related to his original design even by the time that's fully made.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.920
 I think it was pretty good.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.920
 Well, read the book, Andy.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:21.600
 I certainly haven't, but I read an article about it.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.840
 Okay, we should move on to fact number four and that is Andy's fact.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:30.320
 Yes, my fact is that to deal with violent or drunk people, Japanese police carry massive

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:34.560
 futons and roll the offender up in them to calm them down.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.560
 This is fantastic.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.080
 They genuinely, they turn criminals into burritos.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.600
 And would that calm you down, do you think?

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.600
 I think it would.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.400
 If you're rendered completely immobile and you're just sort of in your comfy foot on, I would,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.400
 yeah, I'd calm down.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.960
 Yeah, like when you put a bag over a horse's head and it stops.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.960
 Yeah.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.760
 Stop doing that, Alex.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.320
 So this is from a podcast which is called My Perfect Country.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.240
 Each episode is about a country that is doing something right in a particular aspect of

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.040
 law or society or whatever it is and you're doing it perfectly.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:11.780
 So for example, this is about very low crime and particularly gun crime in Japan.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.280
 It's almost impossible to get a gun in Japan.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.280
 You have to do exams.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.320
 You have to score more than 95% on a rifle range test.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.520
 What, so if you do get a gun at least we know you'll be incredibly accurate.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.520
 Yeah, there's no attempt to murder charges ever.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.520
 Yeah.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.880
 So that's what they should do.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.440
 If you get less than 5% in the rifle range, they should give you help yourself.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:38.680
 Yeah, and as a result there were six occasions last year when the Japanese police fired their

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.880
 guns in total and in 2014 there were six gun deaths.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.120
 I mean, they just, they just don't really have them.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.120
 That's good.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.840
 We do have very similar stance with police people firing guns.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:55.160
 Yeah, so anyway, this is about Japanese policing methods and how they roll people up.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.160
 Yeah.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.400
 It's from the sushi tradition basically.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.400
 Is it?

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.480
 I think someone looks at some sushi and thought, wait a second, why don't we carry massive

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.320
 bits of seaweed around with us?

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.520
 What if that bit of cucumber was a violent offender?

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:12.920
 Yeah, I think it would be quite awkward as a police officer if for this very occasional

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.320
 time when you get a violent offender because like you say there's not many guns, but you

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.880
 always have to carry a massive food ton of that with you.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.920
 They are slightly smaller in Japan, aren't they?

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.280
 So foodtons are a big thing in Japan.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.720
 A lot of people sleep on foodtons and they're not like, I imagine, which is kind of a

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.720
 proper sofa that turns into a bed kind of thing.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.720
 I'll know.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.280
 Yeah, they're not - sorry, they're more like juvets than mattresses, aren't they?

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.280
 Basically.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.280
 Kind of.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.280
 It's a pretty supportive.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.480
 It's a thin mattress that you sleep on, but do you know what else gets a food ton in

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.960
 Japan if you want it?

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.960
 Is your wallet?

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.960
 Yeah.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.960
 So there's a food ton company.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.960
 Yep.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:50.200
 It's a food ton company called Naka Tagawa Foodtons, and they've started making sci-foodtons,

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.280
 which means wallet food ton, and it's made of high quality cotton.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.200
 It includes a little cover, like a duvet cover for your wallet, and it includes a pillow

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.400
 for the head of your wallet, whichever end of your wallet is the head.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:08.720
 It says it's been blessed from priests at Ashrine in Tokyo, and if you want to go more expensive,

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.720
 you can order a little bed that comes with it.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.120
 I'm going to go out on the limb and say this company is not going to last very long.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.560
 Do you see the amount they charge for these foodtons?

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.560
 Yeah.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.920
 They cost about 115 quid, give or take for a food ton.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.800
 For the food ton and bed is 340.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.000
 So then you've got nothing to put in your wallet?

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.360
 Oh no, it's hilarious.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.840
 They aren't beautiful, they look them up.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:35.080
 I mean, I'd be tempted, but then I'm a sucker for this stuff like that.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.200
 Have you heard of the Boroboroton?

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.200
 No, no.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:45.360
 This is a legend, which is like an evil spirit described as a tattered food ton that comes

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.680
 to life at night.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:52.360
 And it's basically part of a group of these kind of demons, these spirits called Sukumogami.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:56.480
 They're basically household objects that either they're possessed by spirits or ghosts, or if

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:02.840
 you use them constantly for 90 to 100 years, they eventually become sentient and they will

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:07.480
 be fine and they'll just kind of behave like normal household objects unless they're feeling

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:11.480
 ignored or needless in which case they will come to life and try to strangle their owners

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:16.120
 and they'll float around to the house, or they will throw noisy parties with other members

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120
 of this.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.080
 So you'll get all your household objects having a party and then trying to kill you.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:24.960
 But how do you stop a violence offender food ton?

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:29.400
 Back it up with a drunk person.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:34.520
 So the police in North Wales a few years ago, this is in 2010, they hired a troop of actors

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.920
 to pretend to be drunk.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.920
 Did they?

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.040
 It was to do a sting on a load of pubs in North Wales.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.160
 They had about 50 pubs in order to check and see if they'd serve people who were obviously

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.160
 inebriated.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.800
 So they hired a troop of actors to dress up as drunk and they gave them all the clothes

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.400
 and costumes as well, like they gave them shabby jackets, he trousers and shoes and they said

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.400
 go in.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.920
 Pretend to be absolutely blind drunk and see if you can get served.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.920
 Wow.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.080
 But then you couldn't prosecute anyone because they're not drunk.

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.920
 I don't know, I imagine you could arrest on those grounds.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.920
 And you don't think so?

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.920
 No.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.920
 I mean either of us has tried it.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.920
 Well I like this place.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:06.920
 There used to be a landlord.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.120
 There used to be a landlord for a pub.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.680
 I had a personal landlord's license, yeah.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.640
 What is that like having a drinks cabinet?

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.640
 Is that just in your house.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.640
 No, I'm not.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.840
 The personal landlord's because I've got one of those.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:21.840
 That means I could go to any pub and be officially by law, the landlord of that pub.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.400
 So about 15 years ago they changed the law.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:29.200
 It used to be that the building had the license, but then they changed it so that the landlord

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.360
 had the license.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.840
 The reason they did it I think is because they had a lot of chain pubs and stuff like that.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:39.200
 And I used to be an accountant for a pub company and I did my personal license.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.360
 And so it meant that if there were like landlords on holiday I could go and work in the pub

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.360
 as the landlord.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.520
 In fact I wouldn't even have to work, I could just be sat there while other people doing

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.200
 all the job, but I'd be kind of the one responsible.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.200
 Wow.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:57.920
 You can say, yeah, you can leave your ship outside, yeah, put the cable down here, that's fine.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.920
 That's good to know.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.920
 We should use that.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.920
 I'm not anymore.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.920
 It's slapsed.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.920
 I mean it lapsed 15, 20 years ago.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.920
 It lapsed.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.160
 You're a pointless friend to us then.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.800
 They have for drunk people on the streets of the UK.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.800
 They've trialed drunk tax.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.800
 What?

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.800
 They don't have drunk people on the streets of the UK.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.800
 They're all acting.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.760
 It's always my life.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.760
 It's the Amdram capital of the world.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:23.880
 No, they have drunk tanks now and the idea is that you get people out of A&E and you stop

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:29.480
 clogging up ambulances with drunk people and they've trialed this in Bristol and I think

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:33.600
 they've trialed it in other places as well and in 2014 for instance over one weekend it

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.320
 kept 15 people out of hospital because what they do is they had a mobile drunk tank which

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.640
 is just a lorry which if someone's really drunk and thinks they're really ill and collapses

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.200
 you shove them in the lorry and then let them have a nap.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.200
 That sounds like a party.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.000
 I mean I would get drunk and then be putting in a lorry.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 That sounds brilliant.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.120
 I think these people might have gone past the fun part of drunk.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.560
 Oh that is going to be the most, it's going to be full of vomit and piss isn't it?

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.560
 It's going to stink yeah.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.560
 Oh my god.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.560
 Do you reckon they have futons in there?

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.560
 I don't think so.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.880
 Everyone's all up in a futon.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.200
 Actually they are just big futons made of metal then it's the same principle.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.200
 Yes.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.680
 I mean you can say anything's a futon made of something else, can't you?

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.480
 This building is a futon made of bricks.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.680
 Excuse me, I've got a complaint about this sandwich.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.480
 It's just a futon made of bread and cheese.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:24.960
 You know you can buy speaking of bread and futon.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:31.240
 You can buy a towel which is deliberately created in the likeness of a flour tortilla so

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.400
 you can wrap yourself up like a burrito.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.400
 That's really good.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.400
 Yeah.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.400
 And sexy too.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.400
 It's it.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.400
 Oh yeah.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.000
 People who invented this, they're a collective called ampersand friends.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.520
 And friends or something.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.480
 They told the Huffington Post that they were inspired by the fantasy of being a human burrito.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.480
 Wow.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.480
 We weird if they said that we were inspired by the collective works of Shakespeare.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.480
 It makes sense.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.480
 You are right.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.480
 Of course.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.480
 Odd reading of Hamlet.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:02.120
 Actually there is a guy who's addicted to being rolled up in carpets.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.120
 Is that?

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.120
 Yeah.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.120
 Maybe he's part of this collective.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.280
 I think he might be the inspiration for it.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.800
 He's a guy called George OT.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.520
 He didn't want to be known by his full name.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.880
 He's in New York and he loves rolling himself up in a carpet and having people trample on

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.880
 him.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.880
 It's charming.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.600
 That's most charming it isn't ever heard of rolling up so much.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:23.400
 It is quite sweet and now he hides himself out to parties and rolls up in a carpet and just

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.400
 trample all over him.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.400
 He particularly likes women.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.400
 He gets paid for that.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.400
 He doesn't make it does he?

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.600
 People will pay up to $200 for him to perform.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.600
 Yeah.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.240
 I mean it's lovely isn't it when you're weird, perverted, fetish, concerned it's your

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.240
 job.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:41.520
 So if anyone would like a burrito boy to turn up at the house.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:48.120
