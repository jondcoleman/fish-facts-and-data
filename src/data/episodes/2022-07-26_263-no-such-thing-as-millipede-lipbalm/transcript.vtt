00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.680
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.960
 This week, coming to you live from Cambridge.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.160
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anit Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.800
 and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.160
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.520
 Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that adult scooters were invented by a Swiss

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.240
 banker who was hungry for a sausage.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.480
 That's true. This was in the 1990s. There was a man who was a Dutch Swiss banker,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.040
 and he was called a "wim orbiter." And he was at home one night, and he suddenly really wanted

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.280
 to a sausage, and he thought, you know, it's what he called a microdistance.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.440
 It wasn't far enough to get in a car and drive there and find car parking.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.880
 What, a sausage shop? Yeah, he had a favorite sausage shop, and it wasn't close enough that he

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.400
 could walk to it, and he thought, why is there not a device that I could use to get me there?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.960
 And then he suddenly had the idea of turning what was only available really for kids,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.760
 kid scooters. Why not make an adult version of that? So he invented that as a result.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.880
 But by the time he's invented it, he's not going to want a sausage any more, is he?

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.480
 No, that's a sad bit of this story, yeah. He starved to death in the manufacturing process.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.960
 No, so when he eventually had a prototype, he took it down to his town and everyone laughed at him

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.160
 because the idea of an adult on a scooter was seen as a really ridiculous. Ten years later,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.400
 and with the support of his wife, he had the prototype made into a real thing. It started going to

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.000
 market. It went to big sales, and then in America, it got sold with the name Razor, Razor Scooters,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.200
 which I grew up riding, and that was him. It was down to the man wanting a sausage.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.720
 And he said he gave them sex appeal, which is something I haven't seen evidence of yet,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.400
 on adults, on scooters, but he said he described it as like the tiny wheels, the polished aluminum,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.920
 and the foam handlebars, the combination of those three things,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.880
 gives them more sex appeal than your average kid's thing. I don't know if foam handlebars are sexy,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.840
 but maybe that's just me, I've got weird taste.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.960
 There was a kind of really, really, really proto scooter, which was invented in the early 19th

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.320
 century, so it was called the Dandy Horse. It was technically called a pedestrian curricle.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.840
 So it was invented in 1818, when it was first pacented, and it had other names, it was called a swift

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.800
 walker, or a pedestrian's accelerator, that was the name of this human. I can't believe this,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.040
 this is three years after the Battle of Waterloo was over, but it was for fashionable dandies in

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.600
 town. And what it was was, imagine a bicycle and just take away the pedals, okay? So you

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.400
 sit, stride it on the saddle, and then you just have to push yourself along the ground on either side.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.000
 This was the ultra fashionable device in London to have, you know, there were only about 300

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.600
 of them made. But it's the bizarre thing about the Dandy Horse is, hey, it appeared, as you say, in

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.880
 1817, it was invented as probably 1818, and it suddenly come back, right? So that's what you see

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.560
 kids going around on them today, they're at local balance bikes, or whatever, and it helped

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.040
 them cycle. And also, it was fashionable for a year. So it invented 1817, really fashionable in

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.800
 London, 1818, disappeared by 1819. And you can find articles by the 1830s, you've got articles

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.880
 going, "God, remember the dandy horse? That was weird, wasn't it?" But that's actually true of

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.240
 that adult scooters as well. Yeah. They are coming back in America especially, but in 1999,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.560
 they had four million dollars worth of sales, 4.5. In 2000, it was 70 million, and in 2001, it

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.280
 had gone back down to 6 million. So it's just like one year where they became absolutely massive.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.840
 Yeah. And then quite a few people got injured, I think. Yeah. Well, yeah, what happened was is,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.680
 the problem he had was he made this new innovation, you could fold, it could go in your bag,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.440
 everyone got excited immediately, every country that had copies, you know, pirated copies made,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.120
 got in on the action. So the market was flooded with all this stuff. And as you say,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.000
 handles weren't made properly, so people were chopping their, we're not chopping their

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.240
 fingers off, but damaging. One person lost, one person lost a bit of a finger due to a cheap

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.160
 imitation. Yeah, exactly. They made the handles out of knives or something. That's sexy.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:52.000
 They're made now. There is this, the town that it's produced in, it's just outside of Zurich,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.920
 and it's called Kusnacht, and it's where they manufacture, or where the headquarters for this

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.440
 razor company is, without the name razor, his original company. And it's a really cool town.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.760
 It sounds like there's a lot of amazing stuff that's happened and going on there. So notable people

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.240
 outside of this razor that's there from that town include Julius Maggi, who invented the pre-cooked

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.200
 soup, Maggi noodles. From this tiny, tiny town, Carl Jung was from there. I usually have led with

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:29.280
 Carl Jung. Well, how about this? Tina Turner lives there since 1994. Yeah, Carl Jung, Tina Turner,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.440
 and the Maggi noodle guy. Yeah, you put those in the wrong order. It was clarified. But it is

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.840
 bizarre that scooters, even though we're claiming that this guy invented them, they are not a new

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.120
 invention. And I really had no idea that these motorized scooters you see today were first

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.600
 properly invented in 1915. And there were loads of pictures in the early 20th century

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.560
 of people going around on them. And again, it was short lived, it was between about 1915 and 1922.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.080
 They were partly a response to wartime gas rationing, so they didn't use up very much petrol.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.640
 And it was in America, and they would come with head and tail lights and a toolbox,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.880
 and policemen used them. Post was delivered on them, postmen used them for a while. Wait,

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.280
 sorry, are these things like vespas or are they things like? No, you're standing on them. Yes,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.320
 they're fuel powered. You're standing like a child, but we're the small motor. Yeah. And they had

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.320
 even... I did read a source that said they were used by a New York gang called the Bog Trotters,

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.840
 the Long Island Bog Trotters. No. You did exist. And this is written in a lot of books. I've

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.320
 struggled to find the primary newspaper reports that talk about the Bog Trotters disappearing down

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.400
 alleyways on push scooters, but apparently they were really useful for getting away from police.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.320
 They just do motorized scooters down alleyways. Yeah, that is possible, I guess. If you commit a crime

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:50.160
 at the top of a hill, you're laughing. I found something about development of new kinds of

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:57.440
 transport. Okay. Similar wartime transport innovation. So motorized roller skates. So separate

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.200
 roller skates with motors inside them were invented in the Second World War. For people in the war?

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.040
 Well, the inventors suggested that... That would have been, I mean, the war. I'm not going to say the war

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.920
 is fun, because war isn't fun. No. But if we all had motorized roller skates... It would have taken

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.760
 the edge off. Would have taken the edge off. Well, the guy who invented them was called Tom Hancock's.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:22.000
 He took the motor out of a lawn mower and he basically put these engines on these roller skates.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.040
 And his footage, a new footage of him scootering around, and he's even got a little trailer on the

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.240
 back, which his daughter sits on and she's just sitting there going along the road. And he suggested

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.520
 that soldiers could use them to save on marching and he was not taken off on his offer, basically.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:44.480
 But they're coming back. Those are the segue last year invented motorized roller skates. Really?

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.840
 And you could, but they were not greeted with great favour. Headlines included, Segway is back and it's

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:57.040
 coming for your last tread of dignity. Segway's escapes are a whole new way to look cool while falling

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.160
 over and wired magazine named them the object in the office most likely to kill you.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:08.240
 Yeah, but these electric scooters, they are quite popular now in America in a lot of cities.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.680
 They have like kind of Uber thing or a Boris bike kind of thing where you can take them for a small

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.000
 amount of money and take them around. Can't you? A lime and bird are the two main companies.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.280
 The problem is they're new and so for instance the scooters that bird has got their rebranded

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:32.000
 Xiaomi devices which have a weight limit of 200 pounds when the average American man weighs 197.9 pounds.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.680
 And a couple of weeks ago, lime did an official statement saying there was a bug that caused sudden

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:43.920
 excessive braking and they said it's all right. It only happens when being ridden downhill at top speed.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:53.520
 Excessive braking is not what you want, is it? No, basically you go down downhill and you'd hit

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.800
 something small on the road and whatever's in the scooter makes it think that it's a massive obstacle

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.760
 and just immediately stops. Oh god. They did say I should say for legal reasons that fewer than

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:12.960
 0.0.045% of all rides worldwide have been affected. That's covered. The Segway has a checkered

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.600
 history, isn't it? And the guy who invented the Segway Dean Cayman in fact thought it was going

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.640
 to take over the world. So and he called it ginger after ginger Rogers because I guess they're so

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:28.640
 elegant. But he also invented a bunch of other things so he invented a robotic wheelchair which

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.960
 goes upstairs which is quite cool. So the wheels climb over each other so you can get up the stairs.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:39.600
 He also invented a person cannon. This is technically called a controllable launcher

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:45.360
 and it's a cannon that fires its payload as in the person that you put in it onto the top of

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:53.360
 buildings. So if you're I mean that does sound really cool. Do you set the height of the building

00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:00.000
 that you want to get onto the top of? Of course you do. They're not all set up to be the size of the

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.680
 shard. And then you just got a one story house. You wouldn't want to be going to the top of the

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.680
 shard though because even if you get right to the top you're instantly impaled in the shard.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.880
 But also it's building to land on in the world. What if you work on the 15th floor in the building's

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.920
 30 floors? You're still as far away. Could you open a window and just get propelled through that?

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.480
 Wait what do you mean open a window? They don't want to go inside the building. It's not just a

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.280
 quick way of getting to work. What are you saying? You were saying it fires you onto the top of a building?

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.680
 Yes, if you're sorry if you're a fireman or something in the building. If there's a terrorist

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.560
 up there it's not just oh I'm too lazy to use the lift. I don't want to be with a scum in there.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.720
 Just get my purse and can I? So if there's a terrorist up there. I would have been a great see to

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.720
 die hard with Bruce Willis gets a lot to the top of the. He said it was it's potential uses

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.160
 were anti-terrorism. I don't remember when terrorists have hidden on the top of buildings

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.320
 and we haven't been able to get to them. But this is what we need when they do. And apparently it

00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:00.400
 would land you gently at a safe impact distance from the air. They thought the second would be

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.080
 bigger than the internet though. They said this is going to be the biggest thing since the internet.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.360
 They said this is going to render cars obsolete. And then the problem with it is that they did it

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.200
 massive secrecy. So they were really paranoid when they were making it that Japan was working

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.240
 or something similar. So everyone who was making it had to have all their blinds nailed down,

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.760
 properly taped shots so no one could see anything. They couldn't test it because they were so

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.920
 paranoid about other people seeing it. So they were astonished when it was left outside and only

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:34.800
 weirdos and nerds used them. I've got four. Exactly. I'm going to have to move us on in a second to

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.280
 our next facts. I've got one tiny fact. This is just about sort of little motorised forms of transport.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:47.280
 Since Donald Trump became the president, the Secret Service has spent $300,000 renting golf carts

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:53.520
 from him so they can protect him while he plays golf. Yeah. Just in case anyone was on the fence

00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:00.960
 about him at this point. Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Anna. My fact this week is

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.840
 that goats have been engineered to produce spider silk because when farmers try to get the spiders

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:12.640
 to do it themselves, they just kept eating each other. This is an amazing thing that goes

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:18.720
 to engineer to do in the early 2000s. They have been genetically spliced with the protein from

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.520
 spiders that makes their silk and apparently farmers have been trying to farm spider silk for over

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.080
 100 years but it's a complete nightmare because they're territorial cannibalistic predators that

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:37.120
 will eat anything in their way. Other people who will find their way. So yeah, it didn't work and

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.880
 then they finally found out that you can put these jeans in goats which don't tend to eat each

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:47.520
 other unless you've got a very unhappy farm and they're what's called transgenic. So a transgenic

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:53.680
 goat is transgenic is when you have the DNA of something totally different put into you and it comes

00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:00.480
 out in their milk. They're not just weaving these webs. They don't get glanced silk glands inserted.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.880
 You don't come in the morning and you're in the farm and your goats in the wet tree.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:15.440
 Imagine if you got bit by a radioactive goat of this kind. Just having to explain your super power

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:23.040
 would be so long. So the reason I've climbed up this apparently sheer wall of a dam is a niche goat

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:29.520
 reference. So the spiders had the early versions where they did this. They put a spider in a tiny

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.240
 little almost like the stock. You know if you throw like, um, this one has eight holes.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.200
 It was just for the abdomen and you put the spider in there and then you'd put a thing in and it would

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.960
 pull all the spider silk out. But the thing is they kept all the spiders together and eventually a

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.680
 spider spun the webs over the wall so it was completely covered which meant that no other insects

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.480
 or mosquitoes could get in and so they ended up not having anything to eat which is why they all

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.560
 ate each other and then eventually there was only few left alive but they were all absolutely

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:14.080
 massive because they'd eaten all the mates. And that's why it never kind of kind of, I don't know,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:20.000
 is how useful it has been already in the past. So for instance it's been totally vital to astronomy.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.920
 I don't know this so for 250 years it was used in telescopes and it's used in the eyepieces of

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.120
 telescopes and it acts as a kind of as crosshairs basically. So if you're looking through a normal

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.120
 telescope you see a shadow of stars, you need some kind of reference point. It's amazing you never

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:41.440
 got that job at the sky of night. Do you think that's a common complaint that they go, oh man,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.920
 it's too many. It was, it's not that there's too many, it's that you can't pinpoint where they are

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.080
 and so what you do is you need crosshairs to act as a reference point and the perfect crosshairs

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.640
 are spider silk and so they've been used in telescopes for hundreds of years. They used to have a

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:02.720
 spider silk collector, the grenet of the observatory until the 1950s and there was, I was actually

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:08.160
 reading the astronomical guidelines from the 1890s about how to collect spider silk and it says

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.680
 you have to stand on a stool and you hang a spider from a piece of wood and then as it drops you

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.520
 wind it's thread with a fork. So you just collect it thread with a fork. So this poor spider

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.920
 thinks it's dropping and dropping and it's just saying the same place and then it sometimes says if

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.880
 a racney is inclined however to be obstinate gently blow on her with a full steady breath

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:32.880
 and she will weave but this is how they've been pinpointing where stars are. That's incredible.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.000
 It's amazing. I can't believe that you can collect it and store it like that. Oh yeah. Well another

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.760
 thing was in war it's very useful so in the second world war it was used in gun sites for the same

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.880
 reason. You put it on the lens of gun sites and it was exactly that reason to help you focus and

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:55.520
 there was a team of spider ticklers who were in place. Yeah the US employed the main one was called

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:01.840
 nan's songa and a bunch of other women who tickled spiders. She tickled so many webs out of spiders

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.800
 that the US had to appeal to Mexico for extra spider imports because she'd exhausted all the web

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:12.320
 available in America. I mean how many spiders are there in America? She can't have tickled every

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.920
 single one. She was basing through those spiders. Yes you're on roller skates. You're tickling spider.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:26.800
 What's going on to win this war? I think there's been debate, not serious debate but debate

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:34.560
 nonetheless about what kind of spider bit spider-man. The theory is that it's finally we've got to

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:40.960
 the big issue of that. Spider-man must be one or another kind of spider because it wasn't just

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:46.320
 an else spider that bit it wasn't. So tarantulas probably produce silk from their feet.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.880
 Oh yeah because he doesn't, when he fires the silk it's out of his hands. He doesn't pull it out of

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:56.480
 his bum doesn't he? Yes. If he had been bitten by a radioactive house spider he would have to laboriously

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:02.800
 like his costume would look very different. And they really wanted to make the film a PG.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:13.200
 I mean other species me. It's worth saying that spider-man has gadgets that shoot out the web. It's

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.400
 not actual web shooting out of his arms. Really? When the movies at least I don't know. He can't stick

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.320
 to walls. He can't stick to walls. He can't stick to walls. I did not know that. The thing is the

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.800
 four people who know least about spider-man is this room that sat on the stage. Everyone else

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:37.040
 has got half a fuck say. If you don't have any fishing bait when you're going fishing an alternative

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:44.080
 to use particularly if you're in the Solomon Islands is spider silk. They have a fish there which is

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.760
 called the needle fish and it's mouth is too small to eat any of the classic luring bait that you use.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.440
 So what they do there is they use like a kite string so they throw that out into the water and

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:01.680
 they attach to it blobs of rolled up silk from a spider's web and they will just bounce it on the

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.800
 water and what happens is that these fish come up and they leap into it and they get stuck to it

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.080
 and then they pull them back and that's how they catch them. So that's their bait.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:16.720
 Couldn't they then just swim off but with a mouth that's stuck together? No because the guy's got

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.920
 the kite string. He's pulling them back in. You've got the kite string. Sorry, got it. Yeah, yeah,

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:25.440
 no, you haven't just thrown a bit of sorry. You've never been great at fishing, have you?

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:31.040
 Throw the rod in there with everything. Just set by the side of the lake for two hours.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:38.480
 Not showing that fish. I bet that's really uncomfortable in its mouth right now.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.480
 That's fishing.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:48.960
 Okay, we're going to have to move on to fact number three and that is Andy. My fact is that when

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:55.680
 King George VI visited Washington and American chemist provided the royals with special London water

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:02.240
 so they could have exactly the same tea as they had in Britain. And this was the first time the king had

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:08.720
 any king had visited a sitting U.S. president because of all the unpleasantness previously.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:15.040
 Can I ask this water? It wasn't that they brought it over from London, or was it?

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.920
 No, they didn't. They made it up. They sort of analysed the chemicals in it and a chemist called

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.560
 Betts offered to provide special London water. And the White House said that's a very nice and

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.440
 hospitable thing to do. We'll have five gallons of it. And then halfway through the royal visit,

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.760
 Betts got another telegram saying, we find we will need far more water than we ask for.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.320
 Would it be possible and could you be so kind as to furnish us with 20 more gallons?

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.760
 Because the royals evidently drank a lot more tea than the Americans abound for. I looked it up.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:49.840
 If that was small cups of tea, the original consignment would have made 120 small cups of tea.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.200
 And then they asked for enough to make another 500 cups of tea.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.160
 Wow. And he was only there four days or something, wasn't he?

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.440
 Yeah. So it must have been lots of people drinking it.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:05.680
 No, it's just the king. It was a big trip. When they went there, they were received outside

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.880
 the White House by over 250,000 people. It was made him. Everyone came out to see that.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.960
 They made a lot of trips. This was when the war was about to kick off.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.240
 So it was very symbolic, the trip that they were doing. And George Essex went to visit the tomb

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:27.440
 of George Washington, who obviously was a foe of his great, great, great grandfather.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:33.920
 So that was a huge symbolic moment to visit the man who effectively kicked us out of America.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.120
 And so that is revolting tea all over that tombstone.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.640
 They also, as well as that, they had hot dogs for the first time, the first time a royal had had a hot dog.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.480
 The headline in New York Times said, "King tries hot dog and asks for more."

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:52.720
 The hot dogs were served on a silver tray and apparently the queen at the time,

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.400
 which was the queen mother, yeah. She asked Roosevelt how to eat a hot dog and Roosevelt said,

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.640
 "Very simple, push it into your mouth and keep pushing until it is all gone."

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.360
 It's good advice in general, I think. It's a sure-for-recipe for choking.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.960
 Well then she used the knife and fork after that.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.280
 Yeah, and no photographer allowed to take photos because of the royal eating hot dogs.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.280
 Yeah, I mean, that's the thing. I think you're not allowed to take photo of the queen eating now, are you?

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:24.000
 You don't want that phallic shot, do you? You don't want the hot dog going into the queen.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.240
 You don't want wholesale. Yeah, you don't want the president of the United States shoving

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.680
 a sausage in the queen's face, do you? It's bad, Pierre.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:38.960
 I looked up a little bit about tea. You know Carl Linnaeus, who same as the categorising

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:45.760
 life. He was really desperate. He wanted to import a lot of plants because he was a specimen

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.160
 collector and he was desperate to bring back tea from the east and time and time again he failed

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:56.160
 to bring back any tea from the east. So he tried 20 different times to get a single tea plant

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.680
 from China where it wasn't the time. But what happened did he get half way through and then just

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:05.600
 thinking I could do with a broom? Well, they died on route. At the time as they were eaten by rats

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.000
 or mice, there was once a time where he had a student called Pierre Osbeck who had managed to

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.560
 source a tea plant and he got it all the way to the Cape of Good Hope, sailing all the way back from

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:21.200
 China and then there was a sudden whirlwind and it was blown overboard. Another one fell off

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.880
 ship when the ship blasted a ceremonial gun as it left the harbour, but right on the edge.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.040
 Would it blow deck? What did he do? I know, I know. Why have they only got one specimen each time?

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.760
 I reckon like the 30th of 40th time, I would be like why don't we take two this time just in case?

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:44.480
 So the following assistant after the gun debacle, he was called Largestrum and he brought a plant

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.560
 back to Uppsala. He managed it, he made it, brought a plant back and then he merged over two years

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.840
 before finding out it was the wrong one. Was it because is this in China that he was taking the

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.960
 leaves from? Yeah, so it was that China had a stronghold over tea and they didn't want, that was the

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:05.040
 biggest, most dangerous thing to their economy for you to take that out and as a result of someone

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:11.360
 actually managing to smuggle it out and setting it up, that's what gave both to so much of how

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:16.720
 the West became powerful basically through tea. If I made that, I feel like you're looking at me like

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:27.440
 I was just, some more clarity wouldn't go on this. So I was looking at tea, so teas are very British

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.520
 thing, the breads have been very proud of their tea making their cons, they're addicted to tea

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:36.720
 basically, have been for a long time and to the extent that in war it's been really useful and

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:43.360
 every single tank, every single armored tank to this day has tea making facilities in it and

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.320
 this is because it caused a serious problem in the war, so in the Second World War just off the

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.960
 Normandy landings, there was a British battalion, a British tank battalion who had a couple of

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.040
 minutes to spare, so they did what all British troops did with a couple of minutes to spare,

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.640
 they popped out of their tanks, so they called a few spiders. And they tickled some spiders.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:09.920
 Had a quick roll escape. And they made a tea and they made this tea and the enemy saw that they

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.120
 were doing that and they sort of destroyed them and their tanks. And so it became apparent that

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.760
 there needed to be tea making facilities within tanks and you couldn't put petrol and light fires

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:25.120
 in tanks to make tea. And so tanks were all equipped in their little funnel in the sort of chimney

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.440
 with proper tea making facilities that were designed for tanks, that used the electricity that the

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:34.560
 tank used and it was inside the turret and they are still used to this day and it was because the

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:41.440
 Brits needed to drink tea at all times. Wow, that's amazing. Even in tanks. We're going to have to move on

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:47.200
 shortly to our final fact. Can I just, I've got some stuff about milk and tea, so the way the Brits

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.640
 drink tea is with milk. And I wanted to know when that actually started and so the first person to

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:58.880
 recommend drinking tea with milk was a guy called Thomas Garway in 1670. So no one drunk tea with milk

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:04.320
 then most of the countries they don't. But he wrote a pamphlet called an exact description of the

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:11.040
 quality and virtues of leave tea, draw not for the satisfaction of persons of quality. And he gave

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.480
 a bunch of reasons why tea is a great thing to drink. So he said if you add milk to it, it avoids

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:21.840
 looseness in the bowels, which is quite good to know. I think he also said the good thing about

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:30.080
 tea is it prevents fevers by provoking a most gentle vomit. Tea was really weird then. He said it

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.600
 makes the body active and lusty. And he said that this is something that he learned from Japanese law

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.080
 that have been brought over. The best tea ought to be gathered by virgins. There are the only people

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:45.040
 who are qualified to gather the best tea, yes. You were saying about vomiting. The reason that we have

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.640
 tea in Britain is due to vomiting. And this is because when Charles II married Catherine

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:56.000
 of Braganza of Portugal, she brought the idea of tea over. It had been a few people that had it,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.600
 but it wasn't really popular. And she came over to the UK on a boat and it was an extremely stormy

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.920
 crossing. And when she arrived, she was feeling really, really sick. So she asked for a cup of tea

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:10.000
 and everyone went, what the fuck's tea. And they didn't know what tea was. And so they gave her

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.800
 instead a glass of ale, which unsurprisingly did not make her feel better at all. And so she decided

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:20.640
 that we're going to have to have a lot more tea in the country and then it became much more popular

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:26.080
 effects of that. Oh, really? Just the fact? God imagine, if you weren't travelling and you got

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:32.320
 to the other end and they said, what the fuck's tea? You'd go back. Have you ever heard of America?

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:41.200
 I'm okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:46.880
 Okay, my fact this week is that many millipede researchers are annoyed that more than 70 years

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:54.640
 after World War II, the animals are still associated with the Nazis. It's certainly the first

00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:03.440
 symbol I have in mind when I think Nazi. So this is true, apparently. A very early qualifier.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:09.920
 Well, I was told this by a good friend, Erica McAllister, who works in the Natural History Museum.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:15.440
 Why are they not the insects? Well, I googled it and apparently it comes from the dig for victory

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:20.160
 campaign. So do you remember during World War II, the people who were left home, they weren't tickling

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.480
 spiders and they weren't playing with the roller skates and stuff like that. They were making food at

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.360
 home so that we wouldn't run out of food. And so they sent a load of pamphlets around to everyone

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:34.000
 saying, this is what you have to do. This is how to plant sprouts and this is how to dig up potatoes.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.640
 But it also said, this is what you have to do with pests. And they had a picture of a centipede

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.200
 and a picture of a millipede. And they said the centipede was a fast moving friend and the

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.520
 millipede was a slow moving enemy. And they showed you how to tell the difference between the two of

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:54.240
 them. And the millipede was holding a massive swastika. Right. And sorry, is that the main way you

00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:02.480
 tell the difference even today? But the reason was that centipedes eat insects and millipedes eat

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.360
 plant matter. And so if you're making vegetables, what you don't want is insects that are going to

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:12.000
 eat the roots of your plants. But you do want centipedes that might eat the other pests. But in

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.680
 actual fact, millipedes mostly eat decaying or getting matter. They have very weak mouth so they

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:22.400
 can't really eat tubers and stuff like that. So it was completely ridiculous. I can't eat a tuba.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:30.160
 So I'll play it here. Well, thank God we've resuscitated the reputation of the millipedes.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:35.520
 Everyone thought was a fascist. Millipedes don't have a thousand legs.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:43.440
 Sometimes researching the show is just horrible. They have 750 as the most they've ever had.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:49.040
 There is a theory that one day there could be a millipede with a thousand legs. Why? How come?

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.360
 Because I believe that some of them develop extra legs that longer they live.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:58.880
 Really? Yeah. Well, they all do. Millipedes all have legs for themselves as they're growing. So when

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.440
 they're born, they're born with about three pairs of legs. And it's kind of like they're adding

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:07.520
 to each other like they're Lego or something or like a conger line. They're constantly adding a new

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.800
 segment. They shed, they malt, and then they add a new segment with legs. So if they live forever,

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:19.760
 I guess they wouldn't. If they live forever, yes. Oh, a thousand years. A thousand years. Just like

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:30.080
 the third Reich was predicted to. More and more evidence as we look for it. Well, this is the

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.600
 really cool one. It's called Iliacme Plenipedes, which is the one with the most legs ever. It only

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:42.560
 lives in California under a particular boulder. I'm sorry. It lives in a very small four and a half

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.400
 square kilometres, not a boulder, four and a half square kilometres. It was found under a boulder. It

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:51.920
 was missing for 80 years. And then it was rediscovered. They should have just looked under the boulder.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:30:05.120
 Should have looked in Argentina. It's too much. It's too much. But this is, oh, this is a really

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:12.000
 weird thing. The male of this species, Iliacme Plenipedes, or Plenipedes, it has converted two of

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.560
 its legs into sex organs, which is a thing that some animals can do. That's what

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:23.680
 millipedes tend to do. They're legs turn into penises. Yeah. During puberty. Imagine that. 13 years old,

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:29.760
 and what are your legs turns into a penis? That's a rough day at school, isn't it?

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:38.160
 You would hope to get it. And why aren't you doing PE today? Well,

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:44.320
 yeah, it sounds really dramatic actually. They're whole bodily makeup changes. This is the

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:49.760
 recent study that looked into what happens when they hit puberty. And it's usually on their fifth,

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:56.240
 sixth or seventh segment. Those legs turn into a gonopod, or gonopod. And that's basically a

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.360
 penis that clasps the female while they put sperm into her. And it involves the rearrangement

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.800
 of all their internal organs, basically. And it's an exhausting process in terms of energy consumption

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:14.480
 to turn your legs into a penis. And so some adolescent male millipedes go through reverse

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.920
 adolescence because they develop the penis legs. And then they're so exhausted. They're basically

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.840
 at starvation level because they've used so much energy. And so they go backwards again.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.240
 They're like, "I'm knackered, I can't deal with this whole..." So wait, did they turn the leg

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:34.560
 penises back into legs? Yeah, they reverse adolescence. Wow. Imagine if Spider-Man was bitten by

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:50.800
 millipedes. This one's definitely not PG, guys. So, okay, well, Madagascar's giant pill millipedes,

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:57.280
 they have a music-making organ on their backside. The males is called a harp and the females is a

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:02.480
 washboard. And basically, it's like a load of ridges, but both sexes have a knob on their

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:07.120
 backside of the last pair of legs, which they rub across their backsides to make noises.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:15.120
 So the female sounds a bit like a washboard and the male sounds like a skiffle group.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:22.240
 Whereas a lot of them are deaf as well, tragically. So they make this music to seduce each other,

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.840
 but they can't hear. And so we don't really know what the point is.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:32.720
 Maybe they're feeding the vibrations in their heads. Yeah, but they can't hear the beautiful

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:37.440
 skiffle music that's been created. It's very sad. You know, some of them have, this is just quite a

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.560
 cool thing. They have spiral stomachs to give themselves a larger surface area to digest food,

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.600
 because obviously they're very, very long. So if the food is going around a spiral, it gets maximum

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:56.400
 surface area. Very clever. Very clever. They give each other back massages. No. Yeah,

00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:01.760
 this is actually how they seduce their mates, is they give the ladies a back massage. So

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:07.920
 the millipede's defense mechanism is to curl up into a ball, into a spiral. And sometimes if she

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.840
 hears a male coming, she thinks, or she's male coming, she thinks, "Oh, that's a threat." And so she

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:17.520
 curls up tightly. And to try and seduce her, he'll walk over her back until she relaxes her.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:27.760
 Lower. Lower. Lower. Lower still. Got a long way to go. But that's not, to me, if you turn that

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.840
 into human terms, if you were seducing and you gave a back massage, you would go with hands.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:36.400
 You wouldn't, anyone to get some massage, when you suddenly feel someone standing on your back,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:43.840
 that's the thing. Like, there is some people like, my wife had a massage the other day. And she had

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.080
 people walking all over her back. Yeah, it's a thing. There you go. And imagine if those people

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.800
 had 750 legs, that would be a good massage. I'm going to get a call. A lot of them is a penis.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:34:01.360
 You were never seeing them again. We're going to have to wrap up shortly. I've got one quick thing,

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:07.200
 which is that lemurs self-medicate using millipedes. This is really cool. So they get these

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.520
 infestations of threadworms, which are very nasty things, around their mouth and around their

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.640
 anuses, and they sort of crawl out, and then they lay their eggs in your skin around those two

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.200
 areas, threadworms. They're very unpleasant to get. So lemurs have a particular kind of

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.800
 millipede, which has a chemical defense mechanism inside it, and it can blind and poison predators,

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.600
 and it's quite strong. So the lemurs chew on the millipedes, and then they rub the remains around

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:38.320
 their mouths and around their anuses, and then they swallow them, and they're repels the threadworm.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:47.840
 It's an awful moment for the millipede when it thinks, "Oh, this is a real low point in my life,

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:54.720
 I'm being used as lip balm." The animal does it know. The anus is coming.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.480
