00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show, we have two exciting announcements

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,120
 to make. The first is about who our special guest is this time and the second is about

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,280
 a live show we have coming up. So firstly, our guest this week is the brilliant comedian

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,120
 Rachel Parris. Rachel's been on once before, but if you haven't heard of her or you didn't

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:24,680
 hear that episode, she is a fantastic writer, comedian, presenter, musician, you name it.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,240
 She's an ostentatious, the Jane Austen themed improvised comedy show. She also is in the

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,840
 throes of publishing her first ever book. It's called Advice from Strangers, Everything

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,120
 I Know from People I Don't Know. She toured around for a year asking her live audience

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,280
 for advice and this book is the brilliant result. It's funny, it's uplifting, the

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,760
 advice range is from be kind to never pass up the opportunity for a wee. It spans the

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,320
 gamut. It's a brilliant book and it's out in paperback now so do check it out.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,280
 The second thing to say is that we have a live No Such Thing as a Fish coming up on

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,400
 the 21st of April and this is a global streaming event. Very exciting. We're doing a show

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,040

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:02:03,720
 show. Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,400
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting

23
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,000
 here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Rachel Parris and once again we have gathered

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,600
 round the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:25,840
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Rachel. My fact is Dame Maura

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,440
 Limpany remains the only castaway on Desert Island Discs to have chosen entirely her

27
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:40,280
 own recordings to be marooned with which I admire. Me too, bold. Straight in. I feel

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,880
 like I should say straight away like in her defence, it was her second appearance on the

29
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,080
 show, her first was 22 years earlier and she didn't want to repeat any of her choices.

30
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
 And there probably hadn't been any music in the audience. That's the problem, back in

31
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,680
 the day there was eight songs so that's yeah, that's a big problem. We should quickly say

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,600
 because our British listeners will obviously know what Desert Island Discs is but not the

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,040
 young ones. Not the young ones possibly, but international people won't know it either.

34
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:18,480
 This is children and foreigners. A new book by Sally Rooney. Yeah, so it's the UK's I

35
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,640
 believe longest running radio show if not it's right up there at the top. It's an interview

36
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,640
 show and the basic premise of it is you bring eight records onto the show, songs you love,

37
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,720
 that means something to you and then at the end you're asked to make a decision. You're

38
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,480
 going to be marooned on the Desert Island. What one song are you going to save while

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,080
 the seven other wash away and you get to bring a book and you get to bring a luxury item

40
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,400
 and it's awesome. It's my favourite radio show. Yeah, and they use that to talk about

41
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,720
 their life and thoughts and everything as well. So it's really like esteemed isn't it

42
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,280
 in British culture. I think it was Dame Elizabeth Schwarzkopf who did a lot of her own recording.

43
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,400
 She was a soprano, but it was only Maureen Limpany who chose entirely. I read that Schwarzkopf

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,040
 picked seven out of eight featured her voice and was Dame Maureen Limpany she was a pianist.

45
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:19,160
 Pianist. Pianist. There's a hinge in Pian. Pianist. To be fair to her Limpany she didn't

46
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,160
 pick songs composed by her. They were Mozart songs and they were Chopin and stuff like that.

47
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,080
 So they were all classical pieces that she was playing on, but then you get people like

48
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:34,320
 Norman Wisdom who is for children and overseas people. He was a comedian, very big in Albania.

49
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,560
 I mean anyone under 80 is going to struggle with Norman Wisdom. What about him? Well he

50
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,440
 chose five of his eight as his own songs, but I think his actual own songs don't laugh

51
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,280
 at me because I'm a fool, stuff like that. Someone who chose three of their own for foreigners

52
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:58,640
 and not for children was Rolf Harris. Oh gosh. Just for the edit. Wow. One weird one was

53
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:06,000
 David Frost who picked David Frost interviews. Not even music. Did he do the next one? Most

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,240
 of them. I'm not sure that he did bizarrely. With those people, I do wonder if was it just

55
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,360
 a matter of having not thoroughly researched what the program is? Well, in the early days

56
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,120
 I think. It's so eminent. These days being invited on a desk is basically, in Britain

57
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,540
 it's kind of a minor gong. It's like getting an MBE or something. I'm sure you guys found

58
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,880
 out that some people have done it twice. That's pretty eminent. That's like double gong. You

59
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,600
 got some people who've done it three times. I need two people as far as I can tell I've

60
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,720
 done it four times. Oh really? Yeah. Do we get to guess who? Have a guess. Someone like

61
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:49,320
 Maggie Smith. Yeah, I would say even more eminent. David Attenborough. Oh wow. And if you guys

62
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,200
 guessed the other one without having read about it already. I was going to try and word

63
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,440
 my way in some way. Wait, I don't know. Is it one of the chuckle brothers? It's Barry

64
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,960
 Chuckle. Yeah, and his luxury was Paul Chuckle, which was nice. Sorry, is it actually bad?

65
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,320
 No, no, no. Don't do that. I believed you. It is a comedian, isn't it, from old? Yeah,

66
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,720
 Arthur Aske. So modern name that cuts a lot of ice today. But like a musical guy, was

67
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:20,120
 he? Yeah, yeah, a really, really famous comedian in the 50s and 40s and 50s. Yeah. The original

68
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,040
 host was a guy called Roy Plombly who invented it. And he invented it during the Second World

69
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,520
 War, actually. It was a sort of wartime commission to cheer people up and it was just clearly

70
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,800
 a good idea. But he was incredibly austere about it. And in fact, he was so controlling

71
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,080
 that the early shows were scripted. So he would script each dialogue in advance and

72
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,040
 then they'd just sit and they'd read the script. And then that was it. And it was largely just

73
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,400
 about the music, wasn't it? It was basically like being Zoe Ball and sort of going, let's

74
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,960
 listen to this next track. It was, you know, they were DJing to an extent. Also, he would

75
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,860
 ask about whether you could survive on a desert island, as in he was incredibly interested

76
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,280
 in it. He would ask like, can you build your own shelter? Can you fish? Can you swim? You

77
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,720
 know, what are you going to do about the sun? It's like it was it was great. Almost purely

78
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
 that feels like that's what it should be. It was really, it was really fun, I think.

79
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,720
 Do you know how he pitched this? So he was like 27, I think, when he pitched this. And

80
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,160
 he came up with it. Did he? He came up with it and he thought that it was going to be

81
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,520
 six episodes and that was it. He thought they paid him quite well. Inside of we. And so

82
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,360
 it was a shock that it lasted for him like 41 years and became this national institution.

83
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,680
 But before that he was he used to pitch shows to the BBC. And one of the shows he pitched

84
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,520
 was called I know what I hate. And it was a it was a show in which guests choose songs

85
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,400
 that they hated. And they would just have them, you know, either, you know, Room 101

86
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,480
 basically, I guess the pre Room 101. Imagine if you got them mixed up and you're Dame

87
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:53,880
 Mara. Your own songs. Has desert island discs ever had a gap or is it just run continuous

88
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,760
 in the early days it had? I think these days they only do 40 a year. Oh, right. Okay.

89
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,600
 There's a few gaps. But there was there was a there was a couple of years of like five

90
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,920
 year gap where it kind of just went off air all together. Yeah. He also did a panel show

91
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,200
 called many a slip, which sounds amazing. So in a typical round, he would read out a piece

92
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,760
 of text and there would be some grammatical error in there. And the panel had to find the

93
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:23,640
 grammatical error. Bring it back. Isn't that amazing? Absolutely love that. I would really

94
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,200
 enjoy being on the panel for that. Yeah. I was reading the early guests like the really

95
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,000
 early sort of the first 10 guests they had. So did you guys read at all about Captain Dingle?

96
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,080
 Sounds great. He was unbelievably interesting. So it's just listed as Explorer, right? Dan is

97
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,960
 very interested by this. Yeah, keep talking. Well, Captain Alewood Edward Dingle was born in 1874.

98
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,720
 And then he was on the show in the mid 40s. So he's pretty old by this point. Yeah. And he was

99
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,120
 uniquely qualified to be on the show. Can you guess why? He was especially good. Because he'd

100
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,200
 lived on a desert island? He had lived on a desert island himself. Or he was a disc.

101
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:07,800
 He was both. He was a uniquely circular guy. No, he had been shipwrecked five times in his life.

102
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,400
 Brilliant. Wow. Oh my God. In 1893. So he was 19. He was in a schooner called the Black Pearl.

103
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,880
 He and his shipmate were going to retrieve gold from a sunken ship, which had sunk 20 years before.

104
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,880
 He was a Black Pearl from Pirates of the Caribbean. It's the same one. Yeah. And so then they got

105
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,440
 shipwrecked. And it was only two of them in this boat. And they spent 11 weeks on a desert island

106
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,440
 eating raw penguin and drinking rain. Wow. There's some good news, which is that while on the island,

107
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:40,600
 they found some other treasure from a different shipwreck. And the two of them got along so

108
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,960
 badly, these two, that they weren't speaking at all. For like a few days in, they were just not

109
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,200
 speaking for days on end. Right. It's kind of understandable, isn't it? Yeah, completely. Yeah.

110
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,480
 This would make such a better episode of desert island discs than how difficult your childhood was.

111
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:03,080
 Bring it back. Bring back exclusively shipwrecked. So who did Dingle's partner do an episode as well

112
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,080
 to sort of counter? Easy balance. I don't know. What a shame. Can I just say one thing about Plomley?

113
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:17,000
 Yeah. His grandfather was called, right, Hey Ho. What? He was called, right, Hey Ho. And his

114
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,440
 surname was Wigg. So his first two names were right, W-R-I-G-H-T. Okay. And his middle name was

115
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,720
 Hey Ho, H-A-Y-H-O-E. What? He was called, right, Hey Ho. Do we know the story? That's amazing.

116
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,920
 It's not one of those Bible things, is it? You know how people were named after just putting it?

117
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,840
 They were just normal names back in the day. Imagine at school, like the teacher goes, right,

118
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:45,880
 Hey Ho. Everybody stop packing up. So good. There's an episode that Dan will be especially

119
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:54,280
 interested in, the Buzz Aldrin episode, which we've never heard. Okay. It was during Sulawli's

120
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,880
 tenure. She's massively respected, obviously. Amazing broadcaster. And she and the production

121
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,080
 team went to Buzz Aldrin's house in California, right? And they were setting up, you know,

122
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,200
 doing all the sort of pre-chat bits. And Buzz Aldrin left the room and never came back.

123
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,240
 I really? Wow. So they didn't make it? Where did you? Did they do it in 1969?

124
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:24,600
 I've just got to quickly do something. And that's why Lawley was second on the moon,

125
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,560
 because she was trying to get the interview. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's amazing.

126
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,200
 Was he pissed off? Or do we know? We don't know anything. He just walked out. Okay.

127
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,280
 I don't know. Someone will know. Someone will know. Buzz will know. Yeah. Let's ask him.

128
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,520
 Let's ask him. I mean, he came on our show in a museum of curiosity. Came all the way over here.

129
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,640
 We didn't even have to go to California. You should have done a reverse Lawley on him.

130
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,080
 You should have. The entire audience leaves.

131
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:57,240
 Alistair McClain, who was a novelist in the 20th century. Like a detective. Yeah,

132
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,040
 thriller, like Where Eagles Dare and Guns of Navarone. I mean, huge author, right?

133
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,800
 And and Plomley was a mega fan. Loved Alistair McClain. Really excited. And he arrived and they

134
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,600
 were doing the pre-interview. You know, they're talking about just talking about what they're

135
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,280
 going to talk about. And as they were doing the pre-interview, Roy Plomley realized he was not

136
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,320
 talking to Alistair McClain, the novelist. He was talking to a guy called Alistair McClain,

137
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,920
 who was the head of the European Tourist Bureau of the Government of Canada.

138
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:31,240
 He must have got the letter. So can you come on the Desert Island disc and thought,

139
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:38,120
 finally, my work has been appreciated. Why have they waited so long? I've got so much to say

140
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,440
 about Canada. That's amazing. Can you guess what we did? I would say, I think you style it out,

141
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,000
 don't you? You have to just say, this is the person we've asked. It's the whole point. I reckon

142
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,920
 he just bezoldrined it and just walked out. Well, he stuck it out. They just recorded it anyway,

143
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,280
 and then didn't broadcast it. Oh, was it just terrible? I have no idea. But I don't think it

144
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,840
 was, I don't think it was broadcast in the end. That's a shame because it is a format that thrives

145
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,560
 on just someone you've never heard of, because the songs allow you in. As a Canadian, this guy

146
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,920
 would probably be quite good at wilderness survival. Yeah, you like some islands in Canada,

147
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,440
 one of the most island. Is it? I think that's absolutely heartbreaking for Alistair McClain,

148
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,240
 the Canadian. Imagine you get the letter and you're so flattered and you're like,

149
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,320
 I knew actually that my life did mean something to people. This really validates everything

150
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,480
 that I've had doubts about, I'll be honest. Years of misery. Being the head of the European

151
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,720
 Torres Bureaus. Am I on the right path? Then you record, you even record it and it goes fine.

152
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,640
 And then it never airs and you inquire why it's never aired. They must have told him

153
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,880
 the tapes were burned in a fire. I hope so. I hope that's what they said. The UK's burnt down,

154
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,720
 unfortunately. And he'll be like, I can come back, I can redo it. And they'll be like,

155
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:04,200
 We're booked up, sorry. It's all 2023, we're booked. I was wondering how many islands there were,

156
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:10,120
 like in the Pacific, for instance, if you put one celebrity on each one, would that

157
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,440
 have run out now? Could you fit everyone who's been on Desert Island discs onto their own

158
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,680
 individual island? I think even just in the Pacific, you would easily be able to do it.

159
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,720
 Wow, amazing. Yeah, but it wouldn't be good for the local flora and fauna.

160
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,520
 Yeah, why not? Well, Desert Islands, usually they have lots of species on because there's no

161
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,440
 humans, there's no cats, there's no rats, there's no, so it's quite good for species. But if you put,

162
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,440
 you know, Barry Chuckle on. The insects will be hurting themselves on the pane of glass. He's

163
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:45,080
 accidentally smashed, carrying. There's a story. Herbert Morrison, who was a politician, he was

164
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,840
 sort of under Clement Attlee in his government. He, when he died, he was found to have his eight

165
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,360
 songs in his wallet waiting. Should he ever be called at moments noticed to suddenly appear

166
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,960
 on Desert Island discs? Yeah, I think quite similarly, I have on purpose learned all of the

167
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,480
 words to trouble by Iggy Azalea, just in case I ever get asked to do a celebrity lip sync.

168
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,200
 No way. Is that with Jennifer Hudson? Yeah, because I know the chorus. I will be your

169
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:22,040
 Jennifer Hudson. That's very good. It's very much the same and equal esteem I think. I have actually

170
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,640
 learned a lot of ice skating moves in case I'm ever invited on, I don't even know the name of the

171
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,880
 show. I've actually been practicing eating kangaroo testicles for the last five years, just in case.

172
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:46,280
 It's a must of mine, a special subject. Kangaroos knackers. Okay, it is time for fact number two,

173
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:53,000
 and that is my fact. My fact this week is that a man called Mike Merrill found making decisions so

174
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,160
 hard that he floated himself as a publicly traded person and for over a decade now has had over

175
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:05,160
 800 people making his decisions for him. Great. Very clever. So this guy, yeah, so this was back

176
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,080
 in I think it was 2007. His career was sort of at a point where he wasn't knowing fully what he was

177
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:18,120
 doing with his life, so he decided to separate himself into 100,000 shares and float himself

178
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,520
 and ask the people who were interested in purchasing these shares at one buck a piece,

179
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,240
 "Would you like to make the decisions for me?" Ironically, that is quite a big decision to make.

180
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:36,600
 It is. And he kept the majority shares, right? Yes. But he made his majority shares

181
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:43,960
 non-voting. Oh, I see. So he didn't have any sway. So no one can own him. Yeah, no one can own him.

182
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,400
 But he doesn't have to make the decisions. That they can rule him. Exactly, they can rule him. But

183
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:53,000
 he throws up the question that he needs deciding. So it's not like they can just say, "We've decided

184
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,880
 this week we want you to dye your hair pink." He has to say, "Should I dye my hair pink?" So he set up

185
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,560
 a website. It's called K-MikeyM. I went to it in the course of doing the research. I tried to buy

186
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,720
 some shares, but none are up at the moment because he's very popular at the moment. He sort of releases

187
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,080
 them in small batches on demand and they fluctuate with the demand. So they could be anything as low

188
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:20,440
 as 99 cents, but they can go all the way up to $18. That shares for you? Yeah. Has anyone made a big

189
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:26,200
 profit on Mike Merrill? Yeah, his brother, who sold when he got to a high point. Yeah, he sold

190
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,720
 all his shares and bought a new dishwasher, I think, or something. He does make the decisions

191
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,120
 about what they vote on, but when he moved in with his girlfriend, he got complaints from the

192
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,720
 shareholders who said, "This is a decision I think you should have consulted us on." This is definitely

193
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,760
 going to affect, you know, life. It affects the value of him, doesn't it? Yeah. If you get married.

194
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,400
 Because someone else is then not making decisions, but helping him make decisions, as in if you're

195
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,800
 living with a partner, you do chat stuff over with them. They might have an influence on you.

196
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,160
 Yeah. Well, the other thing is shares depend on how much he's valued at, right?

197
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:09,560
 And his value is going to change when his life changes. So the amount of money you have changes

198
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,480
 when you get married, it might change for the better or for the worse. But are you saying his

199
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,920
 value would either soar or crater when he moved in with a girlfriend? It's plausible. But it's your

200
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,080
 value on different markets, isn't it? So on the dating market, your value is it sinks when you're

201
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,040
 limited. Does it sink when you go up from supply and demand? You would think it would increase.

202
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,600
 Some people say that. Some people say, "Oh, no one's interested in you," and tell you that you

203
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,840
 move in with a partner, and then suddenly everyone's after you, you know? Is that your experience?

204
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:42,520
 So you're backfired. My experience is total indifference.

205
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:50,520
 You maintained very nicely consistently. Thank you. When this happened, and he had to explain to

206
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,240
 his girlfriend that he had to consult his shareholders, he issued her with a relationship

207
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:02,600
 contract that she had to sign. What? Which sounds bonkers. But I'm reading that this is it is quite

208
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:08,200
 bonkers, but also relationship contracts instead of getting married or before marriage are very

209
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,560
 much on the rise the last few years. Well, cream ups, especially, I think. In the relationship

210
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,920
 contract, do we know any details or is it simply? I don't know the details of that one. I did want

211
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,000
 to tell you, though, about another relationship contract that was in the news recently. So the

212
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,880
 independent reported that Shailene, someone called Shailene, or @salamiqueen on TikTok,

213
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,760
 made headlines because she made her boyfriend sign a relationship contract that said that if he cheated

214
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:39,320
 on her, he had to pay all her bills. Indefinitely. That's the thing I put for how long. I don't know

215
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,760
 what he said. And her comment on it was, I'm so smart or crazy. I don't know.

216
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,040
 That's the salamiqueen. I feel like he wouldn't hold off and cart that, I think.

217
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,800
 He was unconscionable to me. Apparently, it was a legal contract. And yeah, I don't know

218
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,600
 if the contract just said pay her bills with no other parameters.

219
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,280
 You've got to define the terms, haven't you? You've got to define what cheating is, you know.

220
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,560
 Is it casting a flirty glance at someone? In which case, he's going to be

221
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,000
 paying bills pretty quickly. Is it hiding money underneath the boarding monopoly?

222
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,360
 Yes. Is it making a cup of tea quietly? So you don't have to make the other one a cup of tea.

223
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,120
 Is it with sleeping with someone else? We don't know. Something like that. We don't know.

224
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:31,560
 Did you hear about Patrick Campbell? No. So he owned a company called profitwell.com

225
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:39,720
 and he sold it in 2022 for $200 million. And he decided to do a hostile takeover of Mike Merrill.

226
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:47,480
 And he has since bought 15% of Mike's shares. And he reckons, because you can tell how often

227
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,200
 people vote. And usually his shareholders, Mike Merrill shareholders, don't vote. Most of them,

228
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,080
 it's just a joke and they might vote once or twice, but they don't really do it.

229
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,520
 This guy, Patrick Campbell, reckons that with 15%, he has enough power to influence all the

230
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,800
 shareholder votes and he can basically tell him to do what he wants. Wow. That's amazing. That's

231
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,920
 exciting. But he's still got to only tell him to do what has been presented. So Mike can still

232
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,640
 only ask certain questions and it's up to him. But he basically now reckons that he will have

233
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,680
 the deciding vote on any question that he's asked. He reckons Mike's undervalued at the moment.

234
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:27,880
 Well, here's the kind of things that he's probably influencing his decisions on. So he would have

235
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,600
 possibly been part of the decision of whether or not Mike invested in a Rwandan chicken farming

236
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:41,000
 business. That was approved by the shareholders. Grow a winter mustache. That was denied. No

237
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,640
 winter mustache happened. Cold up for Mike. They decided on whether or not Mike believes in ghosts.

238
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:54,040
 He asked, do I believe in ghosts? They voted on whether or not he does. 66% said yes, you do.

239
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,720
 So he does believe in ghosts. I'm sorry. I've been on board with this

240
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,840
 until that makes the whole thing look ridiculous. It does. Yeah, yeah. I found it interesting that

241
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:11,240
 when he made the decision to embark on this, he valued his life at $100,000 and sold shares on

242
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:19,160
 that basis. That was a very low calculation compared to what economists value a life at,

243
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,080
 because they have to calculate this in terms of what the government make decisions on.

244
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,520
 Officially, economists think the average human life in the US is worth about $8.7 million.

245
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,520
 Really? Yeah. Wow. That's a lot. It varies a little bit. I'm rich. So like the Environmental

246
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,760
 Protection Agency uses $7.4 million. Another one uses $9.6 million, but there is a figure on it. How

247
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,200
 does Andy get at this? Yeah, I'm theoretically loaded. I don't know that you can access it,

248
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,280
 but it has a huge... What if he cuts off his leg? Yeah. He's got a worth of $1 million.

249
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:58,600
 On the open market. Wow. But I found it so interesting what this means to us in terms of

250
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:07,880
 rulings in government. So for example, in 1972, the auto industry put a life's worth of $885,000

251
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,880
 in today's dollars. And then two years later, the figure was more or less the same, the Department

252
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:20,520
 of Transportation rejected a regulation to install bars at the rear of trucks to prevent passenger

253
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,640
 vehicles from sliding underneath them. So a safety measure for trucks was rejected because they did

254
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:31,080
 the maths on it, and it wasn't cost effective because the lives that it would save weren't worth

255
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,000
 it for the price that it would cost to install them. Which is bleak, isn't it? It's like it would

256
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,440
 save so many thousands of lives, but they weren't worth enough for them to do it. I guess there's

257
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:49,400
 got to be some kind of calculation. Is it like... Sorry, sorry, sorry. You're making decisions

258
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,040
 about a limited amount of resources, all your income as a country, and you're trying to maximise

259
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:02,440
 the human life. Yeah, we all agree I'd rant. But is it like if you're mountaineering and you

260
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,080
 know, you get lost and the government are like, well, he's actually already had $3 million because

261
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,360
 you know, we put him up in hospital that time. Oh, if you're in one ravine and in the next

262
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,440
 ravine, there's a lot of Bitcoin. It makes more sense for the government to go for the Bitcoin.

263
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,360
 Yeah, yeah. Depending on how Bitcoin's doing, you know, it's very variable. Yeah, well,

264
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:28,600
 food's a thought. I mean, food's big food's a thought. You know, the calculation was actually,

265
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,280
 there's a bit more to it, the 100K. So it wasn't that he thought that was his full life that was

266
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,720
 worth that amount. He calculated based on the fact that he had a day job and that this decision

267
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,120
 making was only going to apply to his free time. So 100K is based on his nights and his weekends.

268
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,360
 So yeah, there's still, if you round him up, it's still low. It's still, he'd be about a mil,

269
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,280
 just under a mil maybe, I guess, for the rest of the, well, there's bleed between your, you can't

270
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,640
 separate those perfectly. As in, if you grow a moustache, that will affect your job. Yeah.

271
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,440
 Depending on what you do for a living. If you believe in ghosts. Exactly. It's a 24/7

272
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,200
 activity. It works in a creepy old house. This is true. Yeah. I think it's harder to make decisions

273
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,200
 everywhere, for everybody at the moment, because there's the thing about how many more decisions

274
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,280
 you have to make. So there's an economist called Eric Beinhacher. I think he was very

275
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,480
 eminent and famous and he wrote a book. It was a huge sellout about this kind of thing. And he

276
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,600
 had estimated that between 10,000 years ago and the modern day, human choices had multiplied

277
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:35,240
 a hundred million fold. Wow. Oh my God. I have five or six different eye creams in my bedside table.

278
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,240
 Okay. And every night, I choose one of those five or six eye creams. Based on mood. Yeah,

279
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,920
 based on mood. Right. Based on vibe. And I sort of enjoy that process. Yeah.

280
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:53,720
 That's just one of the many examples. I've walked 40 minutes near the office wondering

281
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,120
 what to have for lunch. Yeah. And I've gone into four places and not had lunch in any of them.

282
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,000
 Back in the day, Andy, you would have been walking around the jungle going,

283
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:08,440
 "Shall I kill that buffalo or shall I go after that?" Exactly. That lemon. Probably take the

284
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:14,120
 lemon. Yeah. Returning it when it doesn't taste as good. It's a bit of a habit of Andy's. Right.

285
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,840
 Sorry. Remember the time you returned that sausage? I once.

286
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,920
 One time. I once went back to a local restaurant. And it wasn't because it didn't taste good. It

287
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:29,000
 tasted great. Was it a single sausage? Well, yeah. And I was 11 pounds down on the transaction.

288
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,880
 A single sausage. I ask you. You must have the picture of you on the door when you walk in,

289
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,120
 so do not allow this man to return his sausage. They gave me another sausage in the end. But

290
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,480
 by that point, the whole transaction was so spoiled, you know. Yeah. I wasn't able to enjoy

291
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:47,000
 either of the two sausages I ended up taking away. Yeah. I like that you're holding a fork

292
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,080
 with a sausage on the end. You're walking around the restaurant trying to find the manager.

293
00:26:52,600 --> 00:27:00,920
 Tutting. Well, it was a takeaway. So I actually had to go back in. So you take the box on trust,

294
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,040
 don't you? I'm sure this is a nice dish. You take it away. You open it up. I think this is

295
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,680
 ridiculous. Was it a hot dog? Painful. No, it was just a sausage. Rachel, it was a sausage.

296
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:14,920
 Why did you buy a sausage to take away? I don't understand the meal. It was a sausage and rice.

297
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,440
 It was so depressed. But it was a very nicely spiced sausage. But it was still ridiculous.

298
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,640
 What was wrong with it? It was too small. It was two, it was 11 quid. One small sausage for 11

299
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,480
 quid. This was about five years ago, I should say. This was before the cost of living crisis. This was,

300
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,880
 you know, at the time sausages were going for like two quid. You know, this is ridiculous. Yeah.

301
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,320
 This is ridiculous. So you didn't think you were getting your money's worth? I didn't. And I went

302
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,880
 back and I remonstrated for quite some time. But you stay, I mean, we had a good 20 minute chat

303
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,840
 here where you were deciding whether or not and building the fury. I mean, this is not

304
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,400
 me remembering a random thing. This was a big incident. This was sausage gate in this office.

305
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:59,320
 I've just got a couple of things on decision making. One of the great ways of deciding is just

306
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,560
 coin flipping. So many things in history have been decided from just getting a flip of a coin.

307
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:09,240
 So, you know, the company Packard Hewlett. Packard. That's right. Because he won the

308
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,240
 Toinkos and that's why he got named that. It could have been the other way around. We could have

309
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,360
 had Packard Hewlett. Did you say the Toinkos? Yeah, that's well, and that could have been cool.

310
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,440
 That was a coin toss that won that way around as well. We wrote that out with a computer, didn't

311
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:29,480
 they? Yeah. So we've got Hewlett Packard off the back of that. Portland, we've all heard of Portland,

312
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,680
 the city in America. Yeah. That was meant to be called Boston, but they lost the Toinkos.

313
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:40,120
 The Toinkos? We don't keep saying it. Should we call it a Toinkos?

314
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:47,560
 Great. Yeah. So that should have been called Boston. Wait, they were trying to call themselves,

315
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,000
 but what did Boston have to say? I don't think Boston was called Boston at that point.

316
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,400
 Oh, okay. I'm guessing. Oh, James thinks it is.

317
00:28:53,400 --> 00:29:01,400
 Why would they have called it Boston then? Just another Boston. Okay, right. Yeah.

318
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,400
 Yeah. The Wright brothers as well. So Wilbur Wright. We're going to be called the wrong brothers.

319
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,600
 Should we go in the air or should we go underground?

320
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:23,240
 So Wilbur became the first person ever to fly a plane because of a Toinkos.

321
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:33,000
 And, but this was an unfortunate one because Wilbur's first flight didn't go. It didn't work.

322
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,480
 So the second flight then went to Orville, who then became the first person to fly a plane.

323
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,920
 So sometimes it can go against you. Yeah. And that's why the duck was called Orville and not Wilbur.

324
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:50,600
 Was it? No. No. He famously couldn't fly Horville the duck. I wish I could fly way up in the sky,

325
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:57,000
 but I can't. You can. I would, I'd like to pick that Lauren as my desert island.

326
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,600
 Thank you very much. That one's going out for the children and the foreigners.

327
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:12,440
 Okay. It is time for fact number three and that is James. Okay. My fact this week is that according

328
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:18,840
 to a survey of pubs in 1930, the average time someone in Bolton took to drink a pint of beer

329
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:28,600
 was 52 minutes. In Liverpool, it was 22 minutes. 52 is a long time. 22 is quite speedy. I'm in the

330
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:34,520
 like 10 to 15 mark, I reckon. Well, on average, like if you have five pints in a night, it slows

331
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:41,240
 down, doesn't it? Yeah. Okay. So I read this in a book called Darts in England, 1900 to 1939,

332
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,280
 a social history by Patrick Chaplin, which I've mentioned before, which is an amazing book,

333
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,160
 which is mostly about darts. And he really does talk about darts quite a lot in this context as

334
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:58,520
 well, because it was related to a thing called mass observation, which was, it was this thing in

335
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,960
 Britain where they got a panel of observers and they made a diary about what was happening in

336
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,520
 their day to day life. And the idea is they do it over time and in different places. And it would

337
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,240
 give an idea of what was happening in the country. But anyway, there was this thing in Liverpool

338
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:19,720
 that they banned darts and actually any pub games. And they thought it was encouraging people to go

339
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,640
 into pubs. And so they wouldn't let you do it. In fact, Liverpool was the only city in the country

340
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,680
 where no one played darts in pubs. But what happened was it had the opposite effect. Because

341
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,800
 you couldn't play darts or pool or dominoes or whatever, you had no distractions. You just drank

342
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,640
 more because you didn't have anything, you know, if you're playing darts, you have to go and collect

343
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,560
 the darts and come back and stuff. And it's, and you're not drinking. Whereas in Liverpool,

344
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,360
 they would just get in drunk. Then eventually they brought sports back into pubs in Liverpool.

345
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,000
 Is that, is that why? Yeah, because in Bolton was famously at the time, a lot of people played

346
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,040
 darts and played pool and stuff and still do. That's really interesting. This is weird, because I

347
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:02,040
 was separately reading about pubs in Bolton. And but I got a fact from the mass observation study.

348
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:07,880
 Oh, really? Yeah. So it was in this one was in 1937 and 38. I don't know whether is that about the

349
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:14,280
 right time? Yeah, 30s. So and yeah, as James says, massive survey of people. But I think they didn't

350
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:19,480
 have many people who were from Bolton doing the studying. So what they did was they got a lot of

351
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:27,000
 middle and upper class Southerners who dressed as northerners and put on accents and went incognito

352
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,040
 in pubs in Bolton and just drank and and you reckon they got away with that because I'm from

353
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:39,080
 Bolton. I just wonder what it was like. What were they doing? They were observing for the mass.

354
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:44,200
 I think observing in people's behaviour in pubs and recording and you know what was said. So I

355
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,880
 just a couple of nice details from this study. One observer who was EL in the notes was rendered

356
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:56,040
 incapable of doing any observation after drinking eight pints in an hour and 45 minutes. They got

357
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,200
 into a lot of fights. It was all kind of glossed over. I think it was a pretty inglorious. I mean,

358
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,560
 if you're a middle class or upper class person from the south going to the north dressed as a

359
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:11,000
 northerner and doing a fake northern accent, you're going to get in fights. I'm sorry. And they also

360
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,360
 had a covert photographer in the corner. Dressed as a whip. Taking secret pictures, I guess, of the

361
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:27,640
 fights as they broke out. Do you want some pub slang? Sure. A quiz. Pint hole. My mouth. It's not

362
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:35,000
 the mouth. Oh, dear. How are people drinking pints? We need a funnel. Pint hole. Is it like

363
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,880
 the cellar where you go and get the beer from? This is actually the least good answer of the three

364
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:48,360
 that I've got. It's just the public bar. Oh. All right. A wobble shop. Wobble shop. Wobbling like,

365
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:53,880
 you know, unsteady because you're drunk. It's just another word for a pub again. It's an unlicensed

366
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:01,080
 pub. Apparently. He's down the wobble shop. Do we get unlicensed pubs? Well, they're not loud,

367
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:09,080
 but it's quite bold to be calling yourself a pub. This one's hard, but it's good. You're an

368
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:16,040
 admiral of the narrow seas. Okay. Does it just mean drunk? It is something you do when you're

369
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,480
 drunk. You sway like you're on a boat. Very nice. No. Buy some stuff off eBay that you really shouldn't

370
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,560
 buy. That's it. That's it. No, it's drunkenly throwing up into someone else's lap. Oh. All right,

371
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:34,920
 but I'm an admiral of the narrow seas. It's okay. I'm qualified. Take it up with the Navy.

372
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:41,800
 Come on, Captain Dingle. Let's get out of here. There's a pub in Bolton called the Old Madden

373
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,720
 Seyve. We talked about Bolton before. It's possibly the oldest pub in the country. It's

374
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:51,080
 certainly in the top 10. And there's a mention of its name from 1251. So we know it's at least

375
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,920
 that old, but it's where the Earl of Derby was executed in 1651 for his part in the Bolton

376
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,480
 Massacre. This was during one of the Civil Wars. And there's a chair there. It was the last chair

377
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,440
 he sat in before he was beheaded at the Earl of Derby. At the pub? It's in the pub. Yeah, it's

378
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:14,840
 quite very famous in Bolton this. And they have 53 ghosts in this pub apparently, including a ghost

379
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,240
 dog that's known to lick the manager's feet when he lets them hang out of the bed in the middle

380
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:24,760
 of the night. Well, Mike Merrill, if you're listening, you need to get there ASAP. But that's

381
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,120
 a lot of ghosts for one pub. It's an old pub though. It's from 1251. So, you know. Yeah.

382
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:36,520
 Because as I was looking into, there's usually the most haunted everything in Britain. And I

383
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:43,080
 couldn't find pub. And then the ones that I read, they had like four ghosts. So that's huge. I would

384
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,840
 imagine with pubs, unlike houses or hotels or anything, because you don't stay there overnight.

385
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,240
 It's a lot less spooky, isn't it? Because you can just leave. Do you know what I mean? Like,

386
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,240
 it's such a fleet that you go to the pub for a few hours, but then you go home and also it's like

387
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,400
 busy and social. So, I don't know, it's got a lot less spooky. But most pubs outside cities would

388
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,880
 have rooms, wouldn't they? And you know, there are taverns, you know, Jamaica Inn, that kind of

389
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,320
 vine, you know, spooky old pub up on the moors. And you know, there's dark business going on there.

390
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:19,160
 That's based on Jamaica Inn. Yeah. I accidentally backed into someone's car. Wow. You were the real

391
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:25,080
 pirate. I know. Well, I went into the bar and told them that I did it. There was no problem. But

392
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,000
 yeah, I've been there. And also I've been to what I think is the most haunted or they say it was the

393
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,920
 most haunted, which is the mermaid and rye, which yeah, has got a billion ghosts. What, rye and

394
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,480
 Sussex? Yeah, or Kent. It's on the coast. Yeah. Rye's in Sussex. Yeah. Yeah. Rye is a lovely town.

395
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,040
 It is very nice. The mermaid's a lovely pub. You've been to quite a few supposedly haunted

396
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,080
 places. Yeah, I'm a big fan of them. Maybe. I don't believe in any of them. Maybe you're a ghost.

397
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:58,040
 That's spooky. Maybe you're Hailey Joel Osmond. I don't know. Grown up. It's six cents.

398
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:04,840
 Oh, it's the kids. Sorry, right. I was watching clips from the six cents the other day and that

399
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,560
 that joke still went over my head. Sorry. No, no, I love it. Thanks for calling it a joke though.

400
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:17,400
 I was just looking into drinking beer fast, which is related to what you're talking about.

401
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:27,080
 So before we get to beer, the fastest drinker of a fizzy drink certainly is a guy called Eric

402
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:34,520
 Badlands Booker. Such a sexy, outlawish name. There's obviously just drink fizzy drinks first.

403
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:41,320
 He drank a liter of Mountain Dew, the American fizzy drink, from a measuring cup in 6.8 seconds.

404
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:48,280
 And previously, his record was drinking two liters in 18 seconds. That was just last year.

405
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:55,960
 But I came across this guy who is a British man called Peter Dowdswell. And he has not only got

406
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:05,480
 the record for drinking a pint of beer the quickest, but he's got records in so many food and drink

407
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:15,400
 speed competitions. So he had to retire a few years ago when he suffered back and shoulder

408
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:24,200
 injuries as he tried to sink a pint while being held upside down. He was 71. 71? Yeah. Oh my god.

409
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,400
 He was dropped twice by the men who were employed to hold his drinks.

410
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,360
 Who was holding them?

411
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:35,800
 Yeah, that's amazing. So he holds like all, he's gone through, he's really like belt and braces.

412
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:43,880
 He holds the records for drinking ale, beer, coke, champagne, milk, and milk upside down.

413
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:51,320
 And he holds records for eating quickly, raw eggs, cocktail sausages, pies soaked in Worcester

414
00:38:51,320 --> 00:39:00,440
 sauce, sushi, Weeter Bix, sausages upside down. And my favourite, eating quickly, sausages on

415
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:08,920
 John Evans's head. Do we know John Evans's? No, I don't know. I think we're meant to know.

416
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,560
 Right. Actually, I am impressed by that because it's hard. I would imagine to eat a sausage off

417
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,680
 someone's head because heads are not plate shaped. Oh, you see in my head, he was sat on the guy's head.

418
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,760
 I thought he was sat on. I think you're right. I think you're right. Yeah. I don't, sorry,

419
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,040
 you're correct. I'm sure you're right. Yeah, Evans is probably not a plate.

420
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,560
 I think either could be possible. Yeah. I don't know. Do you know that the, I was reading about

421
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:38,040
 pub quizzes and that when they existed, when they first came about. And if you look at the

422
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,440
 internet, it says that they came about in the 1970s, but I found in the newspaper archives,

423
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:48,040
 there was definitely one happening in 1954, in Neath in Wales. So we reckon around just

424
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:55,960
 after World War II. But probably they didn't exist in 1947, because I found an article about a pub

425
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:02,680
 quiz in Sunderland. And this was, they advertised it as the pub quiz. And what it was is young

426
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,080
 people could go to a pub and ask a panel of married people about the intricacies of sex.

427
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,440
 And that was called, it was called a pub quiz. That's amazing. Isn't that amazing?

428
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,920
 Quizzing someone asking that question. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, I could do with that.

429
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,680
 Is that still a thing? I think any good pub quiz master will be able to answer some of your

430
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,960
 questions. Not all of them. I didn't have to do it between the rounds as well.

431
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:32,120
 But yeah. And I think it's like World War II just finished. They're trying to get the population

432
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:37,240
 up, you know, young married couples got questions. So they, God.

433
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,480
 She just finished the music round. Any questions? Dan sticks her hands up. Yeah.

434
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:50,760
 It's foreplay stuff. Is sexual or optional? I wonder what the questions were that were asked.

435
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,280
 I didn't say it was just like, this is a thing that's happened. Wow. That would be,

436
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,880
 that would be great if you could ask married people what, what it's like. Well, can you remember

437
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:10,600
 what it was like? I think I remember a question when my mum told me about sex when I was, I don't

438
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:18,840
 know what age, like, I think I was nine or something. I think I remember. So she described it to me.

439
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:25,560
 And I think I remember asking how, how do you both move at the same time?

440
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,720
 Which I still think is quite a valid question. You know, I don't know, I've never had sex, but

441
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:39,000
 the answer ultimately, of course, you know, you just sort of, just sort of works most of the time.

442
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,800
 It just kind of happens. Yeah. I've just, I, did you, the very first time say to someone,

443
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,080
 hey, don't worry, I know what you're thinking, but I've got it covered. I spoke to mum, she explained it.

444
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,760
 It will work. It's a to me to use situation. The Chuckle Brothers were the greatest lovers

445
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:11,000
 in history. Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is Andy. My fact is,

446
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,120
 when he was approached for the role, the first actor to play Mr. Blobby was simultaneously

447
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:24,600
 appearing in Shakespeare's measure for measure. I just imagine him turning up in the wrong outfit.

448
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:30,200
 I wish I knew any quotes from measures for measures.

449
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:36,440
 When you're playing the Duke of Venice. So this is about Mr. Blobby. And I think for international

450
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,920
 lessons, we should just quickly say our children. Mr. Blobby is kind of like one of the national

451
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:52,120
 animals of England, I would say. He's a, he's a big pink object, humanoid creature, pink and yellow.

452
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,680
 He's seven feet tall. He wears a bow tie and he screams blobby, blobby, blobby. And he wears a

453
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,160
 big inflatable suit and he just turns up on TV and causes mayhem. And I think he, Mr. Blobby

454
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,520
 doesn't wear a big inflatable suit. Mr. Blobby is the inflatable suit. It's not like inside Mr. Blobby,

455
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,000
 there's a smaller blobby. No, inside there's a man who it turns out is classically trained.

456
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,040
 Inside there's just a very big heart. Thank you.

457
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,640
 So basically, Mr. Blobby's been having a bit of a moment because he was really big in the 90s.

458
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:27,000
 And he was on a thing called Noel's House Party, hosted by Noel Evans. And he's been sort of back

459
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,360
 in the news recently, just there's been a few sightings of him and there's been a costume put

460
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,280
 up on sale and all this. And I was reading this piece in the news statement, "Beautiful piece" by

461
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:40,440
 Stuart Mccony, all about Mr. Blobby. And I just wanted to read you this line because it's, I think

462
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,360
 maybe the most beautiful thing that's ever been written about Mr. Blobby. "Malice and stupidity

463
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:49,880
 were never far from Blobby's puce bulbous surface. There was surely something of Antonin Artode's

464
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,760
 Theatre of Cruelty in Blobby's defiantly senseless nihilistic interventions."

465
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,600
 He's such a great writer.

466
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,800
 He's great. And so he basically, he would just cause absolute mayhem and break things and,

467
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,840
 you know, sit on people and throw them, get in fights.

468
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,800
 Yeah. What was the name of this guy who, who played him?

469
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,240
 He was called Barry Killaby.

470
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,800
 Barry Killaby. And he's gone off and done other things. He's done bits of acting.

471
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,160
 He was in "Chucklevision," for instance, with the Chucklebrothers on stage.

472
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:24,680
 And just before COVID, he put on a one-man theatre show about the final days of Harry Houdini.

473
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:31,400
 Again, not in the Blobby costume. He was just doing that. But he has come back and he is doing

474
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,760
 the Blobby from time to time. He still goes into the Blobby suit. The reason being that actually

475
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,600
 is a lot of acting is, you know, it's a difficult thing to do to get the point across when you're

476
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:47,080
 in a massive suit. But recently he was on "This Morning" on ITV. And he was punched in the stomach

477
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:53,480
 by Maggie Philbin. And the article said that he let out a piercing scream and fell down like a sack

478
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:59,480
 of spunts. Now, what I find interesting about that is that Barry had just done a play about Harry

479
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,560
 Houdini. How did Harry Houdini die?

480
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,600
 He was punched in the stomach.

481
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,800
 He was punched in the stomach.

482
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,760
 Oh, yes.

483
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,800
 Barry must have thought it was the end of his days, wasn't it?

484
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,280
 So it's happening again.

485
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,240
 Does Blobby have an appendix? Which I think Houdini had a plendositis and that's...

486
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,680
 We don't know about Blobby's organs. We don't know about the organ structure of a Blobby.

487
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,520
 No, we don't. No, that's very exciting.

488
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,200
 That's really... Oh, God, what a spot.

489
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:27,000
 That's interesting. What your mind does because I definitely thought that Houdini died

490
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,240
 from getting trapped in one of his boxes with chains wrapped it. And that's obviously something

491
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,480
 I've just invented in my head from films or something.

492
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,920
 Yeah, no. It would be a good dramatic irony.

493
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,120
 Yeah.

494
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:41,400
 Barry was just... Well, we're talking about his sort of other life outside of Mr. Blobby.

495
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,680
 So he was married once and then he and his wife broke up

496
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,200
 and then he got together with someone else. And do you know who it was?

497
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:50,840
 Miss Blobby?

498
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,720
 It was Mr. Blobby.

499
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,240
 No.

500
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,560
 Yeah, not Mrs. Blobby. Mr. Blobby.

501
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,920
 So he was split from his wife and he was invited down to the

502
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,480
 staging of the Crinkley Bottom Castle show. So Crinkley Bottom is where Noel's House Party

503
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,680
 took place. It's where it kind of...

504
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,400
 It's a fictional village.

505
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,160
 ...fictional village and they opened up a theme park. They did three in total,

506
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,960
 which were basically Mr. Blobby theme parks.

507
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,160
 And part of it was that obviously Mr. Blobby's a character there.

508
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:24,280
 So Barry got invited down to teach all the aspiring Blobby's how to move inside the suit.

509
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,480
 And one of the people, one of the Blobby apprentices was this woman who he then got

510
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,280
 on with and they ended up getting together and moving in with each other.

511
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,840
 So yeah, he's with another Blobby.

512
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,720
 Incredible.

513
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,160
 Yeah, just she's stuck it out.

514
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,920
 Blobby, I mean I want to know so much about the story.

515
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,520
 I want to know what Blobby Academy was like.

516
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,040
 I want to see a boot camp montage of Blobby's school.

517
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,640
 And then I want to see the moment where she takes off the Blobby head

518
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,600
 and he realises, oh my god, you're the love of my life.

519
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,240
 And they lean into kiss but they can't quite make it.

520
00:46:53,240 --> 00:47:02,120
 I looked at other trained actors in costumes like that.

521
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:09,640
 So Teletubbies, Simon Shelton played Tinky Winky and he was a trained ballet dancer

522
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,520
 and choreographer.

523
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,960
 I mean many of them, you know, they're just classically trained, you know,

524
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,240
 actors and often, often dancers because of the movement.

525
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,920
 And I don't know if I think we've all got, we've all got boys, haven't we, little boys?

526
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,720
 I've got a girl.

527
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,440
 Oh, you've got a girl?

528
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:24,920
 Oh yeah.

529
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,480
 But does anyone actually delete all of this because it's completely relevant to what I'm about to say?

530
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,120
 But in The Night Garden.

531
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:32,920
 Oh yeah.

532
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,600
 So that's my dog's favourite show.

533
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:34,920
 Yes.

534
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,800
 Yeah, my boys love it.

535
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,840
 It's Billy's favourite show.

536
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:43,400
 Iggle Pigle is played by Nick Kellington who also starred in two of the recent Star Wars films

537
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,520
 and The Dark Crystal.

538
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,880
 Whoa, is that right?

539
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,920
 It's quite a range.

540
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,880
 Wow.

541
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,040
 I read the other day that Little Monster from Justin's house, while we're on there,

542
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:57,320
 was also in Jurassic Park, like one of the new Jurassic Parks.

543
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,120
 Okay, right.

544
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,840
 A dinosaur.

545
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,240
 Oh.

546
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,720
 No, so Little Monster's like a little Muppet thing.

547
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:06,200
 But it's the person whose hand is up, Little Monster was also on the dinosaur.

548
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,880
 Wait, so were you watching Jurassic Park and some random guy goes,

549
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,720
 "Could I get the," and you're like, "I know that hand."

550
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,640
 That's brilliant.

551
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,200
 Didn't Barney the Dinosaur, he went on to become a Tantric sex instructor?

552
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,880
 The guy who played the witch.

553
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,760
 There was some controversy wasn't there with Barney the Dinosaur.

554
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,560
 Was that what it was?

555
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,440
 I think that's what he did.

556
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,920
 That's so interesting because there was a New York Times article about Mr. Blobby in the 90s

557
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,320
 saying, "What the hell is this thing in the UK?"

558
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,200
 And they compared him.

559
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,160
 They were saying he's basically Britain's Barney.

560
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,640
 Yes, he's very similar except with chaos because Barney's a very measured safety,

561
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,680
 health and safety guy.

562
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,240
 I was reading a piece comparing the two.

563
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,200
 The Fence magazine, which is a brilliant magazine, it said,

564
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,000
 "Blobby was a dark mirror to Barney the Dinosaur."

565
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:59,400
 And a later blobby called Paul Denson said he was a reaction to that, to Barney the Dinosaur,

566
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,880
 to say, "What would England have if it was shite?"

567
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,400
 And that's what Mr. Blobby is.

568
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,600
 That's so funny.

569
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,160
 He was created by a man called Michael Lego.

570
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,360
 What?

571
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,200
 Yeah, and I just like that.

572
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,920
 Yeah, just in keeping with kids, he was called Mr. Lego.

573
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,480
 Oh, yeah.

574
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,720
 Can I just say one more thing about In the Night Garden?

575
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,280
 Yeah.

576
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,800
 It's worth just mentioning while we're on this topic that obviously the narrator

577
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:27,400
 of In the Night Garden is National Treasure multi-award-winning Sir Derek Jacobi.

578
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,680
 Yes, that's right.

579
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:35,080
 So you've got this, you know, absolutely hugely famous, fantastic actor going,

580
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,520
 "Maka paka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka.

581
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,720
 "My name is Eagle Piggle."

582
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,000
 Is that a pip?

583
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,840
 I said it all the time.

584
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,200
 But they're all like that, aren't they?

585
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,960
 It's like, who does the Klangas?

586
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,160
 It's someone really famous.

587
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:49,880
 What's up, it's Olivier.

588
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,720
 Late Olivier.

589
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,520
 What was that?

590
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

591
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,520
 And Blobby.

592
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,080
 Oh yeah.

593
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,200
 I can't go again.

594
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,480
 Please, Mr.

595
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,600
 Sorry, I'm so sorry.

596
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,120
 How familiar are you with him?

597
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,880
 I'm not, I'd love to meet Blobby.

598
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,640
 It's kind of hard to overach how much a big thing Blobby was in the 90s in Brexit.

599
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,120
 So was he?

600
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:10,920
 So I wasn't here, was he?

601
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,320
 Huge.

602
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:11,800
 Yeah, right.

603
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,360
 Huge.

604
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:12,840
 Oddly.

605
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,320
 Huge.

606
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:13,960
 Okay.

607
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,720
 Let's, Dan, you want some stats?

608
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,040
 Yeah.

609
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,600
 His Christmas single in 1993.

610
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,040
 Sold 600,000 copies.

611
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,040
 Which is pretty good.

612
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:22,440
 Thank you.

613
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,560
 Got the Christmas number one.

614
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:23,800
 Yeah.

615
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,640
 Nearly didn't.

616
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,880
 Was knocked off the top spot by Take That the week before

617
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,760
 and then reclaimed it the following week to get the Christmas number one.

618
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:36,600
 Merch included lemonade, bubble bath, knitting patterns, pasta, lampshades.

619
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,560
 I mean, anything you could imagine had Blobby put on it.

620
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,280
 One of the businessmen evolved so that they'd done some research in the 90s

621
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,920
 and found that every household in the country owed at least one piece of Blobby merchandise.

622
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,400
 Wow.

623
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,920
 That must have been on average.

624
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,640
 Because we didn't have any growing up.

625
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,560
 No, I had two.

626
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,280
 Exactly. There we go.

627
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:54,680
 There we go.

628
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,000
 It worked.

629
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,560
 The system worked.

630
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,680
 Rachel, how many did you have?

631
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:56,680
 None.

632
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,480
 Oh, okay.

633
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,040
 Okay.

634
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,840
 Anna will have had two.

635
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,320
 Yeah.

636
00:50:59,320 --> 00:50:59,880
 Yeah, yeah.

637
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,520
 Knowing Anna.

638
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:00,520
 Yeah.

639
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,600
 I was trying to look into, I'm sure everyone else did,

640
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,960
 other similarities between Shakespeare and Mr. Blobby.

641
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,560
 What a great idea.

642
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,720
 And I couldn't find many.

643
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,680
 I found a couple.

644
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,480
 One is that, one thing they share is that,

645
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,760
 so this theme park stuff I was talking about,

646
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,640
 there was an abandoned place of one of them.

647
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,080
 And one of the houses there that survived was called Dun Blobben House,

648
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,480
 which is what, is that where he lived?

649
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,360
 Dun Blobben House?

650
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,680
 Blobby, if he had a house.

651
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,560
 Well, this was his house in the place.

652
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,480
 And so they left it and it was abandoned.

653
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,240
 And so what would happen is, is that ravers would come and have parties all night long in it

654
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,080
 and they would just use it as an abandoned party house basically.

655
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:47,720
 And so the local guy who owned the area was so pissed off that people kept coming

656
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:52,280
 that he smashed it down, not dissimilar to Shakespeare's home.

657
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:52,680
 You know.

658
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,560
 Do you remember Shakespeare's house?

659
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,520
 Is that the link?

660
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:54,920
 Yeah.

661
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,680
 I thought your link was at Dun Blobben's house,

662
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,280
 but like Dun Senane, maybe?

663
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,480
 Oh yeah, yeah.

664
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,160
 No, so where Shakespeare's house was, there was the owner of it,

665
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,920
 was so sick of tourists coming and taking photos and messing about that he just knocked it down.

666
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,160
 What?

667
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,920
 And so we lost Shakespeare's, yeah.

668
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,000
 A place, so there's one similarity.

669
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,280
 Well, second similarity.

670
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,560
 Oh, sorry, I didn't realize you had one.

671
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,680
 I worked really hard, Andy, to find this, so I'll just quickly get this on.

672
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,960
 So the 1993 Christmas single that you were mentioning,

673
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,640
 in which there's a very famous video that goes along with it,

674
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,080
 it was a parody video.

675
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:30,200
 And there's a parody video, it's the link, by Shakespeare's sister, The Bear.

676
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,200
 They parodied that.

677
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,360
 So there's your second Shakespeare connection.

678
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,000
 You got them, everyone.

679
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,560
 All right, amazing.

680
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,760
 It's almost too close, actually.

681
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,600
 It's eerie.

682
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,200
 I was thinking of links, and I didn't put in as much work as Dan.

683
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,320
 No.

684
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,520
 How could I?

685
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,360
 But I was just thinking measure for measure,

686
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,480
 which Barry Kiloby was stirring it, is a problem play.

687
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,640
 As in, there are these three categories of Shakespeare plays,

688
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,680
 the tragedies, the histories, the comedies, and you know, they're all clear.

689
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,080
 And then there's this fourth quasi category,

690
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,600
 which is called the problem plays.

691
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,960
 And it's basically, they don't obey any of the rules of any of it.

692
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,080
 So measure for measure is kind of, it has comedy elements,

693
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,040
 but there's also a really serious death penalty plot line.

694
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,040
 So it's a problem that you can't put it into a category,

695
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,520
 is that the problem?

696
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,080
 Yeah, it's just, it's more problematic for scholars studying it.

697
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,080
 It's kind of one of these weird, and lots of the later plays are more problem play-ish.

698
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,680
 I think people say the tempest is one as well.

699
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,920
 And I, in a way, blobby.

700
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,280
 Oh, Jesus.

701
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,920
 Well, he doesn't catch the late comedy and tragedy, I would say.

702
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,040
 Exactly, exactly.

703
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,720
 He is comic and tragic at the same time.

704
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,920
 He puzzles scholars.

705
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,440
 Exactly.

706
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,280
 So I think that's watertight.

707
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,600
 I've got a link between blobby and Dickens.

708
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,920
 Oh my God, wow, expanding.

709
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,840
 Well, this is cool, because actually, like,

710
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,000
 the thing about Noel's House Party is,

711
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,080
 they were just looking for something for Noel Edmonds to do.

712
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,040
 So they gave him 18 different shows that he might possibly do,

713
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,960
 and they chose this one because it was the best one.

714
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,560
 But they had complete autonomy, so they could do what they wanted.

715
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,640
 And they didn't have a commissioner telling them what to do.

716
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,080
 They didn't have someone at the BBC saying,

717
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,520
 "You can do this or you can't do this."

718
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,200
 They could do whatever they want.

719
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,120
 And quite often when you find that in TV,

720
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,840
 it's like people take a lot of care about things,

721
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,240
 and there's lots of, like, hidden jokes and stuff.

722
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,840
 And apparently there's a bookcase,

723
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,000
 or there was a bookcase on the side of the set,

724
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,160
 that you never saw.

725
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,520
 You couldn't read any of the books,

726
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,000
 but all the books had got blobby titles.

727
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,480
 Oh, cool.

728
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,680
 And so there was, like, blob finger instead of gold finger.

729
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,640
 Oh, I love it.

730
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,560
 And Martin Blubblewit.

731
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,560
 That's one of the books.

732
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,000
 That's brilliant.

733
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,320
 Yeah.

734
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,160
 But didn't Dickens have a fake bookcase in his house?

735
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:29,560
 He did.

736
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:29,960
 He did.

737
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,280
 He did.

738
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,520
 He had a bookcase in his house which had fake book titles,

739
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,720
 and it was hiding the door to another room or a panel or something,

740
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,560
 but it was, or it was above a doorway.

741
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,120
 And so both blobby and Charles Dickens had the same idea.

742
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:40,680
 Amazing.

743
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,640
 Wow.

744
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,520
 Blobby is basically a literary great, is what we're saying.

745
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:44,680
 Yes.

746
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,160
 Yeah.

747
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:45,640
 Yeah.

748
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,520
 Yeah, he's huge.

749
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,400
 Interestingly, we'll never know what Barry Killaby thinks

750
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,880
 about Mr. Blobby, because he's never done an interview.

751
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,520
 Isn't that weird?

752
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,160
 Ever.

753
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:53,480
 Sorry.

754
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,840
 I totally thought you were going to a really macabre ending.

755
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,480
 Because he's dead.

756
00:54:59,480 --> 00:54:59,720
 Yeah.

757
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,440
 No, I don't think he'll ever do an interview about it.

758
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,160
 As in lots of people have tried to make contact over the years,

759
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,960
 and I think either he just thinks of it as a job,

760
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,080
 and he just doesn't want to become a personality associated with it,

761
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,880
 whatever the reason, he's never, ever done it.

762
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,640
 And it seems like he never will.

763
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,360
 Interesting.

764
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:16,840
 Yeah.

765
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,480
 And he's--

766
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,040
 Sorry.

767
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,120
 I was just going to say, I like the idea of the people who don't know about Mr. Blobby

768
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:27,720
 and Noel's house party googling it and seeing what it was.

769
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,200
 Yeah.

770
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,000
 That's such a treat ahead of you.

771
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,560
 Such a treat.

772
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:33,800
 And also, if you just see, like, say, a one minute clip of that show,

773
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:38,200
 that will in no way explain what happens in the rest of the show.

774
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,680
 You really have to watch our show.

775
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,000
 Yeah, I have no idea what I see or what it is.

776
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,400
 It's a lot.

777
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,400
 One of the things you were saying about how so much weird stuff happened on that show,

778
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,440
 one of them was NTV, and I don't know if you remember that.

779
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,480
 So what it was is they would go into someone's house,

780
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,240
 and they would put a camera on their TV, and they would talk to them live.

781
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,280
 Oh, wow, cool.

782
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:58,840
 Oh, yeah.

783
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,880
 It was amazing.

784
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,520
 It was so cool.

785
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,880
 And they could win prizes or something.

786
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,440
 Did they know?

787
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,240
 Did they know that was it?

788
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,440
 No, they didn't know.

789
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,200
 And the amazing thing was, when you see interviews with Michael Lego,

790
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:13,000
 he basically said, every day, we didn't know if it was going to work.

791
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,720
 And you would be stressed out all the way through the week.

792
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,560
 And the only time you could breathe is when that person didn't swear

793
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,480
 or say something terrible live on air or whatever.

794
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,280
 Stop masturbating.

795
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,680
 Oh, Blobby.

796
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,720
 But apparently, there was a researcher who would go and meet this person the week before

797
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,800
 surreptitiously and pretend that they were just randomly meeting this person.

798
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,720
 Didn't tell them they were on TV or anything.

799
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,800
 So get into their house, set up the camera.

800
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,240
 Were they with a-- yeah, exactly.

801
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,680
 Were they applying the camera to the TV?

802
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,880
 Yeah, so someone would have to nominate you,

803
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,800
 and that person would have access to the TV.

804
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,880
 So they'd make sure you weren't in at the time.

805
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,840
 But a researcher would just come up, someone you've never met before,

806
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,400
 and you would come up with some story

807
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,280
 that they would chat to you to make sure you weren't a person

808
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,280
 who was going to do something terrible live on TV.

809
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,160
 I feel like if you flunked out of MI5, that would be a job that you could take.

810
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:08,200
 It's spy-adjacent, but you're not actually doing any spying.

811
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,880
 I feel like you would get-- because the Cold War's finished at that time in the 1990s.

812
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:17,320
 A lot of those spies went on to do MTV and Blobby.

813
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,280
 There was a lot of gunging as well on it, the gunge tank.

814
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:27,240
 Where sometimes guests, wouldn't they, would get gunged.

815
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,960
 So you'd be in a big glass tank and gunge would fall on you.

816
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:35,240
 But gunge featured fairly heavily on British TV.

817
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,320
 Yeah, get your own back with Dave Bensonfield.

818
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,200
 It was very gunge-heavy.

819
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,240
 There's someone-- this won't make the edit--

820
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:44,600
 but there's someone, a guy on social media.

821
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:50,200
 I think it's only on Instagram, who I sort of assume it's all women,

822
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,280
 but certainly as me and a load of women I know,

823
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,160
 constantly comments, Rachel, will you get gunged?

824
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,200
 Are you willing to get gunged?

825
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,000
 Please respond.

826
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,400
 Just back on the gunge question.

827
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,080
 Would love to see you get gunged.

828
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,120
 Are you willing?

829
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,560
 Always very polite.

830
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,800
 Like, wants it to be fully consensual.

831
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,760
 And very persistent.

832
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,440
 Like, to be fair, I don't think I've ever replied.

833
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,880
 But like, the comments to everyone are the same.

834
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,920
 He just wants to see.

835
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,320
 Certain people get gunged.

836
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,400
 Does he have the capacity to gun?

837
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,880
 I don't think I should ask.

838
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,160
 I think he'd take that as a maybe.

839
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,360
 Just ask, what's your setup?

840
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,400
 Is he using a classic '90s gunge recipe,

841
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:33,960
 or is this him?

842
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,040
 Has he recreated his own gunge in a sort of--

843
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,000
 I don't like to think of that.

844
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,600
 Oh, God.

845
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:46,040
 Well, or is it someone who worked on '90s television

846
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,200
 and has kind of picked up this fetish?

847
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,560
 He's got all this leftover gunge

848
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,080
 after the show got cancelled.

849
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,280
 What am I going to do with this gunge?

850
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,200
 It reminds me of the story.

851
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,200
 This isn't my story, so I'm not sure if we can keep it in.

852
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,120
 But you know Rich Turner, our very good friend,

853
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,480
 who Dan and I worked with a lot,

854
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:04,120
 and as a radio producer and worked on TV for many, many years.

855
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,000
 He worked on a kid's show in the '70s for the BBC.

856
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,960
 And he said that there was a child,

857
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,400
 and they've kind of--

858
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,760
 They've been-- it wasn't gunged,

859
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,160
 but there was like a flower fight, you know?

860
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,720
 So they covered him flower, like this.

861
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,120
 And then someone on set had to shout out,

862
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,520
 "Can someone deflower this child, please?"

863
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:28,680
 And that was the only time that was ever heard of him in 1970s

864
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,480
 at the BBC.

865
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:36,440
 OK, that's it.

866
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,640
 That is all of our facts.

867
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,000
 Thank you so much for listening.

868
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,840
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

869
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,320
 about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,

870
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,160
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

871
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,600
 I'm on @Shrieberland.

872
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,080
 James.

873
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,120
 At James Harkin.

874
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:48,760
 Andy.

875
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,880
 Will you be gunned?

876
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,440
 Rach?

877
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,480
 Rachel Parris.

878
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,440
 Yeah, and remember, as we said at the top of the show,

879
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,680
 you can see Rachel live on stage

880
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,800
 as part of the great ostentatious ensemble.

881
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,480
 It is such an amazing night.

882
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,040
 It's live improvised Jane Austen novels

883
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,040
 that have never been performed before.

884
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,720
 They've been written, I think, 6,000 of them or something like that,

885
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,480
 that were lost to time, have been found.

886
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,920
 They perform a new one each night,

887
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,960
 and that's on in the West End.

888
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,760
 So do check out online to find tickets for that

889
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,080
 or make sure to get her book.

890
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,880
 It is now out on paperback, Advice from Strangers.

891
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,720
 It's out March 23rd.

892
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,760
 It's where Rachel spent basically a year of stand-up life

893
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,520
 going around the UK in Annan Dabra,

894
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,040
 taking advice from strangers

895
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,720
 and working out the answers

896
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,720
 and working out the philosophy of what they were saying,

897
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,080
 meaning it's a brilliant book.

898
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,360
 It's out now on paperback.

899
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,120
 So do check it out and do come back next week.

900
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,320
 We'll have another episode.

901
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,040
 We'll wait in for you.

902
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,080
 We'll see you then.

903
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,880
 Goodbye.

904
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,780
 (upbeat music)

905
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,360
 (upbeat music)
