WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show, we have two exciting announcements

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.120
 to make. The first is about who our special guest is this time and the second is about

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.280
 a live show we have coming up. So firstly, our guest this week is the brilliant comedian

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.120
 Rachel Parris. Rachel's been on once before, but if you haven't heard of her or you didn't

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.680
 hear that episode, she is a fantastic writer, comedian, presenter, musician, you name it.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.240
 She's an ostentatious, the Jane Austen themed improvised comedy show. She also is in the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.840
 throes of publishing her first ever book. It's called Advice from Strangers, Everything

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.120
 I Know from People I Don't Know. She toured around for a year asking her live audience

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.280
 for advice and this book is the brilliant result. It's funny, it's uplifting, the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.760
 advice range is from be kind to never pass up the opportunity for a wee. It spans the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.320
 gamut. It's a brilliant book and it's out in paperback now so do check it out.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.280
 The second thing to say is that we have a live No Such Thing as a Fish coming up on

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.400
 the 21st of April and this is a global streaming event. Very exciting. We're doing a show

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.040
 at the British Library, the world hallowed British Library. As part of their season,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.640

00:01:41.440 --> 00:02:03.720
 show. Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.400
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.000
 here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Rachel Parris and once again we have gathered

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.600
 round the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.840
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Rachel. My fact is Dame Maura

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.440
 Limpany remains the only castaway on Desert Island Discs to have chosen entirely her

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:40.280
 own recordings to be marooned with which I admire. Me too, bold. Straight in. I feel

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.880
 like I should say straight away like in her defence, it was her second appearance on the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.080
 show, her first was 22 years earlier and she didn't want to repeat any of her choices.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.120
 And there probably hadn't been any music in the audience. That's the problem, back in

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.680
 the day there was eight songs so that's yeah, that's a big problem. We should quickly say

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.600
 because our British listeners will obviously know what Desert Island Discs is but not the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.040
 young ones. Not the young ones possibly, but international people won't know it either.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:18.480
 This is children and foreigners. A new book by Sally Rooney. Yeah, so it's the UK's I

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.640
 believe longest running radio show if not it's right up there at the top. It's an interview

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.640
 show and the basic premise of it is you bring eight records onto the show, songs you love,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.720
 that means something to you and then at the end you're asked to make a decision. You're

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.480
 going to be marooned on the Desert Island. What one song are you going to save while

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.080
 the seven other wash away and you get to bring a book and you get to bring a luxury item

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.400
 and it's awesome. It's my favourite radio show. Yeah, and they use that to talk about

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.720
 their life and thoughts and everything as well. So it's really like esteemed isn't it

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.280
 in British culture. I think it was Dame Elizabeth Schwarzkopf who did a lot of her own recording.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.400
 She was a soprano, but it was only Maureen Limpany who chose entirely. I read that Schwarzkopf

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.040
 picked seven out of eight featured her voice and was Dame Maureen Limpany she was a pianist.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:19.160
 Pianist. Pianist. There's a hinge in Pian. Pianist. To be fair to her Limpany she didn't

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.160
 pick songs composed by her. They were Mozart songs and they were Chopin and stuff like that.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.080
 So they were all classical pieces that she was playing on, but then you get people like

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.320
 Norman Wisdom who is for children and overseas people. He was a comedian, very big in Albania.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.560
 I mean anyone under 80 is going to struggle with Norman Wisdom. What about him? Well he

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.440
 chose five of his eight as his own songs, but I think his actual own songs don't laugh

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.280
 at me because I'm a fool, stuff like that. Someone who chose three of their own for foreigners

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:58.640
 and not for children was Rolf Harris. Oh gosh. Just for the edit. Wow. One weird one was

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:06.000
 David Frost who picked David Frost interviews. Not even music. Did he do the next one? Most

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.240
 of them. I'm not sure that he did bizarrely. With those people, I do wonder if was it just

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.360
 a matter of having not thoroughly researched what the program is? Well, in the early days

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.120
 I think. It's so eminent. These days being invited on a desk is basically, in Britain

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.540
 it's kind of a minor gong. It's like getting an MBE or something. I'm sure you guys found

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.880
 out that some people have done it twice. That's pretty eminent. That's like double gong. You

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.600
 got some people who've done it three times. I need two people as far as I can tell I've

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.720
 done it four times. Oh really? Yeah. Do we get to guess who? Have a guess. Someone like

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:49.320
 Maggie Smith. Yeah, I would say even more eminent. David Attenborough. Oh wow. And if you guys

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.200
 guessed the other one without having read about it already. I was going to try and word

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.440
 my way in some way. Wait, I don't know. Is it one of the chuckle brothers? It's Barry

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.960
 Chuckle. Yeah, and his luxury was Paul Chuckle, which was nice. Sorry, is it actually bad?

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.320
 No, no, no. Don't do that. I believed you. It is a comedian, isn't it, from old? Yeah,

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.720
 Arthur Aske. So modern name that cuts a lot of ice today. But like a musical guy, was

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:20.120
 he? Yeah, yeah, a really, really famous comedian in the 50s and 40s and 50s. Yeah. The original

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.040
 host was a guy called Roy Plombly who invented it. And he invented it during the Second World

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.520
 War, actually. It was a sort of wartime commission to cheer people up and it was just clearly

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.800
 a good idea. But he was incredibly austere about it. And in fact, he was so controlling

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.080
 that the early shows were scripted. So he would script each dialogue in advance and

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.040
 then they'd just sit and they'd read the script. And then that was it. And it was largely just

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.400
 about the music, wasn't it? It was basically like being Zoe Ball and sort of going, let's

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.960
 listen to this next track. It was, you know, they were DJing to an extent. Also, he would

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.860
 ask about whether you could survive on a desert island, as in he was incredibly interested

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.280
 in it. He would ask like, can you build your own shelter? Can you fish? Can you swim? You

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.720
 know, what are you going to do about the sun? It's like it was it was great. Almost purely

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.080
 that feels like that's what it should be. It was really, it was really fun, I think.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.720
 Do you know how he pitched this? So he was like 27, I think, when he pitched this. And

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.160
 he came up with it. Did he? He came up with it and he thought that it was going to be

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:23.520
 six episodes and that was it. He thought they paid him quite well. Inside of we. And so

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.360
 it was a shock that it lasted for him like 41 years and became this national institution.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.680
 But before that he was he used to pitch shows to the BBC. And one of the shows he pitched

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.520
 was called I know what I hate. And it was a it was a show in which guests choose songs

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.400
 that they hated. And they would just have them, you know, either, you know, Room 101

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.480
 basically, I guess the pre Room 101. Imagine if you got them mixed up and you're Dame

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.880
 Mara. Your own songs. Has desert island discs ever had a gap or is it just run continuous

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.760
 in the early days it had? I think these days they only do 40 a year. Oh, right. Okay.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.600
 There's a few gaps. But there was there was a there was a couple of years of like five

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.920
 year gap where it kind of just went off air all together. Yeah. He also did a panel show

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:12.200
 called many a slip, which sounds amazing. So in a typical round, he would read out a piece

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.760
 of text and there would be some grammatical error in there. And the panel had to find the

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:23.640
 grammatical error. Bring it back. Isn't that amazing? Absolutely love that. I would really

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.200
 enjoy being on the panel for that. Yeah. I was reading the early guests like the really

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.000
 early sort of the first 10 guests they had. So did you guys read at all about Captain Dingle?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.080
 Sounds great. He was unbelievably interesting. So it's just listed as Explorer, right? Dan is

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:47.960
 very interested by this. Yeah, keep talking. Well, Captain Alewood Edward Dingle was born in 1874.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.720
 And then he was on the show in the mid 40s. So he's pretty old by this point. Yeah. And he was

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.120
 uniquely qualified to be on the show. Can you guess why? He was especially good. Because he'd

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.200
 lived on a desert island? He had lived on a desert island himself. Or he was a disc.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:07.800
 He was both. He was a uniquely circular guy. No, he had been shipwrecked five times in his life.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:13.400
 Brilliant. Wow. Oh my God. In 1893. So he was 19. He was in a schooner called the Black Pearl.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.880
 He and his shipmate were going to retrieve gold from a sunken ship, which had sunk 20 years before.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.880
 He was a Black Pearl from Pirates of the Caribbean. It's the same one. Yeah. And so then they got

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.440
 shipwrecked. And it was only two of them in this boat. And they spent 11 weeks on a desert island

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:32.440
 eating raw penguin and drinking rain. Wow. There's some good news, which is that while on the island,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:40.600
 they found some other treasure from a different shipwreck. And the two of them got along so

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.960
 badly, these two, that they weren't speaking at all. For like a few days in, they were just not

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.200
 speaking for days on end. Right. It's kind of understandable, isn't it? Yeah, completely. Yeah.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.480
 This would make such a better episode of desert island discs than how difficult your childhood was.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:03.080
 Bring it back. Bring back exclusively shipwrecked. So who did Dingle's partner do an episode as well

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:09.080
 to sort of counter? Easy balance. I don't know. What a shame. Can I just say one thing about Plomley?

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:17.000
 Yeah. His grandfather was called, right, Hey Ho. What? He was called, right, Hey Ho. And his

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.440
 surname was Wigg. So his first two names were right, W-R-I-G-H-T. Okay. And his middle name was

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:29.720
 Hey Ho, H-A-Y-H-O-E. What? He was called, right, Hey Ho. Do we know the story? That's amazing.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.920
 It's not one of those Bible things, is it? You know how people were named after just putting it?

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.840
 They were just normal names back in the day. Imagine at school, like the teacher goes, right,

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:45.880
 Hey Ho. Everybody stop packing up. So good. There's an episode that Dan will be especially

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:54.280
 interested in, the Buzz Aldrin episode, which we've never heard. Okay. It was during Sulawli's

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.880
 tenure. She's massively respected, obviously. Amazing broadcaster. And she and the production

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:05.080
 team went to Buzz Aldrin's house in California, right? And they were setting up, you know,

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.200
 doing all the sort of pre-chat bits. And Buzz Aldrin left the room and never came back.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:17.240
 I really? Wow. So they didn't make it? Where did you? Did they do it in 1969?

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:24.600
 I've just got to quickly do something. And that's why Lawley was second on the moon,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.560
 because she was trying to get the interview. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's amazing.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.200
 Was he pissed off? Or do we know? We don't know anything. He just walked out. Okay.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.280
 I don't know. Someone will know. Someone will know. Buzz will know. Yeah. Let's ask him.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.520
 Let's ask him. I mean, he came on our show in a museum of curiosity. Came all the way over here.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:47.640
 We didn't even have to go to California. You should have done a reverse Lawley on him.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.080
 You should have. The entire audience leaves.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:57.240
 Alistair McClain, who was a novelist in the 20th century. Like a detective. Yeah,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.040
 thriller, like Where Eagles Dare and Guns of Navarone. I mean, huge author, right?

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:07.800
 And and Plomley was a mega fan. Loved Alistair McClain. Really excited. And he arrived and they

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.600
 were doing the pre-interview. You know, they're talking about just talking about what they're

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.280
 going to talk about. And as they were doing the pre-interview, Roy Plomley realized he was not

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.320
 talking to Alistair McClain, the novelist. He was talking to a guy called Alistair McClain,

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.920
 who was the head of the European Tourist Bureau of the Government of Canada.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:31.240
 He must have got the letter. So can you come on the Desert Island disc and thought,

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:38.120
 finally, my work has been appreciated. Why have they waited so long? I've got so much to say

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:44.440
 about Canada. That's amazing. Can you guess what we did? I would say, I think you style it out,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.000
 don't you? You have to just say, this is the person we've asked. It's the whole point. I reckon

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.920
 he just bezoldrined it and just walked out. Well, he stuck it out. They just recorded it anyway,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:00.280
 and then didn't broadcast it. Oh, was it just terrible? I have no idea. But I don't think it

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.840
 was, I don't think it was broadcast in the end. That's a shame because it is a format that thrives

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.560
 on just someone you've never heard of, because the songs allow you in. As a Canadian, this guy

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.920
 would probably be quite good at wilderness survival. Yeah, you like some islands in Canada,

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:20.440
 one of the most island. Is it? I think that's absolutely heartbreaking for Alistair McClain,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:25.240
 the Canadian. Imagine you get the letter and you're so flattered and you're like,

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:31.320
 I knew actually that my life did mean something to people. This really validates everything

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:37.480
 that I've had doubts about, I'll be honest. Years of misery. Being the head of the European

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.720
 Torres Bureaus. Am I on the right path? Then you record, you even record it and it goes fine.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:47.640
 And then it never airs and you inquire why it's never aired. They must have told him

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.880
 the tapes were burned in a fire. I hope so. I hope that's what they said. The UK's burnt down,

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.720
 unfortunately. And he'll be like, I can come back, I can redo it. And they'll be like,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:04.200
 We're booked up, sorry. It's all 2023, we're booked. I was wondering how many islands there were,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:10.120
 like in the Pacific, for instance, if you put one celebrity on each one, would that

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.440
 have run out now? Could you fit everyone who's been on Desert Island discs onto their own

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.680
 individual island? I think even just in the Pacific, you would easily be able to do it.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.720
 Wow, amazing. Yeah, but it wouldn't be good for the local flora and fauna.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.520
 Yeah, why not? Well, Desert Islands, usually they have lots of species on because there's no

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:32.440
 humans, there's no cats, there's no rats, there's no, so it's quite good for species. But if you put,

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:38.440
 you know, Barry Chuckle on. The insects will be hurting themselves on the pane of glass. He's

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:45.080
 accidentally smashed, carrying. There's a story. Herbert Morrison, who was a politician, he was

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:50.840
 sort of under Clement Attlee in his government. He, when he died, he was found to have his eight

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:56.360
 songs in his wallet waiting. Should he ever be called at moments noticed to suddenly appear

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:03.960
 on Desert Island discs? Yeah, I think quite similarly, I have on purpose learned all of the

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:09.480
 words to trouble by Iggy Azalea, just in case I ever get asked to do a celebrity lip sync.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.200
 No way. Is that with Jennifer Hudson? Yeah, because I know the chorus. I will be your

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:22.040
 Jennifer Hudson. That's very good. It's very much the same and equal esteem I think. I have actually

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:27.640
 learned a lot of ice skating moves in case I'm ever invited on, I don't even know the name of the

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:33.880
 show. I've actually been practicing eating kangaroo testicles for the last five years, just in case.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:46.280
 It's a must of mine, a special subject. Kangaroos knackers. Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:53.000
 and that is my fact. My fact this week is that a man called Mike Merrill found making decisions so

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.160
 hard that he floated himself as a publicly traded person and for over a decade now has had over

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:05.160
 800 people making his decisions for him. Great. Very clever. So this guy, yeah, so this was back

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:11.080
 in I think it was 2007. His career was sort of at a point where he wasn't knowing fully what he was

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:18.120
 doing with his life, so he decided to separate himself into 100,000 shares and float himself

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.520
 and ask the people who were interested in purchasing these shares at one buck a piece,

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.240
 "Would you like to make the decisions for me?" Ironically, that is quite a big decision to make.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:36.600
 It is. And he kept the majority shares, right? Yes. But he made his majority shares

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:43.960
 non-voting. Oh, I see. So he didn't have any sway. So no one can own him. Yeah, no one can own him.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.400
 But he doesn't have to make the decisions. That they can rule him. Exactly, they can rule him. But

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:53.000
 he throws up the question that he needs deciding. So it's not like they can just say, "We've decided

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.880
 this week we want you to dye your hair pink." He has to say, "Should I dye my hair pink?" So he set up

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:03.560
 a website. It's called K-MikeyM. I went to it in the course of doing the research. I tried to buy

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.720
 some shares, but none are up at the moment because he's very popular at the moment. He sort of releases

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:13.080
 them in small batches on demand and they fluctuate with the demand. So they could be anything as low

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:20.440
 as 99 cents, but they can go all the way up to $18. That shares for you? Yeah. Has anyone made a big

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:26.200
 profit on Mike Merrill? Yeah, his brother, who sold when he got to a high point. Yeah, he sold

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:31.720
 all his shares and bought a new dishwasher, I think, or something. He does make the decisions

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:38.120
 about what they vote on, but when he moved in with his girlfriend, he got complaints from the

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.720
 shareholders who said, "This is a decision I think you should have consulted us on." This is definitely

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.760
 going to affect, you know, life. It affects the value of him, doesn't it? Yeah. If you get married.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.400
 Because someone else is then not making decisions, but helping him make decisions, as in if you're

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.800
 living with a partner, you do chat stuff over with them. They might have an influence on you.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.160
 Yeah. Well, the other thing is shares depend on how much he's valued at, right?

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:09.560
 And his value is going to change when his life changes. So the amount of money you have changes

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.480
 when you get married, it might change for the better or for the worse. But are you saying his

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.920
 value would either soar or crater when he moved in with a girlfriend? It's plausible. But it's your

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.080
 value on different markets, isn't it? So on the dating market, your value is it sinks when you're

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.040
 limited. Does it sink when you go up from supply and demand? You would think it would increase.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.600
 Some people say that. Some people say, "Oh, no one's interested in you," and tell you that you

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.840
 move in with a partner, and then suddenly everyone's after you, you know? Is that your experience?

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:42.520
 So you're backfired. My experience is total indifference.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:50.520
 You maintained very nicely consistently. Thank you. When this happened, and he had to explain to

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.240
 his girlfriend that he had to consult his shareholders, he issued her with a relationship

00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:02.600
 contract that she had to sign. What? Which sounds bonkers. But I'm reading that this is it is quite

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:08.200
 bonkers, but also relationship contracts instead of getting married or before marriage are very

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.560
 much on the rise the last few years. Well, cream ups, especially, I think. In the relationship

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:16.920
 contract, do we know any details or is it simply? I don't know the details of that one. I did want

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.000
 to tell you, though, about another relationship contract that was in the news recently. So the

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.880
 independent reported that Shailene, someone called Shailene, or @salamiqueen on TikTok,

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:32.760
 made headlines because she made her boyfriend sign a relationship contract that said that if he cheated

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:39.320
 on her, he had to pay all her bills. Indefinitely. That's the thing I put for how long. I don't know

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:44.760
 what he said. And her comment on it was, I'm so smart or crazy. I don't know.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:50.040
 That's the salamiqueen. I feel like he wouldn't hold off and cart that, I think.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.800
 He was unconscionable to me. Apparently, it was a legal contract. And yeah, I don't know

00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:00.600
 if the contract just said pay her bills with no other parameters.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.280
 You've got to define the terms, haven't you? You've got to define what cheating is, you know.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.560
 Is it casting a flirty glance at someone? In which case, he's going to be

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.000
 paying bills pretty quickly. Is it hiding money underneath the boarding monopoly?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:18.360
 Yes. Is it making a cup of tea quietly? So you don't have to make the other one a cup of tea.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:24.120
 Is it with sleeping with someone else? We don't know. Something like that. We don't know.

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:31.560
 Did you hear about Patrick Campbell? No. So he owned a company called profitwell.com

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:39.720
 and he sold it in 2022 for $200 million. And he decided to do a hostile takeover of Mike Merrill.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:47.480
 And he has since bought 15% of Mike's shares. And he reckons, because you can tell how often

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:52.200
 people vote. And usually his shareholders, Mike Merrill shareholders, don't vote. Most of them,

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.080
 it's just a joke and they might vote once or twice, but they don't really do it.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:00.520
 This guy, Patrick Campbell, reckons that with 15%, he has enough power to influence all the

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:05.800
 shareholder votes and he can basically tell him to do what he wants. Wow. That's amazing. That's

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.920
 exciting. But he's still got to only tell him to do what has been presented. So Mike can still

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.640
 only ask certain questions and it's up to him. But he basically now reckons that he will have

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.680
 the deciding vote on any question that he's asked. He reckons Mike's undervalued at the moment.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:27.880
 Well, here's the kind of things that he's probably influencing his decisions on. So he would have

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.600
 possibly been part of the decision of whether or not Mike invested in a Rwandan chicken farming

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:41.000
 business. That was approved by the shareholders. Grow a winter mustache. That was denied. No

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.640
 winter mustache happened. Cold up for Mike. They decided on whether or not Mike believes in ghosts.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:54.040
 He asked, do I believe in ghosts? They voted on whether or not he does. 66% said yes, you do.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.720
 So he does believe in ghosts. I'm sorry. I've been on board with this

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.840
 until that makes the whole thing look ridiculous. It does. Yeah, yeah. I found it interesting that

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:11.240
 when he made the decision to embark on this, he valued his life at $100,000 and sold shares on

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:19.160
 that basis. That was a very low calculation compared to what economists value a life at,

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.080
 because they have to calculate this in terms of what the government make decisions on.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:28.520
 Officially, economists think the average human life in the US is worth about $8.7 million.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:34.520
 Really? Yeah. Wow. That's a lot. It varies a little bit. I'm rich. So like the Environmental

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:40.760
 Protection Agency uses $7.4 million. Another one uses $9.6 million, but there is a figure on it. How

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:46.200
 does Andy get at this? Yeah, I'm theoretically loaded. I don't know that you can access it,

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.280
 but it has a huge... What if he cuts off his leg? Yeah. He's got a worth of $1 million.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:58.600
 On the open market. Wow. But I found it so interesting what this means to us in terms of

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:07.880
 rulings in government. So for example, in 1972, the auto industry put a life's worth of $885,000

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:13.880
 in today's dollars. And then two years later, the figure was more or less the same, the Department

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:20.520
 of Transportation rejected a regulation to install bars at the rear of trucks to prevent passenger

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.640
 vehicles from sliding underneath them. So a safety measure for trucks was rejected because they did

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:31.080
 the maths on it, and it wasn't cost effective because the lives that it would save weren't worth

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:37.000
 it for the price that it would cost to install them. Which is bleak, isn't it? It's like it would

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.440
 save so many thousands of lives, but they weren't worth enough for them to do it. I guess there's

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:49.400
 got to be some kind of calculation. Is it like... Sorry, sorry, sorry. You're making decisions

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:54.040
 about a limited amount of resources, all your income as a country, and you're trying to maximise

00:23:54.040 --> 00:24:02.440
 the human life. Yeah, we all agree I'd rant. But is it like if you're mountaineering and you

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.080
 know, you get lost and the government are like, well, he's actually already had $3 million because

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.360
 you know, we put him up in hospital that time. Oh, if you're in one ravine and in the next

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:18.440
 ravine, there's a lot of Bitcoin. It makes more sense for the government to go for the Bitcoin.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.360
 Yeah, yeah. Depending on how Bitcoin's doing, you know, it's very variable. Yeah, well,

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:28.600
 food's a thought. I mean, food's big food's a thought. You know, the calculation was actually,

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:34.280
 there's a bit more to it, the 100K. So it wasn't that he thought that was his full life that was

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:39.720
 worth that amount. He calculated based on the fact that he had a day job and that this decision

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:46.120
 making was only going to apply to his free time. So 100K is based on his nights and his weekends.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:50.360
 So yeah, there's still, if you round him up, it's still low. It's still, he'd be about a mil,

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:54.280
 just under a mil maybe, I guess, for the rest of the, well, there's bleed between your, you can't

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.640
 separate those perfectly. As in, if you grow a moustache, that will affect your job. Yeah.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.440
 Depending on what you do for a living. If you believe in ghosts. Exactly. It's a 24/7

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.200
 activity. It works in a creepy old house. This is true. Yeah. I think it's harder to make decisions

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.200
 everywhere, for everybody at the moment, because there's the thing about how many more decisions

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.280
 you have to make. So there's an economist called Eric Beinhacher. I think he was very

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:21.480
 eminent and famous and he wrote a book. It was a huge sellout about this kind of thing. And he

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.600
 had estimated that between 10,000 years ago and the modern day, human choices had multiplied

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:35.240
 a hundred million fold. Wow. Oh my God. I have five or six different eye creams in my bedside table.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:41.240
 Okay. And every night, I choose one of those five or six eye creams. Based on mood. Yeah,

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.920
 based on mood. Right. Based on vibe. And I sort of enjoy that process. Yeah.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:53.720
 That's just one of the many examples. I've walked 40 minutes near the office wondering

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.120
 what to have for lunch. Yeah. And I've gone into four places and not had lunch in any of them.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.000
 Back in the day, Andy, you would have been walking around the jungle going,

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:08.440
 "Shall I kill that buffalo or shall I go after that?" Exactly. That lemon. Probably take the

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:14.120
 lemon. Yeah. Returning it when it doesn't taste as good. It's a bit of a habit of Andy's. Right.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.840
 Sorry. Remember the time you returned that sausage? I once.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:22.920
 One time. I once went back to a local restaurant. And it wasn't because it didn't taste good. It

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:29.000
 tasted great. Was it a single sausage? Well, yeah. And I was 11 pounds down on the transaction.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.880
 A single sausage. I ask you. You must have the picture of you on the door when you walk in,

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.120
 so do not allow this man to return his sausage. They gave me another sausage in the end. But

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.480
 by that point, the whole transaction was so spoiled, you know. Yeah. I wasn't able to enjoy

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:47.000
 either of the two sausages I ended up taking away. Yeah. I like that you're holding a fork

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.080
 with a sausage on the end. You're walking around the restaurant trying to find the manager.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:27:00.920
 Tutting. Well, it was a takeaway. So I actually had to go back in. So you take the box on trust,

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.040
 don't you? I'm sure this is a nice dish. You take it away. You open it up. I think this is

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.680
 ridiculous. Was it a hot dog? Painful. No, it was just a sausage. Rachel, it was a sausage.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:14.920
 Why did you buy a sausage to take away? I don't understand the meal. It was a sausage and rice.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:22.440
 It was so depressed. But it was a very nicely spiced sausage. But it was still ridiculous.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:27.640
 What was wrong with it? It was too small. It was two, it was 11 quid. One small sausage for 11

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.480
 quid. This was about five years ago, I should say. This was before the cost of living crisis. This was,

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.880
 you know, at the time sausages were going for like two quid. You know, this is ridiculous. Yeah.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.320
 This is ridiculous. So you didn't think you were getting your money's worth? I didn't. And I went

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.880
 back and I remonstrated for quite some time. But you stay, I mean, we had a good 20 minute chat

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:48.840
 here where you were deciding whether or not and building the fury. I mean, this is not

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.400
 me remembering a random thing. This was a big incident. This was sausage gate in this office.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:59.320
 I've just got a couple of things on decision making. One of the great ways of deciding is just

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.560
 coin flipping. So many things in history have been decided from just getting a flip of a coin.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:09.240
 So, you know, the company Packard Hewlett. Packard. That's right. Because he won the

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.240
 Toinkos and that's why he got named that. It could have been the other way around. We could have

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:18.360
 had Packard Hewlett. Did you say the Toinkos? Yeah, that's well, and that could have been cool.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.440
 That was a coin toss that won that way around as well. We wrote that out with a computer, didn't

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:29.480
 they? Yeah. So we've got Hewlett Packard off the back of that. Portland, we've all heard of Portland,

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:34.680
 the city in America. Yeah. That was meant to be called Boston, but they lost the Toinkos.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:40.120
 The Toinkos? We don't keep saying it. Should we call it a Toinkos?

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:47.560
 Great. Yeah. So that should have been called Boston. Wait, they were trying to call themselves,

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.000
 but what did Boston have to say? I don't think Boston was called Boston at that point.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.400
 Oh, okay. I'm guessing. Oh, James thinks it is.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:29:01.400
 Why would they have called it Boston then? Just another Boston. Okay, right. Yeah.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.400
 Yeah. The Wright brothers as well. So Wilbur Wright. We're going to be called the wrong brothers.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.600
 Should we go in the air or should we go underground?

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:23.240
 So Wilbur became the first person ever to fly a plane because of a Toinkos.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:33.000
 And, but this was an unfortunate one because Wilbur's first flight didn't go. It didn't work.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.480
 So the second flight then went to Orville, who then became the first person to fly a plane.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:42.920
 So sometimes it can go against you. Yeah. And that's why the duck was called Orville and not Wilbur.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:50.600
 Was it? No. No. He famously couldn't fly Horville the duck. I wish I could fly way up in the sky,

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:57.000
 but I can't. You can. I would, I'd like to pick that Lauren as my desert island.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.600
 Thank you very much. That one's going out for the children and the foreigners.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:12.440
 Okay. It is time for fact number three and that is James. Okay. My fact this week is that according

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:18.840
 to a survey of pubs in 1930, the average time someone in Bolton took to drink a pint of beer

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:28.600
 was 52 minutes. In Liverpool, it was 22 minutes. 52 is a long time. 22 is quite speedy. I'm in the

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:34.520
 like 10 to 15 mark, I reckon. Well, on average, like if you have five pints in a night, it slows

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:41.240
 down, doesn't it? Yeah. Okay. So I read this in a book called Darts in England, 1900 to 1939,

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:46.280
 a social history by Patrick Chaplin, which I've mentioned before, which is an amazing book,

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:51.160
 which is mostly about darts. And he really does talk about darts quite a lot in this context as

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:58.520
 well, because it was related to a thing called mass observation, which was, it was this thing in

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:03.960
 Britain where they got a panel of observers and they made a diary about what was happening in

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.520
 their day to day life. And the idea is they do it over time and in different places. And it would

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.240
 give an idea of what was happening in the country. But anyway, there was this thing in Liverpool

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:19.720
 that they banned darts and actually any pub games. And they thought it was encouraging people to go

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.640
 into pubs. And so they wouldn't let you do it. In fact, Liverpool was the only city in the country

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.680
 where no one played darts in pubs. But what happened was it had the opposite effect. Because

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:33.800
 you couldn't play darts or pool or dominoes or whatever, you had no distractions. You just drank

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.640
 more because you didn't have anything, you know, if you're playing darts, you have to go and collect

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.560
 the darts and come back and stuff. And it's, and you're not drinking. Whereas in Liverpool,

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:46.360
 they would just get in drunk. Then eventually they brought sports back into pubs in Liverpool.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:51.000
 Is that, is that why? Yeah, because in Bolton was famously at the time, a lot of people played

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.040
 darts and played pool and stuff and still do. That's really interesting. This is weird, because I

00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:02.040
 was separately reading about pubs in Bolton. And but I got a fact from the mass observation study.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:07.880
 Oh, really? Yeah. So it was in this one was in 1937 and 38. I don't know whether is that about the

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:14.280
 right time? Yeah, 30s. So and yeah, as James says, massive survey of people. But I think they didn't

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:19.480
 have many people who were from Bolton doing the studying. So what they did was they got a lot of

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:27.000
 middle and upper class Southerners who dressed as northerners and put on accents and went incognito

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.040
 in pubs in Bolton and just drank and and you reckon they got away with that because I'm from

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:39.080
 Bolton. I just wonder what it was like. What were they doing? They were observing for the mass.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:44.200
 I think observing in people's behaviour in pubs and recording and you know what was said. So I

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:49.880
 just a couple of nice details from this study. One observer who was EL in the notes was rendered

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:56.040
 incapable of doing any observation after drinking eight pints in an hour and 45 minutes. They got

00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:00.200
 into a lot of fights. It was all kind of glossed over. I think it was a pretty inglorious. I mean,

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:05.560
 if you're a middle class or upper class person from the south going to the north dressed as a

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:11.000
 northerner and doing a fake northern accent, you're going to get in fights. I'm sorry. And they also

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:18.360
 had a covert photographer in the corner. Dressed as a whip. Taking secret pictures, I guess, of the

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:27.640
 fights as they broke out. Do you want some pub slang? Sure. A quiz. Pint hole. My mouth. It's not

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:35.000
 the mouth. Oh, dear. How are people drinking pints? We need a funnel. Pint hole. Is it like

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.880
 the cellar where you go and get the beer from? This is actually the least good answer of the three

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:48.360
 that I've got. It's just the public bar. Oh. All right. A wobble shop. Wobble shop. Wobbling like,

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:53.880
 you know, unsteady because you're drunk. It's just another word for a pub again. It's an unlicensed

00:33:53.880 --> 00:34:01.080
 pub. Apparently. He's down the wobble shop. Do we get unlicensed pubs? Well, they're not loud,

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:09.080
 but it's quite bold to be calling yourself a pub. This one's hard, but it's good. You're an

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:16.040
 admiral of the narrow seas. Okay. Does it just mean drunk? It is something you do when you're

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:21.480
 drunk. You sway like you're on a boat. Very nice. No. Buy some stuff off eBay that you really shouldn't

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:27.560
 buy. That's it. That's it. No, it's drunkenly throwing up into someone else's lap. Oh. All right,

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:34.920
 but I'm an admiral of the narrow seas. It's okay. I'm qualified. Take it up with the Navy.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:41.800
 Come on, Captain Dingle. Let's get out of here. There's a pub in Bolton called the Old Madden

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.720
 Seyve. We talked about Bolton before. It's possibly the oldest pub in the country. It's

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:51.080
 certainly in the top 10. And there's a mention of its name from 1251. So we know it's at least

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:56.920
 that old, but it's where the Earl of Derby was executed in 1651 for his part in the Bolton

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:01.480
 Massacre. This was during one of the Civil Wars. And there's a chair there. It was the last chair

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:06.440
 he sat in before he was beheaded at the Earl of Derby. At the pub? It's in the pub. Yeah, it's

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:14.840
 quite very famous in Bolton this. And they have 53 ghosts in this pub apparently, including a ghost

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.240
 dog that's known to lick the manager's feet when he lets them hang out of the bed in the middle

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:24.760
 of the night. Well, Mike Merrill, if you're listening, you need to get there ASAP. But that's

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:30.120
 a lot of ghosts for one pub. It's an old pub though. It's from 1251. So, you know. Yeah.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:36.520
 Because as I was looking into, there's usually the most haunted everything in Britain. And I

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:43.080
 couldn't find pub. And then the ones that I read, they had like four ghosts. So that's huge. I would

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:48.840
 imagine with pubs, unlike houses or hotels or anything, because you don't stay there overnight.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.240
 It's a lot less spooky, isn't it? Because you can just leave. Do you know what I mean? Like,

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:57.240
 it's such a fleet that you go to the pub for a few hours, but then you go home and also it's like

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:03.400
 busy and social. So, I don't know, it's got a lot less spooky. But most pubs outside cities would

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.880
 have rooms, wouldn't they? And you know, there are taverns, you know, Jamaica Inn, that kind of

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:13.320
 vine, you know, spooky old pub up on the moors. And you know, there's dark business going on there.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:19.160
 That's based on Jamaica Inn. Yeah. I accidentally backed into someone's car. Wow. You were the real

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:25.080
 pirate. I know. Well, I went into the bar and told them that I did it. There was no problem. But

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.000
 yeah, I've been there. And also I've been to what I think is the most haunted or they say it was the

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.920
 most haunted, which is the mermaid and rye, which yeah, has got a billion ghosts. What, rye and

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:41.480
 Sussex? Yeah, or Kent. It's on the coast. Yeah. Rye's in Sussex. Yeah. Yeah. Rye is a lovely town.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:46.040
 It is very nice. The mermaid's a lovely pub. You've been to quite a few supposedly haunted

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:51.080
 places. Yeah, I'm a big fan of them. Maybe. I don't believe in any of them. Maybe you're a ghost.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:58.040
 That's spooky. Maybe you're Hailey Joel Osmond. I don't know. Grown up. It's six cents.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:04.840
 Oh, it's the kids. Sorry, right. I was watching clips from the six cents the other day and that

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:09.560
 that joke still went over my head. Sorry. No, no, I love it. Thanks for calling it a joke though.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:17.400
 I was just looking into drinking beer fast, which is related to what you're talking about.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:27.080
 So before we get to beer, the fastest drinker of a fizzy drink certainly is a guy called Eric

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:34.520
 Badlands Booker. Such a sexy, outlawish name. There's obviously just drink fizzy drinks first.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:41.320
 He drank a liter of Mountain Dew, the American fizzy drink, from a measuring cup in 6.8 seconds.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:48.280
 And previously, his record was drinking two liters in 18 seconds. That was just last year.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:55.960
 But I came across this guy who is a British man called Peter Dowdswell. And he has not only got

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:05.480
 the record for drinking a pint of beer the quickest, but he's got records in so many food and drink

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:15.400
 speed competitions. So he had to retire a few years ago when he suffered back and shoulder

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:24.200
 injuries as he tried to sink a pint while being held upside down. He was 71. 71? Yeah. Oh my god.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.400
 He was dropped twice by the men who were employed to hold his drinks.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.360
 Who was holding them?

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:35.800
 Yeah, that's amazing. So he holds like all, he's gone through, he's really like belt and braces.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:43.880
 He holds the records for drinking ale, beer, coke, champagne, milk, and milk upside down.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:51.320
 And he holds records for eating quickly, raw eggs, cocktail sausages, pies soaked in Worcester

00:38:51.320 --> 00:39:00.440
 sauce, sushi, Weeter Bix, sausages upside down. And my favourite, eating quickly, sausages on

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:08.920
 John Evans's head. Do we know John Evans's? No, I don't know. I think we're meant to know.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:13.560
 Right. Actually, I am impressed by that because it's hard. I would imagine to eat a sausage off

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:18.680
 someone's head because heads are not plate shaped. Oh, you see in my head, he was sat on the guy's head.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.760
 I thought he was sat on. I think you're right. I think you're right. Yeah. I don't, sorry,

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.040
 you're correct. I'm sure you're right. Yeah, Evans is probably not a plate.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:31.560
 I think either could be possible. Yeah. I don't know. Do you know that the, I was reading about

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:38.040
 pub quizzes and that when they existed, when they first came about. And if you look at the

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.440
 internet, it says that they came about in the 1970s, but I found in the newspaper archives,

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:48.040
 there was definitely one happening in 1954, in Neath in Wales. So we reckon around just

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:55.960
 after World War II. But probably they didn't exist in 1947, because I found an article about a pub

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:02.680
 quiz in Sunderland. And this was, they advertised it as the pub quiz. And what it was is young

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:07.080
 people could go to a pub and ask a panel of married people about the intricacies of sex.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.440
 And that was called, it was called a pub quiz. That's amazing. Isn't that amazing?

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.920
 Quizzing someone asking that question. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, I could do with that.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:22.680
 Is that still a thing? I think any good pub quiz master will be able to answer some of your

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.960
 questions. Not all of them. I didn't have to do it between the rounds as well.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:32.120
 But yeah. And I think it's like World War II just finished. They're trying to get the population

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:37.240
 up, you know, young married couples got questions. So they, God.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.480
 She just finished the music round. Any questions? Dan sticks her hands up. Yeah.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:50.760
 It's foreplay stuff. Is sexual or optional? I wonder what the questions were that were asked.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:56.280
 I didn't say it was just like, this is a thing that's happened. Wow. That would be,

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:01.880
 that would be great if you could ask married people what, what it's like. Well, can you remember

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:10.600
 what it was like? I think I remember a question when my mum told me about sex when I was, I don't

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:18.840
 know what age, like, I think I was nine or something. I think I remember. So she described it to me.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:25.560
 And I think I remember asking how, how do you both move at the same time?

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:31.720
 Which I still think is quite a valid question. You know, I don't know, I've never had sex, but

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:39.000
 the answer ultimately, of course, you know, you just sort of, just sort of works most of the time.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.800
 It just kind of happens. Yeah. I've just, I, did you, the very first time say to someone,

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:49.080
 hey, don't worry, I know what you're thinking, but I've got it covered. I spoke to mum, she explained it.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:58.760
 It will work. It's a to me to use situation. The Chuckle Brothers were the greatest lovers

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:11.000
 in history. Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is Andy. My fact is,

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.120
 when he was approached for the role, the first actor to play Mr. Blobby was simultaneously

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:24.600
 appearing in Shakespeare's measure for measure. I just imagine him turning up in the wrong outfit.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:30.200
 I wish I knew any quotes from measures for measures.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:36.440
 When you're playing the Duke of Venice. So this is about Mr. Blobby. And I think for international

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:42.920
 lessons, we should just quickly say our children. Mr. Blobby is kind of like one of the national

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:52.120
 animals of England, I would say. He's a, he's a big pink object, humanoid creature, pink and yellow.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:56.680
 He's seven feet tall. He wears a bow tie and he screams blobby, blobby, blobby. And he wears a

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:01.160
 big inflatable suit and he just turns up on TV and causes mayhem. And I think he, Mr. Blobby

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:06.520
 doesn't wear a big inflatable suit. Mr. Blobby is the inflatable suit. It's not like inside Mr. Blobby,

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:11.000
 there's a smaller blobby. No, inside there's a man who it turns out is classically trained.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.040
 Inside there's just a very big heart. Thank you.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:19.640
 So basically, Mr. Blobby's been having a bit of a moment because he was really big in the 90s.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:27.000
 And he was on a thing called Noel's House Party, hosted by Noel Evans. And he's been sort of back

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.360
 in the news recently, just there's been a few sightings of him and there's been a costume put

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.280
 up on sale and all this. And I was reading this piece in the news statement, "Beautiful piece" by

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:40.440
 Stuart Mccony, all about Mr. Blobby. And I just wanted to read you this line because it's, I think

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.360
 maybe the most beautiful thing that's ever been written about Mr. Blobby. "Malice and stupidity

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:49.880
 were never far from Blobby's puce bulbous surface. There was surely something of Antonin Artode's

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.760
 Theatre of Cruelty in Blobby's defiantly senseless nihilistic interventions."

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.600
 He's such a great writer.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:01.800
 He's great. And so he basically, he would just cause absolute mayhem and break things and,

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.840
 you know, sit on people and throw them, get in fights.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.800
 Yeah. What was the name of this guy who, who played him?

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.240
 He was called Barry Killaby.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:13.800
 Barry Killaby. And he's gone off and done other things. He's done bits of acting.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.160
 He was in "Chucklevision," for instance, with the Chucklebrothers on stage.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:24.680
 And just before COVID, he put on a one-man theatre show about the final days of Harry Houdini.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:31.400
 Again, not in the Blobby costume. He was just doing that. But he has come back and he is doing

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:36.760
 the Blobby from time to time. He still goes into the Blobby suit. The reason being that actually

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.600
 is a lot of acting is, you know, it's a difficult thing to do to get the point across when you're

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:47.080
 in a massive suit. But recently he was on "This Morning" on ITV. And he was punched in the stomach

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:53.480
 by Maggie Philbin. And the article said that he let out a piercing scream and fell down like a sack

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:59.480
 of spunts. Now, what I find interesting about that is that Barry had just done a play about Harry

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.560
 Houdini. How did Harry Houdini die?

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.600
 He was punched in the stomach.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.800
 He was punched in the stomach.

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:04.760
 Oh, yes.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.800
 Barry must have thought it was the end of his days, wasn't it?

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.280
 So it's happening again.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:15.240
 Does Blobby have an appendix? Which I think Houdini had a plendositis and that's...

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.680
 We don't know about Blobby's organs. We don't know about the organ structure of a Blobby.

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.520
 No, we don't. No, that's very exciting.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.200
 That's really... Oh, God, what a spot.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:27.000
 That's interesting. What your mind does because I definitely thought that Houdini died

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.240
 from getting trapped in one of his boxes with chains wrapped it. And that's obviously something

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.480
 I've just invented in my head from films or something.

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.920
 Yeah, no. It would be a good dramatic irony.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.120
 Yeah.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:41.400
 Barry was just... Well, we're talking about his sort of other life outside of Mr. Blobby.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:46.680
 So he was married once and then he and his wife broke up

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:50.200
 and then he got together with someone else. And do you know who it was?

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:50.840
 Miss Blobby?

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.720
 It was Mr. Blobby.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.240
 No.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.560
 Yeah, not Mrs. Blobby. Mr. Blobby.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:02.920
 So he was split from his wife and he was invited down to the

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:07.480
 staging of the Crinkley Bottom Castle show. So Crinkley Bottom is where Noel's House Party

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.680
 took place. It's where it kind of...

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.400
 It's a fictional village.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:13.160
 ...fictional village and they opened up a theme park. They did three in total,

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.960
 which were basically Mr. Blobby theme parks.

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:19.160
 And part of it was that obviously Mr. Blobby's a character there.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:24.280
 So Barry got invited down to teach all the aspiring Blobby's how to move inside the suit.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:29.480
 And one of the people, one of the Blobby apprentices was this woman who he then got

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.280
 on with and they ended up getting together and moving in with each other.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.840
 So yeah, he's with another Blobby.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:35.720
 Incredible.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.160
 Yeah, just she's stuck it out.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.920
 Blobby, I mean I want to know so much about the story.

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.520
 I want to know what Blobby Academy was like.

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:44.040
 I want to see a boot camp montage of Blobby's school.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:47.640
 And then I want to see the moment where she takes off the Blobby head

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.600
 and he realises, oh my god, you're the love of my life.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.240
 And they lean into kiss but they can't quite make it.

00:46:53.240 --> 00:47:02.120
 I looked at other trained actors in costumes like that.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:09.640
 So Teletubbies, Simon Shelton played Tinky Winky and he was a trained ballet dancer

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.520
 and choreographer.

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.960
 I mean many of them, you know, they're just classically trained, you know,

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:17.240
 actors and often, often dancers because of the movement.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:22.920
 And I don't know if I think we've all got, we've all got boys, haven't we, little boys?

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.720
 I've got a girl.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.440
 Oh, you've got a girl?

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:24.920
 Oh yeah.

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:29.480
 But does anyone actually delete all of this because it's completely relevant to what I'm about to say?

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.120
 But in The Night Garden.

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:32.920
 Oh yeah.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.600
 So that's my dog's favourite show.

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:34.920
 Yes.

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:35.800
 Yeah, my boys love it.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:36.840
 It's Billy's favourite show.

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:43.400
 Iggle Pigle is played by Nick Kellington who also starred in two of the recent Star Wars films

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.520
 and The Dark Crystal.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.880
 Whoa, is that right?

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.920
 It's quite a range.

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.880
 Wow.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:52.040
 I read the other day that Little Monster from Justin's house, while we're on there,

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:57.320
 was also in Jurassic Park, like one of the new Jurassic Parks.

00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.120
 Okay, right.

00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:58.840
 A dinosaur.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:47:59.240
 Oh.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.720
 No, so Little Monster's like a little Muppet thing.

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:06.200
 But it's the person whose hand is up, Little Monster was also on the dinosaur.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.880
 Wait, so were you watching Jurassic Park and some random guy goes,

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.720
 "Could I get the," and you're like, "I know that hand."

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:15.640
 That's brilliant.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:20.200
 Didn't Barney the Dinosaur, he went on to become a Tantric sex instructor?

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.880
 The guy who played the witch.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.760
 There was some controversy wasn't there with Barney the Dinosaur.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:25.560
 Was that what it was?

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.440
 I think that's what he did.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.920
 That's so interesting because there was a New York Times article about Mr. Blobby in the 90s

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.320
 saying, "What the hell is this thing in the UK?"

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.200
 And they compared him.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.160
 They were saying he's basically Britain's Barney.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:41.640
 Yes, he's very similar except with chaos because Barney's a very measured safety,

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.680
 health and safety guy.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.240
 I was reading a piece comparing the two.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.200
 The Fence magazine, which is a brilliant magazine, it said,

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.000
 "Blobby was a dark mirror to Barney the Dinosaur."

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:59.400
 And a later blobby called Paul Denson said he was a reaction to that, to Barney the Dinosaur,

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.880
 to say, "What would England have if it was shite?"

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:05.400
 And that's what Mr. Blobby is.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.600
 That's so funny.

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.160
 He was created by a man called Michael Lego.

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.360
 What?

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.200
 Yeah, and I just like that.

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.920
 Yeah, just in keeping with kids, he was called Mr. Lego.

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:15.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.720
 Can I just say one more thing about In the Night Garden?

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.280
 Yeah.

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:21.800
 It's worth just mentioning while we're on this topic that obviously the narrator

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:27.400
 of In the Night Garden is National Treasure multi-award-winning Sir Derek Jacobi.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.680
 Yes, that's right.

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:35.080
 So you've got this, you know, absolutely hugely famous, fantastic actor going,

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.520
 "Maka paka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka waka.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:41.720
 "My name is Eagle Piggle."

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.000
 Is that a pip?

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.840
 I said it all the time.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.200
 But they're all like that, aren't they?

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.960
 It's like, who does the Klangas?

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.160
 It's someone really famous.

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:49.880
 What's up, it's Olivier.

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.720
 Late Olivier.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.520
 What was that?

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:56.520
 And Blobby.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.080
 Oh yeah.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.200
 I can't go again.

00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.480
 Please, Mr.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.600
 Sorry, I'm so sorry.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.120
 How familiar are you with him?

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.880
 I'm not, I'd love to meet Blobby.

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.640
 It's kind of hard to overach how much a big thing Blobby was in the 90s in Brexit.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:10.120
 So was he?

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:10.920
 So I wasn't here, was he?

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.320
 Huge.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:11.800
 Yeah, right.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.360
 Huge.

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:12.840
 Oddly.

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:13.320
 Huge.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:13.960
 Okay.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.720
 Let's, Dan, you want some stats?

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.040
 Yeah.

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.600
 His Christmas single in 1993.

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.040
 Sold 600,000 copies.

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:22.040
 Which is pretty good.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:22.440
 Thank you.

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.560
 Got the Christmas number one.

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:23.800
 Yeah.

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.640
 Nearly didn't.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.880
 Was knocked off the top spot by Take That the week before

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.760
 and then reclaimed it the following week to get the Christmas number one.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:36.600
 Merch included lemonade, bubble bath, knitting patterns, pasta, lampshades.

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.560
 I mean, anything you could imagine had Blobby put on it.

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:42.280
 One of the businessmen evolved so that they'd done some research in the 90s

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.920
 and found that every household in the country owed at least one piece of Blobby merchandise.

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:47.400
 Wow.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.920
 That must have been on average.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:51.640
 Because we didn't have any growing up.

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.560
 No, I had two.

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:54.280
 Exactly. There we go.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:54.680
 There we go.

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:55.000
 It worked.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:55.560
 The system worked.

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.680
 Rachel, how many did you have?

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:56.680
 None.

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.480
 Oh, okay.

00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.040
 Okay.

00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:58.840
 Anna will have had two.

00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.320
 Yeah.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:50:59.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:00.520
 Knowing Anna.

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:00.520
 Yeah.

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:04.600
 I was trying to look into, I'm sure everyone else did,

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.960
 other similarities between Shakespeare and Mr. Blobby.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.560
 What a great idea.

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.720
 And I couldn't find many.

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:12.680
 I found a couple.

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.480
 One is that, one thing they share is that,

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.760
 so this theme park stuff I was talking about,

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:21.640
 there was an abandoned place of one of them.

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:25.080
 And one of the houses there that survived was called Dun Blobben House,

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.480
 which is what, is that where he lived?

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.360
 Dun Blobben House?

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.680
 Blobby, if he had a house.

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.560
 Well, this was his house in the place.

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.480
 And so they left it and it was abandoned.

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:39.240
 And so what would happen is, is that ravers would come and have parties all night long in it

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:43.080
 and they would just use it as an abandoned party house basically.

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:47.720
 And so the local guy who owned the area was so pissed off that people kept coming

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:52.280
 that he smashed it down, not dissimilar to Shakespeare's home.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:52.680
 You know.

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:53.560
 Do you remember Shakespeare's house?

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.520
 Is that the link?

00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:54.920
 Yeah.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.680
 I thought your link was at Dun Blobben's house,

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.280
 but like Dun Senane, maybe?

00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.480
 Oh yeah, yeah.

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:03.160
 No, so where Shakespeare's house was, there was the owner of it,

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:06.920
 was so sick of tourists coming and taking photos and messing about that he just knocked it down.

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:07.160
 What?

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.920
 And so we lost Shakespeare's, yeah.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.000
 A place, so there's one similarity.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.280
 Well, second similarity.

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.560
 Oh, sorry, I didn't realize you had one.

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:16.680
 I worked really hard, Andy, to find this, so I'll just quickly get this on.

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.960
 So the 1993 Christmas single that you were mentioning,

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.640
 in which there's a very famous video that goes along with it,

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.080
 it was a parody video.

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:30.200
 And there's a parody video, it's the link, by Shakespeare's sister, The Bear.

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.200
 They parodied that.

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.360
 So there's your second Shakespeare connection.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.000
 You got them, everyone.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:35.560
 All right, amazing.

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.760
 It's almost too close, actually.

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.600
 It's eerie.

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:42.200
 I was thinking of links, and I didn't put in as much work as Dan.

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.320
 No.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.520
 How could I?

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:48.360
 But I was just thinking measure for measure,

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:51.480
 which Barry Kiloby was stirring it, is a problem play.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.640
 As in, there are these three categories of Shakespeare plays,

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.680
 the tragedies, the histories, the comedies, and you know, they're all clear.

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:59.080
 And then there's this fourth quasi category,

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.600
 which is called the problem plays.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.960
 And it's basically, they don't obey any of the rules of any of it.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:07.080
 So measure for measure is kind of, it has comedy elements,

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:10.040
 but there's also a really serious death penalty plot line.

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.040
 So it's a problem that you can't put it into a category,

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:12.520
 is that the problem?

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.080
 Yeah, it's just, it's more problematic for scholars studying it.

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:19.080
 It's kind of one of these weird, and lots of the later plays are more problem play-ish.

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:20.680
 I think people say the tempest is one as well.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.920
 And I, in a way, blobby.

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.280
 Oh, Jesus.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.920
 Well, he doesn't catch the late comedy and tragedy, I would say.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.040
 Exactly, exactly.

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:29.720
 He is comic and tragic at the same time.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.920
 He puzzles scholars.

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:32.440
 Exactly.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.280
 So I think that's watertight.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.600
 I've got a link between blobby and Dickens.

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.920
 Oh my God, wow, expanding.

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:40.840
 Well, this is cool, because actually, like,

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:43.000
 the thing about Noel's House Party is,

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.080
 they were just looking for something for Noel Edmonds to do.

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:48.040
 So they gave him 18 different shows that he might possibly do,

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.960
 and they chose this one because it was the best one.

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:53.560
 But they had complete autonomy, so they could do what they wanted.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.640
 And they didn't have a commissioner telling them what to do.

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.080
 They didn't have someone at the BBC saying,

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:58.520
 "You can do this or you can't do this."

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.200
 They could do whatever they want.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.120
 And quite often when you find that in TV,

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.840
 it's like people take a lot of care about things,

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:07.240
 and there's lots of, like, hidden jokes and stuff.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:08.840
 And apparently there's a bookcase,

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.000
 or there was a bookcase on the side of the set,

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.160
 that you never saw.

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.520
 You couldn't read any of the books,

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:17.000
 but all the books had got blobby titles.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:17.480
 Oh, cool.

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.680
 And so there was, like, blob finger instead of gold finger.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:21.640
 Oh, I love it.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.560
 And Martin Blubblewit.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.560
 That's one of the books.

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.000
 That's brilliant.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:27.320
 Yeah.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.160
 But didn't Dickens have a fake bookcase in his house?

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:29.560
 He did.

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:29.960
 He did.

00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:30.280
 He did.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:32.520
 He had a bookcase in his house which had fake book titles,

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.720
 and it was hiding the door to another room or a panel or something,

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.560
 but it was, or it was above a doorway.

00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:40.120
 And so both blobby and Charles Dickens had the same idea.

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:40.680
 Amazing.

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.640
 Wow.

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.520
 Blobby is basically a literary great, is what we're saying.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:44.680
 Yes.

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:45.160
 Yeah.

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:45.640
 Yeah.

00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:46.520
 Yeah, he's huge.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.400
 Interestingly, we'll never know what Barry Killaby thinks

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.880
 about Mr. Blobby, because he's never done an interview.

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:52.520
 Isn't that weird?

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:53.160
 Ever.

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:53.480
 Sorry.

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.840
 I totally thought you were going to a really macabre ending.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:59.480
 Because he's dead.

00:54:59.480 --> 00:54:59.720
 Yeah.

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.440
 No, I don't think he'll ever do an interview about it.

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.160
 As in lots of people have tried to make contact over the years,

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.960
 and I think either he just thinks of it as a job,

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:11.080
 and he just doesn't want to become a personality associated with it,

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.880
 whatever the reason, he's never, ever done it.

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:15.640
 And it seems like he never will.

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:16.360
 Interesting.

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:16.840
 Yeah.

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:17.480
 And he's--

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.040
 Sorry.

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:22.120
 I was just going to say, I like the idea of the people who don't know about Mr. Blobby

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:27.720
 and Noel's house party googling it and seeing what it was.

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.200
 Yeah.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.000
 That's such a treat ahead of you.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:29.560
 Such a treat.

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:33.800
 And also, if you just see, like, say, a one minute clip of that show,

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:38.200
 that will in no way explain what happens in the rest of the show.

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.680
 You really have to watch our show.

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.000
 Yeah, I have no idea what I see or what it is.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:43.400
 It's a lot.

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:47.400
 One of the things you were saying about how so much weird stuff happened on that show,

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.440
 one of them was NTV, and I don't know if you remember that.

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:53.480
 So what it was is they would go into someone's house,

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:57.240
 and they would put a camera on their TV, and they would talk to them live.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.280
 Oh, wow, cool.

00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:58.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:55:58.840 --> 00:55:59.880
 It was amazing.

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:00.520
 It was so cool.

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.880
 And they could win prizes or something.

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:02.440
 Did they know?

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:03.240
 Did they know that was it?

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.440
 No, they didn't know.

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:08.200
 And the amazing thing was, when you see interviews with Michael Lego,

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:13.000
 he basically said, every day, we didn't know if it was going to work.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.720
 And you would be stressed out all the way through the week.

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:19.560
 And the only time you could breathe is when that person didn't swear

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.480
 or say something terrible live on air or whatever.

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.280
 Stop masturbating.

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:24.680
 Oh, Blobby.

00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:29.720
 But apparently, there was a researcher who would go and meet this person the week before

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:33.800
 surreptitiously and pretend that they were just randomly meeting this person.

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.720
 Didn't tell them they were on TV or anything.

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.800
 So get into their house, set up the camera.

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.240
 Were they with a-- yeah, exactly.

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.680
 Were they applying the camera to the TV?

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:43.880
 Yeah, so someone would have to nominate you,

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.800
 and that person would have access to the TV.

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.880
 So they'd make sure you weren't in at the time.

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:50.840
 But a researcher would just come up, someone you've never met before,

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.400
 and you would come up with some story

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:56.280
 that they would chat to you to make sure you weren't a person

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.280
 who was going to do something terrible live on TV.

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:03.160
 I feel like if you flunked out of MI5, that would be a job that you could take.

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:08.200
 It's spy-adjacent, but you're not actually doing any spying.

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:11.880
 I feel like you would get-- because the Cold War's finished at that time in the 1990s.

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:17.320
 A lot of those spies went on to do MTV and Blobby.

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:22.280
 There was a lot of gunging as well on it, the gunge tank.

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:27.240
 Where sometimes guests, wouldn't they, would get gunged.

00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.960
 So you'd be in a big glass tank and gunge would fall on you.

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:35.240
 But gunge featured fairly heavily on British TV.

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.320
 Yeah, get your own back with Dave Bensonfield.

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.200
 It was very gunge-heavy.

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.240
 There's someone-- this won't make the edit--

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.600
 but there's someone, a guy on social media.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:50.200
 I think it's only on Instagram, who I sort of assume it's all women,

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:54.280
 but certainly as me and a load of women I know,

00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:59.160
 constantly comments, Rachel, will you get gunged?

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.200
 Are you willing to get gunged?

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.000
 Please respond.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.400
 Just back on the gunge question.

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.080
 Would love to see you get gunged.

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.120
 Are you willing?

00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.560
 Always very polite.

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:09.800
 Like, wants it to be fully consensual.

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.760
 And very persistent.

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.440
 Like, to be fair, I don't think I've ever replied.

00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.880
 But like, the comments to everyone are the same.

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:18.920
 He just wants to see.

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.320
 Certain people get gunged.

00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:23.400
 Does he have the capacity to gun?

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.880
 I don't think I should ask.

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.160
 I think he'd take that as a maybe.

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.360
 Just ask, what's your setup?

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.400
 Is he using a classic '90s gunge recipe,

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:33.960
 or is this him?

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:36.040
 Has he recreated his own gunge in a sort of--

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.000
 I don't like to think of that.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.600
 Oh, God.

00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:46.040
 Well, or is it someone who worked on '90s television

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.200
 and has kind of picked up this fetish?

00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.560
 He's got all this leftover gunge

00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.080
 after the show got cancelled.

00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.280
 What am I going to do with this gunge?

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.200
 It reminds me of the story.

00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.200
 This isn't my story, so I'm not sure if we can keep it in.

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:58.120
 But you know Rich Turner, our very good friend,

00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.480
 who Dan and I worked with a lot,

00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:04.120
 and as a radio producer and worked on TV for many, many years.

00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:07.000
 He worked on a kid's show in the '70s for the BBC.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.960
 And he said that there was a child,

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.400
 and they've kind of--

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.760
 They've been-- it wasn't gunged,

00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.160
 but there was like a flower fight, you know?

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.720
 So they covered him flower, like this.

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.120
 And then someone on set had to shout out,

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:22.520
 "Can someone deflower this child, please?"

00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:28.680
 And that was the only time that was ever heard of him in 1970s

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.480
 at the BBC.

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:36.440
 OK, that's it.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.640
 That is all of our facts.

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.000
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.840
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:43.320
 about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.160
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:46.600
 I'm on @Shrieberland.

00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:47.080
 James.

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:48.120
 At James Harkin.

00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:48.760
 Andy.

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:49.880
 Will you be gunned?

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:54.440
 Rach?

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:55.480
 Rachel Parris.

00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:58.440
 Yeah, and remember, as we said at the top of the show,

00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.680
 you can see Rachel live on stage

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.800
 as part of the great ostentatious ensemble.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.480
 It is such an amazing night.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.040
 It's live improvised Jane Austen novels

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.040
 that have never been performed before.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:13.720
 They've been written, I think, 6,000 of them or something like that,

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.480
 that were lost to time, have been found.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.920
 They perform a new one each night,

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.960
 and that's on in the West End.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.760
 So do check out online to find tickets for that

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.080
 or make sure to get her book.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.880
 It is now out on paperback, Advice from Strangers.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.720
 It's out March 23rd.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.760
 It's where Rachel spent basically a year of stand-up life

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.520
 going around the UK in Annan Dabra,

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.040
 taking advice from strangers

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.720
 and working out the answers

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.720
 and working out the philosophy of what they were saying,

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:39.080
 meaning it's a brilliant book.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.360
 It's out now on paperback.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.120
 So do check it out and do come back next week.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.320
 We'll have another episode.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.040
 We'll wait in for you.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.080
 We'll see you then.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:45.880
 Goodbye.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.780
 (upbeat music)

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:51.360
 (upbeat music)
