00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:19.360
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.800
 this week coming to you from Arnmore in Glasgow, Scotland.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.200
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and please welcome to this stage its Adich Zinsky, Andy Murray

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 and Judge Markins.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.160
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160
 the last seven days, and in a particular order here we go, starting with you, Andrew

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:01.160
 Hunter Murray. My fact this week is that for just one penny you can rent a B for a month.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
 [laughter]

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.160
 What are we doing here?

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.160
 So what would you do with one B?

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.160
 Well you make friends, you take them on expeditions.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.280
 So as we mentioned before on this podcast, a lot of bees in America live on trucks, and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:36.680
 the reason they do is because they move around the country all the time because they rented

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.600
 out to pollinate crops, and they have this whole like basically a tall schedule where

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.320
 they move from area to area pollinating a new crop every few weeks.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.880
 And there's a massive crop, the Californian Almond Crop, Almond, and that needs one and a half

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:59.520
 million beehives, which is a total of at least 30 billion bees, which is amazing.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.080
 They all arrive around the same time, and so they arrive, they pollinate the crop, and

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.080
 then they go.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.000
 And an American beekeeper whose name is Randy Oliver has calculated the cost of it, and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.560
 he worked out that the cost is one penny, one US penny in fact, so a bit less than an English

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.000
 penny, per bee per month.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.440
 So one English penny would get you 1B for two months, I think it's about 1.6.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.440
 Six weeks.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.440
 Yeah.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.440
 Oh, okay.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.440
 No worth it.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.640
 It won't work for the holiday I'm thinking, I'm so happy.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.800
 So you must get more than one, presumably, you must do it and there's no like number of

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.240
 bees, and then the minimum option is one, so what I'm asking is, what is the minimum number

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.040
 of bees that I couldn't hire?

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.040
 Don't know.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.040
 Okay.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.040
 You could probably...

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.040
 I've got a tenor in my pocket.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.040
 It is a Scottish tenor.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.040
 That would get you.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.040
 They weren't except that James.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.040
 Trust me.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:11.360
 Hang on, wait, if it's one penny, let's just say it's one penny, so wait, wait, wait, wait,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.360
 it's a thousand.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.320
 But I don't think that's enough for a hive, I think the minimum is probably at least one

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.320
 hive.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.320
 Okay.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.720
 Do you know how bees collect pollen, I didn't know this, it's so cool.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.120
 So they go and bees will go out, they'll either be collecting pollen or they'll be collecting

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.000
 nectar, they never do both at once, you don't want to mix those two.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.320
 And if they're collecting pollen, they get under a flower and they get covered in pollen

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.000
 because they've got, you know, their hairy, their furry, and so pollen sticks all over

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 them.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.600
 But that's okay because they've got combs on their front four legs, so they use the combs

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.920
 on their front two legs to comb the pollen out of their antennae, and they use the combs

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.560
 on their middle legs to comb the pollen out of their fur on their body, and then they've

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.280
 got these two kind of buckets on their back legs, which I think they're called pollen

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.280
 baskets.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.840
 And they're like, I mean, they just look like little baskets on the back of their legs,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.480
 and they crush the pollen once they've combed it out of their hair into these two little

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.280
 baskets, and then they carry it home in their pollen baskets.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.280
 Isn't that cool?

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.280
 That's very cool.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280
 Yeah.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.280
 That's amazing.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.520
 And the one really amazing thing about bees is that they have a positive charge.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.520
 They're electric.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.520
 Bees are electric.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.520
 If you're putting them into a remote control, or do you get double bee and triple bee

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:34.080
 and that proves you.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.400
 So what happens?

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.320
 So the bee flies through the air, and it kind of hits particles in the air, and that gives

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.320
 it a positive charge.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.080
 A bit like if you get a balloon and you rub it against yourself, and that gives the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.520
 balloon a charge, it's a bit like static, but the flowers have a negative charge, and that

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.080
 means that when a bee goes into a flower, the pollen will actually jump, just jump from

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080
 the flower to the bee.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.080
 Wow.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.080
 Using a lot of electricity.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.840
 I've read today, bees don't pee or poo in space.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.280
 Why would you go to, I don't go to space to poo, Eilah.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.280
 That was the thing.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.680
 Yeah, but if you were in space, you would, at some point, so I see, so when we send bees

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.680
 up there.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.680
 Yes.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.680
 So they hold it in.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.320
 So a bunch of bees were sent to space, and in space, they actually started.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.440
 So a lot of little insects have been sent to space, particularly flying insects to see how they

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.160
 can cope with flying, and there's, I watched them amazing footage today, by the way, of

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.680
 opinions inside one of those vomit rockets that go down.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.680
 They let them loose.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.040
 If you don't know the vomit rocket, it's where they film zero gravity without leaving the

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.040
 earth's atmosphere.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.040
 So you can do the weightlessness.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.040
 And also, actual astronauts use it to practice being in zero energy.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.040
 Yeah, exactly.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.040
 So basically the plane is, what is it?

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.600
 So it goes up in a parabola, and it kind of makes it feel like you're weightless.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.600
 Okay.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.120
 So you fly around, and yeah, so on, and, you do.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.400
 So they brought pigeons on board, and the pigeons just didn't know what was going on because

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.760
 they couldn't, they couldn't just fly and bumping into walls.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.840
 At one point, a pigeon is flying upside down, and the others are like, what the, it's really

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.840
 confusing.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.800
 That's, that's where pigeons will get their alien abduction stories.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.920
 So they brought, they brought a bunch of bees into space, and they, they brought houseflies,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.760
 and their houseflies, actually, they say for houseflies, it's a no-fly zone.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.920
 They just don't bother.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.080
 They don't even try.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.080
 They start trying.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.080
 They can't fly.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.000
 So either they just try and cling to the wall, or they just stay still and just float

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 everywhere they go.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.840
 So houseflies don't fly in space.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.440
 These kind of after about seven days worked out what to do, and they managed to, they even

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.440
 built a honeycomb.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.160
 They even managed to make residents.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.200
 And the, the main thing they noticed though, is that they just didn't go to the toilet.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.160
 They were holding until they got back to earth.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.960
 Well, I think it's because they were put in an enclosed hive, a space hive, weren't

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.960
 they?

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.120
 And bees do not defecate in their own hives.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.120
 They don't shit with the eat.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.200
 And so they literally thought, well, if I can't get out of this thing, then I'm not

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.200
 going to put in it.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.200
 They're too polite.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.200
 So they held it in for a week.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.200
 Yeah.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.720
 Because if they held it in thinking, I'll do it when I get back.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.720
 That's quite optimistic.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.880
 Because they're just bees.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.960
 They don't know that they're actually going to come back to them.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.960
 Wow.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.960
 Yeah.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.960
 So interesting, right?

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.800
 Moths, when they went into space, actually learned to, I think they were the smartest flying

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.800
 creature.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.960
 They learned that they could kind of float in space.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.520
 So when you try to flap, it doesn't really work because you get so disoriented.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.120
 But the moths and zero gravity very quickly realize that they could change the method of

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.920
 flying and turn more into seagulls.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.760
 And then they just sort of float it around on the air.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.760
 Right?

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.760
 Yeah.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.760
 Oh, cool.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.760
 That's very cool.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.760
 Well, then Moths, very clever.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.320
 Do you know why honeybees die when they sting you?

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.560
 So most of the vast majority of bees don't die when they sting you.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.520
 But most honeybees do die when they sting you.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.440
 And it's because all of their insides are falling out.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.440
 So I know.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.440
 It's really sad.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.440
 What do you mean?

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.840
 So when they put their sting into you, I think human skin is a bit too hard.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:11.200
 So they can't properly retract their sort of barbed stinger as it comes out.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.600
 So instead, what it does is rather than leaving behind just its sting, as it tries to pull away,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.480
 it leaves behind, inside you, it's digestive tract and it's abdomen and everything.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:26.800
 So, and then that, because it's not really a bee any more, it's just a lump of fluff.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.320
 So that's over for them.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.520
 You've found Muth even in a horrible horrible fact.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:38.480
 But they evolved to mostly sting other insects or other bees or, yeah, so that's what the

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.480
 sting is really for.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.520
 And they have no problem stinging them without, you know, without that happening to the world.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.960
 So when they sting something with really tough skin and to a bee, we have really tough skin.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.960
 Yeah.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.480
 We need to move on soon to the next fact.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.760
 Oh, can I just talk about other things you can rent?

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.760
 Yeah.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.760
 James.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.280
 So you were very lucky to get off with the caution, I don't think.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.000
 Guinea pigs.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 You could rent guinea pigs.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Guinea pigs.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.120
 Yeah, in Switzerland, you can rent guinea pigs, but only Switzerland as far as I can find.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:19.240
 And that's because according to Swiss law, it's illegal to have one guinea pig on its own.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.200
 You need to have a second guinea pig because they're really kind of sociable creatures and

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.520
 if you have one, they get lonely.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.240
 And so the Swiss made a law against it.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.240
 Wow.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.200
 So what happens is one of your guinea pigs dies and you're like, OK, now I've only got one guinea pig.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.720
 I'm going to have to get another one.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.360
 But what would happen is you get a young one and then the old one would die.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.080
 And then you'd have to get another young one and you just be in some horrible cycle of just

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.760
 always getting more and more guinea pigs.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.440
 So some people have seen a gap in the market and thought, you know what we can do?

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.520
 We can rent one until the second one dies.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.520
 And that's the thing.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:02.800
 God, I must say, the Swiss parliament really does have time on his hands, I'd say.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:10.120
 In Japan, you can rent an attractive man to wipe away your tears.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.640
 Is there a phone number or a website?

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.200
 I ordered one for you. He's back to stage.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.440
 Yeah, isn't this totally bizarre?

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.600
 It's definitely true.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.840
 It's a Tokyo-based company.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:30.600
 It's called Icomisodanshi and that means apparently roughly translated as handsome weeping boys.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.400
 And it's if they're, you know, it's for women, specifically.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.880
 And apparently women are prone to going to the workplace or whatever and bursting into

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.880
 tears.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.440
 And so we need to hire attractive weeping boys to come and turn up to the office, wipe away

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.640
 your tears and come for you.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:51.960
 OK, interestingly, I have been to Tokyo and I have seen the clubs they have which are

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.440
 kind of just handsome young men clubs.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.440
 They're women.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.480
 They're aimed at women and they're aimed at women I didn't go in.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.200
 But it's just sort of, like, handsome young men hanging around in there looking cool and

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.200
 a bit emo.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.960
 And the bill's very unreasonable as well.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.360
 50,000 yen for a coke.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.920
 But that sort of fits into that trend.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.920
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.920
 Yeah, it does.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.920
 Yeah, I'm sorry, that sounds traumatic for you.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.920
 It's very hot.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.720
 I think you've got a little Olaf waiting next door.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:25.720
 Oh, is a really good Japanese name, I just didn't know it was him.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:33.880
 Samurai, Olaf, we should move on to our next facts.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.200
 OK, it's time for fact number two.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.440
 And that is my fact.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.760
 My fact this week is that Iceland imports ice.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.280
 Yeah, it actually does.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.440
 In shops now, you can get ice in Iceland.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:53.480
 And particularly this one shop, which is called had cup, and it's a sort of grocery store,

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.480
 and they import ice.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.480
 You buy them in blocks of four.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.960
 And it doesn't make any sense at all because the water in Iceland is rated a total 100 percent

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.960
 for freshness.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.200
 So if they've got great water that you can turn into ice, but they bring it in from Norway.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.320
 So they now import ice from Norway.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.320
 That's really good.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.320
 Yeah.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:18.320
 So I via the Twitter account of a guy called Janar, who was the mayor of Reykjavik, and

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.240
 he was actually a comedian who hated what was going on in the country, and he thought this

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.240
 is just bullshit.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.160
 I'm going to run, I'm going to run his mayor of Reykjavik.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.560
 So he said, I'm going to set up a party.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.560
 They said, what are you going to call it?

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.640
 And he said, the best party will be the best party.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.880
 So they set up the best party.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.280
 We've spoken about this on the podcast before, and he made all the promises that anyone

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.280
 wanted him to make.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.280
 So he was like, what do you want?

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.280
 I'll give you anything.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.280
 I said, we want free towels.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.280
 You'll have free towels.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.040
 When I'm mayor, everyone will have free towels.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.800
 Is that the first thing that the people demand it?

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.520
 I think they wanted to test the grounds first and see what he was going to go for.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.520
 What?

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.760
 He could also say afterwards, by the way, here's my main promise, whatever you ask for and

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.080
 I agree to, I will break once I become mayor.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.000
 So when he became mayor, he said, you're getting no free towels.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.160
 I didn't know that Britain exports ice to China, anyway, and to Sweden.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.920
 The British exports of ice to China have tripled in the last three years.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.920
 Wow.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.920
 Probably from quite a low base.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:20.320
 But still, we have a company, there's a company in Yorkshire called The Ice Company.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.320
 So not.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.320
 Very good name.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.320
 Yeah, not.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.600
 I mean, a good, a descriptive name, if nothing else.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.960
 And they make 500 tons of ice a day, they're in South Kirkby in Yorkshire.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.960
 And this is the cool thing.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:36.240
 So they have these machines which make ice, massive machines, and they make 300 pound

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.040
 blocks of really crystal clear, beautiful looking ice.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.000
 And it's made in these huge freezing compartments, right?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.840
 And the water gets frozen in cylinders and then huge blades chop it up.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.000
 And then the cubes of ice are blow-dried, so they don't stick to each other.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 Wow.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Yeah.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Yeah.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.960
 So somewhere there's someone whose job is to be an ice hairdryer.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.960
 Is that weird?

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.960
 That is weird.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:05.360
 Well, clear ice is very sought after, and I think this might be why this Norwegian ice has

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.840
 been imported, because I think it's Mr. Iceman, isn't it?

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.840
 Yes.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.920
 Which, again, is a very good name.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.360
 And it, so I went to the Mr. Iceman website, and it's the Mr. Iceman ice that's now being

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.240
 sold in Iceland.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.720
 And they advertise about that they've got the hardest ice in the world.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.720
 So you can, if you're fee, if it's a special occasion, you drop one of these blocks of ice

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.320
 on your whisky and it takes twice as long to melt as an ordinary block of ice.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.200
 So that's what everyone wants.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.000
 It says, "For those that appreciate a whisky cold, but not diluted, they will cherish the

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 ice block."

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.480
 Which is actually quite a good idea.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.520
 Do you know the queen likes ice?

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.520
 But she does.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.520
 Actually, that's a great fan.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.680
 But she doesn't like the noise that ice makes in the glass.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.200
 Does she have special flunkies to whenever the ice is getting close to the edge of the glass?

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.720
 Just dip their finger in and let it rebound off.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.760
 I don't think the queen would like fingers in that drink.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.000
 She drinks gin and du bonnet, it's her favorite drink.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.480
 And she hates the noise that the ice makes.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.480
 And so her favorite flunky Prince Philip invented a machine.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.960
 He invented a machine that makes tiny ice bowls that don't grate against each other.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.680
 And so now she can have her drink and it doesn't make any noise.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.320
 He invented Prince Philip invented a machine.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.320
 Yeah.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:33.320
 I mean, they say it's tough at the top, but I had no idea just how tough it was.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.360
 Well, that makes a really tiny ice bowl.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.280
 Tiny little ice bowls.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.280
 Those are popular.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.360
 I've heard about them in fancy bars and things.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.520
 They have sort of hand-carved ice bowls, which are good bites.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.520
 Right.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.520
 Yeah.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.520
 Wow.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.520
 And some unusual imports.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.520
 Okay.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.520
 So Germany imports Lederhosen.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.520
 Wow.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.520
 Really?

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.520
 There's only 100 others.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.360
 Fewer than 100 businesses making Lederhosen left in Germany and they get most of them from

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.360
 China, though.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.360
 Wow.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.360
 That's one thing.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.560
 Australia imports Dingo urine.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.560
 Imports.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.560
 Yeah.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.560
 Where are the Dingo's from?

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.560
 Where's that side Australia?

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.600
 I think the thing is with Dingo urine, it's quite important that you have to get it from

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.600
 a captive Dingo.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.400
 You can't just go into the wild and just grab a Dingo and like a lot of zoos around the

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.240
 world have Dingo's in them and so they get the urine from these places and then they

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.280
 import them into Australia and they use them to deter other animals.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.280
 Right.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.280
 And they cost us.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.280
 Right.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:33.200
 It's not true, I don't think it's even made in Australia and I'm drinking it now, I love

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.200
 it.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.920
 So I feel really bad about that comment for a number of reasons.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.520
 And it's illegal to bring dirty mattresses into Canada.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.520
 What?

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.440
 You're not allowed to import a dirty mattress into Canada.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.840
 You have to have it fumigated and you need a letter from the fumigator proving that you've

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.840
 done it.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.800
 I wouldn't want someone bringing a dirty mattress into my house.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.760
 And what is a country but a big house?

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:05.600
 Doesn't Canada mean large village in like an old native American language?

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.600
 I don't know.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.600
 It does.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.600
 Okay.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.600
 I believe it.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.600
 What do you say?

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.600
 What do you say it doesn't this?

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.600
 You mean this is a thing.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.000
 Franz imports all its frog sex, doesn't it?

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Hard to say.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 Yes.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Yes.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 From Southeast Asia.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Yes.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 I think mainly from the Philippines, Indonesia, mainly from Indonesia and something

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 from Japan.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.440
 And yeah, I think frog farming is now illegal in France or, yeah, I think you can't really

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.640
 farm frogs in France but they still consume them and so they get them all from Southeast

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.640
 Asia.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.120
 And they're becoming massively endangered frogs in Southeast Asia.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.440
 Lots because the French eat about a incredible number of tons of frogs legs a year.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.440
 Wow.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.440
 Yeah.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.440
 So it's very bad.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.440
 It doesn't need.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.440
 Cops is.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.920
 The corpse trade is picking up.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:53.400
 I think it's a problem in some countries like Turkey that people don't want to donate

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.920
 their bodies after they've died and so there's a cadaver shortage.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.920
 Is it for like, dissection and...

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.920
 It's for dissection.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:05.080
 Yeah, so for medical purposes and for like crash test dummies so if they're testing airplanes

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.640
 and things like that, they use human corpses.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.640
 They do that.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.160
 Yeah, they don't tell you that when it's the donate your body to science.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.160
 They sit you in cars and this is true.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.160
 They sit you...

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.720
 Who is they?

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.200
 They sit you in cars and they just slam the cars into walls and they sit because

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.760
 with a crash test dummy, a real crash test dummy, you can't tell what things will break in

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.760
 an actual crash.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.760
 So it's saving people.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.440
 Or blown up by a land mine, that's the other potential option.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.440
 Is it?

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.600
 They test land mines on, which I would have thought is very obvious, if a land mine blows stuff

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.600
 up, it blows stuff up.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.600
 But no, they test...

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.520
 But then the important thing with that is you need to know if there's a body part, this

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.520
 distance away, where was the original land mine.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.040
 So it's all that kind of thing.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.160
 This is all very important science, Andy.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.360
 They actually, someone invented, just on land mines, someone has invented, this is quite

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:01.880
 a while ago, seeds that you scatter out into fields and when the plants grow, they touch

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:07.200
 the land mine metal and so what would otherwise be, let's say, a yellow flower, then goes red.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.320
 So for all these countries that still have unblasted land mines, you can now see them.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.000
 It's a quite a beautiful solution, they say, to how you can...

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 It's amazing.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Yeah.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Yeah.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.920
 Unless you don't know that they've done that and you want to pick a nice bunch of

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.920
 flowers.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.920
 And these things...

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.200
 The yellow ones are a bit boring on land.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.480
 Why don't you go and get a bunch of the red, Danny?

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:35.840
 And that's Valentine's Day ruined.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.200
 We need to move on to the next thing.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.200
 Okay, let's move on.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.200
 Should we go for it?

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.200
 Yeah.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.800
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James Harkin.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:49.040
 Okay, my fact this week is that the most dangerous invasive species in Britain is a poo-eating

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.760
 muscle from Transylvania.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.720
 It's true, man.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.720
 It's true.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:01.000
 This is a really bad evil muscle that's come in from Transylvania, and they are blocking

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 up our toilets.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.280
 I would have thought they'd be helping relieve the blocked toilets.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.440
 Yes, that's a good point, but they have to live there, and they are really, really good

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:17.520
 at reproducing, and one female is capable of producing one million babies in a year.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.480
 Oh, yeah, what's she called?

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.720
 So how are they getting here?

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:24.720
 You would get on ships.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.040
 Yeah, on ships, bilges, and things like that.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:31.200
 So when a ship is going from one place to another, they actually collect water from one

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.840
 area to kind of keep the ballast, and then when they get to the other place, they'll often

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.960
 release it, and then you'll end up with species moving from one place to another.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.280
 It's like the bees.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.360
 It's exactly like the bees.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.360
 Okay.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.360
 Yeah.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.360
 Yeah, the bees of the ocean.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.360
 Yeah.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.920
 It's our fault, it's not their fault, they were happy in Transylvania.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.800
 We brought them over, and they did what they did.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.840
 Well, though, it's not just humans that can bring invasive species, because I went to a

00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:01.480
 Glasgow museum today, and they said that there's, what was it, it was a, it was a plant called

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.000
 speawatt, and that's been brought to this area, and it's causing a real problem, and it was

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.240
 brought on the feet of geese, so when they flew over from, I think, from Africa, they carried

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.800
 this little plant over, and now it's become an invasive species.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.800
 So it's not always us.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.800
 Oh, thanks a lot.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800
 Wow.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.800
 Geese.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.800
 Yeah.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.240
 And it's guys.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.080
 So mussels get about reputation, don't they?

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.760
 If you look at mussels, there's pretty much no one's got a good word to say about them.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.320
 They're invasive species everywhere, and they're probably in the Great Lakes in America,

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.320
 I think.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.120
 So these, are they Quagga mussels?

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.120
 Yeah, Quaggas.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.880
 Quaggas, and zebra mussels, I think.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.360
 In America, they have zebra ones, and here we have Quaggas, but they're both named

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.600
 after horse-like creatures.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.480
 Because a Quagga is like an extinct type of zebra, right, isn't it?

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.480
 What's up with that?

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.480
 [laughter]

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.480
 Quagga mussels.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.880
 One of the things they do to native species of mussels, they literally sit on them and

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.680
 kill them by doing that.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.960
 So I know, they physically push them into the sediment on riverbases and things like

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.800
 that, and it's sort of the native species are crushed.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.200
 And one of the species, which is at risk, one of the native species of mussels is called

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.160
 "Siu d'un ordante complanata", and its common name is the depressed river mussel.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.160
 [laughter]

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.360
 What a grimly prophetic name.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.360
 [laughter]

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:27.160
 But, yeah, they were in ecosystems, like, ecosystems don't they?

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:33.240
 So in Great Lakes, they eat all the algae, I think, which then stops feeding organisms,

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.000
 which then feed other organisms, then it wipes out everything.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.800
 And so you're just ever the lake full of mussels, which is a disaster.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.120
 But I think they shouldn't get us such a bad rep, because they are natural water

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.120
 filters.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.120
 Okay.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.560
 You could just drop a mussel in some dirty water and then drink it a little bit later.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.560
 You couldn't do that.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.920
 But they do, they do sieve water.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:59.240
 So when they are, when they're looking for a meal, then they take the water in and they filter

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.560
 it through their tissues and they absorb some of the stuff that they want from the water

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.320
 and then they release the rest of it.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.240
 And what they absorb are a lot of the horrible chemicals in the ocean.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.880
 So they'll absorb herbicides, they'll absorb like flame retardants, they'll absorb a lot

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:16.360
 of the poisons that we put into the oceans, and they will release purified water.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.120
 So they're using that to remove contaminants in quite a lot of lakes.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.920
 Well, of course, that's one of the reasons why they make us so sick if you have a bad one,

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.520
 because they're kind of filtering dirty water and leaving nice water, but they keep all the

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.360
 nasty things that make people sick.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.360
 Yeah.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.720
 And then if you get a bad one, yeah, that's why you get sick.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.720
 Yeah.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.200
 So this quagga, one of the reasons it's quite bad is not only does that eat human excrement,

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.400
 but there are other animals that eat its excrement.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:48.920
 And one of them is a killer shrimp that they call the pink peril.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.160
 Whenever it comes into any, whenever it goes into any lake, it kills all the other shrimps

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.160
 there.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:59.240
 And so these two guys always kind of co-invade lakes or rivers.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.640
 So whenever there's a muscle there, there's always the killer pink shrimp there as well.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.640
 Right.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.640
 And that's why it's like doubly bad.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.640
 That's mortifying, isn't it?

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:10.000
 You're not even the guy who eats the poo, you're the guy who eats the poo of the guy who

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 eats the poo.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Wow.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.560
 You know there's actually animals now that disguise themselves as poo so that they don't get eaten.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.560
 Is that right?

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.560
 Yeah.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.040
 So they would, if the muscle was around, they'd be in big trouble.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.200
 But most animals don't eat them.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.040
 So there's one that's called the moth caterpillar.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.320
 So the moth caterpillar does have sort of little white bits on it and little brown bit.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.720
 And it will disguise itself in a sitting position to look like bird droppings.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.720
 So it's just quite safe.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:42.040
 Anytime a bird sees it, things are, that's poo, I'm not going to risk it this time.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:47.360
 So you've got the moth caterpillar, there's the orb weeping spider, there's a giant swallowed

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.800
 tail butterfly, and then this one's really on the nose, bird droppings spiders.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.040
 And they all do that.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.040
 They all disguise themselves.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.800
 It's the evolutionary thing.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.360
 And yet then they give themselves that giveaway name.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:03.440
 It's like, what was the point of going to that trouble?

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:09.640
 They should have called themselves just some bird droppings, nothing to do here.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:15.320
 So NASA have actually asked the community of scientists around the world and said that

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:20.320
 we'll be a prize for this if you can convert poo into a eating product because when we

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.360
 go for these long haul missions to Mars, you are going to need everything that you can

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:29.840
 get to be reused as potential source for something and they think poo might be what we

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.840
 can use for food.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:37.840
 What is the judging panel of this competition?

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.220
 Actually, you know, Heston Blumenthal has now contributed to space food.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.220
 I see.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.220
 Yeah.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:49.040
 So Tim Peake, the British astronaut who's gone up in space, he worked with Heston Blumenthal

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.600
 and his people and they've created a bacon sandwich that can be made and eaten and a cup

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.320
 of tea that can be made and drunk.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.320
 Wow.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.320
 And they're made up, too.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.320
 Well, they didn't tell Tim that.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.320
 Yeah.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.320
 So that's quite cool.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.920
 So Heston's already getting into space.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.920
 Great.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.920
 Oh.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:11.360
 Speaking of defecation and Transylvania, which is where this poo eating muscle comes from, there's

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:18.120
 the Salina Terda Salt Mine, which is this huge salt mine and it was a salt mine until 1932.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.120
 So it's massive.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.680
 I think it's in the capital, the biggest city in Transylvania and it sounds like the coolest

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680
 holiday ever now.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.680
 Have you seen it?

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680
 Really?

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.680
 Yeah.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.680
 They converted it.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:34.440
 So it's this massive expanse of mine under the main city there and they've turned it into

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.440
 basically a theme park.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.680
 It's this underground theme park.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.160
 It is in 1992.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.320
 So it's got this massive 180 seat amphitheater.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.240
 It's got basketball courts.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.560
 It's got like ping pong tables.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.560
 It's got mini golf.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.560
 It's got bowling.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.920
 You get carried around this big underground theme park in the old machinery that was used

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.920
 for mining once.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.160
 They've got a huge underground lake and you can go on the lake and little boats.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.880
 They've got this ferris wheel that takes you up around it and you can look at the stalactites

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.120
 and the stalactites as you go around on it.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.840
 And they've transformed this disused salt mine.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.600
 They didn't know what to do with for 50 years into the best theme park in the world.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.600
 Sounds amazing.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.600
 Yeah.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.600
 We should go there.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.600
 And that's in Terda.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.600
 That's in Terda.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.600
 Yeah.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.040
 The edict of Terda is quite a famous thing, which is I think it was a kind of thing where

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.040
 it meant that in Transylvania everyone was allowed to have any religion they wanted and it was

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.600
 one of the first places in the world that had this.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.240
 And I have this theory that that's why kind of people think of Transylvania as kind of

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:37.040
 this weird kind of gothic place because the Catholic Church saw that it was a place where

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.640
 anyone could have any religion they wanted and they kind of didn't like it.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.640
 Oh.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.640
 Yeah.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.920
 I think it might be because they had a leader called Raddy and Pela who had to pay hundreds

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.520
 of thousands of people on spikes.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.520
 Yeah.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.520
 They're a good place to be.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.520
 They're a good place to be.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.520
 They're a good place to be.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.520
 They're a good place to be.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.640
 So let's move on to our final fact of the show and that is Chisinski.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.640
 Yeah.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:02.960
 My fact is that until about 4,000 years ago, humans didn't notice the colour blue.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.520
 Or most humans didn't notice the colour blue.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.520
 Okay.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.160
 Just escape their notice.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.000
 So I'd not heard of this before.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.840
 And so since reading into it, it's really fascinating.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.840
 It's amazing.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:21.360
 So the idea effectively is that someone looked through all the old literature that we

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:26.040
 have, any bit of writing, ancient Iceland, homer's odyssey, all that sort of stuff.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.160
 And any time that there should have been a reference to blue, they used a different colour.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.480
 And so the idea is that they actually think that maybe because there was no word describing

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:39.520
 it, we just didn't notice the sky, which is where you're looking at the big blue thing

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.720
 in the sky.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.280
 And as a result of not naming it, it was just blended into different colours.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.280
 Yeah.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.600
 It is extremely controversial that.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.600
 Yeah.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:53.600
 This is a very controversial idea, but I think what corroborates it really nicely is that.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:59.000
 So this guy who went through all these ancient texts, and it is from many different cultures.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.680
 So yeah, Greece, China, Japan, Hebrew languages, none of them had the word for the colour blue.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.280
 They started off all having black and white.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.640
 They were the first words to colour words to appear.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.680
 And then red was the next one.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.280
 Then yellows and greens came in, and then blue was last.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.440
 And the idea that maybe people weren't really noticing blue, or sort of couldn't distinguish

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.160
 it from others, does make a bit of sense when you look at this research that was done by

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:29.240
 a guy called Jules Davidoff, and he did this research in Namibia with the Himbert tribe,

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:33.040
 and the Himbert tribe does not have a word for blue at all.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.040
 And you can look this up.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.040
 It's really, really cool to do.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:40.800
 What he did was he showed members of the Himbert tribe a series of, I think, it was 12 dots,

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.120
 and 11 of them were bright green, and one of them was bright blue.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.600
 And he said, "Which one is the blue one?"

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.200
 And they couldn't tell.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.280
 They just didn't know it, all the same to them, and so they really couldn't distinguish

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.280
 it.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.560
 But then that tribe has many, many more words for green than we have.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:00.000
 And they showed them a 12 green circles, and said, "Which one is the different shade

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 of green?"

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.080
 And if you look at the green circles, you cannot tell.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.520
 I can't tell which one was the lighter shade of green, and everyone who they tested immediately

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.120
 spotted the lighter shade of green.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:15.120
 But the idea is that because they have more words to describe it and to distinguish between

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.600
 them, that we sort of learn, we automatically learn to distinguish that.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.080
 I think it's a really, really interesting idea.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.080
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.160
 There's another kind of fact, which isn't really a fact, which no one could actually

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.520
 see the colour blue, or maybe they were colour blind or something back in the day.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.640
 And the idea is, Homer wrote about the sea, and he said it was the wine dark sea.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.040
 And people are like, "Why is he saying wine dark instead of blue?"

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.040
 Wine dark.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.520
 Because when you see the sea in the evening, sunsert, it does, it can look the colour of

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.520
 wine.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.200
 So maybe all the wine was bright blue.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.200
 Yeah.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.200
 It's just the ones mentioned.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:52.360
 Well, there is a theory that they, in those days, they used to add water to the wine because

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.240
 the wine was a lot kind of stronger, so they'd add water to it.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.600
 And the water might have had a high alkaline content, which made it look a bit more blue.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.120
 And they made their wine look a bit more blue.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.320
 That seems like a little bit like Clutchy that's stressed to me.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.320
 Yeah.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.360
 I don't think we'll ever resolve this argument one way or the other.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.360
 It is amazing to think of it, though.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.360
 It's very, very cool.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.960
 I went on to a website called XKCD, where you guys must know this.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.960
 It's a webcomic.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.960
 Wow!

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.960
 I think that's what I'm going to say.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.960
 I think the webcomic is in tonight.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.080
 So it's a webcomic by Ronald Monroe, and he kind of explains things.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:27.000
 And he did a really good kind of study where he looked at colours, and he had men and women

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.280
 looking at all different colours and saw how they described them, to see if there was

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.280
 any difference.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.960
 And they found that actually men and women was pretty much the same, apart from women

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:39.920
 tend to add more things like light green and lime green, whereas men would just say something's

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.920
 green.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.920
 Just green.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.920
 It's just green.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.120
 But why, why he did that?

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.120
 So that was a general thing.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.120
 But what he did was...

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.120
 Classic lads.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.120
 Let's look at it.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.120
 Let's look at it.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.120
 Let's look at it.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.120
 Let's look at it.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.360
 I'm going to have the pub and not qualify colours.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:32:00.520
 Sorry, James.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:04.920
 So what he did, what he did was, that was kind of a general thing, but he looked at all

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.160
 the different things that people had said and tried to find which were the most male comments

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.200
 and which were the most female comments.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.960
 So these are the colours that women said much more often than men.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:22.720
 So dusty teal, blush pink, dusty lavender, butter yellow and dusky rose.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.080
 So they were things that women said that men really didn't say.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.600
 And the things that men said that women really didn't say for colours were penis.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:40.720
 I mean, it's not that it's not one colour for a star.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.200
 It's just green, mate.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:49.680
 You've got to see a doctor.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.760
 Who's beautiful grass?

00:32:53.760 --> 00:33:03.960
 It's green, it might be.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:15.000
 So, penis, don't know, beige, spelt with an A and WTF.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.400
 Wow.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:22.200
 Yeah, apparently women can't see those colours.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.640
 True, true facts.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:34.720
 Speaking of penises, I've found and the colour of blue.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:40.680
 Scientists have worked out how now to if they can flash a blue light at your eyes and give

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.680
 you an erection.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:47.040
 It's a really new thing that's happening at the moment.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:55.120
 At the moment, they've only been able to give mice erections, but they're working on it

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.120
 for humans.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:01.680
 And the idea is that it stimulates a thing inside your eye that leads directly to a part

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.800
 of your penis, which I wrote down.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:12.640
 It's called Corpus cavernosum.

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.960
 It's a region that gets filled up with blood to facilitate an erection.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:23.400
 So you see this light and it opens it up and you can go crazy.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:31.400
 I don't understand the science of it, but it was really hard to read the main sign of it.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:46.600
 That was part of it, wasn't it, that part of it.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.080
 Go on, you're around to realise.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:56.680
 So the guy that the scientist is working on it, he calls it erectileopogenetic stimulator

00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.400
 and when he was asked about it, so he said it's quite simple.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.680
 Sometimes you get past the gene therapy part of it, shine a blue light, cause dick to get

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.680
 hard.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.160
 And that's basically the science.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.160
 It's amazing.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.160
 It's to do with an algae as well.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.320
 It's apparently a bit of an algae that they've taken out.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:22.220
 I don't know if I've mentioned this about the new alternative to Viagra, which is playing

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.600
 sounds to your penis.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.600
 What?

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.480
 Yeah, it's like Viagra doesn't always work and sometimes it has side effects, but this

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.920
 is the thing, they get a machine, they put it on the men's parts and they play very, very

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.600
 high clicks like this.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.600
 It is real.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.320
 Just you like Dolphins a bit much.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:48.080
 Is this a very, very coded way of telling us about your awakening when he's all flipper?

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.160
 But it does work.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.160
 It does work.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.160
 That's incredible.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.160
 It kind of excites the blood vessels to kind of open.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.160
 Wow.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.160
 Wow.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.160
 This is real science people.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:03.160
 I mean, I've got a fact about eyes and colour perception, but I'm not sure we can go back.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.160
 I've been really happy if we went back.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.160
 Okay.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.160
 Yeah, let's go back to ours.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.160
 Yeah.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.160
 Okay.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:15.900
 Tarantulas have evolved to be blue or for parts of them to be blue separately on eight

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.720
 different occasions in nature and we don't know why.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.360
 Why do they keep forgetting how to be blue and I mean to re-evolve it?

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.560
 When they branched off into separate, I think it's separate genuses and separate species.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.280
 Or maybe it's separate species within the same genus.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.680
 They have independently in though once they've branched off.

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.680
 I see.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.320
 They have no idea.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.760
 And they don't have good colour vision.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.680
 So it's not like they know.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.000
 That's the really weird thing.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.520
 And it's not driven by sexual selection because they can't see when each other a blue.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.400
 They have no idea.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.400
 They can't tell.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.400
 So we have no idea.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.720
 Maybe it hides them from the prey or maybe it, you know, has some other effect, but yeah.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.720
 Wow.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.720
 How weird.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:00.080
 I was reading that you can now get your eyes turned blue if you have brown eyes for $5,000.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:04.560
 The idea is that actually right behind every brown eye is a blue eye because it's all to

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.560
 do with colour.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.000
 So you can actually burn away the brown and sitting behind it is the natural blue.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 Yeah.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 So people are doing this now.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 They say that babies all have blue eyes.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 I don't know if it's true, but they do say that.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 That's true, isn't they?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 They do.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 As all babies have very pale blue eyes for the first few days and then they sort themselves

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 out.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 Get their acts together.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 That's really cool.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.880
 If I hadn't recently spent all my money renting these, I would definitely put my eyes.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.880
 Let's wrap up.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.880
 Shall we wrap up?

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.880
 Okay.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.880
 That's it.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.880
 That is all of our facts.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880
