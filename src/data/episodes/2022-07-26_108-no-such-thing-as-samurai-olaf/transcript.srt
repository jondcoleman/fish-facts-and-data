00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:19,360
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,800
 this week coming to you from Arnmore in Glasgow, Scotland.

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,200
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and please welcome to this stage its Adich Zinsky, Andy Murray

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:40,200
 and Judge Markins.

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:47,160
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,160
 the last seven days, and in a particular order here we go, starting with you, Andrew

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:01,160
 Hunter Murray. My fact this week is that for just one penny you can rent a B for a month.

9
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,160
 [laughter]

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,160
 What are we doing here?

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,160
 So what would you do with one B?

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,160
 Well you make friends, you take them on expeditions.

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,280
 So as we mentioned before on this podcast, a lot of bees in America live on trucks, and

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:36,680
 the reason they do is because they move around the country all the time because they rented

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,600
 out to pollinate crops, and they have this whole like basically a tall schedule where

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,320
 they move from area to area pollinating a new crop every few weeks.

17
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,880
 And there's a massive crop, the Californian Almond Crop, Almond, and that needs one and a half

18
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:59,520
 million beehives, which is a total of at least 30 billion bees, which is amazing.

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,080
 They all arrive around the same time, and so they arrive, they pollinate the crop, and

20
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
 then they go.

21
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:11,000
 And an American beekeeper whose name is Randy Oliver has calculated the cost of it, and

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,560
 he worked out that the cost is one penny, one US penny in fact, so a bit less than an English

23
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,000
 penny, per bee per month.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,440
 So one English penny would get you 1B for two months, I think it's about 1.6.

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
 Six weeks.

26
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
 Yeah.

27
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
 Oh, okay.

28
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440
 No worth it.

29
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,640
 It won't work for the holiday I'm thinking, I'm so happy.

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,800
 So you must get more than one, presumably, you must do it and there's no like number of

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,240
 bees, and then the minimum option is one, so what I'm asking is, what is the minimum number

32
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,040
 of bees that I couldn't hire?

33
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
 Don't know.

34
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
 Okay.

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
 You could probably...

36
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
 I've got a tenor in my pocket.

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
 It is a Scottish tenor.

38
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
 That would get you.

39
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,040
 They weren't except that James.

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
 Trust me.

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:11,360
 Hang on, wait, if it's one penny, let's just say it's one penny, so wait, wait, wait, wait,

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
 it's a thousand.

43
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,320
 But I don't think that's enough for a hive, I think the minimum is probably at least one

44
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
 hive.

45
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
 Okay.

46
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,720
 Do you know how bees collect pollen, I didn't know this, it's so cool.

47
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,120
 So they go and bees will go out, they'll either be collecting pollen or they'll be collecting

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,000
 nectar, they never do both at once, you don't want to mix those two.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,320
 And if they're collecting pollen, they get under a flower and they get covered in pollen

50
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,000
 because they've got, you know, their hairy, their furry, and so pollen sticks all over

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 them.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,600
 But that's okay because they've got combs on their front four legs, so they use the combs

53
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,920
 on their front two legs to comb the pollen out of their antennae, and they use the combs

54
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,560
 on their middle legs to comb the pollen out of their fur on their body, and then they've

55
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,280
 got these two kind of buckets on their back legs, which I think they're called pollen

56
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
 baskets.

57
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,840
 And they're like, I mean, they just look like little baskets on the back of their legs,

58
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,480
 and they crush the pollen once they've combed it out of their hair into these two little

59
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,280
 baskets, and then they carry it home in their pollen baskets.

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
 Isn't that cool?

61
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
 That's very cool.

62
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
 Yeah.

63
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
 That's amazing.

64
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,520
 And the one really amazing thing about bees is that they have a positive charge.

65
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
 They're electric.

66
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,520
 Bees are electric.

67
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,520
 If you're putting them into a remote control, or do you get double bee and triple bee

68
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:34,080
 and that proves you.

69
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,400
 So what happens?

70
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,320
 So the bee flies through the air, and it kind of hits particles in the air, and that gives

71
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
 it a positive charge.

72
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,080
 A bit like if you get a balloon and you rub it against yourself, and that gives the

73
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,520
 balloon a charge, it's a bit like static, but the flowers have a negative charge, and that

74
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,080
 means that when a bee goes into a flower, the pollen will actually jump, just jump from

75
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
 the flower to the bee.

76
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
 Wow.

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
 Using a lot of electricity.

78
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:04,840
 I've read today, bees don't pee or poo in space.

79
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,280
 Why would you go to, I don't go to space to poo, Eilah.

80
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
 That was the thing.

81
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,680
 Yeah, but if you were in space, you would, at some point, so I see, so when we send bees

82
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
 up there.

83
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
 Yes.

84
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
 So they hold it in.

85
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
 Yeah, yeah.

86
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,320
 So a bunch of bees were sent to space, and in space, they actually started.

87
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,440
 So a lot of little insects have been sent to space, particularly flying insects to see how they

88
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,160
 can cope with flying, and there's, I watched them amazing footage today, by the way, of

89
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,680
 opinions inside one of those vomit rockets that go down.

90
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
 They let them loose.

91
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,040
 If you don't know the vomit rocket, it's where they film zero gravity without leaving the

92
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
 earth's atmosphere.

93
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
 So you can do the weightlessness.

94
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,040
 And also, actual astronauts use it to practice being in zero energy.

95
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
 Yeah, exactly.

96
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
 So basically the plane is, what is it?

97
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,600
 So it goes up in a parabola, and it kind of makes it feel like you're weightless.

98
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
 Okay.

99
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,120
 So you fly around, and yeah, so on, and, you do.

100
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,400
 So they brought pigeons on board, and the pigeons just didn't know what was going on because

101
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,760
 they couldn't, they couldn't just fly and bumping into walls.

102
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,840
 At one point, a pigeon is flying upside down, and the others are like, what the, it's really

103
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
 confusing.

104
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,800
 That's, that's where pigeons will get their alien abduction stories.

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,920
 So they brought, they brought a bunch of bees into space, and they, they brought houseflies,

106
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,760
 and their houseflies, actually, they say for houseflies, it's a no-fly zone.

107
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,920
 They just don't bother.

108
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,080
 They don't even try.

109
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
 They start trying.

110
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
 They can't fly.

111
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,000
 So either they just try and cling to the wall, or they just stay still and just float

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 everywhere they go.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,840
 So houseflies don't fly in space.

114
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,440
 These kind of after about seven days worked out what to do, and they managed to, they even

115
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
 built a honeycomb.

116
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,160
 They even managed to make residents.

117
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,200
 And the, the main thing they noticed though, is that they just didn't go to the toilet.

118
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,160
 They were holding until they got back to earth.

119
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,960
 Well, I think it's because they were put in an enclosed hive, a space hive, weren't

120
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
 they?

121
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,120
 And bees do not defecate in their own hives.

122
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
 They don't shit with the eat.

123
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,200
 And so they literally thought, well, if I can't get out of this thing, then I'm not

124
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
 going to put in it.

125
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
 They're too polite.

126
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
 So they held it in for a week.

127
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
 Yeah.

128
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,720
 Because if they held it in thinking, I'll do it when I get back.

129
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
 That's quite optimistic.

130
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,880
 Because they're just bees.

131
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,960
 They don't know that they're actually going to come back to them.

132
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
 Wow.

133
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
 Yeah.

134
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
 So interesting, right?

135
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,800
 Moths, when they went into space, actually learned to, I think they were the smartest flying

136
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
 creature.

137
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,960
 They learned that they could kind of float in space.

138
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,520
 So when you try to flap, it doesn't really work because you get so disoriented.

139
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,120
 But the moths and zero gravity very quickly realize that they could change the method of

140
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,920
 flying and turn more into seagulls.

141
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,760
 And then they just sort of float it around on the air.

142
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
 Right?

143
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
 Yeah.

144
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
 Oh, cool.

145
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
 That's very cool.

146
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
 Well, then Moths, very clever.

147
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,320
 Do you know why honeybees die when they sting you?

148
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,560
 So most of the vast majority of bees don't die when they sting you.

149
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,520
 But most honeybees do die when they sting you.

150
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,440
 And it's because all of their insides are falling out.

151
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
 So I know.

152
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
 It's really sad.

153
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
 What do you mean?

154
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,840
 So when they put their sting into you, I think human skin is a bit too hard.

155
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,200
 So they can't properly retract their sort of barbed stinger as it comes out.

156
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,600
 So instead, what it does is rather than leaving behind just its sting, as it tries to pull away,

157
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,480
 it leaves behind, inside you, it's digestive tract and it's abdomen and everything.

158
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,800
 So, and then that, because it's not really a bee any more, it's just a lump of fluff.

159
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,320
 So that's over for them.

160
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,520
 You've found Muth even in a horrible horrible fact.

161
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,480
 But they evolved to mostly sting other insects or other bees or, yeah, so that's what the

162
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
 sting is really for.

163
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,520
 And they have no problem stinging them without, you know, without that happening to the world.

164
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,960
 So when they sting something with really tough skin and to a bee, we have really tough skin.

165
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
 Yeah.

166
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,480
 We need to move on soon to the next fact.

167
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,760
 Oh, can I just talk about other things you can rent?

168
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
 Yeah.

169
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
 Yeah, yeah.

170
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
 James.

171
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,280
 So you were very lucky to get off with the caution, I don't think.

172
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,000
 Guinea pigs.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 You could rent guinea pigs.

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Guinea pigs.

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,120
 Yeah, in Switzerland, you can rent guinea pigs, but only Switzerland as far as I can find.

176
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,240
 And that's because according to Swiss law, it's illegal to have one guinea pig on its own.

177
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,200
 You need to have a second guinea pig because they're really kind of sociable creatures and

178
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,520
 if you have one, they get lonely.

179
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,240
 And so the Swiss made a law against it.

180
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
 Wow.

181
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,200
 So what happens is one of your guinea pigs dies and you're like, OK, now I've only got one guinea pig.

182
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,720
 I'm going to have to get another one.

183
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,360
 But what would happen is you get a young one and then the old one would die.

184
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,080
 And then you'd have to get another young one and you just be in some horrible cycle of just

185
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,760
 always getting more and more guinea pigs.

186
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,440
 So some people have seen a gap in the market and thought, you know what we can do?

187
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,520
 We can rent one until the second one dies.

188
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
 And that's the thing.

189
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:02,800
 God, I must say, the Swiss parliament really does have time on his hands, I'd say.

190
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,120
 In Japan, you can rent an attractive man to wipe away your tears.

191
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,640
 Is there a phone number or a website?

192
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,200
 I ordered one for you. He's back to stage.

193
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,440
 Yeah, isn't this totally bizarre?

194
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,600
 It's definitely true.

195
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,840
 It's a Tokyo-based company.

196
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:30,600
 It's called Icomisodanshi and that means apparently roughly translated as handsome weeping boys.

197
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,400
 And it's if they're, you know, it's for women, specifically.

198
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,880
 And apparently women are prone to going to the workplace or whatever and bursting into

199
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
 tears.

200
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,440
 And so we need to hire attractive weeping boys to come and turn up to the office, wipe away

201
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,640
 your tears and come for you.

202
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,960
 OK, interestingly, I have been to Tokyo and I have seen the clubs they have which are

203
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,440
 kind of just handsome young men clubs.

204
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
 They're women.

205
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,480
 They're aimed at women and they're aimed at women I didn't go in.

206
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,200
 But it's just sort of, like, handsome young men hanging around in there looking cool and

207
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
 a bit emo.

208
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,960
 And the bill's very unreasonable as well.

209
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,360
 50,000 yen for a coke.

210
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,920
 But that sort of fits into that trend.

211
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
 Yeah, that's amazing.

212
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
 Yeah, it does.

213
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
 Yeah, I'm sorry, that sounds traumatic for you.

214
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
 It's very hot.

215
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,720
 I think you've got a little Olaf waiting next door.

216
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,720
 Oh, is a really good Japanese name, I just didn't know it was him.

217
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:33,880
 Samurai, Olaf, we should move on to our next facts.

218
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,200
 OK, it's time for fact number two.

219
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,440
 And that is my fact.

220
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,760
 My fact this week is that Iceland imports ice.

221
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,280
 Yeah, it actually does.

222
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,440
 In shops now, you can get ice in Iceland.

223
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,480
 And particularly this one shop, which is called had cup, and it's a sort of grocery store,

224
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
 and they import ice.

225
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
 You buy them in blocks of four.

226
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,960
 And it doesn't make any sense at all because the water in Iceland is rated a total 100 percent

227
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
 for freshness.

228
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,200
 So if they've got great water that you can turn into ice, but they bring it in from Norway.

229
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,320
 So they now import ice from Norway.

230
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
 That's really good.

231
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
 Yeah.

232
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:18,320
 So I via the Twitter account of a guy called Janar, who was the mayor of Reykjavik, and

233
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,240
 he was actually a comedian who hated what was going on in the country, and he thought this

234
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
 is just bullshit.

235
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,160
 I'm going to run, I'm going to run his mayor of Reykjavik.

236
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,560
 So he said, I'm going to set up a party.

237
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
 They said, what are you going to call it?

238
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,640
 And he said, the best party will be the best party.

239
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,880
 So they set up the best party.

240
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,280
 We've spoken about this on the podcast before, and he made all the promises that anyone

241
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
 wanted him to make.

242
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
 So he was like, what do you want?

243
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
 I'll give you anything.

244
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
 I said, we want free towels.

245
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
 You'll have free towels.

246
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,040
 When I'm mayor, everyone will have free towels.

247
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,800
 Is that the first thing that the people demand it?

248
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,520
 I think they wanted to test the grounds first and see what he was going to go for.

249
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
 What?

250
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,760
 He could also say afterwards, by the way, here's my main promise, whatever you ask for and

251
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,080
 I agree to, I will break once I become mayor.

252
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,000
 So when he became mayor, he said, you're getting no free towels.

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,160
 I didn't know that Britain exports ice to China, anyway, and to Sweden.

254
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,920
 The British exports of ice to China have tripled in the last three years.

255
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
 Wow.

256
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
 Probably from quite a low base.

257
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,320
 But still, we have a company, there's a company in Yorkshire called The Ice Company.

258
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
 So not.

259
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
 Very good name.

260
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
 Yeah, not.

261
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,600
 I mean, a good, a descriptive name, if nothing else.

262
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,960
 And they make 500 tons of ice a day, they're in South Kirkby in Yorkshire.

263
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
 And this is the cool thing.

264
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:36,240
 So they have these machines which make ice, massive machines, and they make 300 pound

265
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,040
 blocks of really crystal clear, beautiful looking ice.

266
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,000
 And it's made in these huge freezing compartments, right?

267
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,840
 And the water gets frozen in cylinders and then huge blades chop it up.

268
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,000
 And then the cubes of ice are blow-dried, so they don't stick to each other.

269
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Wow.

270
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Yeah.

271
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Yeah.

272
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,960
 So somewhere there's someone whose job is to be an ice hairdryer.

273
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
 Is that weird?

274
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
 That is weird.

275
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:05,360
 Well, clear ice is very sought after, and I think this might be why this Norwegian ice has

276
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,840
 been imported, because I think it's Mr. Iceman, isn't it?

277
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
 Yes.

278
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,920
 Which, again, is a very good name.

279
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,360
 And it, so I went to the Mr. Iceman website, and it's the Mr. Iceman ice that's now being

280
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,240
 sold in Iceland.

281
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,720
 And they advertise about that they've got the hardest ice in the world.

282
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,720
 So you can, if you're fee, if it's a special occasion, you drop one of these blocks of ice

283
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,320
 on your whisky and it takes twice as long to melt as an ordinary block of ice.

284
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,200
 So that's what everyone wants.

285
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,000
 It says, "For those that appreciate a whisky cold, but not diluted, they will cherish the

286
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 ice block."

287
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,480
 Which is actually quite a good idea.

288
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,520
 Do you know the queen likes ice?

289
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
 But she does.

290
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,520
 Actually, that's a great fan.

291
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,680
 But she doesn't like the noise that ice makes in the glass.

292
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,200
 Does she have special flunkies to whenever the ice is getting close to the edge of the glass?

293
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,720
 Just dip their finger in and let it rebound off.

294
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,760
 I don't think the queen would like fingers in that drink.

295
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,000
 She drinks gin and du bonnet, it's her favorite drink.

296
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,480
 And she hates the noise that the ice makes.

297
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,480
 And so her favorite flunky Prince Philip invented a machine.

298
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,960
 He invented a machine that makes tiny ice bowls that don't grate against each other.

299
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,680
 And so now she can have her drink and it doesn't make any noise.

300
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,320
 He invented Prince Philip invented a machine.

301
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
 Yeah.

302
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:33,320
 I mean, they say it's tough at the top, but I had no idea just how tough it was.

303
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,360
 Well, that makes a really tiny ice bowl.

304
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,280
 Tiny little ice bowls.

305
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
 Those are popular.

306
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,360
 I've heard about them in fancy bars and things.

307
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,520
 They have sort of hand-carved ice bowls, which are good bites.

308
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
 Right.

309
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
 Yeah.

310
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
 Wow.

311
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
 And some unusual imports.

312
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
 Oh, yeah.

313
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
 Okay.

314
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
 So Germany imports Lederhosen.

315
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
 Wow.

316
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,520
 Really?

317
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
 There's only 100 others.

318
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,360
 Fewer than 100 businesses making Lederhosen left in Germany and they get most of them from

319
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
 China, though.

320
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
 Wow.

321
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
 That's one thing.

322
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,560
 Australia imports Dingo urine.

323
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,560
 Imports.

324
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
 Yeah.

325
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
 Where are the Dingo's from?

326
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
 Where's that side Australia?

327
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,600
 I think the thing is with Dingo urine, it's quite important that you have to get it from

328
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
 a captive Dingo.

329
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,400
 You can't just go into the wild and just grab a Dingo and like a lot of zoos around the

330
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,240
 world have Dingo's in them and so they get the urine from these places and then they

331
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,280
 import them into Australia and they use them to deter other animals.

332
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
 Right.

333
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
 And they cost us.

334
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
 Right.

335
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,200
 It's not true, I don't think it's even made in Australia and I'm drinking it now, I love

336
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
 it.

337
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,920
 So I feel really bad about that comment for a number of reasons.

338
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,520
 And it's illegal to bring dirty mattresses into Canada.

339
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
 What?

340
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,440
 You're not allowed to import a dirty mattress into Canada.

341
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,840
 You have to have it fumigated and you need a letter from the fumigator proving that you've

342
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
 done it.

343
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,800
 I wouldn't want someone bringing a dirty mattress into my house.

344
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,760
 And what is a country but a big house?

345
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,600
 Doesn't Canada mean large village in like an old native American language?

346
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
 I don't know.

347
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
 It does.

348
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
 Okay.

349
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
 I believe it.

350
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
 What do you say?

351
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
 What do you say it doesn't this?

352
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
 You mean this is a thing.

353
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,000
 Franz imports all its frog sex, doesn't it?

354
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Hard to say.

355
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Yes.

356
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Yes.

357
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 From Southeast Asia.

358
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Yes.

359
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 I think mainly from the Philippines, Indonesia, mainly from Indonesia and something

360
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 from Japan.

361
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,440
 And yeah, I think frog farming is now illegal in France or, yeah, I think you can't really

362
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,640
 farm frogs in France but they still consume them and so they get them all from Southeast

363
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
 Asia.

364
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,120
 And they're becoming massively endangered frogs in Southeast Asia.

365
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,440
 Lots because the French eat about a incredible number of tons of frogs legs a year.

366
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
 Wow.

367
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
 Yeah.

368
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
 So it's very bad.

369
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
 It doesn't need.

370
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
 Cops is.

371
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,920
 The corpse trade is picking up.

372
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,400
 I think it's a problem in some countries like Turkey that people don't want to donate

373
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,920
 their bodies after they've died and so there's a cadaver shortage.

374
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
 Is it for like, dissection and...

375
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
 It's for dissection.

376
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:05,080
 Yeah, so for medical purposes and for like crash test dummies so if they're testing airplanes

377
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,640
 and things like that, they use human corpses.

378
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
 They do that.

379
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,160
 Yeah, they don't tell you that when it's the donate your body to science.

380
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
 They sit you in cars and this is true.

381
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
 They sit you...

382
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,720
 Who is they?

383
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,200
 They sit you in cars and they just slam the cars into walls and they sit because

384
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,760
 with a crash test dummy, a real crash test dummy, you can't tell what things will break in

385
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
 an actual crash.

386
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
 So it's saving people.

387
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,440
 Or blown up by a land mine, that's the other potential option.

388
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
 Is it?

389
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,600
 They test land mines on, which I would have thought is very obvious, if a land mine blows stuff

390
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
 up, it blows stuff up.

391
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
 But no, they test...

392
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,520
 But then the important thing with that is you need to know if there's a body part, this

393
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,520
 distance away, where was the original land mine.

394
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,040
 So it's all that kind of thing.

395
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,160
 This is all very important science, Andy.

396
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,360
 They actually, someone invented, just on land mines, someone has invented, this is quite

397
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,880
 a while ago, seeds that you scatter out into fields and when the plants grow, they touch

398
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,200
 the land mine metal and so what would otherwise be, let's say, a yellow flower, then goes red.

399
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,320
 So for all these countries that still have unblasted land mines, you can now see them.

400
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,000
 It's a quite a beautiful solution, they say, to how you can...

401
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 It's amazing.

402
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Yeah.

403
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Yeah.

404
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,920
 Unless you don't know that they've done that and you want to pick a nice bunch of

405
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
 flowers.

406
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
 And these things...

407
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,200
 The yellow ones are a bit boring on land.

408
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,480
 Why don't you go and get a bunch of the red, Danny?

409
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:35,840
 And that's Valentine's Day ruined.

410
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,200
 We need to move on to the next thing.

411
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
 Okay, let's move on.

412
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
 Should we go for it?

413
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
 Yeah.

414
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,800
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James Harkin.

415
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:49,040
 Okay, my fact this week is that the most dangerous invasive species in Britain is a poo-eating

416
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,760
 muscle from Transylvania.

417
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,720
 It's true, man.

418
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
 It's true.

419
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,000
 This is a really bad evil muscle that's come in from Transylvania, and they are blocking

420
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 up our toilets.

421
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,280
 I would have thought they'd be helping relieve the blocked toilets.

422
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,440
 Yes, that's a good point, but they have to live there, and they are really, really good

423
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,520
 at reproducing, and one female is capable of producing one million babies in a year.

424
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,480
 Oh, yeah, what's she called?

425
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,720
 So how are they getting here?

426
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
 You would get on ships.

427
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,040
 Yeah, on ships, bilges, and things like that.

428
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,200
 So when a ship is going from one place to another, they actually collect water from one

429
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,840
 area to kind of keep the ballast, and then when they get to the other place, they'll often

430
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,960
 release it, and then you'll end up with species moving from one place to another.

431
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,280
 It's like the bees.

432
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,360
 It's exactly like the bees.

433
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
 Okay.

434
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,360
 Yeah.

435
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,360
 Yeah, the bees of the ocean.

436
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,360
 Yeah.

437
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,920
 It's our fault, it's not their fault, they were happy in Transylvania.

438
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,800
 We brought them over, and they did what they did.

439
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,840
 Well, though, it's not just humans that can bring invasive species, because I went to a

440
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,480
 Glasgow museum today, and they said that there's, what was it, it was a, it was a plant called

441
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,000
 speawatt, and that's been brought to this area, and it's causing a real problem, and it was

442
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,240
 brought on the feet of geese, so when they flew over from, I think, from Africa, they carried

443
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,800
 this little plant over, and now it's become an invasive species.

444
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 So it's not always us.

445
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
 Oh, thanks a lot.

446
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
 Wow.

447
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
 Geese.

448
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
 Yeah.

449
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,240
 And it's guys.

450
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,080
 So mussels get about reputation, don't they?

451
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,760
 If you look at mussels, there's pretty much no one's got a good word to say about them.

452
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,320
 They're invasive species everywhere, and they're probably in the Great Lakes in America,

453
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
 I think.

454
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,120
 So these, are they Quagga mussels?

455
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
 Yeah, Quaggas.

456
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,880
 Quaggas, and zebra mussels, I think.

457
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,360
 In America, they have zebra ones, and here we have Quaggas, but they're both named

458
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,600
 after horse-like creatures.

459
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
 Oh, yeah.

460
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,480
 Because a Quagga is like an extinct type of zebra, right, isn't it?

461
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
 What's up with that?

462
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,480
 [laughter]

463
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
 Quagga mussels.

464
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,880
 One of the things they do to native species of mussels, they literally sit on them and

465
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,680
 kill them by doing that.

466
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,960
 So I know, they physically push them into the sediment on riverbases and things like

467
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,800
 that, and it's sort of the native species are crushed.

468
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,200
 And one of the species, which is at risk, one of the native species of mussels is called

469
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,160
 "Siu d'un ordante complanata", and its common name is the depressed river mussel.

470
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
 [laughter]

471
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,360
 What a grimly prophetic name.

472
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
 [laughter]

473
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,160
 But, yeah, they were in ecosystems, like, ecosystems don't they?

474
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:33,240
 So in Great Lakes, they eat all the algae, I think, which then stops feeding organisms,

475
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,000
 which then feed other organisms, then it wipes out everything.

476
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,800
 And so you're just ever the lake full of mussels, which is a disaster.

477
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,120
 But I think they shouldn't get us such a bad rep, because they are natural water

478
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
 filters.

479
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
 Okay.

480
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,560
 You could just drop a mussel in some dirty water and then drink it a little bit later.

481
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
 You couldn't do that.

482
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,920
 But they do, they do sieve water.

483
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,240
 So when they are, when they're looking for a meal, then they take the water in and they filter

484
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,560
 it through their tissues and they absorb some of the stuff that they want from the water

485
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,320
 and then they release the rest of it.

486
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,240
 And what they absorb are a lot of the horrible chemicals in the ocean.

487
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,880
 So they'll absorb herbicides, they'll absorb like flame retardants, they'll absorb a lot

488
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,360
 of the poisons that we put into the oceans, and they will release purified water.

489
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,120
 So they're using that to remove contaminants in quite a lot of lakes.

490
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,920
 Well, of course, that's one of the reasons why they make us so sick if you have a bad one,

491
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,520
 because they're kind of filtering dirty water and leaving nice water, but they keep all the

492
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,360
 nasty things that make people sick.

493
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360
 Yeah.

494
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,720
 And then if you get a bad one, yeah, that's why you get sick.

495
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
 Yeah.

496
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,200
 So this quagga, one of the reasons it's quite bad is not only does that eat human excrement,

497
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,400
 but there are other animals that eat its excrement.

498
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:48,920
 And one of them is a killer shrimp that they call the pink peril.

499
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,160
 Whenever it comes into any, whenever it goes into any lake, it kills all the other shrimps

500
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
 there.

501
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,240
 And so these two guys always kind of co-invade lakes or rivers.

502
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,640
 So whenever there's a muscle there, there's always the killer pink shrimp there as well.

503
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
 Right.

504
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
 And that's why it's like doubly bad.

505
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
 That's mortifying, isn't it?

506
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,000
 You're not even the guy who eats the poo, you're the guy who eats the poo of the guy who

507
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 eats the poo.

508
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Wow.

509
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,560
 You know there's actually animals now that disguise themselves as poo so that they don't get eaten.

510
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
 Is that right?

511
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
 Yeah.

512
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,040
 So they would, if the muscle was around, they'd be in big trouble.

513
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,200
 But most animals don't eat them.

514
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,040
 So there's one that's called the moth caterpillar.

515
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,320
 So the moth caterpillar does have sort of little white bits on it and little brown bit.

516
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,720
 And it will disguise itself in a sitting position to look like bird droppings.

517
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
 So it's just quite safe.

518
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,040
 Anytime a bird sees it, things are, that's poo, I'm not going to risk it this time.

519
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,360
 So you've got the moth caterpillar, there's the orb weeping spider, there's a giant swallowed

520
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,800
 tail butterfly, and then this one's really on the nose, bird droppings spiders.

521
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,040
 And they all do that.

522
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
 They all disguise themselves.

523
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,800
 It's the evolutionary thing.

524
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,360
 And yet then they give themselves that giveaway name.

525
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,440
 It's like, what was the point of going to that trouble?

526
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,640
 They should have called themselves just some bird droppings, nothing to do here.

527
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,320
 So NASA have actually asked the community of scientists around the world and said that

528
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,320
 we'll be a prize for this if you can convert poo into a eating product because when we

529
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,360
 go for these long haul missions to Mars, you are going to need everything that you can

530
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,840
 get to be reused as potential source for something and they think poo might be what we

531
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
 can use for food.

532
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:37,840
 What is the judging panel of this competition?

533
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,220
 Actually, you know, Heston Blumenthal has now contributed to space food.

534
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,220
 I see.

535
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,220
 Yeah.

536
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,040
 So Tim Peake, the British astronaut who's gone up in space, he worked with Heston Blumenthal

537
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,600
 and his people and they've created a bacon sandwich that can be made and eaten and a cup

538
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,320
 of tea that can be made and drunk.

539
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
 Wow.

540
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
 And they're made up, too.

541
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
 Well, they didn't tell Tim that.

542
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
 Yeah.

543
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
 So that's quite cool.

544
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,920
 So Heston's already getting into space.

545
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
 Great.

546
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
 Oh.

547
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:11,360
 Speaking of defecation and Transylvania, which is where this poo eating muscle comes from, there's

548
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:18,120
 the Salina Terda Salt Mine, which is this huge salt mine and it was a salt mine until 1932.

549
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
 So it's massive.

550
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,680
 I think it's in the capital, the biggest city in Transylvania and it sounds like the coolest

551
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
 holiday ever now.

552
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
 Have you seen it?

553
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,680
 Really?

554
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
 Yeah.

555
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,680
 They converted it.

556
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:34,440
 So it's this massive expanse of mine under the main city there and they've turned it into

557
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
 basically a theme park.

558
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,680
 It's this underground theme park.

559
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,160
 It is in 1992.

560
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,320
 So it's got this massive 180 seat amphitheater.

561
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,240
 It's got basketball courts.

562
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,560
 It's got like ping pong tables.

563
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
 It's got mini golf.

564
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
 It's got bowling.

565
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,920
 You get carried around this big underground theme park in the old machinery that was used

566
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
 for mining once.

567
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,160
 They've got a huge underground lake and you can go on the lake and little boats.

568
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,880
 They've got this ferris wheel that takes you up around it and you can look at the stalactites

569
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,120
 and the stalactites as you go around on it.

570
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,840
 And they've transformed this disused salt mine.

571
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,600
 They didn't know what to do with for 50 years into the best theme park in the world.

572
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
 Sounds amazing.

573
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
 Yeah.

574
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
 We should go there.

575
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
 And that's in Terda.

576
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
 That's in Terda.

577
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
 Yeah.

578
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,040
 The edict of Terda is quite a famous thing, which is I think it was a kind of thing where

579
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,040
 it meant that in Transylvania everyone was allowed to have any religion they wanted and it was

580
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,600
 one of the first places in the world that had this.

581
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,240
 And I have this theory that that's why kind of people think of Transylvania as kind of

582
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,040
 this weird kind of gothic place because the Catholic Church saw that it was a place where

583
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,640
 anyone could have any religion they wanted and they kind of didn't like it.

584
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,640
 Oh.

585
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,640
 Yeah.

586
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,920
 I think it might be because they had a leader called Raddy and Pela who had to pay hundreds

587
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,520
 of thousands of people on spikes.

588
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
 Yeah.

589
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
 They're a good place to be.

590
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
 They're a good place to be.

591
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
 They're a good place to be.

592
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
 They're a good place to be.

593
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,640
 So let's move on to our final fact of the show and that is Chisinski.

594
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
 Yeah.

595
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,960
 My fact is that until about 4,000 years ago, humans didn't notice the colour blue.

596
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,520
 Or most humans didn't notice the colour blue.

597
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
 Okay.

598
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,160
 Just escape their notice.

599
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,000
 So I'd not heard of this before.

600
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,840
 And so since reading into it, it's really fascinating.

601
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
 It's amazing.

602
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,360
 So the idea effectively is that someone looked through all the old literature that we

603
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,040
 have, any bit of writing, ancient Iceland, homer's odyssey, all that sort of stuff.

604
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,160
 And any time that there should have been a reference to blue, they used a different colour.

605
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,480
 And so the idea is that they actually think that maybe because there was no word describing

606
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,520
 it, we just didn't notice the sky, which is where you're looking at the big blue thing

607
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,720
 in the sky.

608
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,280
 And as a result of not naming it, it was just blended into different colours.

609
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
 Yeah.

610
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,600
 It is extremely controversial that.

611
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
 Yeah.

612
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,600
 This is a very controversial idea, but I think what corroborates it really nicely is that.

613
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,000
 So this guy who went through all these ancient texts, and it is from many different cultures.

614
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,680
 So yeah, Greece, China, Japan, Hebrew languages, none of them had the word for the colour blue.

615
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,280
 They started off all having black and white.

616
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,640
 They were the first words to colour words to appear.

617
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,680
 And then red was the next one.

618
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,280
 Then yellows and greens came in, and then blue was last.

619
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,440
 And the idea that maybe people weren't really noticing blue, or sort of couldn't distinguish

620
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,160
 it from others, does make a bit of sense when you look at this research that was done by

621
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,240
 a guy called Jules Davidoff, and he did this research in Namibia with the Himbert tribe,

622
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,040
 and the Himbert tribe does not have a word for blue at all.

623
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
 And you can look this up.

624
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
 It's really, really cool to do.

625
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:40,800
 What he did was he showed members of the Himbert tribe a series of, I think, it was 12 dots,

626
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,120
 and 11 of them were bright green, and one of them was bright blue.

627
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,600
 And he said, "Which one is the blue one?"

628
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,200
 And they couldn't tell.

629
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,280
 They just didn't know it, all the same to them, and so they really couldn't distinguish

630
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
 it.

631
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,560
 But then that tribe has many, many more words for green than we have.

632
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,000
 And they showed them a 12 green circles, and said, "Which one is the different shade

633
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 of green?"

634
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,080
 And if you look at the green circles, you cannot tell.

635
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,520
 I can't tell which one was the lighter shade of green, and everyone who they tested immediately

636
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,120
 spotted the lighter shade of green.

637
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:15,120
 But the idea is that because they have more words to describe it and to distinguish between

638
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,600
 them, that we sort of learn, we automatically learn to distinguish that.

639
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,080
 I think it's a really, really interesting idea.

640
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,080
 Yeah, it's amazing.

641
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,160
 There's another kind of fact, which isn't really a fact, which no one could actually

642
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,520
 see the colour blue, or maybe they were colour blind or something back in the day.

643
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,640
 And the idea is, Homer wrote about the sea, and he said it was the wine dark sea.

644
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,040
 And people are like, "Why is he saying wine dark instead of blue?"

645
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
 Wine dark.

646
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,520
 Because when you see the sea in the evening, sunsert, it does, it can look the colour of

647
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
 wine.

648
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,200
 So maybe all the wine was bright blue.

649
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
 Yeah.

650
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
 It's just the ones mentioned.

651
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,360
 Well, there is a theory that they, in those days, they used to add water to the wine because

652
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,240
 the wine was a lot kind of stronger, so they'd add water to it.

653
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,600
 And the water might have had a high alkaline content, which made it look a bit more blue.

654
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,120
 And they made their wine look a bit more blue.

655
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,320
 That seems like a little bit like Clutchy that's stressed to me.

656
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
 Yeah.

657
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,360
 I don't think we'll ever resolve this argument one way or the other.

658
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,360
 It is amazing to think of it, though.

659
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,360
 It's very, very cool.

660
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,960
 I went on to a website called XKCD, where you guys must know this.

661
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
 It's a webcomic.

662
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
 Wow!

663
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,960
 I think that's what I'm going to say.

664
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
 I think the webcomic is in tonight.

665
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,080
 So it's a webcomic by Ronald Monroe, and he kind of explains things.

666
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:27,000
 And he did a really good kind of study where he looked at colours, and he had men and women

667
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,280
 looking at all different colours and saw how they described them, to see if there was

668
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
 any difference.

669
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,960
 And they found that actually men and women was pretty much the same, apart from women

670
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,920
 tend to add more things like light green and lime green, whereas men would just say something's

671
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
 green.

672
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
 Just green.

673
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
 It's just green.

674
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,120
 But why, why he did that?

675
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
 So that was a general thing.

676
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,120
 But what he did was...

677
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
 Classic lads.

678
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,120
 Let's look at it.

679
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,120
 Let's look at it.

680
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
 Let's look at it.

681
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
 Let's look at it.

682
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,360
 I'm going to have the pub and not qualify colours.

683
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:00,520
 Sorry, James.

684
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,920
 So what he did, what he did was, that was kind of a general thing, but he looked at all

685
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,160
 the different things that people had said and tried to find which were the most male comments

686
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,200
 and which were the most female comments.

687
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,960
 So these are the colours that women said much more often than men.

688
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:22,720
 So dusty teal, blush pink, dusty lavender, butter yellow and dusky rose.

689
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,080
 So they were things that women said that men really didn't say.

690
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,600
 And the things that men said that women really didn't say for colours were penis.

691
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:40,720
 I mean, it's not that it's not one colour for a star.

692
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,200
 It's just green, mate.

693
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,680
 You've got to see a doctor.

694
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,760
 Who's beautiful grass?

695
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:03,960
 It's green, it might be.

696
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:15,000
 So, penis, don't know, beige, spelt with an A and WTF.

697
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,400
 Wow.

698
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:22,200
 Yeah, apparently women can't see those colours.

699
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,640
 True, true facts.

700
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:34,720
 Speaking of penises, I've found and the colour of blue.

701
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,680
 Scientists have worked out how now to if they can flash a blue light at your eyes and give

702
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,680
 you an erection.

703
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:47,040
 It's a really new thing that's happening at the moment.

704
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:55,120
 At the moment, they've only been able to give mice erections, but they're working on it

705
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
 for humans.

706
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:01,680
 And the idea is that it stimulates a thing inside your eye that leads directly to a part

707
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,800
 of your penis, which I wrote down.

708
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:12,640
 It's called Corpus cavernosum.

709
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,960
 It's a region that gets filled up with blood to facilitate an erection.

710
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:23,400
 So you see this light and it opens it up and you can go crazy.

711
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:31,400
 I don't understand the science of it, but it was really hard to read the main sign of it.

712
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:46,600
 That was part of it, wasn't it, that part of it.

713
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,080
 Go on, you're around to realise.

714
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:56,680
 So the guy that the scientist is working on it, he calls it erectileopogenetic stimulator

715
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,400
 and when he was asked about it, so he said it's quite simple.

716
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,680
 Sometimes you get past the gene therapy part of it, shine a blue light, cause dick to get

717
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
 hard.

718
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,160
 And that's basically the science.

719
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
 It's amazing.

720
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,160
 It's to do with an algae as well.

721
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,320
 It's apparently a bit of an algae that they've taken out.

722
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:22,220
 I don't know if I've mentioned this about the new alternative to Viagra, which is playing

723
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,600
 sounds to your penis.

724
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
 What?

725
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,480
 Yeah, it's like Viagra doesn't always work and sometimes it has side effects, but this

726
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,920
 is the thing, they get a machine, they put it on the men's parts and they play very, very

727
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,600
 high clicks like this.

728
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
 It is real.

729
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,320
 Just you like Dolphins a bit much.

730
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:48,080
 Is this a very, very coded way of telling us about your awakening when he's all flipper?

731
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,160
 But it does work.

732
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
 It does work.

733
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,160
 That's incredible.

734
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,160
 It kind of excites the blood vessels to kind of open.

735
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,160
 Wow.

736
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
 Wow.

737
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,160
 This is real science people.

738
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:03,160
 I mean, I've got a fact about eyes and colour perception, but I'm not sure we can go back.

739
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,160
 I've been really happy if we went back.

740
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
 Okay.

741
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
 Yeah, let's go back to ours.

742
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
 Yeah.

743
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
 Okay.

744
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,900
 Tarantulas have evolved to be blue or for parts of them to be blue separately on eight

745
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,720
 different occasions in nature and we don't know why.

746
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,360
 Why do they keep forgetting how to be blue and I mean to re-evolve it?

747
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,560
 When they branched off into separate, I think it's separate genuses and separate species.

748
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,280
 Or maybe it's separate species within the same genus.

749
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,680
 They have independently in though once they've branched off.

750
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
 I see.

751
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,320
 They have no idea.

752
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,760
 And they don't have good colour vision.

753
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,680
 So it's not like they know.

754
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,000
 That's the really weird thing.

755
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,520
 And it's not driven by sexual selection because they can't see when each other a blue.

756
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,400
 They have no idea.

757
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
 They can't tell.

758
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
 So we have no idea.

759
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,720
 Maybe it hides them from the prey or maybe it, you know, has some other effect, but yeah.

760
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,720
 Wow.

761
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
 How weird.

762
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,080
 I was reading that you can now get your eyes turned blue if you have brown eyes for $5,000.

763
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,560
 The idea is that actually right behind every brown eye is a blue eye because it's all to

764
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
 do with colour.

765
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,000
 So you can actually burn away the brown and sitting behind it is the natural blue.

766
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Yeah.

767
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 So people are doing this now.

768
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 They say that babies all have blue eyes.

769
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 I don't know if it's true, but they do say that.

770
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 That's true, isn't they?

771
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 They do.

772
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 As all babies have very pale blue eyes for the first few days and then they sort themselves

773
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 out.

774
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 Get their acts together.

775
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 That's really cool.

776
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,880
 If I hadn't recently spent all my money renting these, I would definitely put my eyes.

777
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
 Let's wrap up.

778
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
 Shall we wrap up?

779
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
 Okay.

780
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
 That's it.

781
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
 That is all of our facts.

782
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
