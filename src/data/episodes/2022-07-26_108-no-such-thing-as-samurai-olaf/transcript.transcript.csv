00:00:00,00:00:10,[soulful guitar music]
00:00:10,00:00:19,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:22,"this week coming to you from Arnmore in Glasgow, Scotland."
00:00:22,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and please welcome to this stage its Adich Zinsky, Andy Murray"
00:00:27,00:00:40,and Judge Markins.
00:00:40,00:00:47,And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from
00:00:47,00:00:52,"the last seven days, and in a particular order here we go, starting with you, Andrew"
00:00:52,00:01:01,Hunter Murray. My fact this week is that for just one penny you can rent a B for a month.
00:01:01,00:01:04,[laughter]
00:01:04,00:01:08,What are we doing here?
00:01:08,00:01:12,So what would you do with one B?
00:01:12,00:01:17,"Well you make friends, you take them on expeditions."
00:01:17,00:01:23,"So as we mentioned before on this podcast, a lot of bees in America live on trucks, and"
00:01:23,00:01:36,the reason they do is because they move around the country all the time because they rented
00:01:36,00:01:41,"out to pollinate crops, and they have this whole like basically a tall schedule where"
00:01:41,00:01:45,they move from area to area pollinating a new crop every few weeks.
00:01:45,00:01:51,"And there's a massive crop, the Californian Almond Crop, Almond, and that needs one and a half"
00:01:51,00:01:59,"million beehives, which is a total of at least 30 billion bees, which is amazing."
00:01:59,00:02:03,"They all arrive around the same time, and so they arrive, they pollinate the crop, and"
00:02:03,00:02:04,then they go.
00:02:04,00:02:11,"And an American beekeeper whose name is Randy Oliver has calculated the cost of it, and"
00:02:11,00:02:15,"he worked out that the cost is one penny, one US penny in fact, so a bit less than an English"
00:02:15,00:02:18,"penny, per bee per month."
00:02:18,00:02:24,"So one English penny would get you 1B for two months, I think it's about 1.6."
00:02:24,00:02:25,Six weeks.
00:02:25,00:02:26,Yeah.
00:02:26,00:02:27,"Oh, okay."
00:02:27,00:02:29,No worth it.
00:02:29,00:02:36,"It won't work for the holiday I'm thinking, I'm so happy."
00:02:36,00:02:42,"So you must get more than one, presumably, you must do it and there's no like number of"
00:02:42,00:02:47,"bees, and then the minimum option is one, so what I'm asking is, what is the minimum number"
00:02:47,00:02:49,of bees that I couldn't hire?
00:02:49,00:02:50,Don't know.
00:02:50,00:02:51,Okay.
00:02:51,00:02:52,You could probably...
00:02:52,00:02:53,I've got a tenor in my pocket.
00:02:53,00:02:55,It is a Scottish tenor.
00:02:55,00:02:56,That would get you.
00:02:56,00:03:01,They weren't except that James.
00:03:01,00:03:02,Trust me.
00:03:02,00:03:11,"Hang on, wait, if it's one penny, let's just say it's one penny, so wait, wait, wait, wait,"
00:03:11,00:03:12,it's a thousand.
00:03:12,00:03:17,"But I don't think that's enough for a hive, I think the minimum is probably at least one"
00:03:17,00:03:18,hive.
00:03:18,00:03:19,Okay.
00:03:19,00:03:24,"Do you know how bees collect pollen, I didn't know this, it's so cool."
00:03:24,00:03:29,"So they go and bees will go out, they'll either be collecting pollen or they'll be collecting"
00:03:29,00:03:32,"nectar, they never do both at once, you don't want to mix those two."
00:03:32,00:03:36,"And if they're collecting pollen, they get under a flower and they get covered in pollen"
00:03:36,00:03:40,"because they've got, you know, their hairy, their furry, and so pollen sticks all over"
00:03:40,00:03:41,them.
00:03:41,00:03:45,"But that's okay because they've got combs on their front four legs, so they use the combs"
00:03:45,00:03:50,"on their front two legs to comb the pollen out of their antennae, and they use the combs"
00:03:50,00:03:54,"on their middle legs to comb the pollen out of their fur on their body, and then they've"
00:03:54,00:03:58,"got these two kind of buckets on their back legs, which I think they're called pollen"
00:03:58,00:03:59,baskets.
00:03:59,00:04:02,"And they're like, I mean, they just look like little baskets on the back of their legs,"
00:04:02,00:04:06,and they crush the pollen once they've combed it out of their hair into these two little
00:04:06,00:04:09,"baskets, and then they carry it home in their pollen baskets."
00:04:09,00:04:10,Isn't that cool?
00:04:10,00:04:11,That's very cool.
00:04:11,00:04:12,Yeah.
00:04:12,00:04:13,That's amazing.
00:04:13,00:04:17,And the one really amazing thing about bees is that they have a positive charge.
00:04:17,00:04:18,They're electric.
00:04:18,00:04:20,Bees are electric.
00:04:20,00:04:25,"If you're putting them into a remote control, or do you get double bee and triple bee"
00:04:25,00:04:34,and that proves you.
00:04:34,00:04:36,So what happens?
00:04:36,00:04:41,"So the bee flies through the air, and it kind of hits particles in the air, and that gives"
00:04:41,00:04:42,it a positive charge.
00:04:42,00:04:45,"A bit like if you get a balloon and you rub it against yourself, and that gives the"
00:04:45,00:04:49,"balloon a charge, it's a bit like static, but the flowers have a negative charge, and that"
00:04:49,00:04:54,"means that when a bee goes into a flower, the pollen will actually jump, just jump from"
00:04:54,00:04:55,the flower to the bee.
00:04:55,00:04:56,Wow.
00:04:56,00:04:57,Using a lot of electricity.
00:04:57,00:05:04,"I've read today, bees don't pee or poo in space."
00:05:04,00:05:07,"Why would you go to, I don't go to space to poo, Eilah."
00:05:07,00:05:08,That was the thing.
00:05:08,00:05:12,"Yeah, but if you were in space, you would, at some point, so I see, so when we send bees"
00:05:12,00:05:13,up there.
00:05:13,00:05:14,Yes.
00:05:14,00:05:15,So they hold it in.
00:05:15,00:05:16,"Yeah, yeah."
00:05:16,00:05:20,"So a bunch of bees were sent to space, and in space, they actually started."
00:05:20,00:05:25,"So a lot of little insects have been sent to space, particularly flying insects to see how they"
00:05:25,00:05:31,"can cope with flying, and there's, I watched them amazing footage today, by the way, of"
00:05:31,00:05:35,opinions inside one of those vomit rockets that go down.
00:05:35,00:05:36,They let them loose.
00:05:36,00:05:40,"If you don't know the vomit rocket, it's where they film zero gravity without leaving the"
00:05:40,00:05:41,earth's atmosphere.
00:05:41,00:05:42,So you can do the weightlessness.
00:05:42,00:05:45,"And also, actual astronauts use it to practice being in zero energy."
00:05:45,00:05:46,"Yeah, exactly."
00:05:46,00:05:48,"So basically the plane is, what is it?"
00:05:48,00:05:52,"So it goes up in a parabola, and it kind of makes it feel like you're weightless."
00:05:52,00:05:53,Okay.
00:05:53,00:05:59,"So you fly around, and yeah, so on, and, you do."
00:05:59,00:06:03,"So they brought pigeons on board, and the pigeons just didn't know what was going on because"
00:06:03,00:06:06,"they couldn't, they couldn't just fly and bumping into walls."
00:06:06,00:06:12,"At one point, a pigeon is flying upside down, and the others are like, what the, it's really"
00:06:12,00:06:13,confusing.
00:06:13,00:06:20,"That's, that's where pigeons will get their alien abduction stories."
00:06:20,00:06:24,"So they brought, they brought a bunch of bees into space, and they, they brought houseflies,"
00:06:24,00:06:28,"and their houseflies, actually, they say for houseflies, it's a no-fly zone."
00:06:28,00:06:29,They just don't bother.
00:06:29,00:06:31,They don't even try.
00:06:31,00:06:32,They start trying.
00:06:32,00:06:33,They can't fly.
00:06:33,00:06:38,"So either they just try and cling to the wall, or they just stay still and just float"
00:06:38,00:06:39,everywhere they go.
00:06:39,00:06:41,So houseflies don't fly in space.
00:06:41,00:06:46,"These kind of after about seven days worked out what to do, and they managed to, they even"
00:06:46,00:06:47,built a honeycomb.
00:06:47,00:06:50,They even managed to make residents.
00:06:50,00:06:54,"And the, the main thing they noticed though, is that they just didn't go to the toilet."
00:06:54,00:06:56,They were holding until they got back to earth.
00:06:56,00:07:00,"Well, I think it's because they were put in an enclosed hive, a space hive, weren't"
00:07:00,00:07:01,they?
00:07:01,00:07:04,And bees do not defecate in their own hives.
00:07:04,00:07:05,They don't shit with the eat.
00:07:05,00:07:09,"And so they literally thought, well, if I can't get out of this thing, then I'm not"
00:07:09,00:07:10,going to put in it.
00:07:10,00:07:11,They're too polite.
00:07:11,00:07:13,So they held it in for a week.
00:07:13,00:07:14,Yeah.
00:07:14,00:07:16,"Because if they held it in thinking, I'll do it when I get back."
00:07:16,00:07:17,That's quite optimistic.
00:07:17,00:07:18,Because they're just bees.
00:07:18,00:07:21,They don't know that they're actually going to come back to them.
00:07:21,00:07:22,Wow.
00:07:22,00:07:23,Yeah.
00:07:23,00:07:24,"So interesting, right?"
00:07:24,00:07:28,"Moths, when they went into space, actually learned to, I think they were the smartest flying"
00:07:28,00:07:29,creature.
00:07:29,00:07:31,They learned that they could kind of float in space.
00:07:31,00:07:35,"So when you try to flap, it doesn't really work because you get so disoriented."
00:07:35,00:07:39,But the moths and zero gravity very quickly realize that they could change the method of
00:07:39,00:07:40,flying and turn more into seagulls.
00:07:40,00:07:43,And then they just sort of float it around on the air.
00:07:43,00:07:44,Right?
00:07:44,00:07:45,Yeah.
00:07:45,00:07:46,"Oh, cool."
00:07:46,00:07:47,That's very cool.
00:07:47,00:07:48,"Well, then Moths, very clever."
00:07:48,00:07:51,Do you know why honeybees die when they sting you?
00:07:51,00:07:54,So most of the vast majority of bees don't die when they sting you.
00:07:54,00:07:57,But most honeybees do die when they sting you.
00:07:57,00:08:00,And it's because all of their insides are falling out.
00:08:00,00:08:01,So I know.
00:08:01,00:08:02,It's really sad.
00:08:02,00:08:03,What do you mean?
00:08:03,00:08:06,"So when they put their sting into you, I think human skin is a bit too hard."
00:08:06,00:08:11,So they can't properly retract their sort of barbed stinger as it comes out.
00:08:11,00:08:15,"So instead, what it does is rather than leaving behind just its sting, as it tries to pull away,"
00:08:15,00:08:20,"it leaves behind, inside you, it's digestive tract and it's abdomen and everything."
00:08:20,00:08:26,"So, and then that, because it's not really a bee any more, it's just a lump of fluff."
00:08:26,00:08:28,So that's over for them.
00:08:28,00:08:32,You've found Muth even in a horrible horrible fact.
00:08:32,00:08:38,"But they evolved to mostly sting other insects or other bees or, yeah, so that's what the"
00:08:38,00:08:39,sting is really for.
00:08:39,00:08:43,"And they have no problem stinging them without, you know, without that happening to the world."
00:08:43,00:08:47,"So when they sting something with really tough skin and to a bee, we have really tough skin."
00:08:47,00:08:48,Yeah.
00:08:48,00:08:50,We need to move on soon to the next fact.
00:08:50,00:08:52,"Oh, can I just talk about other things you can rent?"
00:08:52,00:08:53,Yeah.
00:08:53,00:08:54,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:54,00:08:55,James.
00:08:59,00:09:04,"So you were very lucky to get off with the caution, I don't think."
00:09:04,00:09:06,Guinea pigs.
00:09:06,00:09:07,You could rent guinea pigs.
00:09:07,00:09:08,Guinea pigs.
00:09:08,00:09:13,"Yeah, in Switzerland, you can rent guinea pigs, but only Switzerland as far as I can find."
00:09:13,00:09:19,"And that's because according to Swiss law, it's illegal to have one guinea pig on its own."
00:09:19,00:09:23,You need to have a second guinea pig because they're really kind of sociable creatures and
00:09:23,00:09:25,"if you have one, they get lonely."
00:09:25,00:09:27,And so the Swiss made a law against it.
00:09:27,00:09:28,Wow.
00:09:28,00:09:33,"So what happens is one of your guinea pigs dies and you're like, OK, now I've only got one guinea pig."
00:09:33,00:09:34,I'm going to have to get another one.
00:09:34,00:09:39,But what would happen is you get a young one and then the old one would die.
00:09:39,00:09:43,And then you'd have to get another young one and you just be in some horrible cycle of just
00:09:43,00:09:46,always getting more and more guinea pigs.
00:09:46,00:09:51,"So some people have seen a gap in the market and thought, you know what we can do?"
00:09:51,00:09:54,We can rent one until the second one dies.
00:09:54,00:09:55,And that's the thing.
00:09:55,00:10:02,"God, I must say, the Swiss parliament really does have time on his hands, I'd say."
00:10:02,00:10:10,"In Japan, you can rent an attractive man to wipe away your tears."
00:10:10,00:10:14,Is there a phone number or a website?
00:10:14,00:10:18,I ordered one for you. He's back to stage.
00:10:18,00:10:20,"Yeah, isn't this totally bizarre?"
00:10:20,00:10:21,It's definitely true.
00:10:21,00:10:22,It's a Tokyo-based company.
00:10:22,00:10:30,It's called Icomisodanshi and that means apparently roughly translated as handsome weeping boys.
00:10:30,00:10:34,"And it's if they're, you know, it's for women, specifically."
00:10:34,00:10:37,And apparently women are prone to going to the workplace or whatever and bursting into
00:10:37,00:10:38,tears.
00:10:38,00:10:43,"And so we need to hire attractive weeping boys to come and turn up to the office, wipe away"
00:10:43,00:10:45,your tears and come for you.
00:10:45,00:10:51,"OK, interestingly, I have been to Tokyo and I have seen the clubs they have which are"
00:10:51,00:10:54,kind of just handsome young men clubs.
00:10:54,00:10:55,They're women.
00:10:55,00:10:58,They're aimed at women and they're aimed at women I didn't go in.
00:10:58,00:11:03,"But it's just sort of, like, handsome young men hanging around in there looking cool and"
00:11:03,00:11:04,a bit emo.
00:11:04,00:11:06,And the bill's very unreasonable as well.
00:11:06,00:11:10,"50,000 yen for a coke."
00:11:10,00:11:11,But that sort of fits into that trend.
00:11:11,00:11:12,"Yeah, that's amazing."
00:11:12,00:11:13,"Yeah, it does."
00:11:13,00:11:14,"Yeah, I'm sorry, that sounds traumatic for you."
00:11:14,00:11:15,It's very hot.
00:11:15,00:11:18,I think you've got a little Olaf waiting next door.
00:11:18,00:11:25,"Oh, is a really good Japanese name, I just didn't know it was him."
00:11:25,00:11:33,"Samurai, Olaf, we should move on to our next facts."
00:11:33,00:11:36,"OK, it's time for fact number two."
00:11:36,00:11:37,And that is my fact.
00:11:37,00:11:41,My fact this week is that Iceland imports ice.
00:11:41,00:11:44,"Yeah, it actually does."
00:11:44,00:11:47,"In shops now, you can get ice in Iceland."
00:11:47,00:11:53,"And particularly this one shop, which is called had cup, and it's a sort of grocery store,"
00:11:53,00:11:54,and they import ice.
00:11:54,00:11:56,You buy them in blocks of four.
00:11:56,00:12:01,And it doesn't make any sense at all because the water in Iceland is rated a total 100 percent
00:12:01,00:12:02,for freshness.
00:12:02,00:12:07,"So if they've got great water that you can turn into ice, but they bring it in from Norway."
00:12:07,00:12:09,So they now import ice from Norway.
00:12:09,00:12:10,That's really good.
00:12:10,00:12:11,Yeah.
00:12:11,00:12:18,"So I via the Twitter account of a guy called Janar, who was the mayor of Reykjavik, and"
00:12:18,00:12:22,"he was actually a comedian who hated what was going on in the country, and he thought this"
00:12:22,00:12:23,is just bullshit.
00:12:23,00:12:26,"I'm going to run, I'm going to run his mayor of Reykjavik."
00:12:26,00:12:27,"So he said, I'm going to set up a party."
00:12:27,00:12:28,"They said, what are you going to call it?"
00:12:28,00:12:31,"And he said, the best party will be the best party."
00:12:31,00:12:32,So they set up the best party.
00:12:32,00:12:37,"We've spoken about this on the podcast before, and he made all the promises that anyone"
00:12:37,00:12:38,wanted him to make.
00:12:38,00:12:39,"So he was like, what do you want?"
00:12:39,00:12:40,I'll give you anything.
00:12:40,00:12:41,"I said, we want free towels."
00:12:41,00:12:42,You'll have free towels.
00:12:42,00:12:44,"When I'm mayor, everyone will have free towels."
00:12:44,00:12:46,Is that the first thing that the people demand it?
00:12:46,00:12:50,I think they wanted to test the grounds first and see what he was going to go for.
00:12:50,00:12:51,What?
00:12:51,00:12:54,"He could also say afterwards, by the way, here's my main promise, whatever you ask for and"
00:12:54,00:12:57,"I agree to, I will break once I become mayor."
00:12:57,00:13:01,"So when he became mayor, he said, you're getting no free towels."
00:13:01,00:13:07,"I didn't know that Britain exports ice to China, anyway, and to Sweden."
00:13:07,00:13:10,The British exports of ice to China have tripled in the last three years.
00:13:10,00:13:11,Wow.
00:13:11,00:13:13,Probably from quite a low base.
00:13:13,00:13:20,"But still, we have a company, there's a company in Yorkshire called The Ice Company."
00:13:20,00:13:21,So not.
00:13:21,00:13:22,Very good name.
00:13:22,00:13:23,"Yeah, not."
00:13:23,00:13:24,"I mean, a good, a descriptive name, if nothing else."
00:13:24,00:13:28,"And they make 500 tons of ice a day, they're in South Kirkby in Yorkshire."
00:13:28,00:13:29,And this is the cool thing.
00:13:29,00:13:36,"So they have these machines which make ice, massive machines, and they make 300 pound"
00:13:36,00:13:41,"blocks of really crystal clear, beautiful looking ice."
00:13:41,00:13:44,"And it's made in these huge freezing compartments, right?"
00:13:44,00:13:47,And the water gets frozen in cylinders and then huge blades chop it up.
00:13:47,00:13:52,"And then the cubes of ice are blow-dried, so they don't stick to each other."
00:13:52,00:13:53,Wow.
00:13:53,00:13:54,Yeah.
00:13:54,00:13:55,Yeah.
00:13:55,00:13:57,So somewhere there's someone whose job is to be an ice hairdryer.
00:13:57,00:13:58,Is that weird?
00:13:58,00:13:59,That is weird.
00:13:59,00:14:05,"Well, clear ice is very sought after, and I think this might be why this Norwegian ice has"
00:14:05,00:14:08,"been imported, because I think it's Mr. Iceman, isn't it?"
00:14:08,00:14:09,Yes.
00:14:09,00:14:11,"Which, again, is a very good name."
00:14:11,00:14:16,"And it, so I went to the Mr. Iceman website, and it's the Mr. Iceman ice that's now being"
00:14:16,00:14:19,sold in Iceland.
00:14:19,00:14:23,And they advertise about that they've got the hardest ice in the world.
00:14:23,00:14:27,"So you can, if you're fee, if it's a special occasion, you drop one of these blocks of ice"
00:14:27,00:14:32,on your whisky and it takes twice as long to melt as an ordinary block of ice.
00:14:32,00:14:34,So that's what everyone wants.
00:14:34,00:14:38,"It says, ""For those that appreciate a whisky cold, but not diluted, they will cherish the"
00:14:38,00:14:39,"ice block."""
00:14:39,00:14:40,Which is actually quite a good idea.
00:14:40,00:14:42,Do you know the queen likes ice?
00:14:42,00:14:43,But she does.
00:14:43,00:14:46,"Actually, that's a great fan."
00:14:46,00:14:50,But she doesn't like the noise that ice makes in the glass.
00:14:50,00:14:55,Does she have special flunkies to whenever the ice is getting close to the edge of the glass?
00:14:55,00:14:59,Just dip their finger in and let it rebound off.
00:14:59,00:15:03,I don't think the queen would like fingers in that drink.
00:15:03,00:15:08,"She drinks gin and du bonnet, it's her favorite drink."
00:15:08,00:15:10,And she hates the noise that the ice makes.
00:15:10,00:15:14,And so her favorite flunky Prince Philip invented a machine.
00:15:14,00:15:18,He invented a machine that makes tiny ice bowls that don't grate against each other.
00:15:18,00:15:21,And so now she can have her drink and it doesn't make any noise.
00:15:21,00:15:24,He invented Prince Philip invented a machine.
00:15:24,00:15:25,Yeah.
00:15:25,00:15:33,"I mean, they say it's tough at the top, but I had no idea just how tough it was."
00:15:33,00:15:36,"Well, that makes a really tiny ice bowl."
00:15:36,00:15:38,Tiny little ice bowls.
00:15:38,00:15:39,Those are popular.
00:15:39,00:15:41,I've heard about them in fancy bars and things.
00:15:41,00:15:44,"They have sort of hand-carved ice bowls, which are good bites."
00:15:44,00:15:45,Right.
00:15:45,00:15:46,Yeah.
00:15:46,00:15:47,Wow.
00:15:47,00:15:48,And some unusual imports.
00:15:48,00:15:49,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:49,00:15:50,Okay.
00:15:50,00:15:51,So Germany imports Lederhosen.
00:15:51,00:15:52,Wow.
00:15:52,00:15:53,Really?
00:15:53,00:15:54,There's only 100 others.
00:15:54,00:15:58,Fewer than 100 businesses making Lederhosen left in Germany and they get most of them from
00:15:58,00:15:59,"China, though."
00:15:59,00:16:00,Wow.
00:16:00,00:16:01,That's one thing.
00:16:01,00:16:04,Australia imports Dingo urine.
00:16:04,00:16:05,Imports.
00:16:05,00:16:06,Yeah.
00:16:06,00:16:07,Where are the Dingo's from?
00:16:07,00:16:08,Where's that side Australia?
00:16:08,00:16:11,"I think the thing is with Dingo urine, it's quite important that you have to get it from"
00:16:11,00:16:12,a captive Dingo.
00:16:12,00:16:17,You can't just go into the wild and just grab a Dingo and like a lot of zoos around the
00:16:17,00:16:21,world have Dingo's in them and so they get the urine from these places and then they
00:16:21,00:16:24,import them into Australia and they use them to deter other animals.
00:16:24,00:16:25,Right.
00:16:25,00:16:26,And they cost us.
00:16:26,00:16:27,Right.
00:16:27,00:16:33,"It's not true, I don't think it's even made in Australia and I'm drinking it now, I love"
00:16:33,00:16:34,it.
00:16:34,00:16:37,So I feel really bad about that comment for a number of reasons.
00:16:37,00:16:41,And it's illegal to bring dirty mattresses into Canada.
00:16:41,00:16:42,What?
00:16:42,00:16:45,You're not allowed to import a dirty mattress into Canada.
00:16:45,00:16:49,You have to have it fumigated and you need a letter from the fumigator proving that you've
00:16:49,00:16:50,done it.
00:16:50,00:16:55,I wouldn't want someone bringing a dirty mattress into my house.
00:16:55,00:16:59,And what is a country but a big house?
00:16:59,00:17:05,Doesn't Canada mean large village in like an old native American language?
00:17:05,00:17:06,I don't know.
00:17:06,00:17:07,It does.
00:17:07,00:17:08,Okay.
00:17:08,00:17:09,I believe it.
00:17:09,00:17:10,What do you say?
00:17:10,00:17:11,What do you say it doesn't this?
00:17:11,00:17:13,You mean this is a thing.
00:17:13,00:17:16,"Franz imports all its frog sex, doesn't it?"
00:17:16,00:17:17,Hard to say.
00:17:17,00:17:18,Yes.
00:17:18,00:17:19,Yes.
00:17:19,00:17:20,From Southeast Asia.
00:17:20,00:17:21,Yes.
00:17:21,00:17:24,"I think mainly from the Philippines, Indonesia, mainly from Indonesia and something"
00:17:24,00:17:25,from Japan.
00:17:25,00:17:30,"And yeah, I think frog farming is now illegal in France or, yeah, I think you can't really"
00:17:30,00:17:33,farm frogs in France but they still consume them and so they get them all from Southeast
00:17:33,00:17:34,Asia.
00:17:34,00:17:37,And they're becoming massively endangered frogs in Southeast Asia.
00:17:37,00:17:41,Lots because the French eat about a incredible number of tons of frogs legs a year.
00:17:41,00:17:42,Wow.
00:17:42,00:17:43,Yeah.
00:17:43,00:17:44,So it's very bad.
00:17:44,00:17:45,It doesn't need.
00:17:45,00:17:46,Cops is.
00:17:46,00:17:47,The corpse trade is picking up.
00:17:47,00:17:53,I think it's a problem in some countries like Turkey that people don't want to donate
00:17:53,00:17:56,their bodies after they've died and so there's a cadaver shortage.
00:17:56,00:17:57,"Is it for like, dissection and..."
00:17:57,00:17:58,It's for dissection.
00:17:58,00:18:05,"Yeah, so for medical purposes and for like crash test dummies so if they're testing airplanes"
00:18:05,00:18:06,"and things like that, they use human corpses."
00:18:06,00:18:07,They do that.
00:18:07,00:18:12,"Yeah, they don't tell you that when it's the donate your body to science."
00:18:12,00:18:14,They sit you in cars and this is true.
00:18:14,00:18:15,They sit you...
00:18:15,00:18:18,Who is they?
00:18:18,00:18:23,They sit you in cars and they just slam the cars into walls and they sit because
00:18:23,00:18:27,"with a crash test dummy, a real crash test dummy, you can't tell what things will break in"
00:18:27,00:18:28,an actual crash.
00:18:28,00:18:29,So it's saving people.
00:18:29,00:18:32,"Or blown up by a land mine, that's the other potential option."
00:18:32,00:18:33,Is it?
00:18:33,00:18:37,"They test land mines on, which I would have thought is very obvious, if a land mine blows stuff"
00:18:37,00:18:38,"up, it blows stuff up."
00:18:38,00:18:40,"But no, they test..."
00:18:40,00:18:44,"But then the important thing with that is you need to know if there's a body part, this"
00:18:44,00:18:47,"distance away, where was the original land mine."
00:18:47,00:18:49,So it's all that kind of thing.
00:18:49,00:18:51,"This is all very important science, Andy."
00:18:51,00:18:55,"They actually, someone invented, just on land mines, someone has invented, this is quite"
00:18:55,00:19:01,"a while ago, seeds that you scatter out into fields and when the plants grow, they touch"
00:19:01,00:19:07,"the land mine metal and so what would otherwise be, let's say, a yellow flower, then goes red."
00:19:07,00:19:11,"So for all these countries that still have unblasted land mines, you can now see them."
00:19:11,00:19:15,"It's a quite a beautiful solution, they say, to how you can..."
00:19:15,00:19:16,It's amazing.
00:19:16,00:19:17,Yeah.
00:19:17,00:19:18,Yeah.
00:19:18,00:19:20,Unless you don't know that they've done that and you want to pick a nice bunch of
00:19:20,00:19:21,flowers.
00:19:21,00:19:22,And these things...
00:19:22,00:19:25,The yellow ones are a bit boring on land.
00:19:25,00:19:28,"Why don't you go and get a bunch of the red, Danny?"
00:19:28,00:19:35,And that's Valentine's Day ruined.
00:19:35,00:19:37,We need to move on to the next thing.
00:19:37,00:19:38,"Okay, let's move on."
00:19:38,00:19:39,Should we go for it?
00:19:39,00:19:40,Yeah.
00:19:40,00:19:42,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James Harkin."
00:19:42,00:19:49,"Okay, my fact this week is that the most dangerous invasive species in Britain is a poo-eating"
00:19:49,00:19:51,muscle from Transylvania.
00:19:51,00:19:54,"It's true, man."
00:19:54,00:19:55,It's true.
00:19:55,00:20:01,"This is a really bad evil muscle that's come in from Transylvania, and they are blocking"
00:20:01,00:20:02,up our toilets.
00:20:02,00:20:06,I would have thought they'd be helping relieve the blocked toilets.
00:20:06,00:20:11,"Yes, that's a good point, but they have to live there, and they are really, really good"
00:20:11,00:20:17,"at reproducing, and one female is capable of producing one million babies in a year."
00:20:17,00:20:21,"Oh, yeah, what's she called?"
00:20:21,00:20:23,So how are they getting here?
00:20:23,00:20:24,You would get on ships.
00:20:24,00:20:27,"Yeah, on ships, bilges, and things like that."
00:20:27,00:20:31,"So when a ship is going from one place to another, they actually collect water from one"
00:20:31,00:20:34,"area to kind of keep the ballast, and then when they get to the other place, they'll often"
00:20:34,00:20:37,"release it, and then you'll end up with species moving from one place to another."
00:20:37,00:20:39,It's like the bees.
00:20:39,00:20:40,It's exactly like the bees.
00:20:40,00:20:41,Okay.
00:20:41,00:20:42,Yeah.
00:20:42,00:20:43,"Yeah, the bees of the ocean."
00:20:43,00:20:44,Yeah.
00:20:44,00:20:48,"It's our fault, it's not their fault, they were happy in Transylvania."
00:20:48,00:20:51,"We brought them over, and they did what they did."
00:20:51,00:20:55,"Well, though, it's not just humans that can bring invasive species, because I went to a"
00:20:55,00:21:01,"Glasgow museum today, and they said that there's, what was it, it was a, it was a plant called"
00:21:01,00:21:06,"speawatt, and that's been brought to this area, and it's causing a real problem, and it was"
00:21:06,00:21:11,"brought on the feet of geese, so when they flew over from, I think, from Africa, they carried"
00:21:11,00:21:13,"this little plant over, and now it's become an invasive species."
00:21:13,00:21:14,So it's not always us.
00:21:14,00:21:15,"Oh, thanks a lot."
00:21:15,00:21:16,Wow.
00:21:16,00:21:17,Geese.
00:21:17,00:21:18,Yeah.
00:21:18,00:21:21,And it's guys.
00:21:21,00:21:24,"So mussels get about reputation, don't they?"
00:21:24,00:21:27,"If you look at mussels, there's pretty much no one's got a good word to say about them."
00:21:27,00:21:32,"They're invasive species everywhere, and they're probably in the Great Lakes in America,"
00:21:32,00:21:33,I think.
00:21:33,00:21:36,"So these, are they Quagga mussels?"
00:21:36,00:21:37,"Yeah, Quaggas."
00:21:37,00:21:39,"Quaggas, and zebra mussels, I think."
00:21:39,00:21:43,"In America, they have zebra ones, and here we have Quaggas, but they're both named"
00:21:43,00:21:45,after horse-like creatures.
00:21:45,00:21:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:46,00:21:49,"Because a Quagga is like an extinct type of zebra, right, isn't it?"
00:21:49,00:21:51,What's up with that?
00:21:51,00:21:53,[laughter]
00:21:53,00:21:54,Quagga mussels.
00:21:54,00:21:59,"One of the things they do to native species of mussels, they literally sit on them and"
00:21:59,00:22:01,kill them by doing that.
00:22:01,00:22:05,"So I know, they physically push them into the sediment on riverbases and things like"
00:22:05,00:22:08,"that, and it's sort of the native species are crushed."
00:22:08,00:22:13,"And one of the species, which is at risk, one of the native species of mussels is called"
00:22:13,00:22:18,"""Siu d'un ordante complanata"", and its common name is the depressed river mussel."
00:22:18,00:22:19,[laughter]
00:22:19,00:22:21,What a grimly prophetic name.
00:22:21,00:22:22,[laughter]
00:22:22,00:22:27,"But, yeah, they were in ecosystems, like, ecosystems don't they?"
00:22:27,00:22:33,"So in Great Lakes, they eat all the algae, I think, which then stops feeding organisms,"
00:22:33,00:22:36,"which then feed other organisms, then it wipes out everything."
00:22:36,00:22:38,"And so you're just ever the lake full of mussels, which is a disaster."
00:22:38,00:22:43,"But I think they shouldn't get us such a bad rep, because they are natural water"
00:22:43,00:22:44,filters.
00:22:44,00:22:45,Okay.
00:22:45,00:22:49,You could just drop a mussel in some dirty water and then drink it a little bit later.
00:22:49,00:22:50,You couldn't do that.
00:22:50,00:22:53,"But they do, they do sieve water."
00:22:53,00:22:59,"So when they are, when they're looking for a meal, then they take the water in and they filter"
00:22:59,00:23:02,it through their tissues and they absorb some of the stuff that they want from the water
00:23:02,00:23:04,and then they release the rest of it.
00:23:04,00:23:08,And what they absorb are a lot of the horrible chemicals in the ocean.
00:23:08,00:23:11,"So they'll absorb herbicides, they'll absorb like flame retardants, they'll absorb a lot"
00:23:11,00:23:16,"of the poisons that we put into the oceans, and they will release purified water."
00:23:16,00:23:19,So they're using that to remove contaminants in quite a lot of lakes.
00:23:19,00:23:22,"Well, of course, that's one of the reasons why they make us so sick if you have a bad one,"
00:23:22,00:23:27,"because they're kind of filtering dirty water and leaving nice water, but they keep all the"
00:23:27,00:23:29,nasty things that make people sick.
00:23:29,00:23:30,Yeah.
00:23:30,00:23:32,"And then if you get a bad one, yeah, that's why you get sick."
00:23:32,00:23:33,Yeah.
00:23:33,00:23:38,"So this quagga, one of the reasons it's quite bad is not only does that eat human excrement,"
00:23:38,00:23:41,but there are other animals that eat its excrement.
00:23:41,00:23:48,And one of them is a killer shrimp that they call the pink peril.
00:23:48,00:23:53,"Whenever it comes into any, whenever it goes into any lake, it kills all the other shrimps"
00:23:53,00:23:54,there.
00:23:54,00:23:59,And so these two guys always kind of co-invade lakes or rivers.
00:23:59,00:24:02,"So whenever there's a muscle there, there's always the killer pink shrimp there as well."
00:24:02,00:24:03,Right.
00:24:03,00:24:04,And that's why it's like doubly bad.
00:24:04,00:24:05,"That's mortifying, isn't it?"
00:24:05,00:24:10,"You're not even the guy who eats the poo, you're the guy who eats the poo of the guy who"
00:24:10,00:24:13,eats the poo.
00:24:13,00:24:15,Wow.
00:24:15,00:24:20,You know there's actually animals now that disguise themselves as poo so that they don't get eaten.
00:24:20,00:24:21,Is that right?
00:24:21,00:24:22,Yeah.
00:24:22,00:24:24,"So they would, if the muscle was around, they'd be in big trouble."
00:24:24,00:24:26,But most animals don't eat them.
00:24:26,00:24:29,So there's one that's called the moth caterpillar.
00:24:29,00:24:33,So the moth caterpillar does have sort of little white bits on it and little brown bit.
00:24:33,00:24:36,And it will disguise itself in a sitting position to look like bird droppings.
00:24:36,00:24:37,So it's just quite safe.
00:24:37,00:24:42,"Anytime a bird sees it, things are, that's poo, I'm not going to risk it this time."
00:24:42,00:24:47,"So you've got the moth caterpillar, there's the orb weeping spider, there's a giant swallowed"
00:24:47,00:24:51,"tail butterfly, and then this one's really on the nose, bird droppings spiders."
00:24:51,00:24:53,And they all do that.
00:24:53,00:24:54,They all disguise themselves.
00:24:54,00:24:55,It's the evolutionary thing.
00:24:55,00:24:58,And yet then they give themselves that giveaway name.
00:24:58,00:25:03,"It's like, what was the point of going to that trouble?"
00:25:03,00:25:09,"They should have called themselves just some bird droppings, nothing to do here."
00:25:09,00:25:15,So NASA have actually asked the community of scientists around the world and said that
00:25:15,00:25:20,we'll be a prize for this if you can convert poo into a eating product because when we
00:25:20,00:25:24,"go for these long haul missions to Mars, you are going to need everything that you can"
00:25:24,00:25:29,get to be reused as potential source for something and they think poo might be what we
00:25:29,00:25:30,can use for food.
00:25:30,00:25:37,What is the judging panel of this competition?
00:25:37,00:25:42,"Actually, you know, Heston Blumenthal has now contributed to space food."
00:25:42,00:25:43,I see.
00:25:43,00:25:44,Yeah.
00:25:44,00:25:49,"So Tim Peake, the British astronaut who's gone up in space, he worked with Heston Blumenthal"
00:25:49,00:25:54,and his people and they've created a bacon sandwich that can be made and eaten and a cup
00:25:54,00:25:56,of tea that can be made and drunk.
00:25:56,00:25:57,Wow.
00:25:57,00:25:58,"And they're made up, too."
00:25:58,00:25:59,"Well, they didn't tell Tim that."
00:25:59,00:26:00,Yeah.
00:26:00,00:26:01,So that's quite cool.
00:26:01,00:26:02,So Heston's already getting into space.
00:26:02,00:26:03,Great.
00:26:03,00:26:04,Oh.
00:26:04,00:26:11,"Speaking of defecation and Transylvania, which is where this poo eating muscle comes from, there's"
00:26:11,00:26:18,"the Salina Terda Salt Mine, which is this huge salt mine and it was a salt mine until 1932."
00:26:18,00:26:19,So it's massive.
00:26:19,00:26:23,"I think it's in the capital, the biggest city in Transylvania and it sounds like the coolest"
00:26:23,00:26:24,holiday ever now.
00:26:24,00:26:25,Have you seen it?
00:26:25,00:26:26,Really?
00:26:26,00:26:27,Yeah.
00:26:27,00:26:28,They converted it.
00:26:28,00:26:34,So it's this massive expanse of mine under the main city there and they've turned it into
00:26:34,00:26:35,basically a theme park.
00:26:35,00:26:36,It's this underground theme park.
00:26:36,00:26:38,It is in 1992.
00:26:38,00:26:42,So it's got this massive 180 seat amphitheater.
00:26:42,00:26:45,It's got basketball courts.
00:26:45,00:26:46,It's got like ping pong tables.
00:26:46,00:26:47,It's got mini golf.
00:26:47,00:26:48,It's got bowling.
00:26:48,00:26:52,You get carried around this big underground theme park in the old machinery that was used
00:26:52,00:26:53,for mining once.
00:26:53,00:26:58,They've got a huge underground lake and you can go on the lake and little boats.
00:26:58,00:27:01,They've got this ferris wheel that takes you up around it and you can look at the stalactites
00:27:01,00:27:04,and the stalactites as you go around on it.
00:27:04,00:27:05,And they've transformed this disused salt mine.
00:27:05,00:27:10,They didn't know what to do with for 50 years into the best theme park in the world.
00:27:10,00:27:11,Sounds amazing.
00:27:11,00:27:12,Yeah.
00:27:12,00:27:14,We should go there.
00:27:14,00:27:15,And that's in Terda.
00:27:15,00:27:16,That's in Terda.
00:27:16,00:27:17,Yeah.
00:27:17,00:27:22,"The edict of Terda is quite a famous thing, which is I think it was a kind of thing where"
00:27:22,00:27:26,it meant that in Transylvania everyone was allowed to have any religion they wanted and it was
00:27:26,00:27:28,one of the first places in the world that had this.
00:27:28,00:27:32,And I have this theory that that's why kind of people think of Transylvania as kind of
00:27:32,00:27:37,this weird kind of gothic place because the Catholic Church saw that it was a place where
00:27:37,00:27:40,anyone could have any religion they wanted and they kind of didn't like it.
00:27:40,00:27:41,Oh.
00:27:41,00:27:42,Yeah.
00:27:42,00:27:44,I think it might be because they had a leader called Raddy and Pela who had to pay hundreds
00:27:44,00:27:46,of thousands of people on spikes.
00:27:46,00:27:47,Yeah.
00:27:47,00:27:48,They're a good place to be.
00:27:48,00:27:49,They're a good place to be.
00:27:49,00:27:50,They're a good place to be.
00:27:50,00:27:51,They're a good place to be.
00:27:51,00:27:55,So let's move on to our final fact of the show and that is Chisinski.
00:27:55,00:27:56,Yeah.
00:27:56,00:28:02,"My fact is that until about 4,000 years ago, humans didn't notice the colour blue."
00:28:02,00:28:05,Or most humans didn't notice the colour blue.
00:28:05,00:28:06,Okay.
00:28:06,00:28:08,Just escape their notice.
00:28:08,00:28:11,So I'd not heard of this before.
00:28:11,00:28:14,"And so since reading into it, it's really fascinating."
00:28:14,00:28:15,It's amazing.
00:28:15,00:28:21,So the idea effectively is that someone looked through all the old literature that we
00:28:21,00:28:26,"have, any bit of writing, ancient Iceland, homer's odyssey, all that sort of stuff."
00:28:26,00:28:29,"And any time that there should have been a reference to blue, they used a different colour."
00:28:29,00:28:33,And so the idea is that they actually think that maybe because there was no word describing
00:28:33,00:28:39,"it, we just didn't notice the sky, which is where you're looking at the big blue thing"
00:28:39,00:28:40,in the sky.
00:28:40,00:28:44,"And as a result of not naming it, it was just blended into different colours."
00:28:44,00:28:45,Yeah.
00:28:45,00:28:46,It is extremely controversial that.
00:28:46,00:28:47,Yeah.
00:28:47,00:28:53,"This is a very controversial idea, but I think what corroborates it really nicely is that."
00:28:53,00:28:59,"So this guy who went through all these ancient texts, and it is from many different cultures."
00:28:59,00:29:05,"So yeah, Greece, China, Japan, Hebrew languages, none of them had the word for the colour blue."
00:29:05,00:29:07,They started off all having black and white.
00:29:07,00:29:09,They were the first words to colour words to appear.
00:29:09,00:29:11,And then red was the next one.
00:29:11,00:29:15,"Then yellows and greens came in, and then blue was last."
00:29:15,00:29:19,"And the idea that maybe people weren't really noticing blue, or sort of couldn't distinguish"
00:29:19,00:29:24,"it from others, does make a bit of sense when you look at this research that was done by"
00:29:24,00:29:29,"a guy called Jules Davidoff, and he did this research in Namibia with the Himbert tribe,"
00:29:29,00:29:33,and the Himbert tribe does not have a word for blue at all.
00:29:33,00:29:34,And you can look this up.
00:29:34,00:29:35,"It's really, really cool to do."
00:29:35,00:29:40,"What he did was he showed members of the Himbert tribe a series of, I think, it was 12 dots,"
00:29:40,00:29:44,"and 11 of them were bright green, and one of them was bright blue."
00:29:44,00:29:45,"And he said, ""Which one is the blue one?"""
00:29:45,00:29:47,And they couldn't tell.
00:29:47,00:29:50,"They just didn't know it, all the same to them, and so they really couldn't distinguish"
00:29:50,00:29:51,it.
00:29:51,00:29:55,"But then that tribe has many, many more words for green than we have."
00:29:55,00:30:00,"And they showed them a 12 green circles, and said, ""Which one is the different shade"
00:30:00,00:30:01,"of green?"""
00:30:01,00:30:04,"And if you look at the green circles, you cannot tell."
00:30:04,00:30:08,"I can't tell which one was the lighter shade of green, and everyone who they tested immediately"
00:30:08,00:30:10,spotted the lighter shade of green.
00:30:10,00:30:15,But the idea is that because they have more words to describe it and to distinguish between
00:30:15,00:30:19,"them, that we sort of learn, we automatically learn to distinguish that."
00:30:19,00:30:21,"I think it's a really, really interesting idea."
00:30:21,00:30:22,"Yeah, it's amazing."
00:30:22,00:30:25,"There's another kind of fact, which isn't really a fact, which no one could actually"
00:30:25,00:30:29,"see the colour blue, or maybe they were colour blind or something back in the day."
00:30:29,00:30:34,"And the idea is, Homer wrote about the sea, and he said it was the wine dark sea."
00:30:34,00:30:38,"And people are like, ""Why is he saying wine dark instead of blue?"""
00:30:38,00:30:39,Wine dark.
00:30:39,00:30:43,"Because when you see the sea in the evening, sunsert, it does, it can look the colour of"
00:30:43,00:30:44,wine.
00:30:44,00:30:46,So maybe all the wine was bright blue.
00:30:46,00:30:47,Yeah.
00:30:47,00:30:48,It's just the ones mentioned.
00:30:48,00:30:52,"Well, there is a theory that they, in those days, they used to add water to the wine because"
00:30:52,00:30:55,"the wine was a lot kind of stronger, so they'd add water to it."
00:30:55,00:30:59,"And the water might have had a high alkaline content, which made it look a bit more blue."
00:30:59,00:31:01,And they made their wine look a bit more blue.
00:31:01,00:31:03,That seems like a little bit like Clutchy that's stressed to me.
00:31:03,00:31:04,Yeah.
00:31:04,00:31:06,I don't think we'll ever resolve this argument one way or the other.
00:31:06,00:31:07,"It is amazing to think of it, though."
00:31:07,00:31:08,"It's very, very cool."
00:31:08,00:31:11,"I went on to a website called XKCD, where you guys must know this."
00:31:11,00:31:12,It's a webcomic.
00:31:12,00:31:13,Wow!
00:31:13,00:31:14,I think that's what I'm going to say.
00:31:14,00:31:16,I think the webcomic is in tonight.
00:31:16,00:31:21,"So it's a webcomic by Ronald Monroe, and he kind of explains things."
00:31:21,00:31:27,"And he did a really good kind of study where he looked at colours, and he had men and women"
00:31:27,00:31:30,"looking at all different colours and saw how they described them, to see if there was"
00:31:30,00:31:31,any difference.
00:31:31,00:31:34,"And they found that actually men and women was pretty much the same, apart from women"
00:31:34,00:31:39,"tend to add more things like light green and lime green, whereas men would just say something's"
00:31:39,00:31:40,green.
00:31:40,00:31:41,Just green.
00:31:41,00:31:42,It's just green.
00:31:42,00:31:46,"But why, why he did that?"
00:31:46,00:31:47,So that was a general thing.
00:31:47,00:31:48,But what he did was...
00:31:48,00:31:49,Classic lads.
00:31:49,00:31:50,Let's look at it.
00:31:50,00:31:51,Let's look at it.
00:31:51,00:31:52,Let's look at it.
00:31:52,00:31:53,Let's look at it.
00:31:53,00:31:54,I'm going to have the pub and not qualify colours.
00:31:54,00:32:00,"Sorry, James."
00:32:00,00:32:04,"So what he did, what he did was, that was kind of a general thing, but he looked at all"
00:32:04,00:32:09,the different things that people had said and tried to find which were the most male comments
00:32:09,00:32:11,and which were the most female comments.
00:32:11,00:32:14,So these are the colours that women said much more often than men.
00:32:14,00:32:22,"So dusty teal, blush pink, dusty lavender, butter yellow and dusky rose."
00:32:22,00:32:26,So they were things that women said that men really didn't say.
00:32:26,00:32:30,And the things that men said that women really didn't say for colours were penis.
00:32:30,00:32:40,"I mean, it's not that it's not one colour for a star."
00:32:40,00:32:44,"It's just green, mate."
00:32:44,00:32:49,You've got to see a doctor.
00:32:49,00:32:53,Who's beautiful grass?
00:32:53,00:33:03,"It's green, it might be."
00:33:03,00:33:15,"So, penis, don't know, beige, spelt with an A and WTF."
00:33:15,00:33:16,Wow.
00:33:16,00:33:22,"Yeah, apparently women can't see those colours."
00:33:22,00:33:25,"True, true facts."
00:33:25,00:33:34,"Speaking of penises, I've found and the colour of blue."
00:33:34,00:33:40,Scientists have worked out how now to if they can flash a blue light at your eyes and give
00:33:40,00:33:42,you an erection.
00:33:42,00:33:47,It's a really new thing that's happening at the moment.
00:33:47,00:33:55,"At the moment, they've only been able to give mice erections, but they're working on it"
00:33:55,00:33:56,for humans.
00:33:56,00:34:01,And the idea is that it stimulates a thing inside your eye that leads directly to a part
00:34:01,00:34:03,"of your penis, which I wrote down."
00:34:03,00:34:12,It's called Corpus cavernosum.
00:34:12,00:34:15,It's a region that gets filled up with blood to facilitate an erection.
00:34:15,00:34:23,So you see this light and it opens it up and you can go crazy.
00:34:23,00:34:31,"I don't understand the science of it, but it was really hard to read the main sign of it."
00:34:31,00:34:46,"That was part of it, wasn't it, that part of it."
00:34:46,00:34:50,"Go on, you're around to realise."
00:34:50,00:34:56,"So the guy that the scientist is working on it, he calls it erectileopogenetic stimulator"
00:34:56,00:35:00,"and when he was asked about it, so he said it's quite simple."
00:35:00,00:35:04,"Sometimes you get past the gene therapy part of it, shine a blue light, cause dick to get"
00:35:04,00:35:05,hard.
00:35:05,00:35:09,And that's basically the science.
00:35:09,00:35:10,It's amazing.
00:35:10,00:35:11,It's to do with an algae as well.
00:35:11,00:35:14,It's apparently a bit of an algae that they've taken out.
00:35:14,00:35:22,"I don't know if I've mentioned this about the new alternative to Viagra, which is playing"
00:35:22,00:35:24,sounds to your penis.
00:35:24,00:35:25,What?
00:35:25,00:35:29,"Yeah, it's like Viagra doesn't always work and sometimes it has side effects, but this"
00:35:29,00:35:33,"is the thing, they get a machine, they put it on the men's parts and they play very, very"
00:35:33,00:35:35,high clicks like this.
00:35:35,00:35:36,It is real.
00:35:36,00:35:39,Just you like Dolphins a bit much.
00:35:39,00:35:48,"Is this a very, very coded way of telling us about your awakening when he's all flipper?"
00:35:48,00:35:49,But it does work.
00:35:49,00:35:50,It does work.
00:35:50,00:35:51,That's incredible.
00:35:51,00:35:54,It kind of excites the blood vessels to kind of open.
00:35:54,00:35:55,Wow.
00:35:55,00:35:56,Wow.
00:35:56,00:35:57,This is real science people.
00:35:57,00:36:03,"I mean, I've got a fact about eyes and colour perception, but I'm not sure we can go back."
00:36:03,00:36:06,I've been really happy if we went back.
00:36:06,00:36:07,Okay.
00:36:07,00:36:08,"Yeah, let's go back to ours."
00:36:08,00:36:09,Yeah.
00:36:09,00:36:10,Okay.
00:36:10,00:36:15,Tarantulas have evolved to be blue or for parts of them to be blue separately on eight
00:36:15,00:36:18,different occasions in nature and we don't know why.
00:36:18,00:36:22,Why do they keep forgetting how to be blue and I mean to re-evolve it?
00:36:22,00:36:26,"When they branched off into separate, I think it's separate genuses and separate species."
00:36:26,00:36:29,Or maybe it's separate species within the same genus.
00:36:29,00:36:32,They have independently in though once they've branched off.
00:36:32,00:36:33,I see.
00:36:33,00:36:35,They have no idea.
00:36:35,00:36:36,And they don't have good colour vision.
00:36:36,00:36:38,So it's not like they know.
00:36:38,00:36:40,That's the really weird thing.
00:36:40,00:36:43,And it's not driven by sexual selection because they can't see when each other a blue.
00:36:43,00:36:45,They have no idea.
00:36:45,00:36:46,They can't tell.
00:36:46,00:36:47,So we have no idea.
00:36:47,00:36:51,"Maybe it hides them from the prey or maybe it, you know, has some other effect, but yeah."
00:36:51,00:36:52,Wow.
00:36:52,00:36:54,How weird.
00:36:54,00:37:00,"I was reading that you can now get your eyes turned blue if you have brown eyes for $5,000."
00:37:00,00:37:04,The idea is that actually right behind every brown eye is a blue eye because it's all to
00:37:04,00:37:05,do with colour.
00:37:05,00:37:09,So you can actually burn away the brown and sitting behind it is the natural blue.
00:37:09,00:37:10,Yeah.
00:37:10,00:37:11,So people are doing this now.
00:37:11,00:37:12,They say that babies all have blue eyes.
00:37:12,00:37:13,"I don't know if it's true, but they do say that."
00:37:13,00:37:14,"That's true, isn't they?"
00:37:14,00:37:15,They do.
00:37:15,00:37:18,As all babies have very pale blue eyes for the first few days and then they sort themselves
00:37:18,00:37:19,out.
00:37:19,00:37:21,Get their acts together.
00:37:21,00:37:22,That's really cool.
00:37:22,00:37:27,"If I hadn't recently spent all my money renting these, I would definitely put my eyes."
00:37:27,00:37:28,Let's wrap up.
00:37:28,00:37:29,Shall we wrap up?
00:37:29,00:37:30,Okay.
00:37:30,00:37:31,That's it.
