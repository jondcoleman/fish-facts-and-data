 [MUSIC]

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Leeds!

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Starting with you, Chazinski.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 My fact this week is that the first hydraulic lift was invented to carry sheep onto a roof.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 And it was invented to do that in Leeds, in fact.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 You suck, aren't you?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 No, no, no.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 What could I say?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 No, it's this place called Temple Works and it's in an area called Holbeck.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Do you have no temple works, you must do right?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 There you go.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 And yeah, it's this amazing building.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 So it was a flax mill. It was started in 1836. At the time it was built, it was the biggest room in the world.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 And it was this guy who was designing this flax mill, but he wanted to make it, he was very safety conscious.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 And so he thought it should all be on one level because he thought if there was a fire, everyone needed to be able to escape quite fast.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 So it was one floor, huge room, and the reason for the sheep on the roof is that.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 So he planted a lawn on the roof, all this grass, because for the flax not to work properly, it needed to be quite moist air inside.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 And so the grass on the roof kind of sucked moisture out of the air, and then it was siphoned down in pipes into the factory.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 And if you've got a grass, you need someone to mow it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 And that's the herd of sheep.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 And so he invented this lift because sheep can't go upstairs.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 And that is the story of Temple Works.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 It's a long and convoluted reason to invent a lift, but that's what he did.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Yeah, it is the biggest room in the world, isn't it?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Oh, it was.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Yeah.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 And I wanted to find out what was the biggest room in the world now.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 And so I googled it, but whenever you googled it, you just get the phrase, "The largest room in the world is a room for improvement."

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 So true.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 We probably don't know this, but how many sheep occupied the roof?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Was it like, was it a lot where they sort of clustered up?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Or was it just a couple who didn't--

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 I think it will have been enough to eat that much grass.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Yeah.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 So not much.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 All right.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 I'm going to say six.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Six.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Oh, I'd say more than six.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 It was a very big room.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 I started counting them, but I fell asleep.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 But it is a really cool building.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 And it was the vision of this guy called John Marshall, who was an early 19th century industrialist,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 when people were starting to think about worker safety.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 And so another thing it had was 25 fire escapes.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Which for a room-- it was like one room, which was a two-acre large room, but even so, 25.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 I think the whole thing was doors.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 But surely none of the sheep would have been able to escape in the event of a fire.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Hey, they can't go downstairs.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 No.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 So you just got a nice barbecue waiting for you when you get back to the building.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Yeah.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 I read that since the '90s in Switzerland, the requirement for every new building is that they should have the ability to have a sustainable rooftop with grass on the top.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 So if you take visuals of Switzerland by, let's say, Google Earth or whatever, it's just beautifully green.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Like they've hidden the whole country.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Yeah.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Imagine trying to bomb Switzerland.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 You couldn't.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 I know.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 I think I've got nuclear bunkers for every person in the whole population.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Yeah.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 We're nuclear bunkers.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 We don't know.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 But I think this is amazing, isn't it?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Because at the moment, green architecture is like the main thing that everyone's trying to do.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 All the new cities are putting grass on top of their buildings.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 And leads was doing it 150 years ago.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 Yeah, very cool.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Which is pretty cool.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 And green architecture takes 30% less energy to heat your building for just a 2% increase in construction costs.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 And the world standards for green architecture are the leadership in energy and environmental design standards.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Or leads.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Oh.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 That's good, isn't it?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 That's very good.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Do you want to talk about sheep, though?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Yeah.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 I'd love to talk about sheep.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Well, I did, because this is, this fact is about sheep on a roof.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 And I was looking at different places to put sheep.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 And one thing that I found amazing is that Captain Cook, when he was going between Australia and New Zealand,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 one place that he really wanted to put sheep was New Zealand.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Which New Zealand is now known for sheep, but in Captain Cook's time, they weren't there.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 And his idea was to introduce sheep to New Zealand.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 And he brought two with him.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 And he arrived.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 This was his second journey there after sussing it out.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 The first time being like, "No, no sheep."

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 And so he went back, brought some.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 And he thought this was going to be his big thing.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 He thought this is, I'm going to spread the spread.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 And he let them out.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 And two days later, or within a few days, they ate a couple poisonous plants and died immediately.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Yeah.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 And he wrote, last night, the UNRAM, I had so much care and trouble brought to this place, died.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 We did suppose that they were poisoned by eating some poisonous plants.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Thus, all my fine hopes of stocking this country with a breeder sheep were blasted in a moment.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Wow.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Poor Captain Cook.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Wait, and that's why there are no sheep in New Zealand today.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 No, and then other people were like, love the sheep idea, Captain.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 I'll get some over.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 And then they did.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 And now there's more sheep there than people.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 And New Zealand, though, sheep racing is a very popular thing.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 And in fact, across the world, and some people take it really seriously.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 I didn't quite know this was a thing, but it's kind of like dog racing.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 So they jump over hurdles and stuff.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 And in New Zealand, the big race, I think, they go round a pub and jump over lots of beer barrels.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 And sheep get up to 60 miles an hour.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 What?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 When they race.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 60 miles an hour.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Do they act?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 I mean, that should be not my goal.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Maybe.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 That's impossible, isn't it?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 That's impossible.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 They pushed them off a sky scraper at the end.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 That's what it is.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 No, that's not possible, is it?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 I've just seen that in my notes and thought, that's faster than a cheater, I think.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 I mean, wouldn't that be amazing if we just found out the sheep are the fastest animals in the world?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 I imagine the look of the sheep dogs face.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Well, where are the sheep boy?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 You were not going to believe what happened.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Do you know that in New Zealand, they're actually trying.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 There's a New Zealand Farmers Federation.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 And they're trying to push for sheep sharing to become an Olympic sport.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 That's their latest push because it's been recognized as a sport.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 This is one of the first steps that you need in order to get to the Olympics.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 So sheep sharing, pole dancing.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 Yeah, I saw that article.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 So it was last year, wasn't it?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 And it's a whole load of new spots now accepted by the International Sports Association of Associations.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 And pole dancing table football is, sheep sharing is, but rugby league isn't.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Really?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 Yeah. And they reckon that it's because the rugby union people are blocking them.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 I knew that I got that well in lead.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 Do you know that sheep are happier when they're surrounded by photos of friends and family?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 No.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 This is true.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 I swear to God.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 This was published in the Royal Society's newspaper, Biological Sciences.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Basically, the sheep were put in a dark room in an experiment.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 And they were shown various things.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 And their behaviour was recorded.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 And when they were shown sheep that were familiar to them, they had a low heart rate.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 And they made fewer bleats than when they were shown triangles or goats.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 But to be fair, a triangle is a natural predator or sheep.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 The report of it in the telegraph said that the discovery could point to the reason

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 that many of us carry pictures of loved ones.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 Yeah.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 I guess we needed the sheep to tell us that.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 The problem is, there's nowhere to put photographs of your loved ones if you're a sheep.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 That's true.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 There's no wall to hang them on.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And they don't have bedside tables.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 But at 60 miles an hour, you can visit them so quickly.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 Okay, let's move on to our next fact.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 It's time for fact number two.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 And that is my fact. My fact this week is that Pope Leo the 13th was once the face of a wine and cocaine cocktail.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 This was a drink that was sold back in the late 1800s and early 1900s called Vin Mariani.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 And it was the predecessor to actual Coca-Cola.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 So if you've heard that thing about Coca-Cola having cocaine in it, this is where it comes from.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 And actually the original Coca-Cola was actually a French wine as well. Coca-Cola started as an alcohol.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 But originally the started in France, it was a guy called Angelo Mariani.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 And it was so loved that the Pope not only drunk it, he was said to have a flask that he carried around with him all the time.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 And he awarded it the Vatican gold medal.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 It's extraordinary.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 What is cocaine? What even is a Vatican gold medal? I cannot find any other example of that medal.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 He must have been high at the time, given the gold medal.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 So one of the, one of the adverts for it said that the Pope said that he would fortify himself with Vin Mariani.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 Quote, "When prayer was insufficient, it was not that."

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 But this was, it was really popular and lots of celebrities love this drink.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 It was a huge deal. So Queen Victoria drank it.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 And Joel's Verne drank it, which actually makes a lot of sense. You read Joel's Verne.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Thomas Edison drank it. Robert Louis Stevenson, Ulysses S. Grant.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 It was super popular. And it was one of these things that did well through celebrity endorsement.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Yeah, and they gave all of their endorsements.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 So Pope Leo literally appeared with a drawing of his face in a newspaper endorsing this drink.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 HG Wells loved it so much. He personally drew two cartoon drawings of himself to allow for it to be used as an endorsement.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 Yeah. And you were supposed to have three glasses of it a day, this wine and cocaine cocktail,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 taken after your meals and half the children.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Because you know what they're like when they've had too much cocaine.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 Although Pope Leo the 13th was not that fun a guy, which is weird since he was the only known drug addict's Pope.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 But I was looking into so much.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 Well, I was going to the British newspaper archive looking for articles about him.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 And there was just loads of profiles on him. And they all talk about how solitary and serious and grave he was.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 One newspaper said he is a silent solitary spirit addicted to study and grave conversation, seldom laughing, a hater of vain twaddle.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 So one of the thing about Leo the 13th, he put fig leaves on the statues at the Vatican on the naked ones.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 See, he was such a killjoy. You would have thought if you're high on drugs.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Does that description of yours, you know, that he was sludgy and addicted to study?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Does it ever say except for certain afternoons when he would only dance and talk about himself?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 It sounds like he made decisions on the come down.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 But the thing with the fig leaves, in fairness for him, he was trying to protect them from future iconoclasts.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Because his previous, the previous Pope before him, who was pious the night, he was even worse than this guy.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 And he used to destroy the new statues. He would just completely trash them.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 And so Leo the 13th thought, well, maybe if I put fig leaves on the no one will trash them.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 I'll never think to look behind these fig leaves.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 But the problem is that a lot of the statues that he's put fig leaves on, he stuck them on so hard that now if you try and remove the fig leaves, you're going to take the cock off.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 Weird.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Some stuff on Coca-Cola.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 So what happened was a guy called Pemberton in America found this Vin Mariani.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 He also called it a most wonderful invigorator of the sexual organs.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 So he sold this stuff which had wine and cocaine in, but then due to prohibition, the Ku Klux Klan actually demanded that all alcohol be banned from Atlanta.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 And so they banned all alcohol from Atlanta.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 So he had to get rid of all the alcohol from the drink.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 He got rid of most of the cocaine as well and then he vented Coca-Cola.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 It's not a little bit of cocaine left, not now.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 It was.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 It was extraordinary that the only reason we have Coca-Cola as a soft drink was the prohibition.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 It goes that far back and the syrup had to be replaced.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 You never hear that in the origin story.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 What I love about it is Pemberton's representatives used to hang out coupons for free Coca-Cola.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 And so he would give you this stuff with cocaine and say you can have this one for free.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 And then they'd come back later and go, "Where was that coke?"

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Coca-Cola imports hundreds of millions of dollars worth of coke leaves which could be turned into cocaine each year, but they don't turn it into cocaine.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 They just extract the coke.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 But then there is one other company which makes cocaine out of it.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 So I think it was in 2003 they imported 175,000 kilos of coke from which you can get quite a lot of cocaine.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 And what are they doing with that?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 It's being used medicinally.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Yeah.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 But it is the only Coca-Cola company.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 You know when people say, "Oh, what's the secret ingredient in Coca-Cola?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 It's coca leaves because they're the only company that are allowed to use stuff with coca leaves."

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 They've got an exception from the government like tens and tens of years ago that said they could import it.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 And so they're the only ones who are allowed it. And they do basically make cocaine out of it.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 But then they just give it to medicine.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 Do you know, I was looking up kind of weird 19th century drinks and cocktails and stuff like that.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 And ended up looking through a bunch of old Victorian books for cocktail recipes.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 And there is one thing that comes up over and over again.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Well, in fact there are two things I thought were interesting.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 One is that mould wine was made with raw eggs.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 So if you made mould wine in the 19th century you had to crack some raw eggs into it.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 And then it was drunk through a straw.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 So for a lot of these cocktails they would say drink this through a straw.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 But in all the recipes they say drink through a straw, stick, macaroni or vermicelli.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 And it turns out people just use like macaroni pasta or vermicelli pasta as straws.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 I looked into this and that's which you obviously should do.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 That is amazing.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Yeah, it's sensible, isn't it?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Yeah, I mean I'll stick with straws for now.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Okay, it would go so maybe because we want to get rid of all the plastic straws, don't we?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Absolutely.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 That's actually the big vermicelli over there.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 I have a fact about advertising because this is about advertising this wine in cocaine.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 The first ever TV advert in Britain was in 1955.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 It was on the 22nd of September 1955.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 That was when ITV launched.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 So that was the first ever televised advertising.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 And on the day that that happened, the BBC killed off Grace Archer,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 who was one of the main characters on the Archer's, the radio show,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 and it was so that they would dominate the newspaper headlines the next day.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 And so that they would get a bit more cover of the ITV's adverts.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 Bastards.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 So Grace Archer died to combat advertising?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 Yes.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 No.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 She laid down her life.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Very good course.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 For a good course.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 And the following morning, Bernard Levin, he wrote in the Guardian newspaper

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 about he kind of reviewed the experience of seeing adverts.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 And he said, "I feel neither depraved nor uplifted by what I have seen.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 I have already forgotten the name of the toothpaste."

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Wow.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Because I think that was the most listened to radio program ever that episode

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 when Grace Archer died.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 It's very famous.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 So they absolutely nailed it.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 Did anyone in here listen to it?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 No, they're all too young.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 Yeah.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 Wait, there was one whoop.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 I was looking on the internet that says that the earliest kind of product placement

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 was by Gladiators in Rome.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 Like not on ITV.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 They had the massive cotton bud contract.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 Yeah.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 Yeah.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 Well, apparently they were selling olive oil and stuff like that.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 But I couldn't find anything else about it.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 So I messaged our friend Greg Jenner, who's a historian, who's been on the podcast.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 And he spoke to Professor Sarah Bond, who's an expert in this field.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 And she thinks that it's not exactly the same thing.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 What it was is Gladiators were slaves of people.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 And so if your boss was an olive oil salesman, then you would sell it because he was an olive oil salesman.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 So it definitely happened that they were kind of the product placement thing, but it wasn't their choice.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 But did they have to cover themselves in olive oil before they went out for a fight?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 I think that would be amazing.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 Actually, there is a thing about them covering themselves and stuff, but I'll come to that later.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 We should move on in a second.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 Anything before we do?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 My favorite product placement of all time is the NBC's first daily news program.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 One of the first TV news programs in the world.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 It's called The Camel News Caravan.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 And it was entirely sponsored by Camel cigarettes.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 And it's the most amazing thing you could ever watch.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 You should look it up.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 So basically the entire channel was about promoting Camel cigarettes.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 But it's ostensibly not that.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 So for instance, there's a moment where Rex Marshall, the presenter, is doing a sports program.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 And he interviews this baseball team, a really famous baseball team.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 And he's talking to him about how the game's gone, the last game they played,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 and how they're feeling about the next game.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 And he asks one of them, he's got like five in the room.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 First of all, they're all smoking Camel cigarettes the whole time.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 And he says, "How are you feeling about the next game?"

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 And the first player says, "I feel great, Rex, the same way I feel about Camel's.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 They taste good and they're mild."

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Which isn't a description of a game of baseball.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 And also, if you don't know, it's about cigarettes.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 Just tuning in to that channel at that moment.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 I'd say the same way I feel about Camel's.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 They taste good.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 It's so weird though, he goes around all five.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Like the next one is like, "Are you going to live up to your reputation?"

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 And the guy goes, "Sure, we're going to try Rex.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 The series is something special, just like Camel's."

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 And it's, again, very poor on the pivot.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 But that was the whole point of the show.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 All right, shall we move on to our next facts?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that Tonux T-Cakes aren't allowed in RAF planes in case they explode.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Amazing.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 What?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Okay, so first of all, does anyone not know what a Tonux T-Cake is?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 I didn't really.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 I have to say.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 So, for non-British listeners, especially, Tonux T-Cake is like a, it's a confectionery,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 it's got a biscuit base, then a dome of marshmallow, and then it's all covered in chocolate.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 It's fantastic, they're really good.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Yeah, and they're made in Scotland, and they're kind of a famous Scottish delicacy.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 You say?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 Yeah, delicacy is a bit strong, isn't it?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 So, and this fact came from a recent interview in a number of newspapers by Squadron Leader Tony Cunain.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 And he said that he and his colleagues were flying with T-Cakes, and they realised that they'd expand when the pressure changed.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 And so, they'd be able to tell the altitude they were at, depending on how big their T-Cakes were.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 About 15,000 feet, the T-Cake would expand sufficiently to crack the cop chocolate shell.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 Is that, is that useful in a, in a life or death situation?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 We were against the Luftwaffe. Where's the T-Cake?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Well, the problem was, one day they were at 40,000 feet, and there was, they were doing a special kind of test,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 and there was a chain, massive change in pressure, and it just exploded.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 And he said, chocolate and shredded marshmallows splattered all over the wooden screens, the flight instruments and the pilots flying suits.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 This rather distracted the pilots from the immediate emergency actions they were supposed to take.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 They're after marshmallows were banned.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 All right. So, you can't take them up anymore.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 No. I like that the pilots had it with them.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 Like, that suggested it was a snack, waiting for them to eat as well.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 Yeah.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 Why would you keep it in the cockpit? Why not do the experiments in the bathroom?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 It just so happens that that would, you know, they just like T-Cakes.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Yeah. Right.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 And they just realized that this was happening and thought, oh, yeah, let's, you know, let's keep taking them up.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 That's kind of funny. It's really sweet.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 And it's basically because there's air inside them.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 The marshmallow has got loads and loads of air in it, and the change in pressure just makes it expand.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 Tannux actually responded to this.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 When the after the interview happened, a Tannux spokesman said, I'm quoting exactly here,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 "It never ceases to amaze us what people get up to with our products."

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 They said, "It never ceases to amaze us what people get up to with our products."

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 We find this example highly amusing, which does imply there are a lot of other examples.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 We find this example disgusting.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 I like the sound of Tannux, the coronary boy Tannux, he's called.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 And we have coincidences, actually, isn't it?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Yeah, he's the great grandson of the Tannux inventor, isn't he?

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 He is, yeah, but he also has invented new Tannux products.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 But what I like about him is he has this notebook that he carries around.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 He's so invested in his company.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 So he carries a notebook around. He keeps all the sales.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 But he also is said, it's not been confirmed, but it said that he has a circle inside the notebook,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 which should be what the size of a Tannux T cake is.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 So whenever he sees one, he goes, is that very nice? It fits the circle.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 He measures them on his notebook.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 Yeah, just out of habit, he just wants to make sure they're all the right size.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Wow.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 And actually, they were good on advertising.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 They were one of the early kind of billboard makers.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 And this is a guy called John Tannux in the 1850s, who was a coffin maker.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 And he used to put big adverts up all over the road saying,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 "Why live a miserable life when for 30 Bob, you can be buried comfortably."

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 Which is so weird, because I don't understand how being buried comfortably

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 is going to make you not live a miserable life.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 Something to look forward to.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 Marshmallows, guess what? Gladiators used to cover themselves in olive oil.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 Olive oil.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Marshmallows, guys.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 No, they did. They would rub themselves in marshmallows with a sap of the marshmallow plant.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 And they thought it would reduce inflammation and irritation of the skin.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 And also, it would give the machine and maybe make them more hard to grab hold of.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Sorry, it's very sweet, the idea that you need to reduce inflammation and irritation of the skin.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 If you've got a spear inside you, don't you worry, I've got something going to help that.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 So the stuff that we get now is kind of fake marshmallow, isn't it?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 It's made out of sugar and stuff like that.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 But you used to have sweets made out of actual marshmallow, the plant, which grows, I think, in swamps and marshes and stuff like that.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 And in Egypt, it was reserved for gods and royalty.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 They were the only ones who allowed to eat marshmallows.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 That's good, isn't it?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 Hey, I was looking into other things that have been banned by RAF planes.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 Yeah, so you've got tonics, TK, it's banned by RAF planes.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 Another thing banned, Philip Hammond.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Because he expands, doesn't he, when he gets the answer?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 Are we talking chancellor of the extra?

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 This may have been resolved, but I couldn't find information to say it has been.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 But only a few years ago, he had taken so many flights and not paid for them that they've now said,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 "You're not getting on any more flights, you've not paid for a single ticket."

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 Prime Minister has done it and anyone else who has done it, they've paid their bills.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 But he owes them a huge amount of money because he takes, he uses their services.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 The M.O.D. said, "You tonics cakes, get out."

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 Wow.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 If only he had access to a massive amount of money that he could pay the bills.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 I was looking up other things that expand in planes.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 Okay.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 And I mean, everything expands in a plane.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 But specifically, you expand in a plane.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 Specifically, even more so, all the gas in your gut.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 It gets a third bigger than normal.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 So if you have ever found yourself farting lots on a plane, that's the reason.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 It's not a plane that got grounded quite recently because someone wouldn't stop farting.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 I think there was.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 There was, isn't there?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 It was creating such a terrific smell for all the other passengers.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Look, I apologise to the cabin crew.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 It's just physics, guys.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 There was also a plane that was, I had to turn around and go back to where it took off from

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 because the toilets were broken.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 But what was amazing about it was on board were 80 plumbers who were on their way to a convention.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 They were unable to do anything.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 They all looked at it and went, "Oh no."

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 I'll have to go back and get some tools for this one.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Just very quickly, another thing that's banned on airplanes.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 Smoking, obviously banned.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 Interestingly, do you know what is essential for every airplane when it goes up?

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 An engine.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 Oh, oh.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 I'm sorry.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 Let's, let's, those little moist townlets.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 Let me hone this list in a bit.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 Smoking is banned, but ash trays are essential.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 Why?

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 The reason is, is because even though they've told people don't smoke, please don't smoke, you'll be in trouble.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 You'll be arrested or so on.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 They still think people are going to have a cheeky smoke.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 That's their theory.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 So toilets in airplanes still need to have an ash tray because if someone gets caught and puts it out,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 it's better than them not having somewhere to put it out.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 And so, as a result, it's an essential British airlines have had planes have not been allowed to take off

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 because their new planes have not had ash trays in them and they've had to be fitted.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 It's an America have a England have it.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Yeah, it's an essential thing.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 Which is insane because you can put out a cigarette on anything.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 It doesn't make any sense.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 You can just drop it in your beer that you've ordered for £20 on your airplane.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 The fact is that when Louis XIV, the French king, needed an operation,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 his doctor was so nervous that he practised it on 75 people beforehand.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Many of whom did not have the condition the operation was meant to cure.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 So Louis XIV ruled until 1715, I think that's when he died,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 and he had a very painful medical condition called a fistula, an anal fistula,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 kind of a gap that opens up in the body as quite painful, it's quite embarrassing,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 and the king had one.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 So, his surgeon, Charles Francois Félix, he was incredibly nervous because at this time,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 being a surgeon was a part-time job with being a barber and being a weekmaker.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 So, surgery wasn't very advanced.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 No.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 And it's like the people who make keys and fix your shoes.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Exactly.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Yes. And 300 years, we won't believe that those two were ever combined.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 Because the art of key making will have been so improved.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 But just like key making, surgery was in its infancy.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 And the surgeon, he borrowed 75 people.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 We only know because he wrote a long account of it.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 The king's official doctors who would prescribe you medicine were very sniffy about surgery,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 as everyone was in that century.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 They thought it was like basically bloodletting and nothing else.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 And so, he borrowed 75 people. He said, "You need this operation, but give me six months

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 and 75 people to practice on."

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 And he practiced and practiced and practiced until he got it right.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 Yeah, and actually he didn't really want to go through with it, right?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 Because it's a really painful procedure.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 A lot of people died having it.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 And he really wanted to try and find a different way of doing it.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 So, before he even practiced on these 75 people, he found another load of people

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 and tried loads of different cures on them.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Just like giving them drinks and giving them pulses and stuff like that.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 And just saying, "Did that work? Did that work?"

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 But then a lot of them didn't have it, so I don't know how he could tell.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Yeah.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 Yeah, he wanted Louie himself, wanted to bathe in special mineral water, didn't he?

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Rather than have the anal surgery, which you can totally understand that being your preference.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 He probably said no to that because famously, Louie the 14th never bathed.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 He bathed only two times in his life.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 As far as he could remember, obviously childhood is out.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 But as an adult, he bathed two times and he stunk really, really badly.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 A Russian ambassador to France said that he stunk like a wild animal.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 And he was clearly so aware of how much he stunk that when he was in a room,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 he would open the windows and be like, "Sorry about this."

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 However, with the procedure, he might have been up for it because he was very into animals.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 He loved an animal. He had about 2,000 animals in his lifetime.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 2,000 is a lot.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 That's too many.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 I think one's too many. I'll be honest.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 But when the King had this operation, it was really secret that it was happening.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 So the only people who knew about it were the King, the surgeon, his doctors,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 his war minister, careful, his confessor, and his new secret wife,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 who he never acknowledged at court because she was a commoner.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 So he didn't want anyone to know about her, and a new secret.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 It's a good way to test a relationship early on, I think.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 But if you get through that and still fancy them, I think you can probably survive anything.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 It's true. And it was a success.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 It was a success. All the four doctors arrived for the procedure through different doors to keep it a secret.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 How does that keep it a secret?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 Well, I guess you think I've just seen one doctor come in today,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 not four doctors arrived at the same time. The King must be in big trouble.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 And then the war minister held the King's hand throughout the procedure,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 which took hours, not the wife, interestingly.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 Well, imagine having Gavin Williams and MP holding your hand.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 And then when it was a success, everyone was very happy because they did tell they told everyone about it, didn't they?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 And then suddenly all the French people decided that they wanted to have the same operation.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 And it became extremely fashionable to have your anus lanced.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 And doctors used to get really annoyed because people would come and say,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 "I'm pretty sure I've got an anal fistula when they had just like a blister on their face or something."

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 And doctors say, "No, you don't." And they say, "No, I'm pretty sure I've an anal fistula."

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 "Can I have the King thing?"

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 And yeah.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 And also he had bandages around his backside because he had this done.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 It became really fashionable for people to walk around with bandages around the bum.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 Yeah.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 To pretend that they'd had the operation.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Yeah, that's extraordinary, isn't it?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 It's kind of, it makes a little more sense in the context of the life of the French King.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Because for example, all the King's poos were documented.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 All the King's horses, all the King's poos.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 Yeah, not just the notable ones.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 Well, you know, one of the things is, right, basically Louis the Farting who talked about this before,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 he wanted his whole life to be on display, right?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 And it was not just his life, it was everyone in his court.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 Everyone's life had to be completely open.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 And one of the reasons they think is because if everyone knew what everyone else was doing all the time,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 it would be impossible for people to go behind his back and plot against him.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 Yeah.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 That's one thing.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 And he did, he really wanted to be able to control all his courtiers and his nobles

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 because everyone was always rebelling against the King in those days.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 But he had really strict rules in Versailles about how everyone else there was supposed to act.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 So he literally had rules about where certain nobles could stand in a room.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 And everyone had their own chair.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 And they weren't allowed to sit in another chair.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 And they had to enter a leave in a certain way.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 And he also had this rule that you had to move between wings of Versailles, which was this huge palace.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 You'd move between the wings in a sedan chair.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 And only the royal family, like his siblings or his children, had their own sedan chair.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 And then the other people in the palace, the nobles, would have to hail one down.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 So you just, you have people walking around with sedan chairs.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 And you just have to put your thumb out and be like, I've got to get to the West Wing now.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 That's amazing.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 You had to flag them down.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 And like you had to pay a fair. So Versailles was so huge that you got to the gate, but the cost of getting on sedan chair from the gate to the palace door was six sous, which was the currency at the time.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 So you had to...

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 Is this, and this is inside the palace?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 Inside the palace, yeah.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 That's incredible.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 Flag down the sedan.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 So I should have invented a new system where you could, you know, just have one come to you by pressing a little thing on the wall.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 So he says he's five minutes away, but I can't see him.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 One of the most famous...

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 Super. That's what it should have been called, sorry.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 Super.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 One of the most famous facts that I think we all know, and if you watch QI, you would know this, is to do with this anal fistual thing.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 And that is that once the operation was a success, everyone was celebrating.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 And John Baptiste Lully, who is a French court composer, had a big sort of opera.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 But during the performance, he stabbed himself in the foot with his baton, and he went gangrenous, and he died.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 And it's famous as one of those stupid deaths, you know, where the composer wax himself in the foot.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 What a way to go.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 At least it was an incredibly important epoch or piece of music, but I don't know.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 Sorry, no, it was the festival performance.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 Hey, just speaking of music very quickly, there was a book that was published in 1938 called The Oxford Companion to Music.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 It was published by Percy Scholls. In it, he discusses God Save the Queen, God Save the King.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 And the British National Anthem, he puts forward the ideas of how it came about.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 Because no one's completely sure for certain who wrote it when it was written.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 They think there was origin stories of how it sort of was taken from handle music, and so on.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 There was a lot of sort of going on.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 In this book, he puts forward the theory as well, that it was actually...

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 This is a French theory that the song was composed in gratitude for the survival of Louis XIV's anal fistula.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 It's not amazing.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 So, impossibly, when we stand up to sing the national anthem, it's because of his penis.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 That's why we stand up.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 Do you want to know my favourite fistula?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 We've all got one.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 History. I think there's a long list, but I think top spot is official from 1822.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 And this is a really important thing in medical history.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 A guy called Alexis Samata was shot in Michigan through the stomach.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 It was an accidental hunting accident, but he was shot incredibly badly.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 His whole inside exploded. His lungs were hanging out of his body.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Someone reported that when he ate, food fell straight out of his stomach again.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 He was really in a bad way. Everyone thought he was going to die.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 He didn't, but what did happen that was quite weird.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 He'd been shot in the kind of stomach area.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 His stomach healed by, like, healing itself onto his external skin.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 So, this is what a fistula is.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 It's a kind of unnatural and painful connection between two organs that shouldn't be connected, isn't it?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 And so, he had a permanent window to his stomach.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 He would walk around and you could just see his stomach completely exposed.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 And a doctor called William Beaumont thought, "Well, this is ideal for me to experiment on."

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 And he made enormous leaps in our understanding of digestion

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 and how foods are processed in our body by adopting this guy, basically,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 and testing out his stomach.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 But he did some really weird stuff.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 So, for instance, his stomach was literally on display.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 And he did things like -- he would lick this guy's empty stomach

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 to taste if there was any acid in it, to see if you produced acid when you weren't eating.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 He would put food on a spoon, and then insert it just into this guy's stomach.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 And then he'd leave it there for a bit.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 And then he'd monitor how long it took to break down.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 And then he'd tie a string to it, and then he'd pull it out at certain intervals.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Did he have permissions to do this, did he?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 I think the guy came to resent him.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 They fell out in the end.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 Oh, he came to resent him, did he?

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 That'd be terrible.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Imagine people could see what you had eaten.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 And your mum gives you some biscuits.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 I made them, and then she escalated, did you eat those biscuits?

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 And you say, "Yeah, of course I ate the biscuits."

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 And then she says, "You liar, I can see your stomach."

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 It's probably a rare problem.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 What a weird window into your life.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 Which is sad.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 I was more upsetting than the window into this guy's stomach.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 All right, let's wrap up.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 Okay, that is it.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 That is all of our facts.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 And we're going to quickly give away one of the tapes

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 that we brought with us.

 Yeah, so this was to come and find us afterwards to claim your prize.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 But it's Hannah Watson.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 Hannah Watson here.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 Hannah.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 Hannah.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 All right, this is the fact in 2004, a boat capsized in Texas

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 because all people on board ran to one side to get a glimpse of a nudist beach they were passing.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 All 60 passengers ended up in the water.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 That's amazing.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 Yeah, come to the back.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 We'll have the cassette there.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 As I said earlier, we're going to be there out the back.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 That is it.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 That is all of our facts.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
