00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish When We Were Joined

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,440
 by the incredible mathematician, YouTuber, science communicator, all-round smart guy

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,360
 Matt Parker. Now, a lot of you will know a lot of Matt's work. He's written a lot of

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,000
 books, things to make and do in the fourth dimensions. One of his humble pie was an

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,200
 absolutely massive book for him. He has a new book out. It is called Love Triangle, The

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,640
 Life-Changing Magic of Trigonometry. I haven't read it yet, but I can tell you having read

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,400
 his other books, it is going to be absolutely incredible. And you can pre-order it right

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:52,720
 now by going to mathsgear.co.uk. That's M-A-T-H-S-G-E-A-R.co.uk. Don't forget that S if you're in America.

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,800
 And you can pre-order a signed copy with a limited edition dust jacket. Of course, it

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,240
 will be available in all of the local bookshops and probably in those big online book retailers

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:11,240
 as well. A few other things about Matt, he is in a podcast called A Problem Squared with

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,080
 Beck Hill, who you might remember from a few months ago. She came on the podcast and talks

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,080
 about Cabbage Patch Kids. Beck and Matt have this incredible podcast. It's definitely worth

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:27,560
 listening to. And there is also a podcast of unnecessary detail that Matt does with two

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,520
 other ex-fish alumni, Steve Mould and Helen Arney from the Festival of the Spoken Nerd.

16
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,280
 Anyway, I'm sure you're going to love this week's show. Don't forget at the end of it,

17
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,480
 go to mathsgear.co.uk to pre-order Matt's new book, Love Triangle. But for now, all that's

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,000
 left to say is on with the podcast.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:10,200
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

20
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,040
 to you from the QI offices in Hovern. My name is Dan Shriver. I am sitting here with Anna

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,720
 Tyshinski, James Harkin and Matt Parker. And once again, we have gathered around the

22
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,840
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:31,240
 order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Matt. The first computer to ever

24
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:38,600
 discover a shape starred in the 1980s sitcom. Well, starred was in an episode of the 1980s

25
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:45,920
 sitcom Laverne and Shirley. Wow. There are a couple of concepts in there. I'm not familiar

26
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,520
 with them. I like to pack a lot of concepts into a sentence. Okay, so computer shape, Laverne

27
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,060
 or Shirley? Can we talk about how you discover a shape? Good point. That feels like the bigger

28
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,880
 question. I also don't know what Laverne and Shirley show you'd recommend. I'm unfamiliar

29
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,400
 with their non-computer based episodes. I used to watch it as a kid. Really? Yeah, yeah.

30
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,800
 And it's good. Yeah, it's, I mean, it was a spinoff from Happy Days. Yeah, it's Gary

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,080
 Marshall, who was the, yeah, the creator of it. He was the Happy Days guy. Yeah, yeah.

32
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,680
 Apparently it was a lot of, sorry, we're in Laverne and Shirley territory now. That was

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,600
 in the main part of my own. Apparently they were like really kind of like, you know, they

34
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,640
 had lots of fights on set and Happy Days, the cast, they used to put glass to the walls

35
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,440
 to hear the Argivets that were going on on the other side. Yeah, it was all that stuff.

36
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,680
 On Happy Days. Yeah. But it was, it was early 80s, I think, Laverne and Shirley. So that's

37
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,520
 quite early for, no, it's not that early for computers, is it? It was a 1980 episode and

38
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:51,960
 the same computer had previously starred in The Land of the Giants in 1969. God didn't

39
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,600
 get work for a while then. No, it went out for a while. So it was in 60s like sci-fi and

40
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:05,040
 being in a 1986 com was actually like the final bit of its Hollywood career. Yeah, it's pretty

41
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,720
 about you've, you've as a result of this fact and we will get to the new shape. Sorry,

42
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,760
 Anna, for knocking out of this, but this website that you sent starring the computer, starring

43
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,480
 the computer is phenomenal. Right. It's the IMDB of computers and movies that they have

44
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,560
 appeared in. And it's run by this one guy who he has this amazing Twitter account where

45
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,240
 he just constantly puts up photos from movies he's watching going, what's this? Does anyone

46
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,840
 know? And the people go hunting to try and track down the exact computer that's in the

47
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,000
 in the movie. So good. What was this computer first? The Burroughs 220. Okay. Once you've

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,760
 seen it in Laverne and Shirley, do you think people then go, well, I want to watch The

49
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,520
 Land of the Giants now and I want to watch? Watch this entire bat catalog. Yeah, you might

50
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,160
 be with an actor. Well, what's good about this computer? The Burroughs 220 really looks

51
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,280
 like a computer. Like if you're thinking 60s computers, like with tape spinning and light

52
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,920
 splashing, it's like your classic retro computer look. Okay. I read that a similar one, which

53
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:11,480
 was the B205. Oh, yes. Was the bat computer in Batman. I wondered if there were ever

54
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,760
 computers that played other computers. And I guess that's an example. Like a Mac playing

55
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,000
 at Dell or something. Yeah. Yeah. But I wanted to find out more about the bat computer. Unfortunately,

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,600
 one of the most popular internet firms in Lagos is called bat computers. I did find

57
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,800
 a few things about the bat computer. And by the way, the Burroughs 205 absolutely smashes

58
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,280
 the hell out of the 220. It does. It had way better casting. Yeah, it's in the top 10 most

59
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,920
 appeared in movies computers in the world. Family of computers for the record. Yeah. One

60
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,080
 big Burroughs family. So here we go. A dynasty, you might say. What you get with the bat computer,

61
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,400
 the Burroughs 205 is you get the bat correction signal, which alerts Batman when he has said

62
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,240
 something incorrect. You have the bat computer input slot, which I remember. Wait a minute.

63
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,200
 So they invented the QI Klaxon. Exactly. Yeah. There's the input slot where it's just it's

64
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,760
 kind of like where you would it's like a mail slot where you put your post in, but it's

65
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,040
 like, here's an entire book and you just shove the book in and it computes the whole book

66
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,640
 really quickly. Wow. Accelerated concentration switch. That's sort of giving it more computing

67
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:22,360
 power in order to deal with the problem. And special escaped arch criminal bat locator,

68
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,680
 which is a preset of the computer, basically, but specifically for like the Joker and the

69
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,840
 Reddler. That's clever. So I find my own app, but like find my villain. Exactly. Yeah. And

70
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,920
 the bat keyboard, that's an actual thing. It is a keyboard, which only has I think five

71
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,460
 or six or seven keys on it. And you can make any letter by playing a chord. Do you know

72
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:49,280
 these math, like no keyboards? So you don't need 26 keys to play all the stonography would

73
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,440
 use. I think so. Yeah. But it was used for like disabled people who, you know, only had

74
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,480
 one hand or something like that. And you could type letters quickly by knowing that if you

75
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,320
 want to do an A, you might press the first one, the third one, the fourth one or whatever.

76
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,400
 Because there's 30. Well, if you include pressing nothing, 32 options, so that you've got enough

77
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,960
 for the whole alphabet. How many keys with five? Five keys. Five keys will give you 32

78
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:18,520
 options, including the null press, which is not using the keyboard. So 31 distinct presses.

79
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,040
 And then if you include your nose, now you can do upper and lower case. I do have a keyboard.

80
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,200
 I removed all the keys apart from the zero and the one on a keyboard because I can type

81
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:34,800
 in binary. So I could I included the backspace. I'm not a monster. So I can and enter so I

82
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,240
 could type out. I tried doing it on stage. I'll type people's names in binary and then

83
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,600
 hit enter. Really? It will come up in text. Wow. I was looking at that website for all

84
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:51,280
 the examples of this B205, which is what the bat computer is. And one just caught my eye,

85
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,160
 which was sex kittens go to college. The movie. I don't know why. But this is an amazing movie

86
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,760
 because it didn't just have this computer in it, the B205. It also had a robot called

87
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:10,160
 Electro in it. And Electro was an exhibit of the 1939 World's Fair. It was like a huge

88
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,080
 seven foot tall robot. It could walk by voice commands. So if you told it to walk, it could

89
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,800
 walk. It could speak 700 words using a record player. It could smoke cigarettes, blow up

90
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,360
 balloons and move its hands and arms. All the parts of the chewing test.

91
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,120
 Wow. So this was like a really famous robot in the World's Fair, 1939. And then by, you

92
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,080
 know, the 1960s, it was in sex kittens go to college. So good. What a career decline.

93
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,280
 Is it good or is it depressing for that poor robot? I just love it. I love all the movies.

94
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,160
 I didn't read that movie. Like there are so many, like you get big ones like Austin Powers,

95
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,760
 the spy who shagged me. It appears in that. But then you also got Dr. Goldfoot and the

96
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:55,400
 Bikini machine. So good. And the Burroughs, by the way, it was a company. Yeah. And it

97
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,200
 was started by William Seward Burroughs, who was a grandfather of William S. Burroughs.

98
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,480
 Really? He invented, at least this is, I'm sure there are other claims to it, but he

99
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,640
 invented and filed the patent for the first calculator. You wouldn't imagine that spawning,

100
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:15,080
 William Burroughs. Not really. Two generations later, it's sort of like chain smoking, romantic.

101
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,240
 Wife shooting. Wife shooting. You like to put that further down in C.

102
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,520
 We rarely talk about the fact that he killed his wife. Yeah. Well, apparently he said that

103
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,520
 he was trying to do a William Tell thing. Yeah. And shoot an apple off her head and accidentally

104
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,920
 shot her butt. Yeah. I'm not sure we all buy that. But apparently that will get you off

105
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,800
 in court because he didn't go to jail. Yeah. Everything was fine. Yeah. Just leave an apple

106
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:44,000
 nearby at the scene of the crime. Yeah. That's what I was aiming for. Another cool pop culture

107
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,560
 computer crossover I came across. Did you guys know that Steve Jobs is Homer Simpson's

108
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:59,520
 uncle? Oh, what? Yes. Yes. This is so weird, this fact. It's so weird. It's so bizarre.

109
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,840
 So Steve Jobs' dad is a guy called Abdul Fattah Jandali. Steve Jobs was put up for adoption

110
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:11,000
 by this guy because his partner's family disapproved of the marriage because he was Syrian Muslim.

111
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,600
 So Steve Jobs went out for adoption, never met his father, actually. This guy, Abdul

112
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,120
 Fattah Jandali, had another kid also who ended up estranged from him. She was called Mona

113
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,920
 Simpson and she married a guy weirdly called Richard Apple. So Steve Jobs' brother-in-law

114
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,800
 is called Apple. What? Brilliant. She married a guy called Richard Apple, who is a riser

115
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,000
 on the Simpsons and he came up with the character of Mona Simpson, Homer's mum, named after

116
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,820
 his partner, Mona Simpson. So Steve Jobs' sister is Mona Simpson, Homer Simpson's

117
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,360
 mum. Okay. Yeah. I followed that, but maybe because I knew it beforehand. I'm not sure

118
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,380
 if that worked because we got too confused looking. Imagining a very complicated family

119
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,000
 tree. Yeah. I'm thinking like the Hapsburgs, the other family tree where they're all kind

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,960
 of into it. Yeah. It is like that. And also, if that branched on into fiction for one bit

121
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,120
 of it, it's a little bit like Icelandic sagas where you're like, "Is this true or is it

122
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:10,400
 not?" So shapes? How does a computer? How does a computer invent a shape? Well, this

123
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,800
 is the problem. So everyone, and this is a perfect example of what happened in computing,

124
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,080
 everyone loves the B205 and all these other fancy computers. The B220 was like a vacuum

125
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,760
 tube miscalculation because they barely made any, no one really bought them. Transistors

126
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,840
 had come along and blown these old ones out of the water. So they were pretty much a forgotten

127
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:39,760
 computer. Until I was reading a old maths paper from 1962 and it was someone called

128
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:49,280
 Donald Grace who was trying to find the biggest shape. Now, you're going to need some constraints

129
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:56,200
 on that. Otherwise, the biggest shape is whatever shape the universe is. But they were trying

130
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,360
 to work out the biggest shape that you could fit in like a unit sphere. Okay. So the biggest

131
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,160
 shape you can fit in a ball. Okay. And you can imagine it the size of the universe if

132
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,760
 you want, no one's stopping you. Yeah. Or you can imagine it at a nice manageable basketball

133
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,360
 esque size. Okay. And to make it a bit more manageable again, they would do it for the

134
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,800
 number of vertices, the number of corners a shape has. Right. And Donald specifically

135
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,720
 was curious what's the biggest shape with eight vertices on it. Okay. Which some people

136
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,200
 might think we just work out how to put eight points on a sphere as far apart as possible

137
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,800
 and join them all up to make a cube and doesn't work. That is the best way to position your

138
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,240
 points on a sphere. And that's actually quite difficult to do. That's a whole other no one

139
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,020
 has a good systematic way to arrange dots on a sphere. That's so interesting. What in

140
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:52,760
 that in that regular way that makes a cube despite all the funding from big golf? What

141
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,680
 is the biggest golf? There's no it's called the Thompson problem. There's no because it

142
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:06,480
 came out of is it named after Gulf Alexi Thompson? It's not right. Okay. It came out of Thompson

143
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,520
 looking at electrons in an atom to work out how they be spaced. And they're like, Oh,

144
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,280
 well, it's easy. They just space such that they've got the as close as possible to the

145
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,080
 same distance between them. And they're like, we just work that. Oh, that's really hard

146
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,040
 to work out. And it doesn't even solve this other problem. So we were a bit mathematician

147
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,920
 with a bit of a dead end. And Donald Grace was studying at Stanford, studying what would

148
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,840
 later be called computer science. And they were like, you know what, I'll just see if

149
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,040
 I can get a computer to solve this problem. Because if I program a computer to start with

150
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,680
 eight points on a sphere, and work out the shape that they define, and then jiggle them

151
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,000
 all around a bit, and see which direction of jiggling increases the volume by the most.

152
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,480
 And just do that more times in a human ever could, you'll eventually evolve your way into

153
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,360
 the biggest possible shape. Yeah, okay. So I read the paper. And I wasn't kind of aware

154
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,360
 of that at the time, I was just looking because I like the shapes. I was reading through the

155
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,840
 paper. And there's a line that said, oh, we ran this on a borrows 220 computer system.

156
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,040
 And I was like, that's weird, like, that's commonplace in modern math research. But I

157
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,920
 was looking at this going, that's what a computer already. And the paper was submitted

158
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,520
 in August 1962. How did he have access to a computer? And it turns out they did have

159
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,680
 the borrows 220 at Stanford, they got it in 1960. So Donald has since passed away, spoke

160
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,840
 to his kids, and they're like, Oh, we used to volunteer and go in at night. Take the

161
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,760
 night shift from the computer lab, that meant he could run his code on the computer. Because

162
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,960
 otherwise, they were not going to waste their computer time for someone finding the biggest

163
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,520
 shape. Yeah, exactly. And he found it. He found the biggest shape and he published it. And

164
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,640
 he's like, I found this thing. And do you have any idea? Can we explain what the shape

165
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:55,640
 is? Or is it tough? It looks a little bit like a dice from D&D. Okay, yeah, it's made

166
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:01,920
 entirely out of triangles. But because it's not like an icosahedron, like a D20, or like

167
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,920
 a D8, that's nice and neat, because they're platonic solids, it's somewhere in the middle.

168
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,200
 So it's still a lot of triangles put together. And it looks quite regular. But it's not exactly

169
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,880
 tidy, because that's an awkward number of vertices. You couldn't you couldn't roll it

170
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,000
 as a physical die. It'll be slightly unfair. Yeah. And it's massive. I mean, it's going

171
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,280
 to be difficult, isn't it? Heavy. Well, it's size of the universe. Can we talk about golf?

172
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:34,960
 Yeah, sure. I made a classic error there. Can I say no? No, you can't say no, because

173
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,160
 this is interesting, right? So I learned this from researching for this. I looked at my golf

174
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,720
 balls, and there's loads of dimples on them, right? All the dimples are hexagons. Or are

175
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,000
 they all hexagons, Matt? Because it's a sphere. They can't be, right? And so I found out that

176
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,440
 every golf ball has 12 pentagons on it. It's amazing. That was Anna, by the way. It's

177
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:05,200
 true. That wasn't a weird Star Wars creature that just suddenly came on. We went to Epcot,

178
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,680
 Disney World, and I made everyone else with stop so we could look at the massive Epcot

179
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,000
 sphere, which is a giant golf ball, I guess. I'm like, "In there somewhere," I said, "at

180
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,320
 12 pentagons." Oh, my God. I'm going to try and find some. But the interesting thing is,

181
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,080
 this is the least interesting part of it. Now, I think this has improved my golf game,

182
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,360
 because what I do is when I put the ball on the tee, I line up one of the pentagons to

183
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,840
 where I want to hit, and it helps me concentrate that that's the part of the ball that I want

184
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,320
 to hit. Oh, that's great. Yeah. That's like with bowling. I use the triangle in the middle.

185
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,320
 Well, you're supposed to. That's what they're there for. I don't think anyone does those,

186
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,320
 but I do. I do, and it works. Yeah. I mean, that's what that's there for. That's quite

187
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,360
 annoying for the golfer behind you who has to wait for you to just constantly go, "Hang

188
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,280
 on. I know there are loads here." Trying to find his pentagons. Well, that's amazing,

189
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,320
 isn't it? Yeah, that's incredible. 12 pentagons, because you can't put hexagons on a sphere.

190
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,920
 You can't. And I've gotten very upset because the UK street signs for a football stadium,

191
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,440
 a picture of a football, and they've forgotten the pentagons. It's all hexagons, which is

192
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,760
 mathematically impossible. So why can't be if they made the sign work? Well, they just

193
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,960
 drawn a hexagon kind of slightly distorted grid, and then cut out a circle of it and

194
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:24,040
 put it on the sign. And we never see the other side of that. Yeah, of course. So I ran a

195
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,680
 big petition. Right. I got 20,000 signatures on a parliamentary petition. Yeah. So the

196
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,200
 government has to write to you at that point to say what they're going to do about this

197
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,000
 important issue you've raised. Yeah. And they wrote to me to say they're not going to change

198
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,280
 the street signs to be correct. They're like, no. They said that the correct geometry would

199
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,540
 be so similar to the current signs. There's no point changing it. And they also said the

200
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,840
 correct geometry would be so distracting, it might increase the likelihood of accidents.

201
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:57,080
 Really? Absolutely bullshit. We've got an election coming up. Thank you. I think if any

202
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,680
 party decides to go for that, we're going to change the shape of footballs on road signs.

203
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,640
 It's got to be a huge majority. Yeah. Yeah, I completely agree. Although I did now talk

204
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,040
 to someone who makes custom footballs, soccer balls, and got them to make me a ball where

205
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:20,680
 from one specific angle, it looks like the street sign. Nice. So someone who runs a company

206
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,640
 called 12 pentagons, John Paul designed this ball where from the front and the back looks

207
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,000
 like the street sign, but like the equator around the bit is a nightmare of weird shapes

208
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,480
 to patch the drama together to make it work in physical reality. Yeah. And you have that.

209
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,760
 I got the ball. I took it up to Liverpool Football Club. No. Yeah, I got their sports

210
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,200
 analytics team to have a kick around with it. I was not allowed. They're like, you have

211
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,120
 to come on a day where we can guarantee there will be no players around. Imagine if Mo Sala

212
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,720
 played with that ball and it fucked up his entire career. I can't play with these other

213
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,760
 balls anymore. Yeah, this is the one. It'd be great to see a lower league team like in

214
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,080
 the EFL training with that ball, knowing the game with that ball, then playing a Premier

215
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,280
 League team and just seeing the difference. Can you deal with the ball? Yeah, exactly.

216
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,500
 It's the guys at Tramir, my team are listening. Give it a go. Can't be much worse than what's

217
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:23,440
 happening this season. Okay, it is time for fact number two. That is James. Okay, my fact

218
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,880
 this week is that the woman who invented the trolley problem was the daughter of a man

219
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,460
 who made railway tracks for a living. So amazing. And the trolley problem is the issue where

220
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,680
 you're in a supermarket and one of the wheels gets stuck and you can't push in a straight

221
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,120
 line. No, it's when your coin won't fit into the slot to release it from the big bunch

222
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,320
 of trolleys. I feel like I have to give a little bit more information about the trolley

223
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,880
 problem. So it's like a philosophical idea that you've got a trolley or like a trolley

224
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,920
 car in America, I guess it is, and it's going down some tracks and it's going to kill five

225
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,280
 people who are working on the tracks or who are tied to the tracks depending on the version.

226
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,400
 But you have a lever and you can pull the lever and the trolley can go in the other direction

227
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,200
 and it will kill only one person. Do you pull the lever to kill that one person or do you

228
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,240
 just do nothing and let the five people die? Yeah, not everyone agrees with what's the

229
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,520
 correct answer. So it's always interesting. Yeah. And that was so that was originally

230
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,680
 called the Tram problem, which was created by Philip of foot. She married a guy called

231
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,960
 foot, which feels quite rebellious if your dad makes railroad tracks. That's true. And

232
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:34,840
 she is known as the Grand Dam of philosophy. Yeah. And her mother was Esther Cleveland,

233
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,040
 who was the first president's child to be born in the White House, the daughter of Grover

234
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:46,280
 Cleveland. And her father was William Sidney, Benson Quay, who managed skinning grove steel

235
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,720
 works in Yorkshire. And he made a lot of the tracks for the train tracks in the north of

236
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,760
 England. And I'm not sure it had any bearing on her philosophical works. I just like the

237
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,760
 idea. I think it's good that she had parents who worked on railroads because imagine if

238
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,160
 her parents were like an accountant and a librarian, yeah, like it'd be a very different

239
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,320
 hypothetical situation. You know, five people want to borrow the same book. Yeah. But one

240
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,440
 other person needs it for their own self is going to fall on. It's going to go one of

241
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,480
 two ways. There's five people on one side. You can shove it the other way and get one

242
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,360
 person that side thinking. Yeah. I don't think it would have caught on as the philosophical

243
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:30,240
 meme it is today. But Philippa Foote was amazing. She's incredible. And it's amazing that all

244
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,920
 the connections, you know, Grand Order of Grover Cleveland came up with this massive

245
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,000
 philosophical dilemma, flatmate of Iris Murdoch. You know, she's like got so many interesting

246
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,080
 little cultural touch points that I just surprised I've never heard of. Yeah. I guess they all

247
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,200
 there seem to be a coterie of very interesting female philosophers around about that time,

248
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,420
 which I suppose was the 30s and 40s. 40s. She got her degree in 42. Got it. So around

249
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,800
 the 40s. And yeah, Iris Murdoch, who I never really thought of as a philosopher, and that's

250
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,960
 just my ignorance. I just read a couple of Iris Murdoch's years ago. And it makes me

251
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,520
 feel much more high brown now having read them because really Iris Murdoch books, have you

252
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,200
 guys ever read her? No. They're basically about loads of people having affairs. Well,

253
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,400
 the two that I read and I think all the rest of them. But once you know she's a moral philosopher,

254
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,000
 there's a huge moral undercurrent that you're supposed to think about. So the trolley problem.

255
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,400
 So it started as a tram problem with Phillipa Foote. Actually, let's go around the table.

256
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,600
 Sorry to interrupt that. Yeah, yeah. Let's go around the table. Pull on that pole. Okay.

257
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,920
 Would you pull on that pole? Pull. Pull. Yeah. But what depends on the freight. The whole

258
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,220
 point is you change insignificant details and flips what people will say. And that seems

259
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,120
 to be what happened. So this one seems to be relatively straightforward, although there's

260
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,720
 some disagreement, but almost everyone says they would pull. But then when you add lots

261
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,800
 of other bits of the scenario, and that seems to have been done by this other woman called

262
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,760
 Judith Jarvis Thompson, who was the person who made the trolley problem famous, came

263
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,600
 up with the term the trolley problem. It's trolleyology is this whole kind of area of

264
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,960
 study that's because of her. And yeah, she expanded on it with loads of possible examples.

265
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,040
 I think the most famous is probably the bystander case where rather than being the driver of

266
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,460
 the trolley, you're now just on a bridge and you see the driver of the train faint. And

267
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,280
 then as a bystander, do you step in? And then that's like, are you intervening now?

268
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,440
 Well, it's slightly different. The bridge one's slightly different. There's two options

269
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,240
 that Judith came up with. One is that you're on the side watching the trolley come and there's

270
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,880
 a lever that you're able to pull. So you now need to make the decision, the five people

271
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,760
 or one people. The bridge decision is you're standing on the bridge. You've suddenly done

272
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,600
 an interesting calculation where you realize that if you chucked what they call the fat

273
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,280
 man, someone big enough, not yourself. You've diagnosed you're too small. But there's someone

274
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,360
 who's big and weighty next to you and you somehow have the skill to throw them off the

275
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,360
 bridge and stop it. Would you then do that? That's the biggest dilemma because that's taking

276
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,800
 an innocent bystander. And there is another version where the bystander is not just big

277
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,760
 enough to stop the train, but he's also the person who put the five people on the track

278
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,800
 in the first place. So he's the villain. So is it better to push him? If you know he's

279
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,840
 a bad guy, he's the one who set this whole terrible scheme up.

280
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,160
 Did he do it deliberately? I need so much backstory now. Okay, well, what are the five

281
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,800
 people done to him? Oh, well, that's a good question.

282
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,480
 This is why if their workers versus tied to the track can change it sometimes. Because

283
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,560
 are they foolish workers who didn't follow health and safety? Or are they there of no

284
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
 fault of their own?

285
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,080
 You're right. They had it coming, mate. You don't follow health and safety.

286
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,360
 This feels like a game of pool whenever I go to a pub and you have to work out what rules

287
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,360
 you're playing.

288
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,880
 Two shot carry. Is it two shots on the black? What is it?

289
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,600
 But I like the bridge one because a lot of people would, in the standard issue version

290
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,860
 of this, pull the lever and sacrifice one person to save five. But then there's the hospital

291
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,720
 waiting room problem, which is where a perfectly healthy person walks in and sits down the

292
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,520
 hospital waiting room and they realize there are five people who all desperately need an

293
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,600
 organ transplant. And if they got the organ that all live. So if we take this one healthy

294
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:08,560
 person, we can take their organs and five, which in the abstract is equivalent to the

295
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:14,600
 same problem. But now it's universally no as opposed to almost universally yes.

296
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,800
 And I think this is what befuddled old Judith Jarvis Thompson and she changed her mind.

297
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,960
 On her solution, she said you shouldn't push the bystander off. And this was years later.

298
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,880
 So it was in the 70s that she came up with her.

299
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,280
 It was a bit late by then because she's already killed 500 people in the experiment.

300
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,040
 She suddenly was like, I feel terrible about this. It's wrong. But she said, it's kind

301
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,520
 of what you were saying, Matt. She said, actually, if you're on the bridge and you've got the

302
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,680
 option to push someone off the bridge to save the five people, but sacrificing them, would

303
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,560
 you sacrifice yourself? And if the answer is no, then you've got no right to sacrifice

304
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,480
 the other person. And if the answer is even yes, you've still got no right because their

305
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,720
 answer might be no. Yeah, which kind of makes sense. Well, is it absolutely right Danny definitively

306
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,280
 saying that? My answer to the trolley problem, if I'm on the trolley, I would immediately

307
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,960
 look out, see if someone's standing near a lever, go pull the lever for Christ's sake,

308
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,240
 if you want. Or yell up to the bridge. Is there anyone who's just having a bad time of

309
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,160
 it? You just kind of want to be a hero. You need to be over 16 stone. I'm having a bad

310
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,720
 time of it. Judith Thompson was really important in the abortion debate and around Roe versus

311
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,520
 wage. She wrote probably the most famous or maybe the most seminal paper about it with

312
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,760
 another thought experiment that she came up with, which and I guess what's quite fun

313
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,400
 about thought experiments is the kind of a bit funny abortion often not a funny subject.

314
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:41,920
 But she just made it funny. She found the comedy and she said in defense of abortion,

315
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,160
 she wrote, imagine this, you wake up one morning and you find yourself back to back in bed

316
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:54,440
 with famous unconscious violinist Nigel Kennedy say not say Nigel Kennedy yet. In fact, because

317
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,680
 he's probably the only famous violinist you can name Jack Benny. All right, you can have

318
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:06,540
 Jack Benny. This is a game I was not equipped to play. Vanessa May. Very good. All right,

319
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,120
 it can be any famous unconscious violinist. It's not really important which specific

320
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,960
 violinist it is. We're playing the famous violinist tennis. No, no, no, please. I'll

321
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,320
 go on. Can't think of one. So the famous violinist has a fatal kidney. Sorry, that's just the

322
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,680
 smallest violin playing for me in my sadness of losing. So the violinist has a fatal kidney

323
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:35,800
 ailment and the Society of Musical Lovers have therefore kidnapped you and rigged up

324
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:42,280
 your circulatory system to the violinist and this will save the violinist, him or her.

325
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,680
 And you go to the hospital and you're like, someone's rigged up my circulatory system with

326
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,760
 this fucking violinist and I don't want it there. And the hospital's like, look, we're

327
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,280
 super sorry. Wouldn't let it happen if we'd known about it. But now it's happened. It's

328
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,000
 kind of letting him die if we unplug you. She says, should you have to agree to be plugged

329
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,080
 into him? And her argument is no, you shouldn't have to agree.

330
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,000
 And the doctor also says in nine months it will be fine and you'll be unplugged anyway,

331
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,440
 right? The doctor says in nine months it'll be fine. Yes. Although she sort of expands

332
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,360
 on it a bit because, you know, if you have a child often it's not straight up. So in nine

333
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,280
 months it'll be fine, but there is no reason. You still have to look after the traumatic

334
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,160
 complexion. You've got to look after the violinist. You've got to change the nappy.

335
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,240
 I think Philip Heffort's original one was also about abortion, the one with the trolley

336
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,360
 problem. Because it had the trolley problem in it, but it also had another quandary which

337
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:38,440
 was a magistrate who executes one man in order to quell a riot in which five innocent men

338
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,440
 will die. And so she asked people, should you be able to execute one person to save five

339
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,960
 people in the riot? And almost everyone said no. And then you said, but should you pull

340
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,680
 this lever so that the trolley kills this one person? And almost everyone said yes. And

341
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,600
 she's like, this is a weird dichotomy of ideas. And I think, I think maybe that's where our

342
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,640
 argument came in of one of them, the judge is actively killing someone versus just not

343
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,040
 saving people, wasn't it? So she was like, that's a slightly different, it's very confusing.

344
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:11,560
 And then Daniel Bartels of Columbia University says this is all bullshit because these dilemmas

345
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,120
 are really engaging situations that people enjoy thinking about, but in real life, you

346
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,440
 wouldn't enjoy it at all. If you had to make that decision, you probably would be a bit

347
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,760
 stressed. On Mastodon, the new Twitter, and there's a user called Sidereal who came up

348
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,520
 with a solution where the trolley is going down and you've got a lever. And what you

349
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,440
 do is you pull the lever just when the front wheels of the trolley have passed, but before

350
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,600
 the back wheels of the trolley have passed, and that will make the trolley cast stop.

351
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,600
 They won't kill anyone.

352
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
 You kill everyone.

353
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
 Yeah.

354
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:53,000
 No, you kill no one. And apparently this is how railroad workers stop runaway trains,

355
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,400
 and how railroad robberies used to take place in the Wild West is you would make the tracks

356
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,360
 change just as the train's going over you.

357
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
 Me too.

358
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
 Right.

359
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,360
 So that's a way to trick it.

360
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
 That's brilliant.

361
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,640
 Did you read the really recent story about a runaway train?

362
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,640
 No.

363
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
 No.

364
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:14,480
 It was mad. In Japan, it was a freight train. It had 50 carriages, and it went for 80 kilometres

365
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,360
 on its own, totally driverless at 100 kilometres per hour. So the driver disembarks for like

366
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:26,280
 a driver stop at a station in a place called Jammu, and it just started rolling, and it

367
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,800
 kept going. And they had to close all the road crossings ahead of it. They were like,

368
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,280
 "Oh my God, we can't stop this train quickly. Make sure pedestrians aren't crossing the

369
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,240
 tracks." It went for 80 kilometres, and eventually I think someone came and put blocks on the

370
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
 track to stop it.

371
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
 Wow.

372
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
 So it ran and trained on it.

373
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,720
 And there was no people on it, the driver had gone and...

374
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,960
 No people, just shed loads of bricks, I think.

375
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,680
 That's a worst-case scenario.

376
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,160
 Not pillows and marshmallows.

377
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,080
 That's probably not.

378
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,000
 Do you guys know Vsauce, the YouTuber?

379
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Yeah.

380
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Michael.

381
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Oh, your buddies are them.

382
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Your actual friends, yeah.

383
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,260
 Are you? I really want to know your opinion on the fact that he actually tried the trolley

384
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:08,920
 problem for real, which has never been done before, and is so weird to watch. I mean, I

385
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,960
 think he did it. He's claiming to have done it.

386
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
 Do you?

387
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
 Yeah. It's really hard to work out if people are acting or not, because you really...

388
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,600
 Did he kill five people or one person?

389
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
 Yeah.

390
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:22,600
 The next video comes from Jail. Maybe it's also Michael in Jail here.

391
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:28,520
 Yeah, it wasn't quite that extreme, but basically he took volunteers from the street and told

392
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,200
 them they were in an experiment about high-speed rail, and like, "We're testing this train,

393
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,880
 this automated train," took them into a switching station, and he says, "Why don't you have a

394
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,940
 look at how this switching station works while you're here?" And there's a guy who's

395
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:44,460
 there saying, "Hey, this is the button I press to put the train on a different track,"

396
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,820
 and then he gets a phone call and has to leave. So the volunteer is just alone in the switching

397
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,660
 station, and they suddenly see a train coming, and they're watching workers on the track

398
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,380
 with headphones on, so they can't hear what's happening. And they think that the only way

399
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,500
 to save these workers is to click that switch they've just been shown, and to kill one person

400
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,360
 but save the other five. And it's incredible to watch, and it's mad to me that it was

401
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,240
 allowed to happen, but he took it through this, like, ethics boards, went through the

402
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,640
 ethics boards, and seven people did it. Do you want to guess how many, because obviously

403
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,720
 the other thing about the trolley problem is people always say they'd switch, and in

404
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,440
 real life, would you actually? Seven people, how many people do you think click the switch?

405
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,520
 I'm going to go one. Nice. I think just like, if you're in someone else's office, you just

406
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,100
 don't want to touch anything, no matter what. All the other social, like you're like, oh,

407
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,380
 yeah, yeah, people dying, but the, oh, the social awkwardness of touching someone's work

408
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:45,460
 station. And that's how good human beings are. You're absolutely right, it's two people.

409
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,500
 Two people. And a lot of them did say that, they were like, well, it's not really my,

410
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,540
 I don't know, maybe he's broken under control. Yeah. Yeah. Gosh. It is part of the dilemma

411
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,980
 that you sort of think the act of pulling the lever makes you complicit to a murder

412
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,560
 versus. Yeah. I hadn't thought of that really, like that being part of the emotion. I'm

413
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,760
 deciding you die. Oh yeah. Whereas if I just don't touch it. Like if it's your job, then

414
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,360
 you could be negligent for not pressing it, right? Because you've let five people die

415
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,320
 and it's your job and you should have made that decision. But if you've just been left

416
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,720
 in that room. You're a real group. But if you've misunderstood this, the situation, you make

417
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:33,620
 it worse. I'm releasing more trains. Okay, it is time for fact number three and that

418
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:40,260
 is Anna. My fact this week is that on the first ever road trip across America, multiple bridges

419
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:45,980
 collapsed under the weight of the cars and had to be rebuilt along the way. Wow. It's

420
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,840
 presumably crumbled behind you often crumbled with the vehicles on it and they would plunge

421
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,280
 into a river. Oh, right. I was thinking like Dan, maybe it's like, you know, when you're

422
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,120
 walking in the countryside and you have to close all the gates behind you, just like

423
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:06,720
 consider a driving in America. Bridge back now. So cows can cross. This was a very specific

424
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,640
 road trip and involved a lot of cars. So it was 1919. And it was 79 vehicles. Specifically,

425
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:20,020
 it was the Army Motor Transport Corps. And they were driving across America to check

426
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,740
 out the state of the road. So it was ordered by the War Department, this road trip. And

427
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,580
 no one had ever traveled from East Coast to West Coast America because the roads just

428
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,540
 weren't equipped for that. There wasn't an interstate road system. And so this trip was

429
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:38,740
 commissioned to see if the roads were possible and it turned out not really. And there were

430
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:45,000
 just constant diversions because like cars would sink in the mud or they often had to

431
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 disassemble covered bridges because the trucks were too tall. So they'd have to take a bridge

432
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,440
 apart and then put it back together when the trucks had gone through. And then if you look

433
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,920
 up news reports about it, it was a huge media deal. Every new state they went into this

434
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,840
 caravan of cars. Everyone was like, Hey, so it was always reported in the news. And the

435
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,040
 news was always saying, you know, 12 bridges repaired today, eight bridges collapsed today,

436
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,700
 you know, another 12 bridges, this truck fell and had to be pulled out of a gully.

437
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,900
 So really, if you were a small town, you'd want to divert the roads to your worst bridges

438
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,060
 so that you're getting free repair. What was the date again? Sorry, Anna, I know you

439
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:26,160
 said 1919, 1919. Gosh, how many cars were on it? There's about 79 vehicles. And it took

440
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,780
 a seriously long time because the roads were so bad. So it took all together. They traveled

441
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:39,960
 3,242 miles. And it took 62 days, which ended up being an average of about five miles an

442
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,360
 hour, a bit over five miles an hour. Wow, they took 20 days longer to do this than the record

443
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,880
 for running across America today. Right. Oh, wow. So then this caused this report to be

444
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:57,040
 written by loads of people, one of whom was a chap called Eisenhower in 1919, who went

445
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,120
 on along for the road trip, wrote a report saying we've got to fix these roads, became

446
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,420
 president more than 30 years later. It was like, they haven't fixed these bloody roads

447
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:09,300
 yet. And so he was the one who fixed the roads. I find it amazing that the interstate system

448
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,660
 in America is basically an army thing. It's a defense thing, isn't it? That's why they

449
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,340
 built it. Is that why they did it initially? It's actually officially known as the Dwight

450
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:24,140
 D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. So yeah, but then after

451
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:29,620
 it had been going for 40 years, they claimed that it had saved the lives of 187,000 people.

452
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,800
 Is that because it's so safe? It is because motorways and highways are just super safe

453
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,960
 compared to normal roads because everyone's going in the same direction. And it's so regimented

454
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,560
 how it works. So I didn't really know anything about the interstate highway system, but all

455
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,160
 the rules are exactly the same across the board. So America didn't have a unified road

456
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,840
 system by the 1950s. You still couldn't really cross efficiently from one state to another

457
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,600
 because it's just not in a state's interest to make the crossing between states good.

458
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,280
 So the federal government took over. And yeah, it's super safe, but like everything down

459
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,460
 to the last detail is the same across the board. So tunnels and bridges are exactly the

460
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:12,580
 same height everywhere. There's the same gradient of slope at the edge of the roads for water

461
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:17,540
 runoff. Everything's the same. That's cool. That universally across America still to this

462
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:23,380
 day? Just in the interstate highway system. Yeah. Yeah. And sweetly, Alaska and Hawaii

463
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:28,420
 both have interstate highway roads, even though they've got no states to go to. I've been

464
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,860
 on the one in Alaska and it's not like it doesn't seem the same as the ones in New York.

465
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,000
 Oh, does it not? Really? No. Okay. Yeah. They maybe have played it a bit faster than these

466
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,620
 for the rules out there. Yeah. The ones in Hawaii are the ones in Honolulu. They're exactly

467
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:46,260
 like anywhere in America for sure. The average age of bridges in the US is a year younger

468
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:58,900
 than me. Wow. We're talking like 54, 55. And will that always be true? They age with you?

469
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,540
 No, they'll chase them and repair them and get new ones. They're not going to get older

470
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,620
 than you, though, sadly our way. They're not going to change you and repair you. That's

471
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,140
 true. How often do you remove a bridge though? Like how many bridges are we losing? I guess

472
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,940
 if they totally replace one, that would reset the clock. Well, a third of them are classified

473
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,660
 as structurally deficient in the US. So they are having to replace them, but they've kind

474
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,940
 of kicked the can down the road for years and years and years and now. Who has a longer

475
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:31,380
 life expectancy? Me or a bridge. An average bridge or you? I reckon the bridges probably

476
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,940
 don't drink as much as me, but I get a bit more exercise. Who would you save in the trolley

477
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,580
 problem if there's a trolley who's going to kill a bridge? There's a bridge on top of

478
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:46,380
 a fat man. Do you push them up? I would love to see a website where it's you and listed

479
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,300
 all the other bridges of America and let's see who wins. Let's see who makes it to the

480
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:56,220
 end. This is like List Trust versus a lettuce. This is a terrible memento mori which I wasn't

481
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:04,860
 expecting. It would be a great update that James has outlived another bridge. Bridges

482
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:10,860
 are not surprise collapse with cars. Engineering and designing a bridge is complicated. Yeah.

483
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:16,340
 And more engineering is kind of experimental. I mean, less so now we've got computers. Now

484
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:22,860
 we're in the post borrows, 220 era. But back in the day, you build a bridge, you're over

485
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:29,180
 engineering a bunch and hope it stays up. But it's only really as good as the load cases

486
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,460
 that have been over it so far. Right. So when they wheeled out cars, I'm not surprised. This

487
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,220
 is a whole new load case. Yeah. Bridges failed. Yeah. They built a bridge in the north of

488
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:44,660
 England in 1846. It was a railway bridge and it was fine. It was like longer than they'd

489
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,820
 ever built before. So they tensioned it up to make it extra stiff and trains were going

490
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,900
 fine over it. And then they added a bit more rock and aggregate to the top of it to kind

491
00:39:53,900 --> 00:40:00,220
 of protect the sleepers. And that additional mass opened up a new mode of movement for

492
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,980
 the bridge that they'd never seen before. And the next train that went over the middle

493
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,420
 of the bridge was long enough that the middle bit could twist. And they just they just never

494
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,580
 seen that happen before because no bridge had been big enough or had that load put on

495
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:20,740
 it. That's now Alton towers. What happened? A lot of injuries, five people died. The first

496
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:26,780
 train that went over after they added this extra rock caused it to twist in a new mode

497
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,020
 in the middle of the bridge that hadn't been seen before. And it'll happen every now and

498
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:36,140
 then we'll build something bigger or different to before. Yeah. And until you test it, we

499
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,860
 have no I mean now obviously with computers, we can do a lot more modeling and testing

500
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:46,420
 in advance, but particularly historically, it was a builder and survivor. Yeah. Whenever

501
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,060
 I'm on Instagram and I'm just scrolling through videos, there often is an advert that comes

502
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:56,660
 up for a game where you have to build a bridge and you have to put the positions of the. Yeah.

503
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,780
 The steel underneath it. And I just watched this ad for minutes on end because every

504
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:06,420
 conceivable way I think a bridge should be built, it collapses and flips and crashes and

505
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:11,780
 thank God you're not a civil engineer. Not the first time I thought that to be honest.

506
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:17,460
 She's saying, yeah, that's right. It's more complicated than we realize. Yeah. But like

507
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,780
 the it was kind of a big deal at the time, although I have to say I've forgotten about

508
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:26,180
 it until reminded researching this, but like the Millennium Bridge was a big case, wasn't

509
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:31,500
 it? And exactly as you say, sort of untested was a huge deal. So for our listeners, it

510
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,300
 was a quite beautiful bridge across the Thames in London that was opened in the year 2000

511
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,420
 in the summer. And I think it closed up to two days because it was wobbling, wasn't

512
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,620
 it? It was moving about seven and a half centimetres backwards and forwards. And people felt like

513
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:48,100
 it didn't sound like a lot. But if you're standing on this bridge, that's earthquake

514
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,860
 levels. Yeah, it's noticeable. And it's because it was able to move from side to side. And

515
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,620
 what I really like about it is Londoners called it the wobbly bridge. They didn't call it

516
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,820
 the bouncy bridge because it wasn't going up and down. It was very specifically going

517
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:05,860
 side to side. It had this lateral back and forth. They accidentally, when they built

518
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:13,140
 it, tuned it, I say tuned, it wasn't deliberate. It ended up being tuned to be able to resonate

519
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:18,700
 at about one hertz. And when a human walks, we take about two steps a second. So we're

520
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:24,260
 basically a mass going backwards and forwards at a rate of one hertz. And people walking

521
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,900
 across the bridge are naturally walking at a hertz where their body's moving backwards

522
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,500
 and forwards once a second. And it would cause the bridge to move a little bit. But then

523
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:36,300
 you had this synchronizing effect where because the bridge is moving slightly, people are

524
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:43,420
 more likely to step in rhythm with it. And so they were all natural dancers. So yeah,

525
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,860
 then it makes it worse and worse. I feel like it's the same as on a trampoline, you know,

526
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,740
 when someone's bouncing and you automatically bounce in sync with them to make them more

527
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,860
 comfortable. So it's quite cool to imagine everyone on Millennium Bridge was walking

528
00:42:54,860 --> 00:43:01,660
 exactly in step. And then all vomiting. Yeah, you got seasickness going over the bridge.

529
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:06,260
 Is it the case that they had to fix it? Was it dangerous because you could break the bridge?

530
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,300
 It could have got worse and worse. So at the levels it was happening, it wasn't dangerous,

531
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,420
 but no one wants to be on a bridge wobbling backwards and forwards. It genuinely made people

532
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,740
 feel sick. That's why they had to fix it. This is my new entry for how I'd solve the

533
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:21,740
 trolley problem. I would be on the bridge. I would see the trolley coming and I'd say,

534
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:27,140
 everyone, let's walk in sync and let's down the bridge. Shake the bridge. Shake the bridge.

535
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,420
 It costs an extra £5 million to fix. It was like on the original budget of £17 or £18

536
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:37,140
 million to build it. It took them two years and £5 million. Really? They had to add extra

537
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:42,140
 damping to take out those frequencies. Yeah, yeah. By doing that, they increased the damping

538
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,340
 below one and a half hertz by about 15, 20% and that was enough to stop that runaway feedback

539
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:53,780
 group. How interesting. So if you got a load of shorter people with shorter legs walking

540
00:43:53,780 --> 00:44:01,180
 along, might it happen again? If you were able to walk at a frequency that... Would it be

541
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:06,940
 faster or slightly like race walkers? The way it's been designed now, you'd have to

542
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,780
 be running. You'd be at a higher frequency to cause a problem, but you'd have to have

543
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:16,340
 a lot of people running at once to fall in sync. So if the London Marathon changes,

544
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:22,900
 dive over. But they do this like people who work on designing football stadiums have to

545
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:27,540
 make sure the stadium is not accidentally tuned to any of the frequencies where a concert

546
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:33,740
 that's put in the stadium might match to. What do you mean because then the actual structure

547
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:38,540
 could vibrate? The whole structure, there's video of people dancing in a stadium. It was

548
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,460
 a football chant that people were doing and you can see the whole structure starts to

549
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:47,020
 go up and down because they've hit that resonant frequency. Every engineer on the stadium has

550
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:55,140
 to go, the referee's a wanker. Don't do it to that one. The famous one up near where

551
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,660
 I live is the Broughton Suspension Bridge between Manchester and Bolton which collapsed

552
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:05,980
 in 1831 and was supposedly because people were marching across it and that resonance

553
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:10,940
 caused the bridge to collapse. I think that's the first, in my research that's the first

554
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:17,540
 bridge that collapsed due to resonance. Supposedly, yeah. And the military from then on were always

555
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:22,420
 told to break step when they cross over a bridge. It is sensible to not walk exactly

556
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,900
 at the same pace if you're going over a bridge, I think. Yeah, actually for the British Army

557
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,820
 at certain points you have to stop playing the music. So, you know, the Trumpeters have

558
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:37,580
 to shut up as you go over a bridge. So, you can all walk really carefully, not coordinating

559
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:42,820
 with anyone else's walk. Everyone walk totally randomly and different to everyone else walking

560
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:48,300
 randomly. You could just put some music that's really difficult to dance to. Yeah. Something

561
00:45:48,300 --> 00:46:03,180
 that lets some Shostakovich, some really sort of... Get all three of the best known violinists.

562
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:07,180
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact. My fact this week

563
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:12,740
 is that in the board game Rising Sun, players are able to collect monsters that are inspired

564
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:19,420
 by both Japanese mythology and, by complete accident, a New Zealand farmer. This is the

565
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,340
 board game which they put on Kickstarter. They needed 300,000 in order to get the game

566
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,100
 going but they ended up getting over four million dollars. And so, they had all this

567
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:33,180
 additional... Well, we might as well add a farmer. That was a stretch goal. One guy from

568
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:39,060
 New Zealand gets to pick a monster. So, what they did was they said, "Okay, well, as we've

569
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,020
 got all this extra money, what we're going to do is we're going to produce more characters."

570
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:45,780
 So, it's like a bonus pack that you get. So, one of these monsters is called the Katahi

571
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:51,500
 and basically, it's described as a Manawa Bradford, a spirit monkey that is very hairy

572
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:56,580
 and gets engulfed in rage. Are you the New Zealand farmer, Dan?

573
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:04,260
 I've never seen you consumed with rage. No, but you have seen me naked. It's made him

574
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:09,420
 pretty angry actually. But yes, so then what happens is the game comes out, all these characters

575
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:14,660
 are out there and then there's this guy who's online who says, "Hey, I'm actually from Japan

576
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,580
 and I've never heard of this character. Does anyone know anything more about it?" So, it

577
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:23,060
 sparks off a big, you know, hunt online for people to try and get to the bottom of it.

578
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:27,660
 Someone eventually discovers that there's a Wikipedia page, legendary Japanese monsters

579
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:33,140
 that has all the characters on it and in there is an entry for this Katahi and a guy in New

580
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:38,300
 Zealand, 19-year-old and his buddy Dick and about online, went to this page and they named

581
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:43,220
 it after him and it just sat there for over a year and the makers of this game went on

582
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:48,060
 to Wikipedia, cut and paste all of the characters on there, didn't do any additional research

583
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:53,780
 and ended up using him and so he's immortalised in this game as a Japanese mythological character.

584
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:57,980
 Awesome. That's just going to encourage more people to edit Wikipedia and that desperate

585
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,940
 hope they'll make it to a ball game. Yeah, that's true and there's this great line

586
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,580
 which says, someone was describing it saying, "This is the most exciting thing to happen

587
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:11,740
 in Daneverk, which is the rural town where he's from in New Zealand, since someone tried

588
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:17,700
 to open a brothel there in 2008 and it lasted precisely three weeks." I think, I mean, people

589
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,360
 got really moralistic about it. One woman said she'd sit outside the brothel every day

590
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:26,180
 knitting to shame anyone who came in and she also said, "I can't see any of our men paying

591
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:30,980
 a hundred dollars a bonk." Which I can see a lot of her men reading that and going, "Can't

592
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:37,700
 you love a bonk?" No, I know. She's from the 50s. One of the district council chiefs

593
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,500
 said that brothels were illegal business and the only thing that they could do was impose

594
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:48,620
 environmental conditions on it and his name was Roger 20 Man, which sounds like something

595
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:56,140
 on the menu at the brothel. Have we ever mentioned the Anton Deck Saturday night takeaway board

596
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:02,020
 game? I don't think so. You say that as if we must have been in. The game we play all

597
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,680
 the time. Yeah, we've mentioned it in pretty much every episode. I don't know what you're

598
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,220
 on about. This came out in 2017. It was an Anton Deck board game called Saturday Night

599
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,720
 Takeaway based on their TV show and it was basically a quiz. So you would play the board

600
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,620
 game and get lots of trivial questions. Sounds good. It was, in theory, good, except it was

601
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:25,140
 just riddled with mistakes. One question asked, "Where is Stonehenge located?" It said Somerset.

602
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,820
 They said that Albert Einstein died in 1949 instead of 55, which is, I guess, you're not

603
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:33,020
 going to automatically know if that's right or wrong. How about this one? True or false?

604
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,020
 This is not the question. I'm rephrasing the question here. True or false, the moon is

605
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:44,780
 the same distance from London to Australia. That is incorrect. Incorrect. Yeah, and it's

606
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:51,020
 incorrect that they said that. They said it was the same distance as London to Blackpool.

607
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:57,700
 In answer to how far away is the moon, they put 225 miles as the correct answer. It's

608
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:03,940
 posted 238,000. Wow. The short-lived TV game show Color

609
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:11,020
 of Money. I only know it from the game in pubs. A bunch of cash machines you could choose

610
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:17,540
 from. They hired a mathematician to analyze the game for them. A mathematician ran the

611
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:20,900
 numbers and came back and said, "This is a terrible game. No one's ever going to win."

612
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:25,860
 They're like, "Oh, no, but I tested it when I was home with the family and my grandma

613
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,860
 won and everyone had a great time." They put the game into production and basically no

614
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:34,060
 one won. That was it for the game and it was gone.

615
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,860
 That sounds like a good thing for the production company though, right? No, if it doesn't make

616
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,020
 good TV. No one wants to watch it.

617
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,260
 Did they ever think of putting that grandma on the show?

618
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:47,060
 They should have. Lucky grandma. That's where you're going wrong.

619
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:52,460
 Just sweep up, take it all home. It's like the fruit machines, pokies. You

620
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,980
 can tune the payout rate. It's not doing ... You're pulling the lever but it's just hitting

621
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:04,700
 a switch that's then spinning the things. The payout rate is programmed in to be once every

622
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:09,260
 kind of sell often. It's not even doing something particularly randomly. It's evening out the

623
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:12,660
 payout rate. You just have to watch and once it's been

624
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:18,020
 long enough, then you go on ... When I used to work in a bar, we would watch it and if

625
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,060
 no one won all night and people were playing it all night, then once everyone else had

626
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,100
 gone home, we'd put all our tips in and lose all our tips.

627
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:32,460
 Then we were just terrible at those. For instance, there was a QI quiz machine game.

628
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,340
 Have we said this on here? I don't think so.

629
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:40,100
 So there's a QI quiz machine game and before it went out, they sent me all of the questions

630
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,340
 so that I could check through them to make sure there wasn't any mistakes and make sure

631
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:48,260
 that it was kind of QI as it should be. There was probably, I think there was 20,000. It

632
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:53,300
 might have been more. Anyway, I had a database of all the questions and they put one in the

633
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:58,380
 pub next to where we worked. Yeah, in Covent Garden, it was a pub down the road.

634
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:02,660
 This is ... We're going to clean up here and so we went and played and we just lost all

635
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,980
 our money. We just couldn't do it.

636
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:09,180
 We just couldn't do it. It was ridiculous. Oh my God.

637
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:14,820
 On Japanese games, in the 1980s, I think it was 1985 or 1986, did you know that almost

638
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:20,940
 half of Japanese people owned a computer domestically when in the US, for instance, that was about

639
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,020
 9%? In what year?

640
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:28,420
 I think it was 1985 or '06. I just read it this week, but that's because they all owned

641
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:34,460
 Famicon, which was a family computer, which was the Nintendo console thing and they were

642
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,940
 all playing Nintendo.

643
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,700
 In 1990, I only knew one person who had a computer in Bolton.

644
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:45,340
 Yeah, there you go. It was called, interestingly, everyone called it Familycom, and they still

645
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:49,820
 do, and they still always call it Familycom, but the name is Familycomputer because they

646
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:54,300
 weren't allowed to trademark it as Familycom because there was an oven released a couple

647
00:52:54,300 --> 00:53:01,560
 of years earlier, which was a Familyconvection oven, which was Familycon.

648
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:05,860
 Just on board games, cool new weird board games, which are always fun. People always

649
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:11,500
 coming up with them these days. Have you guys heard of Consentical?

650
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,460
 No and I already regret half hearing about it.

651
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,980
 Go on, guess what it is?

652
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:21,620
 Yes, you can touch my balls.

653
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:28,660
 So it's a cooperative card game for two players, and it's about a consensual, crucially, sexual

654
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:35,000
 encounter between a curious human and a tentacled alien.

655
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
 And the way it works...

656
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
 I see like tentacle. Not testicle.

657
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,880
 I see Consentacle. Consentical is a testicle one.

658
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,760
 I think Consentical is the one where if you and Mr. Tickle had that.

659
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:53,960
 There are lots of variations. It's like the trolley problem. It was built on a lot.

660
00:53:53,960 --> 00:54:00,040
 Anyway, so I'm super fun. So you've got these cards, which are things that you might want

661
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:07,140
 to do to this alien that you fancy with tentacles. So Wink, Gaze, Envelop, Bite, Lick, Penetrate

662
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:12,860
 is one of the cards, and you convey which card you want to mutually put down with faces

663
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:17,900
 and gestures. So you make a certain face. I'm looking at Matt, and it's like...

664
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:24,720
 Not me. I'm looking at that plant over there, doing a lot of copies of those QI books over

665
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,720
 there.

666
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,360
 That looks as penetrate at that plant.

667
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:33,120
 There's a famous... Is it by Hokusai? There's a famous painting of a woman having sex with

668
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,120
 a octopus.

669
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,120
 Yeah, with an octopus.

670
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,120
 Yeah.

671
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,680
 And a load of octopus scientists looked at it and said it didn't look like the octopus

672
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,680
 was enjoying itself very much, because apparently octopuses have ways of changing their body whenever

673
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,540
 they're mating and stuff like that.

674
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:53,260
 I think there was a exhibition at the British Museum that had a bunch of these, effectively

675
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:58,460
 a monster erotica paintings, and in the year that they were there, if you go to the website

676
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:02,780
 and you looked at the data, there were more searches for that exhibition than there were

677
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,060
 for the opening hours of the British Museum.

678
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:11,260
 Well, maybe that's what inspired this game, you know. It's like stop having this non-consensual

679
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,260
 sex with octopuses.

680
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,260
 So what happens... Sorry, you put the cards down and...

681
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:18,000
 I would need to convey through a series of looks and gestures what kind of sex move we

682
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:25,720
 should make with each other, and then we would look at the table.

683
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,400
 The plants over there can eat it.

684
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,680
 And then you would play a card, and I would play a card, and we would hope that our cards

685
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,360
 mutually matched each other and built trust between us rather than being non-consensual.

686
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,360
 It's snap.

687
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,360
 Yeah.

688
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,360
 It's sexy snap.

689
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,360
 Sexy snap.

690
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,360
 It's snap.

691
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,360
 Oh, snap.

692
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,360
 Oh, snap.

693
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,360
 Yeah.

694
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,500
 It's a really random thing that is a board game I'd love to get my hands on. It's a

695
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:55,860
 game which you can get in Sierra Leone, which is essential to be played by anyone who's

696
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,660
 trying to obtain a driver's license.

697
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:03,940
 It's not fully, but it's just the only piece is the car.

698
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:07,500
 I think you go around the bar and whatever you land on it, ask you a question about the

699
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,500
 highway code.

700
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,500
 Yeah.

701
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,500
 Right.

702
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,680
 So you do the test for two to three months, and then you do the test, and the game supposedly

703
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,020
 gets you ready for the test.

704
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,020
 It's so good.

705
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,020
 I could do with that.

706
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,680
 I'm learning to drive at the moment, and I'm dreading the theory test because it's a big

707
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:25,780
 old book to read, that old highway code, so a board game would be amazing.

708
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,780
 There you go.

709
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,780
 If you're listening, please, God, make a board game otherwise.

710
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:34,020
 Please make it as difficult as possible, so I'm not the best.

711
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,840
 Did you guys ever play the game Guess Who?

712
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,840
 Yes, yes.

713
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,840
 Still play it.

714
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,840
 Good on you, mate.

715
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,840
 Yes.

716
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:51,020
 That was invented by this couple called Aura and Theo Koster, who created a company called

717
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,020
 Theora.

718
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,580
 It's invented in the, I think it was the '60s.

719
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:58,060
 Theo was actually a classmate of Anne Frank, went to school with her.

720
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,060
 No.

721
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,060
 Yeah.

722
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,060
 Wow.

723
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,460
 Interestingly, his original name was Morris, but he was brought up in the Netherlands when

724
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:07,860
 it was under German occupation, so changed his name and hid his Jewish identity.

725
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,880
 Yeah, they married, and they became amazing game designers.

726
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,160
 They designed loads of extremely popular games, one of which was Guess Who, and they

727
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:20,440
 died, one of them died in 2019, one in 2021, I think, both age 90, and their gravestones

728
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,640
 are the Guess Who pop-ups?

729
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,120
 You can flip their gravestone down.

730
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,120
 You can't flip them sadly.

731
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,960
 That would be so cool, but no, you can't.

732
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,960
 What is it?

733
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,960
 What do they have?

734
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,080
 They just have the same design as the Guess Who pop-ups, which are quite similar to an

735
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,320
 actual gravestone.

736
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,340
 Well, guess who?

737
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:46,100
 You want to be able to split the remaining possible people as evenly in half as possible.

738
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,100
 Yes.

739
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,740
 Because you want to basically do a binary search.

740
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:53,180
 You want to split it in half each time, and that's the fastest way to get to the final

741
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:58,900
 answer, and the way you need to do that is by stacking your conditions at once, which

742
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:04,820
 a lot of other people will claim is cheating or making the game not fun anymore, but you

743
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:12,120
 can say if it's a man, do they have glasses, or if it's a woman, have they got a hat?

744
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:18,360
 And there's still a yes or no right response, but now you've used the categories to better

745
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,360
 split the options in half.

746
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,520
 That is so much better than the way we play it.

747
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,520
 Yeah, that's brilliant.

748
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:27,200
 We always say, does your guy like peas, and you just have to make a judgment.

749
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,120
 Look deep into their eyes.

750
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,200
 Would you trust them with the trolley problem?

751
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,820
 So roughly, how quickly do you destroy the seven-year-old you're playing?

752
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:41,940
 I wonder, have mathematicians had a go at the other game invented by Aura and Theo Costa,

753
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:48,060
 which is the, and they made it in the 1970s, the popping out rubber spheres game that's

754
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,060
 become really popular recently.

755
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,700
 I've only seen it because suddenly I'm surrounded by young children.

756
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,700
 Yeah, we've got a few at home.

757
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,700
 Yeah.

758
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,700
 Yeah.

759
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,700
 Do you guys know what I mean?

760
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,700
 The fidgety toy thing.

761
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,700
 Yeah.

762
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,700
 And people are into it.

763
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,700
 Stress ties.

764
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:04,280
 I thought they were invented by someone who is inspired by a field of breasts.

765
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,780
 You're absolutely right.

766
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,800
 And that is Aura Costa.

767
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,800
 Wow.

768
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,800
 Really?

769
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:14,960
 She was actually sweetly and darkly inspired by her sister, who very sadly got breast cancer,

770
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:19,220
 and she had a dream around that time of a huge field of her sister's breasts and woke

771
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:22,380
 up and went to the game designer and was like, make me a field of boobs.

772
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,380
 Wow.

773
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,380
 Oh my God.

774
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:27,140
 I had a dream last night where there was a referee in a football match and he tried

775
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:30,260
 someone off, but he pulled out a rice cake instead.

776
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,260
 Oh yeah.

777
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,260
 Can we turn that into a game?

778
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,260
 Not all dreams are going to be money spinners.

779
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:39,300
 That should have been her tombstone, a giant robber, a gravestone that you could push down

780
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,300
 into the ground.

781
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,300
 But then what if she pops it back up?

782
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:47,700
 That is scary.

783
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:53,460
 Okay, that's it.

784
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,460
 That is all of our facts.

785
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,800
 Thank you so much for listening.

786
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,700

790
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:11,020
 Matt, I'm standupmaths, pretty much everywhere.

791
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:12,020
 Yep.

792
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,020
 And Anna.

795
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,580

 You'll find a link to Club Fish, our secret members club, where we have lots of bonus

799
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,200
 episodes.

800
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:35,000
 But most important of all, you should find yourself to a pre-order link for Matt's new

801
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,040
 book, which is coming out this June, you were saying?

802
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,040
 Yep.

803
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,480
 June in the UK, August in the US.

804
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,480
 And where's the best place for them to go?

805
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:45,720
 If you go to massgear.co.uk, you can get the signed pre-ordered copies by me.

806
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,400
 But you can support your local independent bookshop or anywhere else online to pre-order

807
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,400
 it.

808
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,400
 Remind us what it's called.

809
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,400
 It's called Love Triangle.

810
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,400
 Okay, that's it.

811
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,860
 I'll see you next week with another episode, and we'll see you then.

812
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,360
 Goodbye!
