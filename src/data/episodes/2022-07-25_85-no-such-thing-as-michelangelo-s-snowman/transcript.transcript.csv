00:00:00,00:00:17,"""Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:17,00:00:20,this week coming to you from the Brighton Comedy Festival.
00:00:20,00:00:24,"My name is Dan Treiber, and please welcome to stage it's a three regular elves, Aniches"
00:00:24,00:00:43,"and Skie James Harkin and Andy Murray."""
00:00:43,00:00:47,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from"
00:00:47,00:00:53,"the last seven days and in no particular order here we go, starting with you, James Harkin."
00:00:53,00:01:00,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 1511, the people of Brussels protested against the"
00:01:00,00:01:05,government by filling the city with dozens of pornographic snowmen.
00:01:05,00:01:11,"It's a pornographic snowman, it's just a snowman that's not wearing a scarf."
00:01:11,00:01:15,"Yeah, how did that work?"
00:01:15,00:01:19,Well I can tell you about the snowmen themselves because they have been described.
00:01:19,00:01:25,"There was a snow nun who was seducing a man, there was a snowman and a snow woman who were"
00:01:25,00:01:32,having sex in front of the town's fountain and a snow naked boy urinating into the mouth
00:01:32,00:01:36,of a snow drunkard.
00:01:36,00:01:37,How do they do it?
00:01:37,00:01:43,"When a male snowman and a female snow lady love each other very, no I know what you mean."
00:01:43,00:01:47,"Yeah, because this is a lovely looking snowman and there are final little things added"
00:01:47,00:01:49,in Sunley.
00:01:49,00:01:50,Or a big thing.
00:01:50,00:01:53,It really depends on the snowman.
00:01:53,00:01:57,"It's cold, it's cold, it's cold, it's not going to be big."
00:01:57,00:02:02,"Yeah, so actually it was kind of a tradition at the time or it was a few people did it and"
00:02:02,00:02:04,then everyone kind of took over.
00:02:04,00:02:07,It's known as the miracle of 1511.
00:02:07,00:02:12,"It had been really cold for like six weeks in Brussels, very, very bad weather and there"
00:02:12,00:02:15,had been massive population growth in the city and there was a big wealth discrepancy
00:02:15,00:02:18,between the peasants and the Habsburgs who were in charge.
00:02:18,00:02:22,"So everyone was generally pissed off with the government and they thought well, how can"
00:02:22,00:02:23,we get our point across?
00:02:23,00:02:25,"Well, the only way to do it is to make a snowman."
00:02:25,00:02:32,But I don't know how you could do to snow people having sex because snowman is just a ball
00:02:32,00:02:34,of snow and then a smaller ball of snow and then a ball of snow.
00:02:34,00:02:37,"Yeah, I think these were like a bit more, they looked more like statues."
00:02:37,00:02:38,Yeah.
00:02:38,00:02:39,That's very good snow skill though.
00:02:39,00:02:43,"I mean I can't do that kind of, I don't know, I've never tried, maybe everybody can."
00:02:43,00:02:47,You could do the snow balls that would be on the edge of you.
00:02:47,00:02:54,"For the pre-curve you, snow sculptures, several snow people were involved in a tableau satirising"
00:02:54,00:02:58,"the edicts handed down by the local government, which I think sounds like a very complicated"
00:02:58,00:03:02,snow sculpture given the three balls on top of each other we come up with now.
00:03:02,00:03:03,Yeah.
00:03:03,00:03:07,They had snow unicorns and snow mermaids and a snow dentist.
00:03:07,00:03:12,They had two thrillers back in the day.
00:03:12,00:03:13,So that was what they had.
00:03:13,00:03:18,And apparently busty snow hookers enticing people into the red light districts.
00:03:18,00:03:22,"So it serves a purpose as well as protesting the government, you know, it can help local"
00:03:22,00:03:23,industry.
00:03:23,00:03:26,Brussels seems to have very creative protests.
00:03:26,00:03:30,"I was reading, I think it was just this year that they were protesting against the government,"
00:03:30,00:03:31,it was the farmers.
00:03:31,00:03:35,So the way they protested was they were lined up against riot police but they brought
00:03:35,00:03:41,their cows with them and then they squirted direct from the utter cow milk at the riot
00:03:41,00:03:44,"police and there's all these photos are right place where their shields going wrong, these"
00:03:44,00:03:45,guys going wrong.
00:03:45,00:03:48,What are you just looking protests?
00:03:48,00:03:53,"Yeah, so okay, so in Brussels around the time they had all the different classes, the"
00:03:53,00:03:57,class system and all the different classes had their own kind of snowman.
00:03:57,00:04:00,"And so if you were like a poor person, a peasant and you sort of posh snowman down there,"
00:04:00,00:04:02,you detect that snowman.
00:04:02,00:04:03,Wow.
00:04:03,00:04:04,Yeah.
00:04:04,00:04:06,And there's magistrates got involved and there's court cases.
00:04:06,00:04:08,How can you tell if a snowman is posh?
00:04:08,00:04:13,"I don't know, maybe the carrot comes from weight rolls or whatever, I don't know."
00:04:13,00:04:22,"You know, you can buy off eBay, a melted snowman and that involves a bowl of water with a carrot"
00:04:22,00:04:24,and two blueberries in it.
00:04:24,00:04:27,"By it, 99p is the starting price."
00:04:27,00:04:29,I'm the finishing price.
00:04:29,00:04:32,"Also, snowman building kits, you can get now."
00:04:32,00:04:33,Okay.
00:04:33,00:04:38,So you have a snowman building kit which just says on the front just add snow.
00:04:38,00:04:39,There are loads of these.
00:04:39,00:04:43,"So to make a snowman, the best way, this is from an article on the Smithsonian website"
00:04:43,00:04:48,and they interviewed a physicist at Rhode Island College and his name is Dan Snowman and they
00:04:48,00:04:51,don't ever refer to it throughout the article.
00:04:51,00:04:53,"It's just very politely, don't make any gags."
00:04:53,00:04:59,"And so he says that for one thing, he says that you can make upside down snowman, but he"
00:04:59,00:05:03,"said, I just thought you'd like this down, that they are as rare as Sasquatch sightings."
00:05:03,00:05:09,"There's probably never been one, but anyway, the way you make a snowman is there are five"
00:05:09,00:05:16,"types of snow in terms of moisture and they are technically named dry, moist, wet, very wet"
00:05:16,00:05:17,and slush.
00:05:17,00:05:21,It's all about the ratio of free water to actual ice.
00:05:21,00:05:26,"And it is absolutely no fun around Christmas time, by the way."
00:05:26,00:05:31,I read an article on the website called quarts.com and that was about how to make the perfect
00:05:31,00:05:32,snowman.
00:05:32,00:05:37,"He said, the temperature is very important, too high a temperature and the snow will lack"
00:05:37,00:05:38,strength.
00:05:38,00:05:41,I.e. it will be water.
00:05:41,00:05:43,Do we want to hear some more 16th century snowman?
00:05:43,00:05:44,Yeah.
00:05:44,00:05:45,Sure.
00:05:45,00:05:48,"Apparently, Michelangelo built a snowman."
00:05:48,00:05:51,He was commissioned to build one by Pierreau Medici.
00:05:51,00:05:52,Commissioned.
00:05:52,00:05:53,Yeah.
00:05:53,00:05:57,"So he was, Pierreau was like one of the Medici's, but he wasn't like into art like everyone"
00:05:57,00:05:58,else was.
00:05:58,00:06:03,"So he said to Michelangelo, we'll just make a snowman, but apparently it's the best snowman"
00:06:03,00:06:04,that anyone has ever seen.
00:06:04,00:06:09,"Yeah, but everyone says that after they've melted, there's no burden of proof."
00:06:09,00:06:14,"Some people think that it was the basis or they did it as a practice for David, for Michelangelo's"
00:06:14,00:06:15,David.
00:06:15,00:06:20,"Just on the subject of snowmen and religion, there was this January, there was a cleric in"
00:06:20,00:06:25,Saudi Arabia who issued an edict banning snowmen from being built.
00:06:25,00:06:29,I would imagine not a massive problem inside of you.
00:06:29,00:06:32,"But he said, I mean, I'm sure they get snow in some parts of the country at some times."
00:06:32,00:06:36,"Anyway, he said it is not permitted to make a statue out of snow even by way of play and"
00:06:36,00:06:37,fun.
00:06:37,00:06:40,And he also said it promotes lustiness and eroticism.
00:06:40,00:06:41,I mean Brussels.
00:06:41,00:06:42,Yeah.
00:06:42,00:06:43,Yeah.
00:06:43,00:06:47,So we're going to have to move on very soon to our next factor.
00:06:47,00:06:48,"James, you got something else?"
00:06:48,00:06:54,A student who built a four foot fallace out of snow in a park was given a fixed penalty
00:06:54,00:06:55,of Â£80.
00:06:55,00:06:57,So that was a thing.
00:06:57,00:07:03,Someone else actually said like the worst news report ever.
00:07:03,00:07:04,So that was a thing.
00:07:04,00:07:06,"I mean, there's Andy with the weather."
00:07:06,00:07:11,"It's going to be cold still, so back to you, if you want."
00:07:11,00:07:14,"There was another snow fine, actually."
00:07:14,00:07:19,"In 2013, a police in Germany gave a parking ticket to a car covered in snow which just turned"
00:07:19,00:07:24,up to be a snow sculptor of a car.
00:07:24,00:07:28,They issued the parking ticket and then they realised once they'd issued it when they tried
00:07:28,00:07:32,to scrape the snow off to reveal the number plate and it just kept on going.
00:07:32,00:07:37,They must have kept thinking this is a really small car.
00:07:37,00:07:41,The policeman's comment was when he realised that so they left the parking ticket on it and
00:07:41,00:07:46,"the policeman said we can take a joke as well as the next person, but whether it was made"
00:07:46,00:07:53,"of metal or snow, it was still obstructing the road and that should have been perfect."
00:07:53,00:07:58,"OK, I'm going to move us on to our second fact of the show and that is Chazinsky."
00:07:58,00:08:03,"Yeah, my fact today is that Harris Hawks stand on each other's shoulders to get a better"
00:08:03,00:08:06,"view, which is incredible, too."
00:08:06,00:08:14,It's also considering they can fly.
00:08:14,00:08:18,Are they standing on the shoulders of a flying bird?
00:08:18,00:08:23,"No, they're standing on a perch or a cactus or something and then the guy on the cactus"
00:08:23,00:08:27,is like I can't quite see over that tree and then you stand on my shoulders and they've
00:08:27,00:08:32,"been seen up to like, so usually it's two to three Hawks high, you can get four Hawks high."
00:08:32,00:08:36,"Four Hawks standing on each other's shoulders, it's amazing."
00:08:36,00:08:40,"And yeah, we're not entirely sure why they do this, but it could be a number of reasons,"
00:08:40,00:08:43,"so to get a good view of, you know, if you want to look, get a proper angle down on your"
00:08:43,00:08:47,"potential prey, also to provide shade, I think, so it's often the dominant hawk which is"
00:08:47,00:08:48,on the bottom.
00:08:48,00:08:51,"So it's thought that the dominant hawk goes, ""I'm really hot."
00:08:51,00:08:58,"Someone needs to go on top of me as like a bird parasol,"" and also it might be because"
00:08:58,00:09:03,perching spots are scarce.
00:09:03,00:09:09,So one of the ideas I think is that they're on a cactus and it's hard to find a bit of
00:09:09,00:09:12,"cactus that doesn't have spikes on it, and so when they do find a bit with no spikes in"
00:09:12,00:09:14,"it, they're like, ""Oh, we're all going to sit there."""
00:09:14,00:09:15,Yeah.
00:09:15,00:09:19,Which is really annoying for the one guy who found the cactus that had those spikes on
00:09:19,00:09:20,it.
00:09:20,00:09:21,"Oh, get off."
00:09:21,00:09:22,Come on.
00:09:22,00:09:25,"So who's in the better position, dominant hawk at the bottom or guy at the top?"
00:09:25,00:09:27,"Well, it's a dominant hawk at the bottom, I guess he is."
00:09:27,00:09:31,"You've got three hawks on your shoulders, that's going to be really heavy."
00:09:31,00:09:34,"Well, I've ignited an interview and he hawks for this fact."
00:09:34,00:09:38,"But, yeah, it's called a stack, a hawk stack."
00:09:38,00:09:39,Why is that?
00:09:39,00:09:40,Why is that?
00:09:40,00:09:46,"It's one of those, it's impossible to trace about the etymology that used to have that word"
00:09:46,00:09:47,"there, but..."
00:09:47,00:09:55,There's a theory that hawks would taste most like dinosaur out of anything that we've
00:09:55,00:09:56,got.
00:09:56,00:09:59,"Because a lot of people have asked the question, ""What would a dinosaur taste like?"""
00:09:59,00:10:00,And there's a few...
00:10:00,00:10:02,I thought it would taste like chicken.
00:10:02,00:10:03,"Well, a-ha-ha."
00:10:03,00:10:04,A common misconception.
00:10:04,00:10:05,A-ha-ha.
00:10:05,00:10:07,And you're going to feel like an idiot now.
00:10:07,00:10:12,There's an article on slate.com by guy called Bran Palmer and he said that actually meat's
00:10:12,00:10:17,flavour is also affected by what the animal's been eating and hormones is not just on sort
00:10:17,00:10:19,of the biology or the genes or something.
00:10:19,00:10:21,"So, chickens don't eat meat."
00:10:21,00:10:25,"So if you get a bird which eats meat like a hawk or another raptor, then that's what"
00:10:25,00:10:28,"dinosaurs would taste like, a bit heavier and darker."
00:10:28,00:10:32,"Also, this is a really interesting find out about Harris Hawks for any ornithologist out"
00:10:32,00:10:33,there.
00:10:33,00:10:36,"It's not actually a Harris Hawk, it should be Harris's Hawk."
00:10:36,00:10:37,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:37,00:10:40,"That's my fact of the day, fact of the year, I think."
00:10:40,00:10:45,It was discovered by Ordebond who was a famous 19th century ornithologist and he named
00:10:45,00:10:46,after his mate.
00:10:46,00:10:51,Ordebond named Harris's Hawk after a guy called Edward Harris and he was the one who
00:10:51,00:10:56,"funded a book that this guy was writing, which was the Birds of America, I believe it's called,"
00:10:56,00:10:58,and he discovered a number of new species in that book.
00:10:58,00:11:01,I think it was something like 25 species.
00:11:01,00:11:03,He also named 11 species of fish.
00:11:03,00:11:08,This is one of the best revenge plots I've ever heard in my life because none of those
00:11:08,00:11:09,"fish exist, okay?"
00:11:09,00:11:10,Yeah.
00:11:10,00:11:13,I think it was because the killer fish exists.
00:11:13,00:11:14,Good point.
00:11:14,00:11:16,You got all that.
00:11:16,00:11:21,"So he was basically, he was at his home and the guy who was writing the book on the fish"
00:11:21,00:11:24,"came over to his house and while he was at his house, he was telling him about this book"
00:11:24,00:11:28,"and how it's going to be the ultimate book on fish and while they were chatting, they saw"
00:11:28,00:11:32,a couple of bats fly in and the fish guy thought they were new species of bats or he was scared
00:11:32,00:11:38,of bats were not quite sure but he immediately grabbed Ordebond's violin which was really
00:11:38,00:11:43,"expensive and smashed them against the bats and Ordebond was like, what but he was hosting"
00:11:43,00:11:44,this guy.
00:11:44,00:11:49,"So the guy sat back down and then he went, I know some fish that I've discovered that"
00:11:49,00:11:52,he should include into your book.
00:11:52,00:11:53,And he went fantastic.
00:11:53,00:11:54,What are they?
00:11:54,00:11:56,"He described them, he drew them, they went into the book and then he got outed for putting"
00:11:56,00:11:57,fake fish into his book.
00:11:57,00:11:59,"Isn't that the biggest, best revenge plot?"
00:11:59,00:12:00,Wow.
00:12:00,00:12:01,Yeah.
00:12:01,00:12:02,No way.
00:12:02,00:12:03,Yeah.
00:12:03,00:12:04,I was reading the other day.
00:12:04,00:12:05,So hawk standing on shoulders.
00:12:05,00:12:07,I was reading about monkeys.
00:12:07,00:12:11,I was reading this book Sapiens and they worked together as well and they have this amazing
00:12:11,00:12:12,thing.
00:12:12,00:12:15,A language that zoologists have managed to isolate certain calls.
00:12:15,00:12:20,So monkeys in isolation they'll send a call out and the call will say there's an eagle
00:12:20,00:12:23,in the sky so all the monkeys look up to see if it's coming and then they'll play another
00:12:23,00:12:28,signal which says there's a tiger on the way and so they all go up the tree but then they've
00:12:28,00:12:32,discovered that some monkeys will be seeing another monkey with a banana and go there's
00:12:32,00:12:35,a tiger and they'll leap up into a tree and they'll just take the banana.
00:12:35,00:12:36,Oh.
00:12:36,00:12:37,Yeah.
00:12:37,00:12:38,So devious.
00:12:38,00:12:39,Okay.
00:12:39,00:12:41,"On that, this is very, very cool."
00:12:41,00:12:48,So mockingbirds make alarm calls when they see a hawk and iguanas listen to mockingbirds.
00:12:48,00:12:52,They listen to a completely different species of animal and when the mockingbird makes an
00:12:52,00:12:56,"alarm call, the iguanas all run for it because the iguanas can't tell each other there's"
00:12:56,00:13:01,"a hawk because they don't, they're silent, they don't communicate with each other."
00:13:01,00:13:05,They're all not talking to each other but they just listen to the mockingbird.
00:13:05,00:13:08,It's like one of those things when you're in a strop with someone so you make someone
00:13:08,00:13:10,else communicate with them on your behalf.
00:13:10,00:13:12,I'm not talking to him.
00:13:12,00:13:13,It's really sad.
00:13:13,00:13:16,You can just imagine two iguanas facing each other and not able to say how they feel and
00:13:16,00:13:17,you know.
00:13:17,00:13:18,Yeah.
00:13:18,00:13:24,"If you swaps your eyes for a hawk, you'd be able to see an ant crawling on the ground from"
00:13:24,00:13:26,the roof of a ten-story building.
00:13:26,00:13:27,Wow.
00:13:27,00:13:33,So you'd be arrested immediately but I can see an animal that's still not getting around
00:13:33,00:13:35,a lot of wildlife and just let you say.
00:13:35,00:13:40,"Well, they're thinking about doing laser eye surgery now to give us much better vision which"
00:13:40,00:13:41,I think is completely unnecessary aren't they?
00:13:41,00:13:46,So hawks have like or eagles have 20 to 5 vision and they think they can get humans up
00:13:46,00:13:49,"to 2010 vision, which I don't really see the need."
00:13:49,00:13:53,"So a 20 to 5 vision means that something that I can see you that's 5 metres away, a hawk"
00:13:53,00:13:57,"could be able to see that it's 20 metres away and they could see it with the same vision,"
00:13:57,00:13:58,right?
00:13:58,00:14:03,"So if James is on the top floor of his ten-story house and he's lost his pet ant, this"
00:14:03,00:14:04,will come in handy.
00:14:04,00:14:10,Do you know that lobsters can regenerate their eyes but they can only do it a certain number
00:14:10,00:14:14,"of times and after they've done it that number of times, instead of regenerating an eye,"
00:14:14,00:14:15,they regenerate a limb.
00:14:15,00:14:16,What?
00:14:16,00:14:20,Do they regenerate the limb where the eye wants to lose?
00:14:20,00:14:21,Wow.
00:14:21,00:14:22,"That's great, isn't it?"
00:14:22,00:14:23,That's insane.
00:14:23,00:14:27,Do they know how many times they've got?
00:14:27,00:14:28,I don't think they do.
00:14:28,00:14:32,They probably don't even know their lobsters.
00:14:32,00:14:43,"Imagine shaking hands at somebody's eye with, I was trying to find your fact-hander because"
00:14:43,00:14:48,actually it's surprisingly hard to find that actual sentence on the internet that hawks
00:14:48,00:14:51,stand on each other's shoulders and it was on a site where it's like there's a lot of
00:14:51,00:14:56,sites here these days that are trying to educate children about everything and this was
00:14:56,00:15:00,a super fun hawk page and there was a bunch of stuff about hawks and then it said extra
00:15:00,00:15:06,"fun facts and so the opening one was backstanding so they stand on each other, that was one and"
00:15:06,00:15:09,this is the second extra fun fact.
00:15:09,00:15:14,They gather in large groups and congregate on the electrical transformers where they
00:15:14,00:15:18,electrocuted to death.
00:15:18,00:15:23,Science is fun!
00:15:23,00:15:28,They are kind of the bad guys of the natural world hawks so people don't like them and a lot
00:15:28,00:15:30,of people like this video online which you should all look up.
00:15:30,00:15:35,"Actually there are a few videos of smaller birds who are usually preyed upon by hawks, attacking"
00:15:35,00:15:40,a hawk so it was a mother-king bird and a hawk came a bit too near her nest and she jumps
00:15:40,00:15:45,on the hawks back and grips onto his shoulders and then picks away at his forehead and the
00:15:45,00:15:48,"hawk flies through the air, nothing he can do."
00:15:48,00:15:54,"This is similar, I just read this the other day, that seagulls attack whales which is another"
00:15:54,00:15:59,kind of little thing against the country.
00:15:59,00:16:03,You get seagulls and they go down and there is a whale that is near the surface and seagulls
00:16:03,00:16:08,come down and grab a bit of flesh from the side of the whale.
00:16:08,00:16:09,I know.
00:16:09,00:16:11,Would whales ever deal with a flying animal?
00:16:11,00:16:14,Would they get back down and tell a story like you won't believe what just happened up
00:16:14,00:16:15,there?
00:16:15,00:16:17,It was a thing literally in the air.
00:16:17,00:16:21,It's like a really small flying whale up there.
00:16:21,00:16:25,How do you know you are a whale?
00:16:25,00:16:30,How do you know that a hawk is terrorising the people of Manchester at the moment?
00:16:30,00:16:36,"A massive bird named Stephen reported by the Manchester Evening News, the name Stephen"
00:16:36,00:16:39,"by residents who hate him, I don't know why they have given him a name, who stands on"
00:16:39,00:16:44,"street lights screeching at people, the massive bird named Stephen is known by experts for"
00:16:44,00:16:45,its intelligence.
00:16:45,00:16:50,"I think it means hawks generally are known for their intelligence, not Stephen specifically."
00:16:50,00:16:54,"But Stephanie Milling who lives just off Pollard Street in Manchester said, ""It's been"
00:16:54,00:16:57,"hunting and catching wood pigeons, but it keeps trying to get my cat."""
00:16:57,00:17:02,"And I have a friend nearby who has pet rabbits, so we call each other every now and again saying"
00:17:02,00:17:03,Stephen's out.
00:17:03,00:17:05,Get your rabbits in.
00:17:05,00:17:09,"James' ant farm is in serious, serious channel."
00:17:09,00:17:13,"We need to move on to the next fact, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:17:13,00:17:14,Okay.
00:17:14,00:17:19,My fact this week is that Pope Innocent the Eighth was given the nickname The Honest because
00:17:19,00:17:25,he was the first Pope to acknowledge that he had illegitimate children.
00:17:25,00:17:27,They should have called him Innocent the Smoothie.
00:17:27,00:17:28,Oh!
00:17:28,00:17:29,Come on.
00:17:29,00:17:35,"Those of you who have heard the podcast, you knew what you were coming from."
00:17:35,00:17:36,"So, north."
00:17:36,00:17:38,"Those of you who haven't, you can leave now."
00:17:38,00:17:39,No refunds.
00:17:39,00:17:46,"So, in the old days, Innocent the Eighth was 15th century, so ages ago back in the days"
00:17:46,00:17:51,when he had very naughty popes and there was an amazing spell of naughty popes.
00:17:51,00:17:56,It sounds like Andy's weather forecast will be having a spell of naughty popes.
00:17:56,00:17:59,Not to get rabbit up.
00:17:59,00:18:03,Pope Stephen is out.
00:18:03,00:18:09,"So, normally when popes had illegitimate children, and in the Renaissance and the Middle Ages"
00:18:09,00:18:13,"the loads of them had illegitimate children, they would just say they were their nephews"
00:18:13,00:18:16,and nieces even though they clearly weren't.
00:18:16,00:18:18,"So, they used it to get them jobs."
00:18:18,00:18:22,But Innocent the Eighth acknowledged this and then he still used his position to get his
00:18:22,00:18:23,children jobs.
00:18:23,00:18:26,He made his 13-year-old grandson a cardinal.
00:18:26,00:18:27,Wow.
00:18:27,00:18:28,Yeah.
00:18:28,00:18:32,"When I was looking him up, I looked at his Wikipedia page and you got a lot of links at the"
00:18:32,00:18:38,"bottom to other related articles on Wikipedia and one of them led me to, ""This is the title,"
00:18:38,00:18:40,"""List of Sexually Active Popes."""
00:18:40,00:18:44,And it is a massive list.
00:18:44,00:18:48,"They were active, they were going for it."
00:18:48,00:18:49,"Yeah, they were."
00:18:49,00:18:50,They were wild.
00:18:50,00:18:56,"So, this fact kind of reminds me of, like, I think that modern day or maybe it's always existed,"
00:18:56,00:18:58,elevating honesty way too high.
00:18:58,00:19:03,"So, that whole, I really want to be honest with you, I've shagged your dad."
00:19:03,00:19:04,That kind of thing.
00:19:04,00:19:05,"Oh, sorry."
00:19:05,00:19:06,"No, sorry."
00:19:06,00:19:07,That's it.
00:19:07,00:19:12,"Firstly, which is the 3 of us what you're speaking to."
00:19:12,00:19:16,It was the plural you were talking about.
00:19:16,00:19:17,I'm really sorry.
00:19:17,00:19:24,"The Wikipedia list, a list of that, I'll ask you."
00:19:24,00:19:30,"It just says, ""Your, yours, yours."""
00:19:30,00:19:32,"So, yeah, you don't need to know that."
00:19:32,00:19:38,"And in fact, there were popes who shagged, so Benedict IX was a particularly bad one who"
00:19:38,00:19:46,"was responsible for copious bestiality, sort of me sponsoring all g's, sponsoring all g's."
00:19:46,00:19:51,This all g is brought to you by the Pope.
00:19:51,00:19:56,Have a good time.
00:19:56,00:20:03,"I'm just imagining, like, I'm thinking of having an orgy next week, would you mind sponsoring?"
00:20:03,00:20:05,You can get 10 p per.
00:20:05,00:20:06,Benedict IX is amazing.
00:20:06,00:20:09,He was Pope on three separate occasions.
00:20:09,00:20:11,"He became Pope at the age of, like, really, really young."
00:20:11,00:20:13,Some sources say he was 11 when he became Pope.
00:20:13,00:20:16,"I can't quite, but there's a lot of propaganda, though, so may not have done."
00:20:16,00:20:21,"But he did sell the papacy to his godfather to raise money for his wedding, and then he"
00:20:21,00:20:24,"got bored and decided, ""No, actually, I'd like to be Pope again."""
00:20:24,00:20:25,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:25,00:20:26,He was crazy.
00:20:26,00:20:29,"I was reading through the list of popes, because there was a lot of them who share the same"
00:20:29,00:20:30,"names, John."
00:20:30,00:20:33,Pope John Paul is so on.
00:20:33,00:20:35,Pope George Ringo.
00:20:35,00:20:42,"And there's, I mean, there's amazing names to start with."
00:20:42,00:20:43,They're incredible names.
00:20:43,00:20:44,My favourite one was Pope hilarious.
00:20:44,00:20:48,That's an actual Pope.
00:20:48,00:20:49,Pope hilarious.
00:20:49,00:20:53,But did you look into Pope hilarious to see what hilarious things he did?
00:20:53,00:20:54,"Oh, he was so boring."
00:20:54,00:20:55,I was desperate.
00:20:55,00:20:58,"I spent the majority of my research going, ""Come on."
00:20:58,00:20:59,"One thing."""
00:20:59,00:21:05,"The best thing I could find was he erected a chapel, a convent, and two public baths."
00:21:05,00:21:06,"Yeah, but you had to be there."
00:21:06,00:21:07,It was hilarious.
00:21:07,00:21:11,One of my favourite popes is Benedict XII.
00:21:11,00:21:15,"And what happened with him is the Cardinals, when they were deciding who was going to be Pope."
00:21:15,00:21:19,"What they would often do is, in the first round of votes, they would all vote for someone"
00:21:19,00:21:22,who's probably not going to become Pope because they're a bit rubbish.
00:21:22,00:21:25,"And then they would think, ""Well, no one else will vote for them, and they'll see how the"
00:21:25,00:21:27,"other Cardinals are voting."""
00:21:27,00:21:31,"Unfortunately, everyone voted for Benedict XII."
00:21:31,00:21:32,Was he good?
00:21:32,00:21:41,"Well, Pope John XII turned the Vatican or the papal palace into a hallhouse, apparently, committing"
00:21:41,00:21:45,adultery with numerous women that included his father's long-term girlfriend.
00:21:45,00:21:49,"And I like that because this is a 10th century, and I didn't know you had long-term girlfriends"
00:21:49,00:21:50,in the 10th century.
00:21:50,00:21:54,"I thought you were married, or you were single, too."
00:21:54,00:21:55,Or dead.
00:21:55,00:21:56,Or dead.
00:21:56,00:21:58,Popular choice in the 10th century.
00:21:58,00:22:03,"And he invented the idea of long-term girlfriend, but never gets recognised for it because he"
00:22:03,00:22:07,"was the Pope, and they were focusing on that bit of this story."
00:22:07,00:22:12,"I think, because a lot of these stories, I'm not sure, you know, there's a lot of sort"
00:22:12,00:22:13,of...
00:22:13,00:22:15,There have been put in from the detractors of the public.
00:22:15,00:22:16,And smearing of reputation.
00:22:16,00:22:17,Yeah.
00:22:17,00:22:22,"So there's also the thing of, they might have been made up by an anti-Pope, who was not"
00:22:22,00:22:25,"as you would think, a Pope made out of anti-matter."
00:22:25,00:22:29,Or made out of anti-matter.
00:22:29,00:22:34,"Sort of a rival Pope who would set up a separate court elsewhere somewhere in France,"
00:22:34,00:22:37,"or even somewhere in Italy, and say, ""I'm the Pope."""
00:22:37,00:22:39,That's a bread-horrible rumours about the actual Pope.
00:22:39,00:22:40,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:40,00:22:45,"Although, like, celibacy in the church really didn't become the absolute norm for an"
00:22:45,00:22:49,"extremely long time, until about two or three hundred years ago, and it's thought..."
00:22:49,00:22:54,"So until, I think there's a council of Trent ruling in 1563 that really said, seriously,"
00:22:54,00:22:55,you have to stop having sex.
00:22:55,00:22:59,"We've been saying this for 1,500 years, no one's listened."
00:22:59,00:23:03,"But they kept on doing it, and actually the reason that that eventually passed in the"
00:23:03,00:23:08,"council of Trent, the reason that members of the clergy in the Catholic church can't"
00:23:08,00:23:12,"have sex, is because there were so many other legitimate children, and they were taking"
00:23:12,00:23:16,"the church property and passing it on to their children, so it was going out of the church"
00:23:16,00:23:19,"because they'd be like, ""I guess this church is mine, I'll just give it to my son."""
00:23:19,00:23:23,"And so the church was like, ""Well, we've got to stop this, we've got to keep our property."""
00:23:23,00:23:25,"And so they said, ""Sorry, you're not allowed to have sex."""
00:23:25,00:23:28,But Protestants were very pro-sex at the time.
00:23:28,00:23:34,"So Martin Luther, who sort of founder of the Reformation, thought that it was really bad,"
00:23:34,00:23:37,the whole celibacy vowsing because it encouraged masturbation.
00:23:37,00:23:42,"And as he said, Martin Luther, founder of, I guess, the Protestant church, if it doesn't"
00:23:42,00:23:45,"go into a woman, it goes into your shirt."
00:23:45,00:23:46,What?
00:23:46,00:23:48,And we can't be having that.
00:23:48,00:23:54,"It was before the invention of the tissue, so..."
00:23:54,00:23:57,Life's that's a terrible sentence.
00:23:57,00:23:59,It sounds a bit like the start of a song.
00:23:59,00:24:02,"Yeah, if it doesn't go into a woman, man."
00:24:02,00:24:04,That might...
00:24:04,00:24:07,"Like God, no one else."
00:24:07,00:24:12,Old together.
00:24:12,00:24:17,"I was very quickly looking into, so he was called ""The Honest"" as a sort of nickname."
00:24:17,00:24:22,"And I love history's nicknames, Ivan the Terrible, so on ""Jone of Arc."""
00:24:22,00:24:25,Does that work?
00:24:25,00:24:29,"But my favourite one, this is a king."
00:24:29,00:24:30,"Louis, the unavoidable."
00:24:30,00:24:36,"There's a much it's saying a bit of party, I don't know."
00:24:36,00:24:37,He's coming over.
00:24:37,00:24:38,He's coming over.
00:24:38,00:24:39,He's coming over.
00:24:39,00:24:40,"Oh, Louis."
00:24:40,00:24:41,Hi.
00:24:41,00:24:42,Hi.
00:24:42,00:24:43,Hi.
00:24:43,00:24:44,My good.
00:24:44,00:24:45,You're still king?
00:24:45,00:24:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:46,00:24:48,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:48,00:24:53,"All right, I'm going to move us on to our final fact of the show, and that is my fact."
00:24:53,00:24:59,"My fact this week is that Spanish construction workers recently accidentally destroyed a 6,000-year-old"
00:24:59,00:25:05,neolithic tomb that looked like a picnic table and replaced it with a new and better-looking
00:25:05,00:25:10,picnic table.
00:25:10,00:25:11,And it's incredible.
00:25:11,00:25:12,You can see the photo.
00:25:12,00:25:18,"So the photo is of a stone, sort of, it looks like a big table with surrounding chairs."
00:25:18,00:25:20,"So, I mean, they're full, really."
00:25:20,00:25:22,And then they've replaced it and the new one says--
00:25:22,00:25:26,"Well, I'm sorry, therefore, the neolithic people's full of making them tomb like a picnic table."
00:25:26,00:25:29,"OK, when you say like that, I'm going to retract that statement."
00:25:29,00:25:33,But you look at the new picture and it's this really nice-looking picnic table.
00:25:33,00:25:35,"I mean, actually, it's actually really nice."
00:25:35,00:25:38,"What happened is they didn't know that it was a heritage site property, and they saw"
00:25:38,00:25:41,"it and just thought, oh, the poor people here, they want to have a nice picnic."
00:25:41,00:25:45,"So I was supposed to do something good for them, and then got in serious trouble by ruining"
00:25:45,00:25:46,it.
00:25:46,00:25:50,I read that one local architect said it was probably due to a miscommunication because
00:25:50,00:25:53,it was the summer holiday.
00:25:53,00:25:54,So tragic.
00:25:54,00:25:58,"And also in the summer holiday is demand for picnic tables, rockets."
00:25:58,00:25:59,Yes.
00:25:59,00:26:01,"So they did this global survey, global."
00:26:01,00:26:05,"They did in China of the Great Wall of China, and what they found was there was a huge"
00:26:05,00:26:08,"missing chunk of the Great Wall of China, and they had no idea where it went."
00:26:08,00:26:10,"And the town, just down the road, someone must have gone."
00:26:10,00:26:12,I found this wall full of bricks.
00:26:12,00:26:15,They built a whole town out of the Great Wall of China.
00:26:15,00:26:16,Wow.
00:26:16,00:26:17,"Yeah, it's incredible."
00:26:17,00:26:21,That is the only town you can see from space.
00:26:21,00:26:26,A man in central Ohio has been arrested for having sex with a picnic table.
00:26:26,00:26:30,Here's Andy with the weather.
00:26:30,00:26:35,He would stand the small metal table on its side and use the whole where the umbrella
00:26:35,00:26:36,should be to have sex.
00:26:36,00:26:43,"Ah, it can't be a happy experience."
00:26:43,00:26:47,"Perhaps this is more common amongst certain parts of society than we think, because there's"
00:26:47,00:26:51,"actually a man in Tennessee as well who was arrested for the same thing, and he was arrested."
00:26:51,00:26:56,"So he was initially arrested, a 49 year old man, because he was making an unusual deposit"
00:26:56,00:27:01,"at the ATM nearby, so attempting to copulate with the ATM."
00:27:01,00:27:05,What was wrong with this shirt?
00:27:05,00:27:08,I cannot think of which bit of an ATM.
00:27:08,00:27:12,"With a gun to my head, I would pick."
00:27:12,00:27:16,"I haven't done it, but obviously."
00:27:16,00:27:20,"Obviously, it arrived, and they took him outside of the bank, and sat him on a picnic table"
00:27:20,00:27:24,and went back into the office.
00:27:24,00:27:26,"And another guy came and went, ""Sorry, are you using this?"""
00:27:26,00:27:33,Because I thought it was bad when wasps turned up at a picnic.
00:27:33,00:27:38,I've been getting lucky all these years.
00:27:38,00:27:46,"On speaking of things that have been ruined, your ears, ladies and gentlemen."
00:27:46,00:27:51,"So I read a story about John Lennon, and when he used to, he had a period, which was known"
00:27:51,00:27:56,"as the Lost Weekend, longer than a weekend, but it's where he just went absolutely off the"
00:27:56,00:27:57,rail.
00:27:57,00:27:58,He was doing lots of drugs.
00:27:58,00:28:05,"He was being all night long in all over LA, and he stayed at Hugh Hefner's house for a party,"
00:28:05,00:28:07,"and he didn't stay there, so he was out of party."
00:28:07,00:28:10,"And while he was there, he was so drunk and he was smoking a cigarette."
00:28:10,00:28:12,He didn't have anywhere to put the cigarette out on.
00:28:12,00:28:17,So he decided the matease that was hanging on the wall would be the nice spot for it.
00:28:17,00:28:20,So he stubbed his cigarette into this matease.
00:28:20,00:28:25,"So all the bouncers, bodyguards of Hugh Hefner's playboy mansions immediately grabbed him"
00:28:25,00:28:26,to throw him out.
00:28:26,00:28:29,"Hugh Hefner went, no, no, no, no, no, stop, stop, it's fine."
00:28:29,00:28:30,It's fine.
00:28:30,00:28:31,Did you see what he just did?
00:28:31,00:28:35,"I didn't see, I just heard about it, but guys, John Lennon just stubbed the cigarette out"
00:28:35,00:28:36,on my matease.
00:28:36,00:28:39,"That is probably worth double the amount of money now that you were there, but take around"
00:28:39,00:28:40,the whole house.
00:28:40,00:28:42,I've got a Picasso in the back room.
00:28:42,00:28:45,"I mean, that's quite cool when value is added through destruction."
00:28:45,00:28:46,Yeah.
00:28:46,00:28:47,Wow.
00:28:47,00:28:52,"On other things, being accidentally destroyed, bungling builders as they refer to you when they"
00:28:52,00:28:59,"mess up, accidentally destroyed the wrong house in Cumbria, destroyed a woman's home instead"
00:28:59,00:29:02,of the dilapidated house a few streets away.
00:29:02,00:29:06,"Contractors were supposed to demolish another house, 500 yards away and another street, but"
00:29:06,00:29:11,set to work on Mrs. Beatty's home without checking they had the right address.
00:29:11,00:29:16,"Thomas Armstrong, construction limited, admits they got it wrong, but Mrs. Beatty is still"
00:29:16,00:29:19,considering legal action.
00:29:19,00:29:25,"Mrs. Beatty, when will you end this, then doubt her?"
00:29:25,00:29:31,"In 2013, there was a pair of Peruvian real estate companies which destroyed a pyramid, a small"
00:29:31,00:29:32,one.
00:29:32,00:29:35,"It was six meters high, but nonetheless, it was a pyramid and it was 4,000 years old as"
00:29:35,00:29:36,well.
00:29:36,00:29:40,And the companies workers tried to destroy three more pyramids before people who are
00:29:40,00:29:41,on looking stop them.
00:29:41,00:29:42,"Okay, get this."
00:29:42,00:29:49,"In the same year, 2013, another construction company in Belize, bulldozed one of the largest"
00:29:49,00:29:51,Mayan pyramids in the country.
00:29:51,00:29:55,It was 30 meters tall and they did it just to get crushed rock for road building.
00:29:55,00:30:00,"And the head of the Belize Institute of Archaeology said at the time, these guys knew that this"
00:30:00,00:30:01,was an ancient structure.
00:30:01,00:30:03,It's just bloody laziness.
00:30:03,00:30:08,It just couldn't be bothered to go and get other rock from elsewhere that wasn't a pyramid.
00:30:08,00:30:10,The rock shop was 19 miles away.
00:30:10,00:30:11,Yeah.
00:30:11,00:30:15,"And this happens all the time, that sort of, you know, small pyramids in Central and South"
00:30:15,00:30:16,America get demolished.
00:30:16,00:30:17,Really?
00:30:17,00:30:18,Yeah.
00:30:18,00:30:22,"One of Shakespeare's houses, and I think it was his most famous house."
00:30:22,00:30:26,The guy who owned it was so annoyed of people coming and knocking on his door that he just
00:30:26,00:30:27,knocked it down.
00:30:27,00:30:28,"Yeah, he was."
00:30:28,00:30:29,It's all weird response.
00:30:29,00:30:30,It's all weird.
00:30:30,00:30:32,"It's called the Reverend Gastro-Lor Gaskell or something like that, yeah."
00:30:32,00:30:35,"And he lived there and people just kept going past going, oh, Shakespeare's house and he's"
00:30:35,00:30:36,"like, no, I've had enough of that."
00:30:36,00:30:38,"It's not that big of a position, is it?"
00:30:38,00:30:39,Yeah.
00:30:39,00:30:40,"Also, move."
00:30:40,00:30:41,Yeah.
00:30:41,00:30:42,Seriously.
00:30:42,00:30:45,"And he had to, because he got driven out of the town, I think."
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Yeah, he did, yeah."
00:30:46,00:30:50,"And also he destroyed his house, so he would have had to move."
00:30:50,00:30:52,We're going to have to wrap up very soon.
00:30:52,00:30:53,I'm just a quick thing on picnics.
00:30:53,00:30:54,"Yeah, of course."
00:30:54,00:30:57,"I looked up, you know, this is no picnic."
00:30:57,00:31:02,"It took 190 years after the first French use of the word picnic before we got the phrase,"
00:31:02,00:31:03,this is no picnic.
00:31:03,00:31:09,So I just like to imagine that people were having a constant picnic for 190 years.
00:31:09,00:31:14,"There's this common misconception that the word picnic, the etymology, is racist."
00:31:14,00:31:18,It's one of those like internet rumors that started about the year 2000 that actually a picnic
00:31:18,00:31:22,"used to be where you'd go to watch like lynching of slaves, which just isn't true."
00:31:22,00:31:27,"So in the year 2000, the University of Albany, they wanted to organize, the university wanted"
00:31:27,00:31:30,"to organize a picnic, a big celebratory picnic for the students."
00:31:30,00:31:34,But they were told that it would offend people because it was a racist term.
00:31:34,00:31:37,"So instead, they decided we'll call it an outing."
00:31:37,00:31:41,And then they were written to an informer.
00:31:41,00:31:44,This would offend people because it was a homophobic term.
00:31:44,00:31:50,And so eventually the picnic was publicised without a title.
00:31:50,00:31:51,I didn't know this.
00:31:51,00:31:55,"Just on picnics and picnics tables Paris, the way Paris celebrated the millennium was by having"
00:31:55,00:31:57,a 600 mile long picnic.
00:31:57,00:31:58,Wow.
00:31:58,00:31:59,"Wow, really?"
00:31:59,00:32:03,Imagine being that guy who found picnics table sexually attractive turns up in Paris that
00:32:03,00:32:04,weekend.
00:32:04,00:32:07,And he's gone to Paris to get away from the picnics tables.
00:32:07,00:32:12,"Finally, a new life under the review identity."
00:32:12,00:32:14,Oh my god.
00:32:14,00:32:16,Wow.
00:32:16,00:32:18,"Okay, I'm going to wrap us up."
00:32:18,00:32:19,"Okay, that's it."
