00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,200
 "Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,000
 this week coming to you from the Brighton Comedy Festival.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,040
 My name is Dan Treiber, and please welcome to stage it's a three regular elves, Aniches

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:43,640
 and Skie James Harkin and Andy Murray."

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,720
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,600
 the last seven days and in no particular order here we go, starting with you, James Harkin.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,600
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1511, the people of Brussels protested against the

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,840
 government by filling the city with dozens of pornographic snowmen.

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,800
 It's a pornographic snowman, it's just a snowman that's not wearing a scarf.

10
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,440
 Yeah, how did that work?

11
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,600
 Well I can tell you about the snowmen themselves because they have been described.

12
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,600
 There was a snow nun who was seducing a man, there was a snowman and a snow woman who were

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,800
 having sex in front of the town's fountain and a snow naked boy urinating into the mouth

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,200
 of a snow drunkard.

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
 How do they do it?

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,200
 When a male snowman and a female snow lady love each other very, no I know what you mean.

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,640
 Yeah, because this is a lovely looking snowman and there are final little things added

18
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,640
 in Sunley.

19
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
 Or a big thing.

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,640
 It really depends on the snowman.

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,840
 It's cold, it's cold, it's cold, it's not going to be big.

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,480
 Yeah, so actually it was kind of a tradition at the time or it was a few people did it and

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,200
 then everyone kind of took over.

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,080
 It's known as the miracle of 1511.

25
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,120
 It had been really cold for like six weeks in Brussels, very, very bad weather and there

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,760
 had been massive population growth in the city and there was a big wealth discrepancy

27
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,240
 between the peasants and the Habsburgs who were in charge.

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,280
 So everyone was generally pissed off with the government and they thought well, how can

29
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
 we get our point across?

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,960
 Well, the only way to do it is to make a snowman.

31
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,560
 But I don't know how you could do to snow people having sex because snowman is just a ball

32
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,600
 of snow and then a smaller ball of snow and then a ball of snow.

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,800
 Yeah, I think these were like a bit more, they looked more like statues.

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
 Yeah.

35
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
 That's very good snow skill though.

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,400
 I mean I can't do that kind of, I don't know, I've never tried, maybe everybody can.

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,280
 You could do the snow balls that would be on the edge of you.

38
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,000
 For the pre-curve you, snow sculptures, several snow people were involved in a tableau satirising

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,320
 the edicts handed down by the local government, which I think sounds like a very complicated

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,880
 snow sculpture given the three balls on top of each other we come up with now.

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
 Yeah.

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,840
 They had snow unicorns and snow mermaids and a snow dentist.

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,400
 They had two thrillers back in the day.

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,720
 So that was what they had.

45
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,160
 And apparently busty snow hookers enticing people into the red light districts.

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,480
 So it serves a purpose as well as protesting the government, you know, it can help local

47
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
 industry.

48
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,400
 Brussels seems to have very creative protests.

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,360
 I was reading, I think it was just this year that they were protesting against the government,

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
 it was the farmers.

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,320
 So the way they protested was they were lined up against riot police but they brought

52
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:41,440
 their cows with them and then they squirted direct from the utter cow milk at the riot

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,720
 police and there's all these photos are right place where their shields going wrong, these

54
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
 guys going wrong.

55
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,680
 What are you just looking protests?

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,280
 Yeah, so okay, so in Brussels around the time they had all the different classes, the

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,040
 class system and all the different classes had their own kind of snowman.

58
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,480
 And so if you were like a poor person, a peasant and you sort of posh snowman down there,

59
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,000
 you detect that snowman.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Wow.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Yeah.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
 And there's magistrates got involved and there's court cases.

63
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,320
 How can you tell if a snowman is posh?

64
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,840
 I don't know, maybe the carrot comes from weight rolls or whatever, I don't know.

65
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:22,120
 You know, you can buy off eBay, a melted snowman and that involves a bowl of water with a carrot

66
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,240
 and two blueberries in it.

67
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,120
 By it, 99p is the starting price.

68
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
 I'm the finishing price.

69
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,640
 Also, snowman building kits, you can get now.

70
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,640
 Okay.

71
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,200
 So you have a snowman building kit which just says on the front just add snow.

72
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,960
 There are loads of these.

73
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,720
 So to make a snowman, the best way, this is from an article on the Smithsonian website

74
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,000
 and they interviewed a physicist at Rhode Island College and his name is Dan Snowman and they

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 don't ever refer to it throughout the article.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,960
 It's just very politely, don't make any gags.

77
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,160
 And so he says that for one thing, he says that you can make upside down snowman, but he

78
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,440
 said, I just thought you'd like this down, that they are as rare as Sasquatch sightings.

79
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,760
 There's probably never been one, but anyway, the way you make a snowman is there are five

80
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:16,840
 types of snow in terms of moisture and they are technically named dry, moist, wet, very wet

81
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
 and slush.

82
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,040
 It's all about the ratio of free water to actual ice.

83
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,160
 And it is absolutely no fun around Christmas time, by the way.

84
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,120
 I read an article on the website called quarts.com and that was about how to make the perfect

85
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
 snowman.

86
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,320
 He said, the temperature is very important, too high a temperature and the snow will lack

87
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
 strength.

88
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,720
 I.e. it will be water.

89
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,920
 Do we want to hear some more 16th century snowman?

90
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
 Yeah.

91
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
 Sure.

92
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,880
 Apparently, Michelangelo built a snowman.

93
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,960
 He was commissioned to build one by Pierreau Medici.

94
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
 Commissioned.

95
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
 Yeah.

96
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,680
 So he was, Pierreau was like one of the Medici's, but he wasn't like into art like everyone

97
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
 else was.

98
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,640
 So he said to Michelangelo, we'll just make a snowman, but apparently it's the best snowman

99
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
 that anyone has ever seen.

100
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,960
 Yeah, but everyone says that after they've melted, there's no burden of proof.

101
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,520
 Some people think that it was the basis or they did it as a practice for David, for Michelangelo's

102
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,520
 David.

103
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,000
 Just on the subject of snowmen and religion, there was this January, there was a cleric in

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,080
 Saudi Arabia who issued an edict banning snowmen from being built.

105
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,480
 I would imagine not a massive problem inside of you.

106
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,600
 But he said, I mean, I'm sure they get snow in some parts of the country at some times.

107
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,480
 Anyway, he said it is not permitted to make a statue out of snow even by way of play and

108
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
 fun.

109
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,680
 And he also said it promotes lustiness and eroticism.

110
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
 I mean Brussels.

111
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
 Yeah.

112
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
 Yeah.

113
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,680
 So we're going to have to move on very soon to our next factor.

114
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,880
 James, you got something else?

115
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,400
 A student who built a four foot fallace out of snow in a park was given a fixed penalty

116
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
 of £80.

117
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,040
 So that was a thing.

118
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,360
 Someone else actually said like the worst news report ever.

119
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
 So that was a thing.

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,600
 I mean, there's Andy with the weather.

121
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,760
 It's going to be cold still, so back to you, if you want.

122
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,480
 There was another snow fine, actually.

123
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,880
 In 2013, a police in Germany gave a parking ticket to a car covered in snow which just turned

124
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,640
 up to be a snow sculptor of a car.

125
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,560
 They issued the parking ticket and then they realised once they'd issued it when they tried

126
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,400
 to scrape the snow off to reveal the number plate and it just kept on going.

127
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,120
 They must have kept thinking this is a really small car.

128
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,800
 The policeman's comment was when he realised that so they left the parking ticket on it and

129
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,240
 the policeman said we can take a joke as well as the next person, but whether it was made

130
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,440
 of metal or snow, it was still obstructing the road and that should have been perfect.

131
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,160
 OK, I'm going to move us on to our second fact of the show and that is Chazinsky.

132
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,160
 Yeah, my fact today is that Harris Hawks stand on each other's shoulders to get a better

133
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,320
 view, which is incredible, too.

134
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:14,800
 It's also considering they can fly.

135
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
 Are they standing on the shoulders of a flying bird?

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,280
 No, they're standing on a perch or a cactus or something and then the guy on the cactus

137
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,680
 is like I can't quite see over that tree and then you stand on my shoulders and they've

138
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,560
 been seen up to like, so usually it's two to three Hawks high, you can get four Hawks high.

139
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,880
 Four Hawks standing on each other's shoulders, it's amazing.

140
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,160
 And yeah, we're not entirely sure why they do this, but it could be a number of reasons,

141
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,520
 so to get a good view of, you know, if you want to look, get a proper angle down on your

142
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,800
 potential prey, also to provide shade, I think, so it's often the dominant hawk which is

143
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
 on the bottom.

144
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,560
 So it's thought that the dominant hawk goes, "I'm really hot.

145
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:58,040
 Someone needs to go on top of me as like a bird parasol," and also it might be because

146
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,240
 perching spots are scarce.

147
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,040
 So one of the ideas I think is that they're on a cactus and it's hard to find a bit of

148
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,920
 cactus that doesn't have spikes on it, and so when they do find a bit with no spikes in

149
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,720
 it, they're like, "Oh, we're all going to sit there."

150
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
 Yeah.

151
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,160
 Which is really annoying for the one guy who found the cactus that had those spikes on

152
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
 it.

153
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
 Oh, get off.

154
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
 Come on.

155
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,040
 So who's in the better position, dominant hawk at the bottom or guy at the top?

156
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,000
 Well, it's a dominant hawk at the bottom, I guess he is.

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,240
 You've got three hawks on your shoulders, that's going to be really heavy.

158
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,920
 Well, I've ignited an interview and he hawks for this fact.

159
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,560
 But, yeah, it's called a stack, a hawk stack.

160
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
 Why is that?

161
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
 Why is that?

162
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,360
 It's one of those, it's impossible to trace about the etymology that used to have that word

163
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
 there, but...

164
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:55,360
 There's a theory that hawks would taste most like dinosaur out of anything that we've

165
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
 got.

166
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,200
 Because a lot of people have asked the question, "What would a dinosaur taste like?"

167
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
 And there's a few...

168
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,040
 I thought it would taste like chicken.

169
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
 Well, a-ha-ha.

170
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
 A common misconception.

171
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
 A-ha-ha.

172
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,680
 And you're going to feel like an idiot now.

173
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,880
 There's an article on slate.com by guy called Bran Palmer and he said that actually meat's

174
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,440
 flavour is also affected by what the animal's been eating and hormones is not just on sort

175
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,840
 of the biology or the genes or something.

176
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,240
 So, chickens don't eat meat.

177
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,720
 So if you get a bird which eats meat like a hawk or another raptor, then that's what

178
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,440
 dinosaurs would taste like, a bit heavier and darker.

179
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,560
 Also, this is a really interesting find out about Harris Hawks for any ornithologist out

180
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
 there.

181
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,960
 It's not actually a Harris Hawk, it should be Harris's Hawk.

182
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
 Oh, yeah.

183
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,920
 That's my fact of the day, fact of the year, I think.

184
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,320
 It was discovered by Ordebond who was a famous 19th century ornithologist and he named

185
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
 after his mate.

186
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,360
 Ordebond named Harris's Hawk after a guy called Edward Harris and he was the one who

187
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,640
 funded a book that this guy was writing, which was the Birds of America, I believe it's called,

188
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,880
 and he discovered a number of new species in that book.

189
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,000
 I think it was something like 25 species.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,840
 He also named 11 species of fish.

191
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,040
 This is one of the best revenge plots I've ever heard in my life because none of those

192
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,800
 fish exist, okay?

193
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
 Yeah.

194
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,160
 I think it was because the killer fish exists.

195
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
 Good point.

196
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,680
 You got all that.

197
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,040
 So he was basically, he was at his home and the guy who was writing the book on the fish

198
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,480
 came over to his house and while he was at his house, he was telling him about this book

199
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,400
 and how it's going to be the ultimate book on fish and while they were chatting, they saw

200
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,840
 a couple of bats fly in and the fish guy thought they were new species of bats or he was scared

201
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,280
 of bats were not quite sure but he immediately grabbed Ordebond's violin which was really

202
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,840
 expensive and smashed them against the bats and Ordebond was like, what but he was hosting

203
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
 this guy.

204
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,400
 So the guy sat back down and then he went, I know some fish that I've discovered that

205
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,120
 he should include into your book.

206
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
 And he went fantastic.

207
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
 What are they?

208
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,520
 He described them, he drew them, they went into the book and then he got outed for putting

209
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
 fake fish into his book.

210
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,920
 Isn't that the biggest, best revenge plot?

211
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
 Wow.

212
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
 Yeah.

213
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
 No way.

214
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
 Yeah.

215
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
 I was reading the other day.

216
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
 So hawk standing on shoulders.

217
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
 I was reading about monkeys.

218
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,880
 I was reading this book Sapiens and they worked together as well and they have this amazing

219
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
 thing.

220
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,840
 A language that zoologists have managed to isolate certain calls.

221
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,160
 So monkeys in isolation they'll send a call out and the call will say there's an eagle

222
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,880
 in the sky so all the monkeys look up to see if it's coming and then they'll play another

223
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,280
 signal which says there's a tiger on the way and so they all go up the tree but then they've

224
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,600
 discovered that some monkeys will be seeing another monkey with a banana and go there's

225
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,520
 a tiger and they'll leap up into a tree and they'll just take the banana.

226
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
 Oh.

227
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
 Yeah.

228
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
 So devious.

229
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
 Okay.

230
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,560
 On that, this is very, very cool.

231
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:48,560
 So mockingbirds make alarm calls when they see a hawk and iguanas listen to mockingbirds.

232
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,760
 They listen to a completely different species of animal and when the mockingbird makes an

233
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,800
 alarm call, the iguanas all run for it because the iguanas can't tell each other there's

234
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,360
 a hawk because they don't, they're silent, they don't communicate with each other.

235
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,400
 They're all not talking to each other but they just listen to the mockingbird.

236
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,080
 It's like one of those things when you're in a strop with someone so you make someone

237
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,000
 else communicate with them on your behalf.

238
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I'm not talking to him.

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 It's really sad.

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,920
 You can just imagine two iguanas facing each other and not able to say how they feel and

241
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
 you know.

242
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
 Yeah.

243
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,360
 If you swaps your eyes for a hawk, you'd be able to see an ant crawling on the ground from

244
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,280
 the roof of a ten-story building.

245
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
 Wow.

246
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,360
 So you'd be arrested immediately but I can see an animal that's still not getting around

247
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,720
 a lot of wildlife and just let you say.

248
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,360
 Well, they're thinking about doing laser eye surgery now to give us much better vision which

249
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,960
 I think is completely unnecessary aren't they?

250
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,600
 So hawks have like or eagles have 20 to 5 vision and they think they can get humans up

251
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,640
 to 2010 vision, which I don't really see the need.

252
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,880
 So a 20 to 5 vision means that something that I can see you that's 5 metres away, a hawk

253
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,760
 could be able to see that it's 20 metres away and they could see it with the same vision,

254
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
 right?

255
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,160
 So if James is on the top floor of his ten-story house and he's lost his pet ant, this

256
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,360
 will come in handy.

257
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,040
 Do you know that lobsters can regenerate their eyes but they can only do it a certain number

258
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,120
 of times and after they've done it that number of times, instead of regenerating an eye,

259
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,400
 they regenerate a limb.

260
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
 What?

261
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,960
 Do they regenerate the limb where the eye wants to lose?

262
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
 Wow.

263
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
 That's great, isn't it?

264
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
 That's insane.

265
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,000
 Do they know how many times they've got?

266
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I don't think they do.

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,440
 They probably don't even know their lobsters.

268
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:43,000
 Imagine shaking hands at somebody's eye with, I was trying to find your fact-hander because

269
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,120
 actually it's surprisingly hard to find that actual sentence on the internet that hawks

270
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,920
 stand on each other's shoulders and it was on a site where it's like there's a lot of

271
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,040
 sites here these days that are trying to educate children about everything and this was

272
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,960
 a super fun hawk page and there was a bunch of stuff about hawks and then it said extra

273
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:06,960
 fun facts and so the opening one was backstanding so they stand on each other, that was one and

274
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,600
 this is the second extra fun fact.

275
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,320
 They gather in large groups and congregate on the electrical transformers where they

276
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,560
 electrocuted to death.

277
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,760
 Science is fun!

278
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,600
 They are kind of the bad guys of the natural world hawks so people don't like them and a lot

279
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,880
 of people like this video online which you should all look up.

280
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,240
 Actually there are a few videos of smaller birds who are usually preyed upon by hawks, attacking

281
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,240
 a hawk so it was a mother-king bird and a hawk came a bit too near her nest and she jumps

282
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,980
 on the hawks back and grips onto his shoulders and then picks away at his forehead and the

283
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,800
 hawk flies through the air, nothing he can do.

284
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,300
 This is similar, I just read this the other day, that seagulls attack whales which is another

285
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:59,280
 kind of little thing against the country.

286
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,880
 You get seagulls and they go down and there is a whale that is near the surface and seagulls

287
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,040
 come down and grab a bit of flesh from the side of the whale.

288
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
 I know.

289
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,720
 Would whales ever deal with a flying animal?

290
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,880
 Would they get back down and tell a story like you won't believe what just happened up

291
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
 there?

292
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,200
 It was a thing literally in the air.

293
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,840
 It's like a really small flying whale up there.

294
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,440
 How do you know you are a whale?

295
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,000
 How do you know that a hawk is terrorising the people of Manchester at the moment?

296
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,120
 A massive bird named Stephen reported by the Manchester Evening News, the name Stephen

297
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,200
 by residents who hate him, I don't know why they have given him a name, who stands on

298
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,760
 street lights screeching at people, the massive bird named Stephen is known by experts for

299
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
 its intelligence.

300
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,040
 I think it means hawks generally are known for their intelligence, not Stephen specifically.

301
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,300
 But Stephanie Milling who lives just off Pollard Street in Manchester said, "It's been

302
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,580
 hunting and catching wood pigeons, but it keeps trying to get my cat."

303
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,380
 And I have a friend nearby who has pet rabbits, so we call each other every now and again saying

304
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,380
 Stephen's out.

305
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,540
 Get your rabbits in.

306
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,820
 James' ant farm is in serious, serious channel.

307
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,700
 We need to move on to the next fact, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

308
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
 Okay.

309
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,580
 My fact this week is that Pope Innocent the Eighth was given the nickname The Honest because

310
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:25,300
 he was the first Pope to acknowledge that he had illegitimate children.

311
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,380
 They should have called him Innocent the Smoothie.

312
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,380
 Oh!

313
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,380
 Come on.

314
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:35,300
 Those of you who have heard the podcast, you knew what you were coming from.

315
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,300
 So, north.

316
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,500
 Those of you who haven't, you can leave now.

317
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
 No refunds.

318
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:46,660
 So, in the old days, Innocent the Eighth was 15th century, so ages ago back in the days

319
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,340
 when he had very naughty popes and there was an amazing spell of naughty popes.

320
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,140
 It sounds like Andy's weather forecast will be having a spell of naughty popes.

321
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,820
 Not to get rabbit up.

322
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,020
 Pope Stephen is out.

323
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:09,540
 So, normally when popes had illegitimate children, and in the Renaissance and the Middle Ages

324
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,860
 the loads of them had illegitimate children, they would just say they were their nephews

325
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,620
 and nieces even though they clearly weren't.

326
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,700
 So, they used it to get them jobs.

327
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,780
 But Innocent the Eighth acknowledged this and then he still used his position to get his

328
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,780
 children jobs.

329
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,420
 He made his 13-year-old grandson a cardinal.

330
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,420
 Wow.

331
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,420
 Yeah.

332
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,900
 When I was looking him up, I looked at his Wikipedia page and you got a lot of links at the

333
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:38,660
 bottom to other related articles on Wikipedia and one of them led me to, "This is the title,

334
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,660
 "List of Sexually Active Popes."

335
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,900
 And it is a massive list.

336
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,860
 They were active, they were going for it.

337
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,860
 Yeah, they were.

338
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,860
 They were wild.

339
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,620
 So, this fact kind of reminds me of, like, I think that modern day or maybe it's always existed,

340
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,820
 elevating honesty way too high.

341
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,460
 So, that whole, I really want to be honest with you, I've shagged your dad.

342
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,460
 That kind of thing.

343
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,460
 Oh, sorry.

344
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,460
 No, sorry.

345
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,460
 That's it.

346
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,100
 Firstly, which is the 3 of us what you're speaking to.

347
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,180
 It was the plural you were talking about.

348
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,860
 I'm really sorry.

349
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:24,580
 The Wikipedia list, a list of that, I'll ask you.

350
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:30,780
 It just says, "Your, yours, yours."

351
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,660
 So, yeah, you don't need to know that.

352
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:38,340
 And in fact, there were popes who shagged, so Benedict IX was a particularly bad one who

353
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:46,660
 was responsible for copious bestiality, sort of me sponsoring all g's, sponsoring all g's.

354
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,900
 This all g is brought to you by the Pope.

355
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,220
 Have a good time.

356
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:03,340
 I'm just imagining, like, I'm thinking of having an orgy next week, would you mind sponsoring?

357
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,140
 You can get 10 p per.

358
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,460
 Benedict IX is amazing.

359
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,060
 He was Pope on three separate occasions.

360
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,420
 He became Pope at the age of, like, really, really young.

361
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,460
 Some sources say he was 11 when he became Pope.

362
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,780
 I can't quite, but there's a lot of propaganda, though, so may not have done.

363
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:21,780
 But he did sell the papacy to his godfather to raise money for his wedding, and then he

364
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,420
 got bored and decided, "No, actually, I'd like to be Pope again."

365
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,420
 Oh, yeah.

366
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,420
 He was crazy.

367
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,940
 I was reading through the list of popes, because there was a lot of them who share the same

368
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,940
 names, John.

369
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,140
 Pope John Paul is so on.

370
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,140
 Pope George Ringo.

371
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:42,500
 And there's, I mean, there's amazing names to start with.

372
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
 They're incredible names.

373
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,980
 My favourite one was Pope hilarious.

374
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,100
 That's an actual Pope.

375
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
 Pope hilarious.

376
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,740
 But did you look into Pope hilarious to see what hilarious things he did?

377
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,740
 Oh, he was so boring.

378
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,740
 I was desperate.

379
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,660
 I spent the majority of my research going, "Come on.

380
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,660
 One thing."

381
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:05,100
 The best thing I could find was he erected a chapel, a convent, and two public baths.

382
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
 Yeah, but you had to be there.

383
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
 It was hilarious.

384
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,420
 One of my favourite popes is Benedict XII.

385
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,620
 And what happened with him is the Cardinals, when they were deciding who was going to be Pope.

386
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,460
 What they would often do is, in the first round of votes, they would all vote for someone

387
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,860
 who's probably not going to become Pope because they're a bit rubbish.

388
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,700
 And then they would think, "Well, no one else will vote for them, and they'll see how the

389
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,340
 other Cardinals are voting."

390
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,020
 Unfortunately, everyone voted for Benedict XII.

391
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,020
 Was he good?

392
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:41,700
 Well, Pope John XII turned the Vatican or the papal palace into a hallhouse, apparently, committing

393
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,740
 adultery with numerous women that included his father's long-term girlfriend.

394
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,540
 And I like that because this is a 10th century, and I didn't know you had long-term girlfriends

395
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,540
 in the 10th century.

396
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,700
 I thought you were married, or you were single, too.

397
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,700
 Or dead.

398
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
 Or dead.

399
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,860
 Popular choice in the 10th century.

400
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,180
 And he invented the idea of long-term girlfriend, but never gets recognised for it because he

401
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,100
 was the Pope, and they were focusing on that bit of this story.

402
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:12,500
 I think, because a lot of these stories, I'm not sure, you know, there's a lot of sort

403
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
 of...

404
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,220
 There have been put in from the detractors of the public.

405
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,220
 And smearing of reputation.

406
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,220
 Yeah.

407
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,980
 So there's also the thing of, they might have been made up by an anti-Pope, who was not

408
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,100
 as you would think, a Pope made out of anti-matter.

409
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,740
 Or made out of anti-matter.

410
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,220
 Sort of a rival Pope who would set up a separate court elsewhere somewhere in France,

411
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,140
 or even somewhere in Italy, and say, "I'm the Pope."

412
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,060
 That's a bread-horrible rumours about the actual Pope.

413
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

414
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:45,100
 Although, like, celibacy in the church really didn't become the absolute norm for an

415
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,100
 extremely long time, until about two or three hundred years ago, and it's thought...

416
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,260
 So until, I think there's a council of Trent ruling in 1563 that really said, seriously,

417
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,900
 you have to stop having sex.

418
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,620
 We've been saying this for 1,500 years, no one's listened.

419
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,900
 But they kept on doing it, and actually the reason that that eventually passed in the

420
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,020
 council of Trent, the reason that members of the clergy in the Catholic church can't

421
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,380
 have sex, is because there were so many other legitimate children, and they were taking

422
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,260
 the church property and passing it on to their children, so it was going out of the church

423
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,820
 because they'd be like, "I guess this church is mine, I'll just give it to my son."

424
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,020
 And so the church was like, "Well, we've got to stop this, we've got to keep our property."

425
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,020
 And so they said, "Sorry, you're not allowed to have sex."

426
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,540
 But Protestants were very pro-sex at the time.

427
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:34,220
 So Martin Luther, who sort of founder of the Reformation, thought that it was really bad,

428
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,340
 the whole celibacy vowsing because it encouraged masturbation.

429
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:42,260
 And as he said, Martin Luther, founder of, I guess, the Protestant church, if it doesn't

430
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,220
 go into a woman, it goes into your shirt.

431
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,220
 What?

432
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,940
 And we can't be having that.

433
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,620
 It was before the invention of the tissue, so...

434
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,020
 Life's that's a terrible sentence.

435
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,420
 It sounds a bit like the start of a song.

436
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,900
 Yeah, if it doesn't go into a woman, man.

437
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
 That might...

438
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,900
 Like God, no one else.

439
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,900
 Old together.

440
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,940
 I was very quickly looking into, so he was called "The Honest" as a sort of nickname.

441
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,460
 And I love history's nicknames, Ivan the Terrible, so on "Jone of Arc."

442
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,460
 Does that work?

443
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,420
 But my favourite one, this is a king.

444
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,940
 Louis, the unavoidable.

445
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:36,300
 There's a much it's saying a bit of party, I don't know.

446
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,900
 He's coming over.

447
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,900
 He's coming over.

448
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,900
 He's coming over.

449
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
 Oh, Louis.

450
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,900
 Hi.

451
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,900
 Hi.

452
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,900
 Hi.

453
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,900
 My good.

454
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
 You're still king?

455
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,900
 Oh, yeah.

456
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
 Oh, yeah.

457
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,180
 All right, I'm going to move us on to our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

458
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:59,780
 My fact this week is that Spanish construction workers recently accidentally destroyed a 6,000-year-old

459
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:05,140
 neolithic tomb that looked like a picnic table and replaced it with a new and better-looking

460
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:10,140
 picnic table.

461
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,740
 And it's incredible.

462
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,740
 You can see the photo.

463
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,380
 So the photo is of a stone, sort of, it looks like a big table with surrounding chairs.

464
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,300
 So, I mean, they're full, really.

465
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,100
 And then they've replaced it and the new one says--

466
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,060
 Well, I'm sorry, therefore, the neolithic people's full of making them tomb like a picnic table.

467
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,060
 OK, when you say like that, I'm going to retract that statement.

468
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,060
 But you look at the new picture and it's this really nice-looking picnic table.

469
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,420
 I mean, actually, it's actually really nice.

470
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,980
 What happened is they didn't know that it was a heritage site property, and they saw

471
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,740
 it and just thought, oh, the poor people here, they want to have a nice picnic.

472
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,940
 So I was supposed to do something good for them, and then got in serious trouble by ruining

473
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,940
 it.

474
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,140
 I read that one local architect said it was probably due to a miscommunication because

475
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,660
 it was the summer holiday.

476
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
 So tragic.

477
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,340
 And also in the summer holiday is demand for picnic tables, rockets.

478
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,340
 Yes.

479
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,140
 So they did this global survey, global.

480
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,660
 They did in China of the Great Wall of China, and what they found was there was a huge

481
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,660
 missing chunk of the Great Wall of China, and they had no idea where it went.

482
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,900
 And the town, just down the road, someone must have gone.

483
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,980
 I found this wall full of bricks.

484
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,380
 They built a whole town out of the Great Wall of China.

485
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,380
 Wow.

486
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,380
 Yeah, it's incredible.

487
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,740
 That is the only town you can see from space.

488
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,380
 A man in central Ohio has been arrested for having sex with a picnic table.

489
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,660
 Here's Andy with the weather.

490
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,220
 He would stand the small metal table on its side and use the whole where the umbrella

491
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,860
 should be to have sex.

492
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:43,260
 Ah, it can't be a happy experience.

493
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,700
 Perhaps this is more common amongst certain parts of society than we think, because there's

494
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,900
 actually a man in Tennessee as well who was arrested for the same thing, and he was arrested.

495
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,500
 So he was initially arrested, a 49 year old man, because he was making an unusual deposit

496
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,340
 at the ATM nearby, so attempting to copulate with the ATM.

497
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:05,740
 What was wrong with this shirt?

498
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,660
 I cannot think of which bit of an ATM.

499
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,220
 With a gun to my head, I would pick.

500
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,500
 I haven't done it, but obviously.

501
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,340
 Obviously, it arrived, and they took him outside of the bank, and sat him on a picnic table

502
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,140
 and went back into the office.

503
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,820
 And another guy came and went, "Sorry, are you using this?"

504
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:33,820
 Because I thought it was bad when wasps turned up at a picnic.

505
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,100
 I've been getting lucky all these years.

506
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:46,500
 On speaking of things that have been ruined, your ears, ladies and gentlemen.

507
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,820
 So I read a story about John Lennon, and when he used to, he had a period, which was known

508
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,860
 as the Lost Weekend, longer than a weekend, but it's where he just went absolutely off the

509
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,860
 rail.

510
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,860
 He was doing lots of drugs.

511
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:05,220
 He was being all night long in all over LA, and he stayed at Hugh Hefner's house for a party,

512
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,540
 and he didn't stay there, so he was out of party.

513
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,860
 And while he was there, he was so drunk and he was smoking a cigarette.

514
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,980
 He didn't have anywhere to put the cigarette out on.

515
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,740
 So he decided the matease that was hanging on the wall would be the nice spot for it.

516
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,620
 So he stubbed his cigarette into this matease.

517
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,220
 So all the bouncers, bodyguards of Hugh Hefner's playboy mansions immediately grabbed him

518
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,740
 to throw him out.

519
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,300
 Hugh Hefner went, no, no, no, no, no, stop, stop, it's fine.

520
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,300
 It's fine.

521
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,300
 Did you see what he just did?

522
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,260
 I didn't see, I just heard about it, but guys, John Lennon just stubbed the cigarette out

523
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,260
 on my matease.

524
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,460
 That is probably worth double the amount of money now that you were there, but take around

525
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,460
 the whole house.

526
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,180
 I've got a Picasso in the back room.

527
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,460
 I mean, that's quite cool when value is added through destruction.

528
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,460
 Yeah.

529
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,460
 Wow.

530
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,900
 On other things, being accidentally destroyed, bungling builders as they refer to you when they

531
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:59,620
 mess up, accidentally destroyed the wrong house in Cumbria, destroyed a woman's home instead

532
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,620
 of the dilapidated house a few streets away.

533
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,420
 Contractors were supposed to demolish another house, 500 yards away and another street, but

534
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,180
 set to work on Mrs. Beatty's home without checking they had the right address.

535
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:16,180
 Thomas Armstrong, construction limited, admits they got it wrong, but Mrs. Beatty is still

536
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,580
 considering legal action.

537
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:25,100
 Mrs. Beatty, when will you end this, then doubt her?

538
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:31,620
 In 2013, there was a pair of Peruvian real estate companies which destroyed a pyramid, a small

539
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,620
 one.

540
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,460
 It was six meters high, but nonetheless, it was a pyramid and it was 4,000 years old as

541
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,460
 well.

542
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,700
 And the companies workers tried to destroy three more pyramids before people who are

543
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,900
 on looking stop them.

544
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,900
 Okay, get this.

545
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:49,260
 In the same year, 2013, another construction company in Belize, bulldozed one of the largest

546
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,180
 Mayan pyramids in the country.

547
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,780
 It was 30 meters tall and they did it just to get crushed rock for road building.

548
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,700
 And the head of the Belize Institute of Archaeology said at the time, these guys knew that this

549
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,940
 was an ancient structure.

550
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,180
 It's just bloody laziness.

551
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:08,460
 It just couldn't be bothered to go and get other rock from elsewhere that wasn't a pyramid.

552
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,580
 The rock shop was 19 miles away.

553
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,580
 Yeah.

554
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,500
 And this happens all the time, that sort of, you know, small pyramids in Central and South

555
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
 America get demolished.

556
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,500
 Really?

557
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
 Yeah.

558
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,260
 One of Shakespeare's houses, and I think it was his most famous house.

559
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:26,500
 The guy who owned it was so annoyed of people coming and knocking on his door that he just

560
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
 knocked it down.

561
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
 Yeah, he was.

562
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,500
 It's all weird response.

563
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
 It's all weird.

564
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,660
 It's called the Reverend Gastro-Lor Gaskell or something like that, yeah.

565
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,820
 And he lived there and people just kept going past going, oh, Shakespeare's house and he's

566
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,820
 like, no, I've had enough of that.

567
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,980
 It's not that big of a position, is it?

568
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,980
 Yeah.

569
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,980
 Also, move.

570
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,980
 Yeah.

571
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,980
 Seriously.

572
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,460
 And he had to, because he got driven out of the town, I think.

573
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,460
 Yeah, he did, yeah.

574
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,540
 And also he destroyed his house, so he would have had to move.

575
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,340
 We're going to have to wrap up very soon.

576
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,900
 I'm just a quick thing on picnics.

577
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,900
 Yeah, of course.

578
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,940
 I looked up, you know, this is no picnic.

579
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,620
 It took 190 years after the first French use of the word picnic before we got the phrase,

580
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,620
 this is no picnic.

581
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:09,540
 So I just like to imagine that people were having a constant picnic for 190 years.

582
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:14,180
 There's this common misconception that the word picnic, the etymology, is racist.

583
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,300
 It's one of those like internet rumors that started about the year 2000 that actually a picnic

584
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,540
 used to be where you'd go to watch like lynching of slaves, which just isn't true.

585
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:27,260
 So in the year 2000, the University of Albany, they wanted to organize, the university wanted

586
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,620
 to organize a picnic, a big celebratory picnic for the students.

587
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,220
 But they were told that it would offend people because it was a racist term.

588
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,860
 So instead, they decided we'll call it an outing.

589
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,420
 And then they were written to an informer.

590
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,580
 This would offend people because it was a homophobic term.

591
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:50,340
 And so eventually the picnic was publicised without a title.

592
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,340
 I didn't know this.

593
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,260
 Just on picnics and picnics tables Paris, the way Paris celebrated the millennium was by having

594
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,220
 a 600 mile long picnic.

595
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,220
 Wow.

596
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,220
 Wow, really?

597
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,620
 Imagine being that guy who found picnics table sexually attractive turns up in Paris that

598
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,620
 weekend.

599
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,540
 And he's gone to Paris to get away from the picnics tables.

600
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:12,260
 Finally, a new life under the review identity.

601
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,540
 Oh my god.

602
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,540
 Wow.

603
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,180
 Okay, I'm going to wrap us up.

604
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,180
 Okay, that's it.

605
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,180
