00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
 (horn honking)

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,420
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,460
 (horn honking in foreign language)

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,460
 (horn honking in foreign language)

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,040
 (upbeat music)

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,740
 - Hello and welcome to another episode.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,820
 No such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,140
 coming to you from the QI office in Covent Garden.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,140
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray and I'm sitting here

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,100
 with James Harkin, Anna Teginski,

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,380
 and our special guest this week is Carrie Lloyd.

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,020
 Carrie Ad is a comedian we all know.

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,900
 She's been on QI a load of times.

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,500
 She's in an improvised show called ostentatious,

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,140
 which is Jane Austen based improvised comedy with me.

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,060
 And she also is the presenter and host

17
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,480
 and producer and everything of the podcast grief cast,

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,580
 which is about grief and about people you've lost,

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,300
 but it's also very uplifting and charming

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,460
 and funny and wonderful.

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,500
 So do give that a listen.

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,380
 Okay, starting with fact number one this week,

23
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,180
 and that is Carrie Lloyd.

24
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,460
 My fact is that Unity Mittford was the only person

25
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,340
 to be BFFs with Churchill and Hitler.

26
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,180
 - She was best friends forever,

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,380
 just for any 80s kids in the room.

28
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,260
 - Yeah, she was definitely best buddies,

29
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,260
 Bezzies with Hitler.

30
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,140
 She was very Bezzies with Hitler.

31
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,260
 But she was also very old family friends with Churchill.

32
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,420
 And at some point, just before war broke out,

33
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,580
 so she was living in Germany,

34
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,340
 basically completely in Hitler's inner circle.

35
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,180
 She was completely there.

36
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,860
 She used to write to her friend Winston

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,860
 and beg him very regularly to make peace with Hitler,

38
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,020
 because she really believed in both countries.

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,660
 Now, caveat, yes, she was a massive fascist, obviously.

40
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,660
 Not my saying I love her,

41
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,180
 but she did really believe that England and Germany

42
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,740
 could work together and become this incredible superpower.

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,100
 And she always said, if they go to war, I'll kill myself.

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,180
 I'll kill because these are my two greatest sides of my country.

45
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,620
 And spoiler alert, the moment war broke out,

46
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,980
 she went into a park and she shot herself in the head.

47
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,820
 But spoiler spoiler alert.

48
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,740
 It didn't work.

49
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,460
 She survived with the bullet in her head.

50
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,140
 Wow.

51
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,300
 But then she did also die due to an infection.

52
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,500
 But much later, much, much later.

53
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,020
 So Hitler, her BFF, when she did shoot herself in her head,

54
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,260
 Hitler felt so bad, obviously it was his fault.

55
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,580
 Hashtag, you caused the war.

56
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,700
 He arranged for a train to take her to Switzerland

57
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,460
 and then her mother.

58
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,020
 And I think it was Debo, the young sister, came and got her.

59
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,340
 But he, you know, wars breaking out,

60
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,460
 everyone's leaving countries.

61
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,500
 Hitler made sure that she got out of Germany

62
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,300
 and he knew she was going back to Britain.

63
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,980
 And he funded her healthcare in Germany.

64
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,540
 It's very easy to accidentally read the story and go,

65
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,540
 oh, that's quite nice.

66
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,540
 I know, yes.

67
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,940
 I know, again, he was a massive fascist,

68
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,380
 but also, I think he was quite big into it.

69
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,140
 He was one of the worst, I would say.

70
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,980
 You know, there's a theory about Hitler funding all this.

71
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,740
 So the theory is that her sister, Deborah and her mother,

72
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,740
 took her home after she tried to kill herself.

73
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,860
 She then recuperated at a little nursing home in a village

74
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,180
 called Wiggington in Oxfordshire.

75
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,180
 The home was a maternity home.

76
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,180
 This.

77
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
 And there is a story--

78
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,180
 This is rubbish.

79
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,380
 --there is a story from the woman who ran the home

80
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,660
 that she may have had a baby.

81
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,900
 And the baby had a tiny mustache.

82
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,220
 That was a massive fascist.

83
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,900
 Yeah, and so the journalist who wrote about this,

84
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,340
 she asked the woman who she thought the father might be.

85
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,580
 And she said, well, my mother always said, it was Hitler's.

86
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,420
 Although there is no record of this happening,

87
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,380
 so it's probable there is not a secret Hitler love child.

88
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,180
 But they definitely copped off, didn't they?

89
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,860
 No, also, that's a good--

90
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,380
 Yeah, there's a lot of-- like, it was very suspicious.

91
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,100
 In the inner circle, all the Germans hated her.

92
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,540
 They were like, there's this British woman

93
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,460
 who Hitler literally-- she would advise him

94
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,900
 and wind him up on stuff.

95
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,260
 And she was extremely jealous of Eva Braun, as well.

96
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,060
 And Eva Braun was very jealous of her, though, right?

97
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,980
 Yeah, so Unity definitely was another thing.

98
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,060
 But what I read seems to be that nothing happened,

99
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,620
 basically, he was kind of using her,

100
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,980
 because she was extremely useful.

101
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,300
 And the other weird thing about Unity

102
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,100
 is her middle name was Valkyrie, Unity Valkyrie Mittford.

103
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,500
 And she was born in the town of Swastika.

104
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,340
 So weird.

105
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,180
 So weird.

106
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,220
 And so it said that he was very superstitious.

107
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,940
 And it was said when he found this stuff out about her.

108
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,380
 And she was a six-foot blonde, blue-eyed woman

109
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,540
 that he kind of felt like she was very lucky.

110
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,580
 But apparently, there was no way they ever slept together,

111
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,140
 but she definitely would have.

112
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,700
 And she used to kind of hang out with other fascists.

113
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,500
 And she slept with Churchill.

114
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,060
 No, but her sister, Deca, was married to Esmond Romney,

115
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,580
 who the big room it is that he was Churchill's secret son.

116
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,700
 And it was all sort of hidden, though.

117
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,700
 He was actually a nephew.

118
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,580
 But yeah, I thought Churchill was quite happily married, though.

119
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,180
 It's not like that massive fascist Hitler.

120
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,340
 So this town of Swastika is in Ontario.

121
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,020
 Yes.

122
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,500
 And they wanted to change the name during the war to Winston,

123
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,900
 because of obvious reasons.

124
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,380
 And they even did it, I think.

125
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,820
 Or at least they got pretty close.

126
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,060
 But then everyone who was living there said no.

127
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,980
 And so they took down all the new signs.

128
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,900
 And they said no.

129
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,620
 We were called Swastika before Hitler came along.

130
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,140
 We came with the idea first.

131
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,700
 Why should we change our names?

132
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,100
 And they were named after the symbol,

133
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,820
 which was a good luck symbol, is it Hindi?

134
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,940
 Or Hinduism.

135
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,980
 Yeah, Hinduism.

136
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,340
 So that's where they're beforehand.

137
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,060
 It doesn't have a fact about that guy--

138
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,740
 I think possibly also in Canada, who

139
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,100
 was called Adolf Hitler.

140
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,900
 And it was asked if you're going to change your name.

141
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,060
 And he said, I'm not going to let one guy ruin the name.

142
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,940
 And he didn't change his name.

143
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,220
 Then they were amazing family.

144
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,460
 Yeah, there literally isn't one of them

145
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,700
 that wasn't somehow involved in something.

146
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,460
 So Unity was-- well, they were all bizarre, but she was bizarre.

147
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,660
 So she said that her and her sister grew up,

148
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,620
 her to be a fascist, her sister, one of her sisters,

149
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,820
 that could be a communist.

150
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,020
 And she said that they used to scratch--

151
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,420
 she would scratch Swastika, and her sister

152
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,420
 would scratch Hammer and Sickle into the window of the bedroom

153
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,580
 that they shared together, and the scratch was still there.

154
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,420
 And so they really pursued their dreams.

155
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,500
 There was an article in The Guardian about how

156
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
 they're kind of inspiring in a twisted way.

157
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
 Because she was like, I'm in love with Hitler.

158
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,780
 I'm going to go track them down.

159
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,300
 And she didn't.

160
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,060
 She went to Germany.

161
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,260
 And she sat in a cafe that he frequented.

162
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,580
 She sat there every day.

163
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,260
 Yeah, she sat there every single day.

164
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,780
 Until eventually, he was like, who's

165
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,820
 that six-foot-blown woman that keeps staring at me?

166
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,020
 And that's how she got to know him.

167
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,860
 And apparently, she told-- she wrote to Decker and said,

168
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,700
 this is my plan, like any good obsessed teenager.

169
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,940
 This is how I'm going to get him.

170
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,780
 And so her and Decker, Jessica Mittford, shared a room,

171
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,300
 and they had a chalk line down the middle of the room.

172
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,180
 And at one end was a bust of Lenin,

173
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,860
 and the other end was a picture of Hitler.

174
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,860
 Wow.

175
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,500
 But they were obviously still sisters

176
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,940
 and loved each other very much.

177
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,540
 And then completely opposite.

178
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,500
 But obviously, growing up in exactly the same household.

179
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,380
 Do you think maybe, like, sometimes brothers and sisters

180
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,220
 go against their brothers and sisters, right?

181
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,620
 Yeah.

182
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,940
 Well, if you read any of the Mittford stuff,

183
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,260
 there's an amazing biography by Mary S. Lovell,

184
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,660
 which is the best Mittford S. want to be, which

185
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,860
 says that they all of them had these incredibly obsessive

186
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,420
 personalities and filled them with--

187
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,900
 so either fascism or communism, or Pam,

188
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,820
 who was obsessed with farming.

189
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,420
 She's all the best, yeah.

190
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,420
 Pam is the one that--

191
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:58,940
 Pam's the one that--

192
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,180
 Pam's the one that everyone forgets.

193
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,780
 But she introduced a new breed of chicken into this country.

194
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,100
 Yeah, so--

195
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,300
 And Pam apparently was quite a wit.

196
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,020
 And like, Evelyn Moore was in love with her.

197
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,940
 But the only people who had her jokes were the chickens.

198
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,780
 Yeah, exactly.

199
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,940
 They were sad.

200
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,900
 With her six.

201
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,420
 So there was--

202
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,420
 Yeah.

203
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,380
 And there's a brother who died in the war.

204
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,660
 And then you have Nancy, who was a very famous writer, Diana,

205
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,620
 who obviously also being a bit fascist.

206
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,500
 They do not--

207
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 I don't know if you're well on that list.

208
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,580
 The mistress of Oswald Mosley, head of the bridge.

209
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,660
 She was the wife, the wife of eventual wife of Oswald Mosley.

210
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,500
 Well, I was just referring to the courting effect.

211
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,340
 She was the only famously said Hitler had beautiful blue eyes.

212
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,380
 Oh, yeah.

213
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,100
 Did she tell Stephen Fry this?

214
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,780
 Well, Stephen--

215
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,140
 Actually, he mentioned that on QI.

216
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,660
 Yeah.

217
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,060
 He says that-- Stephen Fry says that she said to him,

218
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,100
 of course, you never met Hitler, did you?

219
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,300
 [LAUGHTER]

220
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,540
 She was an incredible woman, Diana.

221
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,820
 And she was said to be the most beautiful woman of her age.

222
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,140
 Like, men were literally falling over.

223
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,780
 And then she married a Guinness, and had an affair,

224
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,420
 not a pine-egg in his mouth, and then had an affair with Oswald

225
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,620
 Mosley, and then ended up marrying him.

226
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,980
 And then went to prison, right?

227
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,460
 Went to prison.

228
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,560
 And she was the only-- during the war they

229
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,460
 were interred.

230
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,620
 And she and another woman were allowed their husbands

231
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,420
 in Holloway prison.

232
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,420
 So she was in Holloway women's prison.

233
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,860
 And then Oswald was allowed to join up.

234
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,580
 Because Churchill said that was OK.

235
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,780
 Because he was mates with the family.

236
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,700
 And Nancy Metford was famous for doing the upper class

237
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,020
 and lower class rights in Kingston.

238
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,420
 You and non-You were the famous essay she wrote about.

239
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,460
 So great ways.

240
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,020
 What things show you off as being posh on not posh, right?

241
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,420
 Yes.

242
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,420
 Have you got to test for us?

243
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,580
 I couldn't do one.

244
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,140
 How do you pronounce the word, which

245
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,980
 refers to a large cat with a mane?

246
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,500
 Lion?

247
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
 Lion?

248
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,980
 No.

249
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,980
 Not posh, not posh.

250
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,820
 Oh, no.

251
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,900
 Lion?

252
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,700
 Oh, you're pretty posh, isn't it?

253
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,860
 I'm putting it on, I'm picking it.

254
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,980
 It rhymes with barn.

255
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
 Apparently, lawn.

256
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
 Lawn, yeah.

257
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,260
 How do you pronounce the game, which I like to play,

258
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,740
 where I hit little balls around with a stick in a field?

259
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,060
 Golf.

260
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,860
 Goof.

261
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,260
 Goof.

262
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,100
 Goof.

263
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,100
 Goof.

264
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,700
 Oh, yeah, goof.

265
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,500
 Who's it, goof?

266
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,580
 Like Darren Goff.

267
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,260
 Go and play a game of golf.

268
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,820
 Oh, wow.

269
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,980
 There was a study recently that found

270
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,900
 the queen has become less posh over the course of her reign.

271
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,860
 As in, if you listen to her vowels from 1953, she's still quite posh.

272
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,100
 She's still quite posh, though.

273
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,100
 Not as posh, though.

274
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,860
 If you listen to the older recordings, it's almost like--

275
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,900
 But that's her accent is less posh.

276
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,100
 She still lives in a massive family.

277
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,020
 She hasn't kept it real recently, yeah.

278
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,420
 But she talks quite straight, I think, as what we're saying.

279
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,220
 She lives in a palace, but she talks pretty straight.

280
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,300
 She says BFF.

281
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
 Yeah.

282
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,580
 But wasn't the non-new you thing part of it

283
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,420
 was about that thing where people who want to be posh put on posh words?

284
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,020
 So things like Serviette instead of napkin.

285
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,660
 So it wasn't about telling the posh from the working class.

286
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,540
 It was about telling the posh from the middle class who wanted to be you.

287
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,460
 The really posh don't say the posh word.

288
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:59,620
 They just call it a napkin, whereas the social climber says the Serviette.

289
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,140
 Exactly.

290
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,820
 What you call it a mouth face wipe, but like that.

291
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,660
 It's just a plain old weirdo.

292
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,180
 Yeah, Nancy was very like a Serbic and witty about.

293
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,820
 So she was sort of taking the piss out of people.

294
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,540
 There was a lot of piss taking involve, wasn't there?

295
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,380
 Yeah.

296
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,900
 Apparently a gentleman, when he's drunk, may become amorous or mordlin

297
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:24,100
 or vomit in public, but he would never become truculent.

298
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,940
 That's how you know Andy's so common.

299
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,820
 Regularly truculent.

300
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,780
 Fighty, fighty.

301
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

302
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:38,100
 OK, it's time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

303
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,060
 My fact this week is that in the 1920s, doctors prescribed intentionally terrifying flights

304
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,060
 and aeroplanes to cure deafness.

305
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,060
 That's true.

306
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,700
 Why did they think that that would, what was their reason?

307
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,420
 Well, I would think maybe because it makes your ears pop.

308
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,060
 Yeah, but likes it that.

309
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,060
 It was not that.

310
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,620
 No, it was the shock factor.

311
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,980
 So it actually, it actually started with someone who couldn't speak.

312
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,380
 It was an Army serviceman who I think lost the ability to speak during the First World War.

313
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,300
 And this is in 1921, this doctor called Charles McInerney said it was a psychological problem

314
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,940
 and that the solution would be going into a plane and being treated to a series of loop

315
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,220
 the loops and nose dives and spins and things that made him think he was going to die.

316
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,380
 And lo and behold, he took this prescription, he did it.

317
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,220
 He stepped off the plane and he said, I don't know if I can speak anymore.

318
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,340
 And it turned out he could because he said that.

319
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,940
 And then it started being touted as a cure for everything.

320
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,940
 Including deafness.

321
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,020
 So, deaf flights were a thing that was quite commonly prescribed.

322
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:41,140
 And Charles Lindbergh, very famous obviously aviator on his business card, he had deaf flights

323
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,180
 as one of the things that he offered to really take deaf people up.

324
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,860
 The idea was that people might have suffered from these things for psychological reasons.

325
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,180
 You were saying that you were a shell shocky kind of thing.

326
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,180
 Yeah.

327
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,500
 So were they take, yeah, was it only if you develop deafness or was it more like, oh,

328
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,900
 I'd been deaf since birth?

329
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
 There were some people who were deaf since birth.

330
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:06,220
 So for example, in 1930, there was a boxer called Fred Mayhem, his nickname was Dummy, which

331
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,780
 is a cruel nickname because he'd been deaf since the edge of eight months.

332
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,780
 Oh my God.

333
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,780
 So he took a flight in 1930.

334
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,380
 It was designed to cure his hearing.

335
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,380
 It was designed to cure his hearing with a parachute jump that he was going to take out

336
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,900
 of the plane, okay?

337
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,500
 In front of a crowd of thousands, the parachute failed to open.

338
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
 Oh my God.

339
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 And he died.

340
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,740
 Where's the happy ending, Andy?

341
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,460
 Probably in the next factor, I'm afraid.

342
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,940
 And sometimes people did die.

343
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:36,220
 The idea also was that it had to be a surprise, so the patients were told that.

344
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,220
 Where are we going?

345
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,140
 Don't worry, just put on this backpack.

346
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,180
 They were told they were just going in a flight because it was the altitude that cured

347
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,180
 the deafness.

348
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,180
 Right.

349
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,260
 And then they'd go up in the flight and then it would be a horrible shock when you suddenly

350
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,900
 started nose diving towards the ground or spinning around in circles because obviously

351
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,500
 if you knew it was going to happen, then the cure wasn't going to be effective.

352
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,260
 Have you heard about this flight that happened in, well, when did I have, in 1969 with Alan

353
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,260
 Funt?

354
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,260
 Have you heard this before?

355
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,500
 I don't think I've ever heard the word Alan Funt before.

356
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
 Alan Funt.

357
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
 I remember.

358
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,780
 He was the host of a prank show in America that was like absolutely massive, kind of like

359
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,900
 candid camera sort of, you know, it was called candid camera.

360
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
 I feel like a fuck.

361
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,900
 What a fuck.

362
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,700
 Alan Funt hosted candid camera, which is like the original you've been framed.

363
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,660
 And he was hugely, hugely famous as much as, I would say, Jamie Beatles in his day.

364
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,140
 And he was on a flight with his family and they had a camera crew because they were going

365
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,100
 to film like this new prank show and it got taken hostage.

366
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,820
 So the plane, a guy stands up and it was at the time apparently there was loads of this

367
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,980
 happening and they were just constantly in '96 and being taken to Cuba.

368
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,500
 It was like quite fashionable.

369
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,020
 So everyone starts panicking.

370
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,380
 Then some of the passengers see Alan Funt and go, oh, it's a prank.

371
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,020
 And it wasn't a prank.

372
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,540
 So Alan Funt standing up and he's like, it's not a prank, which obviously is what Alan

373
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,900
 Funt would do if it was a prank.

374
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,500
 So the whole plane starts laughing and relaxing because they think it's a prank.

375
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,140
 And I think they even got flown to Cuba and they were on the ground for like five hours

376
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,260
 with everyone really relaxing king in a minute.

377
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,940
 Yeah, it seems like the whole plane thinking in a minute the camera's going to come out.

378
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,940
 We're going to laugh.

379
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,940
 And they were winding him up the whole time and he was with his wife and child.

380
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,220
 And the daughter has recounted it and said like they just thought he was getting more and

381
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,940
 more frustrated and upset because no one would believe it.

382
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,940
 Well, the hijacker.

383
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,940
 No, Alan Funt.

384
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,820
 Eventually Funt hijacked the plane and he stopped.

385
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,820
 Yeah.

386
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,180
 Tied me to anywhere apart from Cuba.

387
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,180
 It did happen a lot.

388
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,660
 I remember Andy had a fact where there was a guy who said, take me to Cuba, but the flight

389
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,660
 was already going to.

390
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,660
 Oh, yeah.

391
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,660
 Oh, my God.

392
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,060
 That's a book of parakeet, failures, classic that one.

393
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,060
 Yeah.

394
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,060
 Charles Lindbergh.

395
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,060
 Oh, yeah.

396
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,860
 One of his other specialities listed on his business card, which is an amazing business

397
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,860
 card, by the way, including death lights.

398
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,580
 One of the other things he offered was a plane change in mid air.

399
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
 Yeah.

400
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,100
 This was a trick in early aerial circuses where you would just climb out of the plane you

401
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,260
 were in or flying and climb into another plane next to you.

402
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,420
 That's, would you do that if you're traveling and you do it for an exchange or is it a trick?

403
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,420
 It's a trick, right?

404
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,420
 I was concerned.

405
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,740
 If anyone changing your flight was in the old days, if anyone from Ryanair is listening,

406
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,500
 they will be considering that.

407
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,540
 He was a real dead devil in some way.

408
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,500
 So Lindbergh, he did New York to Paris in 1924.

409
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,340
 I did not know this thing about it.

410
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,140
 He had to get rid of all non-essential equipment, make the plane as light as possible.

411
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,220
 So he took out all non-essential equipment and then he put a big fuel tank on the front

412
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,580
 of the plane so he could have as much fuel as he needed.

413
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,260
 Unfortunately, that meant he could not see out in front of him.

414
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,260
 No.

415
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,260
 I'm not even kidding.

416
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,260
 Oh, my God.

417
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,380
 To see out of the plane in front of him, he had a few options.

418
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,540
 He installed a periscope in the cockpit.

419
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,540
 Oh, my God.

420
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,780
 He also sometimes just had to open the right hand door to peek out the front.

421
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,780
 Oh, my God.

422
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,260
 And his final option was just to turn the plane sideways for a bit.

423
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,260
 That's how I drive.

424
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,260
 It does work.

425
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,260
 It does.

426
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,260
 But, yeah, aerial acrobatics was super popular in the 1920s.

427
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,020
 It was this very specific phase because a lot of people learned to fly in the First World

428
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,740
 War and then they realized they could make a living out of it.

429
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,100
 And barn storming, it was called, and it became this very popular thing.

430
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,980
 And I can't tell if it was, I think the etymology of it is vaguely unclear.

431
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,420
 It's either because people would often do these amazing aerial acrobatics in, like, fields.

432
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,940
 And people would stand by a barn and watch.

433
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,380
 But also quite a common trick they'd do is to fly through a barn.

434
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,020
 So they'd open the doors of the barn, and then you had to fly your plane through the barn

435
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,020
 and come out the other end.

436
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,180
 It's not where the trope of bursting into a barn, and then you burst out the other end

437
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,700
 and all the chickens, you know, flapping around, madly.

438
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,820
 The trope, you know, it happens in every show.

439
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,420
 It's a sign-failed run into a barn.

440
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,420
 It happens less than a pun that's showing.

441
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:51,260
 But is that obviously where the word barn store, it was a real barn store, man?

442
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,260
 I think it is.

443
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,220
 I've seen videos of them flying through, and I'm sure that must be where it comes from.

444
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,380
 Yeah, it must be.

445
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,380
 Yeah.

446
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,060
 I think they played some stunt games of tennis on plates.

447
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,060
 No, oh my gosh.

448
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
 On the wings.

449
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,060
 On the wings?

450
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,060
 From one wing to another, there are a few photos of people doing, oh, it's wing-walking.

451
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,660
 You know, normally you're just sort of discreetly strapped to the plane.

452
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,780
 You're not standing completely free because obviously you'd immediately fall off.

453
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,860
 Does that mean you had to hit the ball ahead of where the person was at this eye?

454
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,460
 I mean, how does physics work, aren't they?

455
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:26,180
 I think the person who really suffers is the ballboy.

456
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,780
 There's a guy called Omar Locklear, who was a 20s stunt pilot.

457
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,740
 I think was the first person to fly from one plane to another in mid-air, possibly.

458
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,740
 Sorry.

459
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,740
 Fly from one plane to another.

460
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,740
 Sorry, climb.

461
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,380
 He launched a smaller plane out of the window of a John Hood jet.

462
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,660
 That's incredible.

463
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,780
 So Omar Locklear was a stunt pilot in the 20s in a film called The Great Air Robbery.

464
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,300
 His one stunt he did, he climbed down from a plane to a speeding car, fought the baddie

465
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,620
 for a bit, kicked the baddie out of the car, then he grabbed the plane's undercarriage

466
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,300
 and climbed back into it as the car overturned and crashed.

467
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,860
 You should never climb back into someone's undercarriage.

468
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,860
 It's very weird.

469
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,060
 Do you know another old cure for deafness around about this time?

470
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:16,540
 The 1920s and before was to make your own artificial eardrum or have an artificial eardrum inserted.

471
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,540
 You could order them.

472
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
 I was going to say online.

473
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:24,740
 They sent you things that were of a made of else claw or pig's bladder or fishbone or something

474
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,940
 called gold beater's skin, which I didn't know about, but your dad probably would, Andy,

475
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,340
 because it's in used in the gold leaf making process and apparently it's animal intestine.

476
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,420
 Anyway, you put this on a little stick and you put it in your ear and it apparently replaced

477
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
 your eardrum.

478
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:46,420
 It didn't work, but it was invented in 1853 or pioneered by a doctor called Joseph Toinby,

479
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,420
 who is Polly Toinby's great grandfather.

480
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,420
 Wow.

481
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,420
 Isn't that weird?

482
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,420
 That's good.

483
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,940
 I read the other day and I haven't looked into this.

484
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,780
 I just saw the headline that your eardrum moves the same way as your eyes move.

485
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:04,500
 So when your eyes kind of move to the left or right, your eardrum slightly move around.

486
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
 Wow.

487
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,860
 It is, you know, when they, like, can't say I've seen just doing it themselves, our eardrums

488
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,860
 is obviously doing it.

489
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,860
 Yeah.

490
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,860
 Oh my god.

491
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,860
 I can kind of feel it.

492
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,860
 If you remember.

493
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,860
 All right.

494
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,860
 I mean, you think that might be your ear bones moving in your jaw.

495
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,860
 Oh yeah.

496
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,860
 Yeah, it might be.

497
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,860
 All right.

498
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,940
 The other thing with, you know, like, well, I can feel it too.

499
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,260
 Yes, it might be your ear bones.

500
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,260
 You have ear bones too.

501
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,260
 I don't know.

502
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,260
 Is it the ear bone?

503
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,260
 No.

504
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,260
 I'm just moving my eyes.

505
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
 Oh, wait.

506
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,260
 There's something moving in there.

507
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,260
 Yeah.

508
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,460
 I think that's your jaw moving, which is connecting to your ear bones.

509
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,620
 Why would my jaw move when I'm just moving my eyes?

510
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,860
 Because you're moving the muscles around your eyes to look that way.

511
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,660
 Carrie, I've been really into logical facts-based explanations here.

512
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,540
 So this is kind of a psychological affliction that they thought could be cured by flying.

513
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,420
 And there was another fashion for curing psychological affliction in about the 1920s.

514
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,980
 And this was pioneered by this doctor called Henry Cotton.

515
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,980
 And I'd never heard of this.

516
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,740
 But he thought that all madness or depression or anxiety was caused by physical stuff and

517
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,620
 could all be cured by surgery.

518
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,900
 So he used to just pull more and more body parts out of people until they were cured.

519
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
 So we'd start with the teeth.

520
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,380
 So you'd go in and you'd pull out all of your teeth if you were mad.

521
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,220
 And then if you still, he'd go for another body part.

522
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,220
 He'd keep on going.

523
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,220
 So then-

524
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,220
 He's like that game operative.

525
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,220
 No, no, no.

526
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,220
 I bet he invented it.

527
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,220
 He was like, I get it.

528
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,220
 Yeah.

529
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,220
 It was fun.

530
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,220
 It was not like operation.

531
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,220
 He'd go tonsils next and then adenoise, and then he'd remove your colon.

532
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,220
 If you still weren't here.

533
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,220
 I feel like you need your colon, don't you?

534
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,220
 I feel like you need--

535
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
 What about the appendix?

536
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
 No.

537
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,220
 I mean, once my stomach's gone, yes, my anxiety is going to go because I'm trying to deal

538
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,220
 with not having a stomach.

539
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,220
 Yeah.

540
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,220
 So I'm probably just going to be really upset.

541
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
 Probably not.

542
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,220
 Well, platypluses don't have stomachs.

543
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,220
 Don't they?

544
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,220
 No, they used to be very anxious.

545
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,220
 I don't know.

546
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,220
 They don't.

547
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,820
 And they used to-- this happened to my granny.

548
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,820
 They used to pull out all your teeth as prevention for tooth decay.

549
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,980
 So when you were like 18 or 21, and this was offered to her, she was extremely poor working

550
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,980
 car salient.

551
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,540
 And so they said, well, to save you some money and worrying about your teeth, just take

552
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,140
 them all out.

553
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,140
 Did you go for it?

554
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,140
 Yes, you had to hold everything or tooth removed at any moment.

555
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,140
 My granny was offered it.

556
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,140
 Didn't take them all from me.

557
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,140
 My lady.

558
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,140
 My lady.

559
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,140
 Yeah.

560
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,140
 This guy did pull out his own children's and wife's teeth as soon as he had children and a

561
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,140
 wife.

562
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,140
 So he had children and a wife over there.

563
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,140
 At what point in the ceremony or the reception did he do it?

564
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,140
 The christening.

565
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,140
 There's one in there.

566
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,140
 Now I'll kiss the bride.

567
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,140
 Well, just one thing before I do it.

568
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,140
 You may now fly over the bride's mouth open.

569
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:37,140
 Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is James Huckett.

570
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,020
 Okay, my fact this week is that there is a patch of snow in Scotland that fell 11 years

571
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,860
 ago and is just melted this week.

572
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,860
 That is amazing.

573
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
 It's sad.

574
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,860
 It's very sad.

575
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,860
 I thought it was amazing.

576
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,860
 When I looked into it, I realized it was sad.

577
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,860
 Super sad.

578
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,860
 The first one was like, wow.

579
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
 Oh.

580
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,860
 Sad.

581
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,300
 So there are these people who kind of always looking for the last bit of snow that's on the Scottish

582
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
 mountains.

583
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,660
 And most years, it's still there when it starts snowing again.

584
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,580
 So it's always going to be there and actually it always melts from the top.

585
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,500
 So the bit at the bottom will have been there for the whole time.

586
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,580
 But this week, and I'm going on a bit of a limb because as we're doing this podcast,

587
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,180
 I think there might still be a tiny bit there, but it's like a bit the size of a rucksack

588
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,180
 or something.

589
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,180
 There's hardly anything.

590
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,660
 And it looks like it's on its last legs, probably, we're recording this on September 29th.

591
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,780
 And I think by the 30th or by the start of October, it'll definitely be gone.

592
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,980
 God, but you're in trouble if there's an uninfected blizzard in Scotland over the next week.

593
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,980
 Yeah, exactly.

594
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,980
 Yeah.

595
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,380
 Hasn't it only disappeared six times in the last 300 years or something?

596
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,380
 Yeah.

597
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,380
 I'd like that.

598
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,380
 So, yeah.

599
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,180
 In the last 300 years, there have only been six times when there's been no snow on the

600
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,180
 ground in Britain.

601
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
 God, yeah.

602
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,340
 Every time you listen to the news at the moment, you feel like it's end of days.

603
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,020
 And you read a story like that where you go, and the snow has also gone.

604
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,820
 And you think, oh, God.

605
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,020
 But it's got a name.

606
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,020
 Yeah.

607
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,020
 And there's a few of them.

608
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,980
 I think the one that I'm talking about is called the Spinks.

609
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,980
 Yeah.

610
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,100
 And it's because there's a rock above it that looks a bit like the Spinks.

611
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,100
 I don't know.

612
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
 That was the reason.

613
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,100
 Yeah.

614
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
 And what do you think it was?

615
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,900
 I thought it was like the patch of snow asked you a riddle when you get there.

616
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,140
 And if you answer wrong, it folds you into its cold heart.

617
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,140
 I don't know.

618
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,140
 That's how it keeps going.

619
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,140
 Yeah.

620
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,940
 But there's one more virgin to come and ask you the question.

621
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,940
 Andy, whenever.

622
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,940
 Hey.

623
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,980
 So these people are very interesting guys.

624
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,620
 There's no patch hunters.

625
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,620
 Yes.

626
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,620
 And so we only know about this because of this guy, Ian Cameron.

627
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,620
 Yeah.

628
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,820
 And he's like one of the main guys.

629
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,740
 And he often goes and tries to find these patches and then we'll take photos of them.

630
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,100
 And then eventually, pretty much if Ian Cameron says they're not there anymore, they're

631
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,100
 probably not there anymore.

632
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
 Yeah.

633
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,340
 And he's got a Facebook group which you can go on and, you know, every few days he posts

634
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,940
 and he's like, oh, there's still a little bit left here, but probably not tomorrow.

635
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,460
 But and all of the data he gathers is really useful for climate scientists because he's

636
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,660
 got a record stretching back years and years now, which is very useful in terms of the

637
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,660
 temperature on the ground.

638
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,820
 And this is what they think it's climate change, is that what?

639
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,820
 Yeah.

640
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,820
 What he is quite circumspect about it.

641
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,460
 He says, look, I'm just going to leave it to the scientists to decide this kind of stuff.

642
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,620
 I wish more people would take that too.

643
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,660
 I suppose it seems pretty likely that it's climate change, right?

644
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,740
 Well, you know, what I like Ian, I can leave it to the scientists, but clearly it's bad.

645
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,820
 But he told the new statesman when they spoke to him, he said, it might sound weird to say,

646
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,500
 but it's like seeing an elderly relative or an old friend.

647
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,140
 You're slightly disappointed if it's not in as good a condition.

648
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,140
 Oh.

649
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,740
 And you're really disappointed if you turn up and it's not there.

650
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,740
 Yeah.

651
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,740
 He is all about the snow, isn't he?

652
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,740
 Yeah.

653
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,820
 He just, he only cares about these snow patches and he says he, I'm sure he cares about

654
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,820
 other things.

655
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,060
 He's a wife covering herself in snow, look at me, Ian, look at me.

656
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,940
 His children wearing snow hats, eating snow.

657
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,020
 He's desperately putting carrots out in front of their nose.

658
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,180
 Daddy, are we snow now?

659
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,180
 No, you're hot.

660
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,620
 You're hot and you're nothing to me.

661
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,380
 It's so easy, it's not like that being Ian's child.

662
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:05,380
 I would like to have said he actually reported he's an enthusiast, but he is not mad.

663
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,620
 So tell that to his poor melting wife.

664
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,580
 I think Ian Cameron is a bit of a hero because he's like looking at this kind of thing and

665
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,340
 not, not what else is, but actually it's like you say really good data and...

666
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,340
 No, he's amazing.

667
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,340
 It's amazing, obviously.

668
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:24,260
 What people do seem to be taking notice, there's a whole Wikipedia article called Snow Patches

669
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,900
 in Scotland, which I suspect maybe Ian Cameron wrote this.

670
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,420
 There are things like, it's so weird, it does seem to be a big thing based on this.

671
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,940
 So it describes a relatively little known snow patch, which was Scotland's largest at the

672
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,940
 time of writing.

673
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,340
 It said this patch does not appear in the no literature on the subject, so it may be

674
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,340
 very under-recorded.

675
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,340
 Only the hips does know about that one.

676
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,340
 It's really obscure.

677
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,340
 You probably haven't heard of it.

678
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,940
 Do you want some good news?

679
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,940
 Sure.

680
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,940
 Sure.

681
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,940
 You don't know about the world's tallest snow woman?

682
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,940
 Of course.

683
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,940
 Guys, I feel like...

684
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,940
 Mrs Cameron.

685
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,420
 So her name is Olympia and she is 30 feet shorter than the statue of Liberty.

686
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,420
 Oh, wow.

687
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,420
 Yeah.

688
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:13,340
 Her arms consist of 27 foot tall evergreens and she has 16 skis for eyelashes and 2,000 feet

689
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
 of rope hair.

690
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,340
 She is amazing.

691
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:20,980
 And five red autotires for lips, which were painted by the Mahousuk Kids Association.

692
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,980
 So basically the whole town got together and made this...

693
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,740
 This is from the photo, this absolute travesty of a snow person.

694
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,980
 I don't know what the parrot is made of, because presumably that's the size of a bus.

695
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:37,180
 The parrot knows it's made of muslin, chicken wire and wood frame by the MSAD number 44 elementary

696
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,180
 school children.

697
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,180
 Yeah.

698
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,180
 It's amazing.

699
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,220
 I have to say, if that magically came to life and approached me one night, I would run for

700
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,220
 the hills.

701
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,220
 And why is that might...

702
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,220
 Why would that happen?

703
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,220
 We're liking that.

704
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,220
 Like in the snowman.

705
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,220
 Oh, I see.

706
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,220
 Christmas things.

707
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,020
 I would not go walking in the air with that meat.

708
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,500
 I would sit indoors with a hairdryer on full blast if it came near me.

709
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,060
 I mean, it's not 100% clear just looking at this from a bit of a distance that she

710
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
 is a woman.

711
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,060
 It's one of the eyelashes.

712
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,060
 It's one of the eyelashes.

713
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,180
 They give you any eyelashes in the classic cartoon version of gender.

714
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,180
 I think a snow vagina will be a bit much at this.

715
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,020
 You don't see many snow penises on the old snowman, do you?

716
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,020
 You do, too.

717
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,020
 Walking.

718
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,020
 You don't.

719
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,020
 Maybe you don't.

720
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,020
 You don't.

721
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,020
 Hang it down in walking in the air.

722
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,020
 I didn't notice.

723
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,020
 You see a lot of snow penises.

724
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,020
 So.

725
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,500
 Have you guys heard about the oldest ever ice?

726
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,500
 Oh.

727
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
 Is it an Antarctica?

728
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,500
 Yes, it is.

729
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,500
 It's discovered this year.

730
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,460
 It dates back, guys.

731
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,780
 2.7 million years.

732
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,780
 What?

733
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,780
 Yeah.

734
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,540
 Is that the one that Putin drank?

735
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,540
 I'm sincerely hoping not.

736
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,540
 Do you not remember that?

737
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,540
 He did that.

738
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,100
 They drilled down to some really old ice and they melted it and Putin drank it.

739
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,620
 Well, just dropped it in a whiskey or something.

740
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
 He's going to live forever.

741
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:54,220
 No, he wasn't down at the bottom of the hole, eating the ice and then they dropped down

742
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,220
 to him.

743
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,740
 Yeah, no, so as a climate scientist, keep on drilling down because the snow that falls

744
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,700
 and then compacts an Antarctica, obviously, not obviously, but it has tiny bubbles of air,

745
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,540
 which tell you a huge amount about the climate 2 million years ago and you can find out how

746
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,700
 much carbon dioxide there was and what that means for the temperature of the earth, which

747
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,860
 is going to be very useful for us over the next century.

748
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:21,660
 But this year in April, there was a freezer in Canada where they had ice cores that

749
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,780
 dated back thousands and thousands of years.

750
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,300
 Yeah, your way ahead of me, Carried.

751
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,300
 No.

752
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
 There was a freezer malfunction.

753
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
 No.

754
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
 And they melted.

755
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,300
 Guys.

756
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,620
 I've had that with ice cream and it's really disappointing.

757
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,620
 Yeah.

758
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,620
 It is so disappointing.

759
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,620
 Well, imagine if there was 22,000 years of history in your ice cream.

760
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,580
 If it's green and black chocolate, I'd be as upset as I would be.

761
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:47,920
 And the director of the Canadian ice core archives guy called Martin Sharp and he said, "Fuck!"

762
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,260
 This is a bad day for Martin Sharp.

763
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,660
 He said, "I've had better days."

764
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,460
 Oh, you love Martin.

765
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,620
 But by a massive stroke of luck, which sounds crazy, but there was a massive stroke of

766
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:04,740
 like 90% of it was saved, solely because camera crew had been filming a documentary about

767
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,180
 this ice core archive and they had said, "Can we move most of it into this other freezer

768
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,180
 which has better lighting?"

769
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,180
 No.

770
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,180
 So thank god.

771
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,180
 Wow.

772
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,180
 Most of it was saved.

773
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180
 That's amazing.

774
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,180
 Is it like an ice cream where if it re-freezes, it's not quite as good?

775
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,180
 I think that's right.

776
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,180
 I think that's right.

777
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,980
 And then you still eat it, but you think, "Oh, I should have eaten this early."

778
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,980
 Yeah.

779
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,300
 It's hard to shove the little bubbles of ancient carbon dioxide back in at the right

780
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,300
 height.

781
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,500
 Well, that's something though, because they're like time capsules, but from literally millions

782
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,900
 of years ago, I kind of find the fact that these bubbles are 2.7 million years old, more

783
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,580
 exciting than the ice, because it's like a little world, even though it doesn't have the

784
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,620
 cool stuff like the blue Peter, Baton, or whatever, inside it, it's still like a little

785
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,620
 time capsule.

786
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,540
 Apparently, you're not supposed to make snowmen in Antarctica.

787
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,540
 Really?

788
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,540
 Why?

789
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,540
 It's a boo according to the telegraph.

790
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,540
 It's a boo.

791
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,540
 They're so uptight.

792
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,940
 Apparently, the rules are designed to prevent the Antarctic's animals from being disturbed.

793
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,940
 Yeah.

794
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,940
 That's fair enough.

795
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
 Animals, penguins?

796
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,940
 I don't know.

797
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,940
 They might be like, "What is that?"

798
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,940
 Yeah.

799
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,940
 You know, "Hey, that's my snow."

800
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,620
 It might be like, "I came into your house and rolled up all your cushions and made a giant

801
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,620
 cushion, man."

802
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,620
 And you woke up.

803
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,620
 Yeah.

804
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,220
 It does sound like I'd wake up, because it sounds like that happened in a dream, I think, the

805
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,220
 other day.

806
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,220
 It sounds like the penguins.

807
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,220
 They're like, just in my no business.

808
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,220
 Suddenly, someone's taking all their like hours.

809
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,700
 The Antarctica had no land animals, permanent land animals, apart from that tiny fly.

810
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
 Got penguins.

811
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,700
 I think it says now.

812
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,900
 Yeah, but they live in the sea.

813
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:28,020
 I think we did this on QI, the only permanent land animal is a midge with no wings.

814
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,900
 Hey, and what the midge doesn't have feelings?

815
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
 Yeah.

816
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,580
 It's even worse for the midge, because if you could be quite a small snowman, but to them,

817
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,380
 it's going to look like that one from Maine.

818
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,380
 The princess.

819
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,380
 The princess.

820
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,380
 Okay.

821
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,380
 I now understand.

822
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,740
 Andy has a point, because what about the Antarctic bases they built and all the snowing

823
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,740
 stations?

824
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,900
 No one's like, "Hey, we're disturbing them, are they?"

825
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,900
 No.

826
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,900
 The penguins are fine with that.

827
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,900
 Yeah, they're fine.

828
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:57,900
 But let's start with the midges.

829
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,780
 Okay, it's time for a final fact.

830
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,180
 And that is my fact this week.

831
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:07,060
 My fact is that the first person ever to use the word "sponge cake" was Jane Austen.

832
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,060
 Oh.

833
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,060
 Oh.

834
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,060
 Good old Jane.

835
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,060
 Good old Jane.

836
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,980
 Now, we mentioned this, because Carrie had you are in an imporised comedy group called

837
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,980
 "Ostentatious", which is about Jane Austen.

838
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
 Yeah, I am, eh, Jane.

839
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,980
 Great.

840
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,980
 She's in that with me.

841
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,980
 I'm a perger.

842
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,980
 I'm a perger, yeah.

843
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,980
 Joe is a perger, isn't that Rachel Powers?

844
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,980
 He's a great comic, isn't he?

845
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,980
 He's an amazing guy.

846
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,980
 He does very well.

847
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,980
 Andy is also in that group with me.

848
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,980
 I am.

849
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,980
 I'm in Austen.

850
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,980
 Yes.

851
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,980
 And you guys have got some big shows coming up.

852
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,980
 We have.

853
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,980
 We're going to the West End for three dates.

854
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,980
 The Piccadilly Theatre.

855
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,980
 We're going to December 5th, January 23rd, and special Valentine's Day, February 13th.

856
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,980
 Go the day before.

857
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,980
 That's what all the fashionable couples are doing.

858
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,980
 And then, on February the 14th, you can do something actually fun.

859
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,980
 Yeah.

860
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,980
 Exactly.

861
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,980
 Exactly.

862
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,980
 At the Piccadilly Theatre at 730, yeah, Austen Tatias are playing their biggest dates yet.

863
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,980
 And we've both seen it, and it's amazing.

864
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
 It's fantastic, yeah.

865
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
 So, sponge cake.

866
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,980
 So, we know our Jane Austen, right, Andy?

867
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,980
 We know our Jane Austen.

868
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,980
 But she coined the word sponge cake.

869
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,980
 She's got a few citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, and this is...

870
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,980
 So, it doesn't mean that she invented the sponge cake.

871
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,980
 She's the first person just to write it down.

872
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,980
 They called it something else before her.

873
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,980
 Do they call it cake sponge?

874
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,980
 Yeah.

875
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,980
 So, the first record of the word comes from her writings.

876
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,980
 I'm not even convinced it's a word.

877
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
 Well, is it two words or is it one word?

878
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,980
 I thought she wrote it down hyphenated.

879
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
 She wrote it down hyphenated in a letter to her sister.

880
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,980
 She said, "You know how interesting the purchase of a sponge cake is to me."

881
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,980
 I think it was a famous Jane Austen sense of humour coming in there.

882
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,980
 So, it's interesting.

883
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:37,980
 The first mention of a sponge cake, is it being given a sick burn in a letter?

884
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,980
 Which is a shame, because sponge cake is a great thing.

885
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,980
 But do you know the words that she either coined or first usage,

886
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,980
 the first evidence of it comes from her?

887
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,980
 I went through the OED and found as many as I could.

888
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,980
 Did you read the whole thing?

889
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,980
 Well...

890
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,980
 I've only started at the beginning, I can't believe it.

891
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,980
 Hard fact, no.

892
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,980
 Antibilius.

893
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,980
 Ooh.

894
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,980
 They're all kind of very ostony words, the ones.

895
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,980
 Like there's coddle, cousinly.

896
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,980
 She invented coddle.

897
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,980
 She didn't invent them, I suppose.

898
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,980
 But she's the first example we have of it.

899
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,980
 Okay.

900
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,980
 But isn't it like you coddle an egg?

901
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,980
 Yeah.

902
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,980
 Yeah, so maybe it's coddle in just that specific term as a molly coddle.

903
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,980
 Right, yeah, yeah.

904
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,980
 Irrepressible obtrusiveness.

905
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,980
 Tittope.

906
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,980
 What's tittope?

907
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,980
 Tittope.

908
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,980
 It's the study of titt.

909
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,980
 Tittope.

910
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,980
 Tittope.

911
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,980
 Sorry, I'm sorry.

912
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,980
 I'm sorry.

913
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,980
 It's apology.

914
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,980
 Tittope.

915
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,980
 I'm already photographing.

916
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,980
 Oh, I'm getting confused.

917
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,980
 Tittope.

918
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,980
 I think it means like a tittope.

919
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,980
 Oh, yes.

920
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,980
 And there's suppose a tittope is a mistake or something?

921
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,980
 No.

922
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,980
 Darcy's always tittopping, isn't he?

923
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,980
 That bull went really tittopping.

924
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,980
 That's how Lizzie felt.

925
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,980
 Garde as into garde about.

926
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,980
 You're kidding, the verbal use of garde.

927
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
 That's cool.

928
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,980
 I think that's better than sponge cakes, to be honest.

929
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,980
 Yes, it is.

930
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,980
 Garde about.

931
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,980
 They're quite neat words.

932
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,980
 Yeah, that's what I think as well.

933
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,980
 It's not like Shakespeare who just invented "the" and "an".

934
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,980
 All the main words.

935
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,980
 Before that, we just literally garde.

936
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,980
 I've got some mind-blowing news on that, Anna.

937
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
 Oh, yeah.

938
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,980
 So Shakespeare's always said that Shakespeare invented 1700 words, right?

939
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,980
 And I'm always saying it.

940
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,980
 And so the words include "bump, hurry, road".

941
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,980
 I mean, it's nonsense.

942
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,980
 So the reason that he gets all these citations is because the first team of people

943
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:37,980
 in Piling the Oxford English Dictionary knew his works intimately because they were all lexicographers.

944
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,980
 So when they were thinking, "Where's the word critical?"

945
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,980
 They say, "Oh, there is a critical in whatever play it was."

946
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,980
 And then, now that we've got better technology, we're going back and we're finding way earlier ones.

947
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,980
 So we thought that the word puke was a Shakespearean coinage.

948
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,980
 Turns out it dates back to 1465, almost two centuries before Shakespeare wrote it.

949
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,980
 I bet you also was saying the word "road".

950
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,980
 Come on.

951
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,980
 No, it wasn't gone on a road.

952
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,980
 Yeah, because it would be weird if Shakespeare's plays were just full of words that no one had heard of.

953
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,980
 Well, the audience would be back full.

954
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,980
 Well, imagine the reviews, you know?

955
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,980
 But you know people say, "No, I find Shakespeare harder to understand."

956
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,980
 Perhaps that's what's happening.

957
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,980
 In the 16th century, people are like, "I don't know. It's not about. I can't really find a road."

958
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,980
 Did you see the amazing website right, like ostin.com?

959
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,980
 No.

960
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,980
 So it tells you you couldn't type in a word and it will tell you how many times you used it.

961
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,980
 So she only used the word "swoon" four times.

962
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,980
 We used that word quite a lot.

963
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,980
 She used the word "curtzy" six times.

964
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,980
 She never used the word "marval".

965
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
 So was it...

966
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,980
 She had embedded superheroes in us.

967
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,980
 No, no.

968
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,980
 She was mainly using the word "DC".

969
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,980
 She did?

970
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,980
 There were things that I think that she may have invented.

971
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,980
 Like, so the phrase "Tom Dick or Harry" I think comes from her.

972
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,980
 And you can imagine her thinking that up from her own head.

973
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,980
 Right?

974
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,980
 Or dog tired.

975
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,980
 Comes from Jane Austen.

976
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,980
 Again, like, that's the kind of thing maybe she had made up.

977
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,980
 Good writing.

978
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,980
 Yeah.

979
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
 If I've told you once, I've told you 100 times.

980
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,980
 No, she came up with that.

981
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,980
 Yeah, that was from her.

982
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,980
 That is a biggie.

983
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,980
 That's probably her.

984
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,980
 I'd say that's her lasting achievement.

985
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,980
 Yeah, but you're only saying that because you've been told that a lot of times.

986
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,980
 I think it's about puke.

987
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,980
 Yeah.

988
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:23,980
 Jane Austen wrote not very well according to this professor.

989
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,980
 This is really interesting.

990
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,980
 I'm bristling.

991
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,980
 According to a lot of people as well.

992
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,980
 I've put a lot of men throughout the years have written a heart of views of her.

993
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,980
 Well, Virginia Woolf didn't like her much.

994
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,980
 Oh, no, that is true.

995
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,980
 Well, Virginia Woolf was a man.

996
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,980
 It's extremely interesting you raised Virginia Woolf.

997
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,980
 So this is a study done by his professor Catherine Sutherland.

998
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,980
 And basically, what she's saying is Jane Austen didn't write like we think she wrote.

999
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
 That was the work of an editor.

1000
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,980
 So I agree with Carrie Hadd and Andy that, like, her novels are perfection in terms

1001
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,980
 of, like, the construction of the sentences and the English language.

1002
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,980
 But what this academic says is that that was all the editor.

1003
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,980
 And if you look at her works, her first drafts of works, she writes totally differently.

1004
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,980
 They're just...

1005
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,980
 They're just dolarbings with prey on the back of a mirror.

1006
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,980
 So Darcy, big nice man, came in the room.

1007
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,980
 Yeah.

1008
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
 And he was like, so nice.

1009
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,980
 Well, she was more experimental.

1010
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,980
 So it actually sounds like she was more interesting.

1011
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,980
 And she said that she wrote a bit more like Virginia Woolf.

1012
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,980
 So for instance, when she had exchanges between characters, like speech exchange,

1013
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,980
 like speech exchanges, she wouldn't separate out one speaker from another.

1014
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,980
 So it would all be like, blurred in a more stream of consciousness,

1015
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,980
 it kind of way.

1016
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,980
 Which is keeping the idea of speech, which is so good at.

1017
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,980
 The speech is so good.

1018
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,980
 Yeah.

1019
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,980
 Well, the editor was wanting her to separate it out.

1020
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,980
 And she couldn't spell.

1021
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,980
 So she didn't know which one, first, of I&E.

1022
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
 She didn't know punctuation.

1023
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,980
 But also, most people didn't spell.

1024
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,980
 Yeah, the rules hadn't been set.

1025
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,980
 You and on you had not been set, though.

1026
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,980
 Yes.

1027
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,980
 The rules hadn't been set.

1028
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,980
 I think maybe she was a little bit worse than other writers at the time.

1029
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,980
 And also, she didn't separate things into paragraphs very well.

1030
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,980
 She was a woman in the 19th century, or the one before that.

1031
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,980
 She didn't.

1032
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,980
 She hadn't had a lot of education.

1033
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,980
 I'm not saying she didn't do very well.

1034
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,980
 We're really bristling, aren't we?

1035
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,980
 Could it be that she didn't try and write sponge cake?

1036
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,980
 She just misspelled sponge carcass.

1037
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
 Sponge cake.

1038
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,980
 What, what is that in, Jane?

1039
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,980
 You know how interesting the purchase of a sponge cake is to me.

1040
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,980
 That is a way more interesting letter to be fair.

1041
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,980
 Virginia Woolf said that one of the reasons that she was so popular

1042
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,980
 is there are 25 elderly gentlemen living in the neighborhood of London

1043
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,980
 who resent any slight upon her genius

1044
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,980
 as if it were an insult to the chastity of their aunts.

1045
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,980
 Wow.

1046
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,980
 And that's a lovely sentence.

1047
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,980
 She's equally brilliant writer.

1048
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,980
 Virginia Woolf.

1049
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,980
 I know it's so sad.

1050
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,980
 They're both so fantastic and yet didn't like each other.

1051
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,980
 Well, it wasn't that many opinions on the show table.

1052
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,980
 They will come in the years after my death.

1053
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,980
 A woman who is crap.

1054
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,980
 And I will call her Virginia Woolf, but spell wool from her.

1055
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,980
 But didn't Charlotte Bronte hate her as well?

1056
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,980
 I'm sure it's a quote from Bronte that said,

1057
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,980
 "I read that and I recognize no love that I've ever known."

1058
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,980
 I can imagine the Bronte is not getting along with her.

1059
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,980
 You were all howling on a moor somewhere.

1060
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,980
 Very different vibe.

1061
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,980
 But wasn't it that when the Brontes came out they were really popular

1062
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,980
 and Jane Austen went out of favour for all of them?

1063
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,980
 Completely out of favour.

1064
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,980
 And actually, I think it's partly only due to cinema that she's back in.

1065
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,980
 So silent movies, very bad.

1066
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,980
 Improvised comedy.

1067
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,980
 Oh, yeah.

1068
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,980
 We have affected her sales quite heavily.

1069
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,980
 Silent movies, I think, would have been terrible for Austin

1070
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,980
 because it's all conversation.

1071
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,980
 I think the first adaptation was 1940, a bright impression.

1072
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,980
 Yes, an amazing film, black and white film.

1073
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,980
 Starring Laurence Olivier.

1074
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,980
 Yes.

1075
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,980
 Lizzie Bennett.

1076
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,980
 First of all.

1077
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,980
 There's been some amazing spin-offs.

1078
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,980
 I don't know anyone looked into this.

1079
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,980
 I mean, obviously the Austin industry, myself and Andy are employed by,

1080
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,980
 is huge.

1081
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,980
 And there's lots of fan fiction and lots of people writing other books.

1082
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,980
 So I just looked up, like, top of the top 20 of other books.

1083
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,980
 There's just, like, definitely not Mr Darcy.

1084
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,980
 Prom and prejudice.

1085
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,980
 Colonel Brandon Styrie.

1086
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,980
 Pride and prejudice.

1087
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,980
 And zombies.

1088
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
 Mr Darcy takes a wife.

1089
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,980
 Pride and prejudice continues.

1090
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,980
 They read titles from my show.

1091
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,980
 Wow.

1092
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,980
 Like, they are incredible amounts.

1093
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,980
 I read that a lot of people do this fan fiction

1094
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,980
 because there's not enough sex in the actual version.

1095
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,980
 Yes, a lot of it is sexy.

1096
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,980
 Darcy's passions, Pride and Prejudice we told through his eyes,

1097
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,980
 by Regina Jeffers, I think is a little bit more sexy than her stuff,

1098
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,980
 because she doesn't really go into it, it has to be said.

1099
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,980
 Darcy and Elizabeth, nights and days at Pemberley.

1100
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,980
 Oh, really?

1101
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,980
 These are all available to my guys.

1102
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,980
 More nights and days are right.

1103
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,980
 Hot nights at Pemberley.

1104
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,980
 Mr Darcy's undoing a Pride and Prejudice variation.

1105
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,980
 Do you know her sexiest line, maybe,

1106
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,980
 or the line that most overtly refers to sex?

1107
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,980
 No.

1108
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,980
 It's pretty--

1109
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,980
 It's a list of sponge cocks.

1110
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,980
 I would like to see sponge cocks square pants.

1111
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,980
 The kids TV show.

1112
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,980
 Oh, my God.

1113
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,980
 This is just a real classic Jane Auster line.

1114
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,980
 It's in Mansfield Park, Fanny Price, the main character.

1115
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,980
 Fanny Price is the root name.

1116
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,980
 It's Fanny.

1117
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,980
 It's Fanny.

1118
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,980
 No, it's a reference to her getting pregnant.

1119
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
 And the sentence is just about, it's one of the last sentences.

1120
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,980
 It's about how Fanny Price now has been to come into some money

1121
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,980
 just after they had been married long enough

1122
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,980
 to begin to want an increase of income.

1123
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,980
 Oh.

1124
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,980
 That's not the rudest line in Mansfield Park.

1125
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,980
 It is an overt reference to sex, though.

1126
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,980
 Well, would you like an overt reference to something else?

1127
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,980
 You know I would.

1128
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,980
 It's in Mansfield Park as well.

1129
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,980
 And there's a character called Mary Crawford,

1130
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,980
 who's a bad, bad girl.

1131
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,980
 And she's talking about the admiralty.

1132
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,980
 And she says she used to know a load of admirals.

1133
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,980
 And she says,

1134
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,980
 "Of rears and vices, I saw enough."

1135
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,980
 Of rears and vices.

1136
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,980
 And vices.

1137
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,980
 "Of rears and vices."

1138
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,980
 "Of rears and vices."

1139
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,980
 "Of rears and vices."

1140
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,980
 "Of rears and vices."

1141
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,980
 Which are both kinds of admiral, but they're also both references to something else.

1142
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,980
 I don't get it.

1143
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,980
 So vices as in woodwork.

1144
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,980
 Yes, okay.

1145
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,980
 "Rearers in the back of the room."

1146
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,980
 Yes.

1147
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,980
 Yeah, no.

1148
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,980
 And that's an incredibly filthy line.

1149
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,980
 That is quite raunchy.

1150
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,980
 I don't know.

1151
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,980
 People are, the academic community is divided over whether it refers to Sodomile or Spanking.

1152
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,980
 But it's one of the two.

1153
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:06,980
 I find it hint that Mary Corpid is a very saucy, not, not nice lady.

1154
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,980
 And that's our main character in trouble.

1155
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,980
 So that's what she's doing.

1156
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,980
 A good character study.

1157
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,980
 She could have said that she's known a lot of seemingly.

1158
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:19,980
 And without that spelling, she had to play that quite obvious.

1159
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,980
 You can play Jane Austen role playing game now, which I really want to play.

1160
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,980
 I want to play life.

1161
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,980
 Yes.

1162
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,980
 So if you don't want to book out for ostentatious.

1163
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,980
 No, there's this online role playing game and it sounds really fun.

1164
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,980
 I think I saw that at the video game.

1165
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,980
 Yeah.

1166
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,980
 You get to pick a character and then you have all these interactions.

1167
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:43,980
 So some guardian journalist went and played it and started out by making this character

1168
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,980
 who lost her handkerchief and then found it and then went for a walk and bumped into a gentleman.

1169
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,980
 Although the writer did say that while she was going on this virtual walk,

1170
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,980
 she saw a bunch of sheep stacked on top of each other.

1171
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:00,980
 So some of the algorithms in the game need some ironing out, she said.

1172
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,980
 Every ostentatious novel there's a discreet sheep stack.

1173
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,980
 My lord will it be?

1174
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,980
 The sheep are stacked so fine today.

1175
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:14,980
 About ten years ago, an ostentbuff and an author sent off some of her manuscripts

1176
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,980
 to various British publishers, seeing if you could get them published.

1177
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,980
 And he made very slight changes to the title and the characters.

1178
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:28,980
 And the pseudonym he used was Alison Lady as an A Lady, which is an ostent's pseudonym.

1179
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,980
 It was not the world's greatest pseudonym.

1180
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,980
 He's the guy who runs the Jane Austen Festival in Bath.

1181
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,980
 Well you know him well.

1182
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:40,980
 They all rejected the manuscripts and only one of them spotted the fact that it was almost identical to Austen's work.

1183
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,980
 He got one letter back from Penguin, he just sent them Pride and Prejudice.

1184
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:49,980
 And they wrote back saying thank you for your recent letter and chapters from your book First Impressions.

1185
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,980
 It seems like a really original and interesting rite.

1186
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,980
 I'm going to say I really do like Penguin though, don't you?

1187
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,980
 I'll show them around the corner.

1188
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,980
 Excellent publisher.

1189
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,980
 Oh gosh.

1190
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,980
 Amazing.

1191
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,980
 And thank God they haven't spotted the art book.

1192
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,980
 It's just a complete rip-off of Bleek House.

1193
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:11,980
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

1194
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,980
 Thank you very much indeed for listening.

1195
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,980
 We will be back again next week with another podcast.

1196
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,980
 But until then you can check us out on Twitter. We are at no such thing and we will have individual Twitter accounts.

1197
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,980
 I'm on @AndruHunterM, James.

1198
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:25,980

1200
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:27,980
 And Anna?

00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,980
 You can email podcasts at qi.com.

1202
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:34,980
 Yeah, and if you want to come and see us on tour, we've just announced a whole new bunch of tour dates.

1209
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,980
 Lovely.

1210
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:05,980
