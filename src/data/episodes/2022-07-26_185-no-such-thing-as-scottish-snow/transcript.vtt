00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
 (horn honking)

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.420
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.460
 (horn honking in foreign language)

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.460
 (horn honking in foreign language)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.040
 (upbeat music)

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.740
 - Hello and welcome to another episode.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.820
 No such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.140
 coming to you from the QI office in Covent Garden.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.140
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray and I'm sitting here

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.100
 with James Harkin, Anna Teginski,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.380
 and our special guest this week is Carrie Lloyd.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.020
 Carrie Ad is a comedian we all know.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.900
 She's been on QI a load of times.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.500
 She's in an improvised show called ostentatious,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.140
 which is Jane Austen based improvised comedy with me.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.060
 And she also is the presenter and host

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.480
 and producer and everything of the podcast grief cast,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.580
 which is about grief and about people you've lost,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.300
 but it's also very uplifting and charming

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.460
 and funny and wonderful.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.500
 So do give that a listen.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.380
 Okay, starting with fact number one this week,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.180
 and that is Carrie Lloyd.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.460
 My fact is that Unity Mittford was the only person

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.340
 to be BFFs with Churchill and Hitler.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.180
 - She was best friends forever,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.380
 just for any 80s kids in the room.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.260
 - Yeah, she was definitely best buddies,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.260
 Bezzies with Hitler.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.140
 She was very Bezzies with Hitler.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.260
 But she was also very old family friends with Churchill.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.420
 And at some point, just before war broke out,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.580
 so she was living in Germany,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.340
 basically completely in Hitler's inner circle.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.180
 She was completely there.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.860
 She used to write to her friend Winston

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.860
 and beg him very regularly to make peace with Hitler,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.020
 because she really believed in both countries.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.660
 Now, caveat, yes, she was a massive fascist, obviously.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.660
 Not my saying I love her,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.180
 but she did really believe that England and Germany

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.740
 could work together and become this incredible superpower.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.100
 And she always said, if they go to war, I'll kill myself.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.180
 I'll kill because these are my two greatest sides of my country.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.620
 And spoiler alert, the moment war broke out,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.980
 she went into a park and she shot herself in the head.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.820
 But spoiler spoiler alert.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.740
 It didn't work.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.460
 She survived with the bullet in her head.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.140
 Wow.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.300
 But then she did also die due to an infection.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.500
 But much later, much, much later.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.020
 So Hitler, her BFF, when she did shoot herself in her head,

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.260
 Hitler felt so bad, obviously it was his fault.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.580
 Hashtag, you caused the war.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.700
 He arranged for a train to take her to Switzerland

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.460
 and then her mother.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.020
 And I think it was Debo, the young sister, came and got her.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.340
 But he, you know, wars breaking out,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.460
 everyone's leaving countries.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.500
 Hitler made sure that she got out of Germany

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.300
 and he knew she was going back to Britain.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.980
 And he funded her healthcare in Germany.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.540
 It's very easy to accidentally read the story and go,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.540
 oh, that's quite nice.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.540
 I know, yes.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.940
 I know, again, he was a massive fascist,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.380
 but also, I think he was quite big into it.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.140
 He was one of the worst, I would say.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.980
 You know, there's a theory about Hitler funding all this.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.740
 So the theory is that her sister, Deborah and her mother,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.740
 took her home after she tried to kill herself.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.860
 She then recuperated at a little nursing home in a village

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.180
 called Wiggington in Oxfordshire.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.180
 The home was a maternity home.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.180
 This.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.180
 And there is a story--

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.180
 This is rubbish.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.380
 --there is a story from the woman who ran the home

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.660
 that she may have had a baby.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.900
 And the baby had a tiny mustache.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.220
 That was a massive fascist.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.900
 Yeah, and so the journalist who wrote about this,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.340
 she asked the woman who she thought the father might be.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.580
 And she said, well, my mother always said, it was Hitler's.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.420
 Although there is no record of this happening,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.380
 so it's probable there is not a secret Hitler love child.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.180
 But they definitely copped off, didn't they?

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.860
 No, also, that's a good--

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.380
 Yeah, there's a lot of-- like, it was very suspicious.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.100
 In the inner circle, all the Germans hated her.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.540
 They were like, there's this British woman

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.460
 who Hitler literally-- she would advise him

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.900
 and wind him up on stuff.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.260
 And she was extremely jealous of Eva Braun, as well.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.060
 And Eva Braun was very jealous of her, though, right?

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.980
 Yeah, so Unity definitely was another thing.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.060
 But what I read seems to be that nothing happened,

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.620
 basically, he was kind of using her,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.980
 because she was extremely useful.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.300
 And the other weird thing about Unity

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.100
 is her middle name was Valkyrie, Unity Valkyrie Mittford.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.500
 And she was born in the town of Swastika.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.340
 So weird.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.180
 So weird.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.220
 And so it said that he was very superstitious.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.940
 And it was said when he found this stuff out about her.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.380
 And she was a six-foot blonde, blue-eyed woman

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.540
 that he kind of felt like she was very lucky.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.580
 But apparently, there was no way they ever slept together,

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.140
 but she definitely would have.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.700
 And she used to kind of hang out with other fascists.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.500
 And she slept with Churchill.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.060
 No, but her sister, Deca, was married to Esmond Romney,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.580
 who the big room it is that he was Churchill's secret son.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.700
 And it was all sort of hidden, though.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.700
 He was actually a nephew.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.580
 But yeah, I thought Churchill was quite happily married, though.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.180
 It's not like that massive fascist Hitler.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.340
 So this town of Swastika is in Ontario.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.020
 Yes.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.500
 And they wanted to change the name during the war to Winston,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.900
 because of obvious reasons.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.380
 And they even did it, I think.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.820
 Or at least they got pretty close.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.060
 But then everyone who was living there said no.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.980
 And so they took down all the new signs.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.900
 And they said no.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.620
 We were called Swastika before Hitler came along.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.140
 We came with the idea first.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.700
 Why should we change our names?

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.100
 And they were named after the symbol,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.820
 which was a good luck symbol, is it Hindi?

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.940
 Or Hinduism.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:08.980
 Yeah, Hinduism.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.340
 So that's where they're beforehand.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.060
 It doesn't have a fact about that guy--

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.740
 I think possibly also in Canada, who

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.100
 was called Adolf Hitler.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.900
 And it was asked if you're going to change your name.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.060
 And he said, I'm not going to let one guy ruin the name.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.940
 And he didn't change his name.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.220
 Then they were amazing family.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.460
 Yeah, there literally isn't one of them

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.700
 that wasn't somehow involved in something.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.460
 So Unity was-- well, they were all bizarre, but she was bizarre.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.660
 So she said that her and her sister grew up,

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.620
 her to be a fascist, her sister, one of her sisters,

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.820
 that could be a communist.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.020
 And she said that they used to scratch--

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.420
 she would scratch Swastika, and her sister

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.420
 would scratch Hammer and Sickle into the window of the bedroom

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.580
 that they shared together, and the scratch was still there.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.420
 And so they really pursued their dreams.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.500
 There was an article in The Guardian about how

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.500
 they're kind of inspiring in a twisted way.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500
 Because she was like, I'm in love with Hitler.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.780
 I'm going to go track them down.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.300
 And she didn't.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.060
 She went to Germany.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.260
 And she sat in a cafe that he frequented.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.580
 She sat there every day.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.260
 Yeah, she sat there every single day.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.780
 Until eventually, he was like, who's

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.820
 that six-foot-blown woman that keeps staring at me?

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.020
 And that's how she got to know him.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.860
 And apparently, she told-- she wrote to Decker and said,

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.700
 this is my plan, like any good obsessed teenager.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.940
 This is how I'm going to get him.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.780
 And so her and Decker, Jessica Mittford, shared a room,

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.300
 and they had a chalk line down the middle of the room.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.180
 And at one end was a bust of Lenin,

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.860
 and the other end was a picture of Hitler.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.860
 Wow.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.500
 But they were obviously still sisters

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.940
 and loved each other very much.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.540
 And then completely opposite.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.500
 But obviously, growing up in exactly the same household.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.380
 Do you think maybe, like, sometimes brothers and sisters

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.220
 go against their brothers and sisters, right?

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.620
 Yeah.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.940
 Well, if you read any of the Mittford stuff,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.260
 there's an amazing biography by Mary S. Lovell,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.660
 which is the best Mittford S. want to be, which

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.860
 says that they all of them had these incredibly obsessive

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.420
 personalities and filled them with--

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.900
 so either fascism or communism, or Pam,

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.820
 who was obsessed with farming.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.420
 She's all the best, yeah.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.420
 Pam is the one that--

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.940
 Pam's the one that--

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.180
 Pam's the one that everyone forgets.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.780
 But she introduced a new breed of chicken into this country.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.100
 Yeah, so--

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.300
 And Pam apparently was quite a wit.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.020
 And like, Evelyn Moore was in love with her.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.940
 But the only people who had her jokes were the chickens.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.780
 Yeah, exactly.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.940
 They were sad.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:12.900
 With her six.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.420
 So there was--

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.420
 Yeah.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.380
 And there's a brother who died in the war.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.660
 And then you have Nancy, who was a very famous writer, Diana,

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.620
 who obviously also being a bit fascist.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.500
 They do not--

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.500
 I don't know if you're well on that list.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.580
 The mistress of Oswald Mosley, head of the bridge.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.660
 She was the wife, the wife of eventual wife of Oswald Mosley.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.500
 Well, I was just referring to the courting effect.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.340
 She was the only famously said Hitler had beautiful blue eyes.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.380
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.100
 Did she tell Stephen Fry this?

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.780
 Well, Stephen--

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.140
 Actually, he mentioned that on QI.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.660
 Yeah.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.060
 He says that-- Stephen Fry says that she said to him,

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.100
 of course, you never met Hitler, did you?

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.540
 She was an incredible woman, Diana.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.820
 And she was said to be the most beautiful woman of her age.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.140
 Like, men were literally falling over.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.780
 And then she married a Guinness, and had an affair,

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.420
 not a pine-egg in his mouth, and then had an affair with Oswald

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.620
 Mosley, and then ended up marrying him.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.980
 And then went to prison, right?

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.460
 Went to prison.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.560
 And she was the only-- during the war they

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.460
 were interred.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.620
 And she and another woman were allowed their husbands

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.420
 in Holloway prison.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.420
 So she was in Holloway women's prison.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.860
 And then Oswald was allowed to join up.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.580
 Because Churchill said that was OK.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.780
 Because he was mates with the family.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.700
 And Nancy Metford was famous for doing the upper class

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.020
 and lower class rights in Kingston.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.420
 You and non-You were the famous essay she wrote about.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.460
 So great ways.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.020
 What things show you off as being posh on not posh, right?

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:28.420
 Yes.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.420
 Have you got to test for us?

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.580
 I couldn't do one.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.140
 How do you pronounce the word, which

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.980
 refers to a large cat with a mane?

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.500
 Lion?

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.500
 Lion?

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:41.980
 No.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.980
 Not posh, not posh.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.820
 Oh, no.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.900
 Lion?

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.700
 Oh, you're pretty posh, isn't it?

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.860
 I'm putting it on, I'm picking it.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.980
 It rhymes with barn.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.980
 Apparently, lawn.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.980
 Lawn, yeah.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.260
 How do you pronounce the game, which I like to play,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.740
 where I hit little balls around with a stick in a field?

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.060
 Golf.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.860
 Goof.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.260
 Goof.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.100
 Goof.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.100
 Goof.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:04.700
 Oh, yeah, goof.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.500
 Who's it, goof?

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.580
 Like Darren Goff.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.260
 Go and play a game of golf.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:09.820
 Oh, wow.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.980
 There was a study recently that found

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.900
 the queen has become less posh over the course of her reign.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.860
 As in, if you listen to her vowels from 1953, she's still quite posh.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.100
 She's still quite posh, though.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.100
 Not as posh, though.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.860
 If you listen to the older recordings, it's almost like--

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.900
 But that's her accent is less posh.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.100
 She still lives in a massive family.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.020
 She hasn't kept it real recently, yeah.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.420
 But she talks quite straight, I think, as what we're saying.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.220
 She lives in a palace, but she talks pretty straight.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.300
 She says BFF.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.300
 Yeah.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.580
 But wasn't the non-new you thing part of it

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.420
 was about that thing where people who want to be posh put on posh words?

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.020
 So things like Serviette instead of napkin.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.660
 So it wasn't about telling the posh from the working class.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.540
 It was about telling the posh from the middle class who wanted to be you.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:54.460
 The really posh don't say the posh word.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:59.620
 They just call it a napkin, whereas the social climber says the Serviette.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.140
 Exactly.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.820
 What you call it a mouth face wipe, but like that.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.660
 It's just a plain old weirdo.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.180
 Yeah, Nancy was very like a Serbic and witty about.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.820
 So she was sort of taking the piss out of people.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.540
 There was a lot of piss taking involve, wasn't there?

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.380
 Yeah.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.900
 Apparently a gentleman, when he's drunk, may become amorous or mordlin

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:24.100
 or vomit in public, but he would never become truculent.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.940
 That's how you know Andy's so common.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.820
 Regularly truculent.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.780
 Fighty, fighty.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:38.100
 OK, it's time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.060
 My fact this week is that in the 1920s, doctors prescribed intentionally terrifying flights

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.060
 and aeroplanes to cure deafness.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.060
 That's true.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.700
 Why did they think that that would, what was their reason?

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.420
 Well, I would think maybe because it makes your ears pop.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.060
 Yeah, but likes it that.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.060
 It was not that.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.620
 No, it was the shock factor.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.980
 So it actually, it actually started with someone who couldn't speak.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:04.380
 It was an Army serviceman who I think lost the ability to speak during the First World War.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:09.300
 And this is in 1921, this doctor called Charles McInerney said it was a psychological problem

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.940
 and that the solution would be going into a plane and being treated to a series of loop

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.220
 the loops and nose dives and spins and things that made him think he was going to die.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.380
 And lo and behold, he took this prescription, he did it.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.220
 He stepped off the plane and he said, I don't know if I can speak anymore.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.340
 And it turned out he could because he said that.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.940
 And then it started being touted as a cure for everything.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.940
 Including deafness.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.020
 So, deaf flights were a thing that was quite commonly prescribed.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:41.140
 And Charles Lindbergh, very famous obviously aviator on his business card, he had deaf flights

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.180
 as one of the things that he offered to really take deaf people up.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.860
 The idea was that people might have suffered from these things for psychological reasons.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.180
 You were saying that you were a shell shocky kind of thing.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.180
 Yeah.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:56.500
 So were they take, yeah, was it only if you develop deafness or was it more like, oh,

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.900
 I'd been deaf since birth?

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.900
 There were some people who were deaf since birth.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:06.220
 So for example, in 1930, there was a boxer called Fred Mayhem, his nickname was Dummy, which

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.780
 is a cruel nickname because he'd been deaf since the edge of eight months.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:10.780
 Oh my God.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.780
 So he took a flight in 1930.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.380
 It was designed to cure his hearing.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.380
 It was designed to cure his hearing with a parachute jump that he was going to take out

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.900
 of the plane, okay?

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.500
 In front of a crowd of thousands, the parachute failed to open.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.500
 Oh my God.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.500
 And he died.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.740
 Where's the happy ending, Andy?

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.460
 Probably in the next factor, I'm afraid.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.940
 And sometimes people did die.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:36.220
 The idea also was that it had to be a surprise, so the patients were told that.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.220
 Where are we going?

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:42.140
 Don't worry, just put on this backpack.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.180
 They were told they were just going in a flight because it was the altitude that cured

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.180
 the deafness.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.180
 Right.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.260
 And then they'd go up in the flight and then it would be a horrible shock when you suddenly

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.900
 started nose diving towards the ground or spinning around in circles because obviously

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.500
 if you knew it was going to happen, then the cure wasn't going to be effective.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.260
 Have you heard about this flight that happened in, well, when did I have, in 1969 with Alan

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.260
 Funt?

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.260
 Have you heard this before?

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.500
 I don't think I've ever heard the word Alan Funt before.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.500
 Alan Funt.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.500
 I remember.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.780
 He was the host of a prank show in America that was like absolutely massive, kind of like

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.900
 candid camera sort of, you know, it was called candid camera.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.900
 I feel like a fuck.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.900
 What a fuck.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.700
 Alan Funt hosted candid camera, which is like the original you've been framed.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.660
 And he was hugely, hugely famous as much as, I would say, Jamie Beatles in his day.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.140
 And he was on a flight with his family and they had a camera crew because they were going

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:34.100
 to film like this new prank show and it got taken hostage.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.820
 So the plane, a guy stands up and it was at the time apparently there was loads of this

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.980
 happening and they were just constantly in '96 and being taken to Cuba.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.500
 It was like quite fashionable.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.020
 So everyone starts panicking.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:49.380
 Then some of the passengers see Alan Funt and go, oh, it's a prank.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.020
 And it wasn't a prank.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.540
 So Alan Funt standing up and he's like, it's not a prank, which obviously is what Alan

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.900
 Funt would do if it was a prank.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.500
 So the whole plane starts laughing and relaxing because they think it's a prank.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.140
 And I think they even got flown to Cuba and they were on the ground for like five hours

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.260
 with everyone really relaxing king in a minute.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.940
 Yeah, it seems like the whole plane thinking in a minute the camera's going to come out.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.940
 We're going to laugh.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.940
 And they were winding him up the whole time and he was with his wife and child.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:18.220
 And the daughter has recounted it and said like they just thought he was getting more and

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.940
 more frustrated and upset because no one would believe it.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.940
 Well, the hijacker.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.940
 No, Alan Funt.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.820
 Eventually Funt hijacked the plane and he stopped.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.820
 Yeah.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.180
 Tied me to anywhere apart from Cuba.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.180
 It did happen a lot.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.660
 I remember Andy had a fact where there was a guy who said, take me to Cuba, but the flight

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.660
 was already going to.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.660
 Oh, my God.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.060
 That's a book of parakeet, failures, classic that one.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.060
 Yeah.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.060
 Charles Lindbergh.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.060
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.860
 One of his other specialities listed on his business card, which is an amazing business

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.860
 card, by the way, including death lights.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.580
 One of the other things he offered was a plane change in mid air.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.580
 Yeah.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.100
 This was a trick in early aerial circuses where you would just climb out of the plane you

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.260
 were in or flying and climb into another plane next to you.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:05.420
 That's, would you do that if you're traveling and you do it for an exchange or is it a trick?

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.420
 It's a trick, right?

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.420
 I was concerned.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.740
 If anyone changing your flight was in the old days, if anyone from Ryanair is listening,

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.500
 they will be considering that.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.540
 He was a real dead devil in some way.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:20.500
 So Lindbergh, he did New York to Paris in 1924.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.340
 I did not know this thing about it.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.140
 He had to get rid of all non-essential equipment, make the plane as light as possible.

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.220
 So he took out all non-essential equipment and then he put a big fuel tank on the front

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.580
 of the plane so he could have as much fuel as he needed.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.260
 Unfortunately, that meant he could not see out in front of him.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.260
 No.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.260
 I'm not even kidding.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.260
 Oh, my God.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.380
 To see out of the plane in front of him, he had a few options.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.540
 He installed a periscope in the cockpit.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.540
 Oh, my God.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:48.780
 He also sometimes just had to open the right hand door to peek out the front.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.780
 Oh, my God.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:54.260
 And his final option was just to turn the plane sideways for a bit.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.260
 That's how I drive.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.260
 It does work.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.260
 It does.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.260
 But, yeah, aerial acrobatics was super popular in the 1920s.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.020
 It was this very specific phase because a lot of people learned to fly in the First World

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.740
 War and then they realized they could make a living out of it.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.100
 And barn storming, it was called, and it became this very popular thing.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.980
 And I can't tell if it was, I think the etymology of it is vaguely unclear.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:22.420
 It's either because people would often do these amazing aerial acrobatics in, like, fields.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.940
 And people would stand by a barn and watch.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.380
 But also quite a common trick they'd do is to fly through a barn.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.020
 So they'd open the doors of the barn, and then you had to fly your plane through the barn

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.020
 and come out the other end.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.180
 It's not where the trope of bursting into a barn, and then you burst out the other end

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.700
 and all the chickens, you know, flapping around, madly.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.820
 The trope, you know, it happens in every show.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.420
 It's a sign-failed run into a barn.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.420
 It happens less than a pun that's showing.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:51.260
 But is that obviously where the word barn store, it was a real barn store, man?

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.260
 I think it is.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:57.220
 I've seen videos of them flying through, and I'm sure that must be where it comes from.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.380
 Yeah, it must be.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.380
 Yeah.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.060
 I think they played some stunt games of tennis on plates.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.060
 No, oh my gosh.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.060
 On the wings.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.060
 On the wings?

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:10.060
 From one wing to another, there are a few photos of people doing, oh, it's wing-walking.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.660
 You know, normally you're just sort of discreetly strapped to the plane.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.780
 You're not standing completely free because obviously you'd immediately fall off.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.860
 Does that mean you had to hit the ball ahead of where the person was at this eye?

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.460
 I mean, how does physics work, aren't they?

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:26.180
 I think the person who really suffers is the ballboy.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.780
 There's a guy called Omar Locklear, who was a 20s stunt pilot.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.740
 I think was the first person to fly from one plane to another in mid-air, possibly.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:34.740
 Sorry.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.740
 Fly from one plane to another.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:36.740
 Sorry, climb.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:41.380
 He launched a smaller plane out of the window of a John Hood jet.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.660
 That's incredible.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:48.780
 So Omar Locklear was a stunt pilot in the 20s in a film called The Great Air Robbery.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:53.300
 His one stunt he did, he climbed down from a plane to a speeding car, fought the baddie

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.620
 for a bit, kicked the baddie out of the car, then he grabbed the plane's undercarriage

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.300
 and climbed back into it as the car overturned and crashed.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.860
 You should never climb back into someone's undercarriage.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.860
 It's very weird.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.060
 Do you know another old cure for deafness around about this time?

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:16.540
 The 1920s and before was to make your own artificial eardrum or have an artificial eardrum inserted.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.540
 You could order them.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.540
 I was going to say online.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:24.740
 They sent you things that were of a made of else claw or pig's bladder or fishbone or something

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.940
 called gold beater's skin, which I didn't know about, but your dad probably would, Andy,

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:33.340
 because it's in used in the gold leaf making process and apparently it's animal intestine.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.420
 Anyway, you put this on a little stick and you put it in your ear and it apparently replaced

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.420
 your eardrum.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:46.420
 It didn't work, but it was invented in 1853 or pioneered by a doctor called Joseph Toinby,

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.420
 who is Polly Toinby's great grandfather.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.420
 Wow.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.420
 Isn't that weird?

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.420
 That's good.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.940
 I read the other day and I haven't looked into this.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:59.780
 I just saw the headline that your eardrum moves the same way as your eyes move.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:04.500
 So when your eyes kind of move to the left or right, your eardrum slightly move around.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.500
 Wow.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.860
 It is, you know, when they, like, can't say I've seen just doing it themselves, our eardrums

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:09.860
 is obviously doing it.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:10.860
 Yeah.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.860
 Oh my god.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:12.860
 I can kind of feel it.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.860
 If you remember.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:14.860
 All right.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.860
 I mean, you think that might be your ear bones moving in your jaw.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.860
 Oh yeah.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.860
 Yeah, it might be.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.860
 All right.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.940
 The other thing with, you know, like, well, I can feel it too.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.260
 Yes, it might be your ear bones.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.260
 You have ear bones too.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.260
 I don't know.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.260
 Is it the ear bone?

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.260
 No.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.260
 I'm just moving my eyes.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.260
 Oh, wait.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.260
 There's something moving in there.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.260
 Yeah.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.460
 I think that's your jaw moving, which is connecting to your ear bones.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.620
 Why would my jaw move when I'm just moving my eyes?

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.860
 Because you're moving the muscles around your eyes to look that way.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.660
 Carrie, I've been really into logical facts-based explanations here.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.540
 So this is kind of a psychological affliction that they thought could be cured by flying.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:52.420
 And there was another fashion for curing psychological affliction in about the 1920s.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.980
 And this was pioneered by this doctor called Henry Cotton.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.980
 And I'd never heard of this.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:01.740
 But he thought that all madness or depression or anxiety was caused by physical stuff and

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.620
 could all be cured by surgery.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.900
 So he used to just pull more and more body parts out of people until they were cured.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.900
 So we'd start with the teeth.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.380
 So you'd go in and you'd pull out all of your teeth if you were mad.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.220
 And then if you still, he'd go for another body part.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.220
 He'd keep on going.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.220
 So then-

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.220
 He's like that game operative.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.220
 No, no, no.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.220
 I bet he invented it.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.220
 He was like, I get it.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.220
 Yeah.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.220
 It was fun.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.220
 It was not like operation.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.220
 He'd go tonsils next and then adenoise, and then he'd remove your colon.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.220
 If you still weren't here.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:30.220
 I feel like you need your colon, don't you?

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.220
 I feel like you need--

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.220
 What about the appendix?

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.220
 No.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:37.220
 I mean, once my stomach's gone, yes, my anxiety is going to go because I'm trying to deal

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.220
 with not having a stomach.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.220
 Yeah.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.220
 So I'm probably just going to be really upset.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.220
 Probably not.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.220
 Well, platypluses don't have stomachs.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.220
 Don't they?

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.220
 No, they used to be very anxious.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.220
 I don't know.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.220
 They don't.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.820
 And they used to-- this happened to my granny.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.820
 They used to pull out all your teeth as prevention for tooth decay.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.980
 So when you were like 18 or 21, and this was offered to her, she was extremely poor working

00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.980
 car salient.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.540
 And so they said, well, to save you some money and worrying about your teeth, just take

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.140
 them all out.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.140
 Did you go for it?

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.140
 Yes, you had to hold everything or tooth removed at any moment.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.140
 My granny was offered it.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.140
 Didn't take them all from me.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.140
 My lady.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.140
 My lady.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.140
 Yeah.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.140
 This guy did pull out his own children's and wife's teeth as soon as he had children and a

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.140
 wife.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.140
 So he had children and a wife over there.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.140
 At what point in the ceremony or the reception did he do it?

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.140
 The christening.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.140
 There's one in there.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.140
 Now I'll kiss the bride.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.140
 Well, just one thing before I do it.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.140
 You may now fly over the bride's mouth open.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:37.140
 Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is James Huckett.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:42.020
 Okay, my fact this week is that there is a patch of snow in Scotland that fell 11 years

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.860
 ago and is just melted this week.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:45.860
 That is amazing.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.860
 It's sad.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.860
 It's very sad.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.860
 I thought it was amazing.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.860
 When I looked into it, I realized it was sad.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.860
 Super sad.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.860
 The first one was like, wow.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.860
 Oh.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.860
 Sad.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:59.300
 So there are these people who kind of always looking for the last bit of snow that's on the Scottish

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.300
 mountains.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.660
 And most years, it's still there when it starts snowing again.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.580
 So it's always going to be there and actually it always melts from the top.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.500
 So the bit at the bottom will have been there for the whole time.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.580
 But this week, and I'm going on a bit of a limb because as we're doing this podcast,

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:19.180
 I think there might still be a tiny bit there, but it's like a bit the size of a rucksack

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.180
 or something.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.180
 There's hardly anything.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:25.660
 And it looks like it's on its last legs, probably, we're recording this on September 29th.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.780
 And I think by the 30th or by the start of October, it'll definitely be gone.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.980
 God, but you're in trouble if there's an uninfected blizzard in Scotland over the next week.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.980
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:34.980
 Yeah.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.380
 Hasn't it only disappeared six times in the last 300 years or something?

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.380
 Yeah.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.380
 I'd like that.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.380
 So, yeah.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.180
 In the last 300 years, there have only been six times when there's been no snow on the

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.180
 ground in Britain.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.180
 God, yeah.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.340
 Every time you listen to the news at the moment, you feel like it's end of days.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.020
 And you read a story like that where you go, and the snow has also gone.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.820
 And you think, oh, God.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.020
 But it's got a name.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.020
 Yeah.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.020
 And there's a few of them.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.980
 I think the one that I'm talking about is called the Spinks.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.980
 Yeah.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.100
 And it's because there's a rock above it that looks a bit like the Spinks.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.100
 I don't know.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.100
 That was the reason.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.100
 Yeah.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.100
 And what do you think it was?

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.900
 I thought it was like the patch of snow asked you a riddle when you get there.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.140
 And if you answer wrong, it folds you into its cold heart.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.140
 I don't know.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.140
 That's how it keeps going.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.140
 Yeah.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.940
 But there's one more virgin to come and ask you the question.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:23.940
 Andy, whenever.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:24.940
 Hey.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.980
 So these people are very interesting guys.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.620
 There's no patch hunters.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.620
 Yes.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.620
 And so we only know about this because of this guy, Ian Cameron.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.620
 Yeah.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.820
 And he's like one of the main guys.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.740
 And he often goes and tries to find these patches and then we'll take photos of them.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:43.100
 And then eventually, pretty much if Ian Cameron says they're not there anymore, they're

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.100
 probably not there anymore.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.100
 Yeah.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.340
 And he's got a Facebook group which you can go on and, you know, every few days he posts

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.940
 and he's like, oh, there's still a little bit left here, but probably not tomorrow.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:56.460
 But and all of the data he gathers is really useful for climate scientists because he's

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.660
 got a record stretching back years and years now, which is very useful in terms of the

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.660
 temperature on the ground.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.820
 And this is what they think it's climate change, is that what?

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:03.820
 Yeah.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:04.820
 What he is quite circumspect about it.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.460
 He says, look, I'm just going to leave it to the scientists to decide this kind of stuff.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.620
 I wish more people would take that too.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.660
 I suppose it seems pretty likely that it's climate change, right?

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:18.740
 Well, you know, what I like Ian, I can leave it to the scientists, but clearly it's bad.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.820
 But he told the new statesman when they spoke to him, he said, it might sound weird to say,

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.500
 but it's like seeing an elderly relative or an old friend.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.140
 You're slightly disappointed if it's not in as good a condition.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.140
 Oh.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.740
 And you're really disappointed if you turn up and it's not there.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:33.740
 Yeah.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.740
 He is all about the snow, isn't he?

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.740
 Yeah.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.820
 He just, he only cares about these snow patches and he says he, I'm sure he cares about

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:40.820
 other things.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.060
 He's a wife covering herself in snow, look at me, Ian, look at me.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.940
 His children wearing snow hats, eating snow.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.020
 He's desperately putting carrots out in front of their nose.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.180
 Daddy, are we snow now?

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.180
 No, you're hot.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.620
 You're hot and you're nothing to me.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.380
 It's so easy, it's not like that being Ian's child.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:05.380
 I would like to have said he actually reported he's an enthusiast, but he is not mad.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.620
 So tell that to his poor melting wife.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:12.580
 I think Ian Cameron is a bit of a hero because he's like looking at this kind of thing and

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:16.340
 not, not what else is, but actually it's like you say really good data and...

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.340
 No, he's amazing.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.340
 It's amazing, obviously.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:24.260
 What people do seem to be taking notice, there's a whole Wikipedia article called Snow Patches

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:28.900
 in Scotland, which I suspect maybe Ian Cameron wrote this.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:33.420
 There are things like, it's so weird, it does seem to be a big thing based on this.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.940
 So it describes a relatively little known snow patch, which was Scotland's largest at the

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.940
 time of writing.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:43.340
 It said this patch does not appear in the no literature on the subject, so it may be

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.340
 very under-recorded.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.340
 Only the hips does know about that one.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.340
 It's really obscure.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.340
 You probably haven't heard of it.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.940
 Do you want some good news?

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:50.940
 Sure.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.940
 Sure.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.940
 You don't know about the world's tallest snow woman?

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:54.940
 Of course.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:55.940
 Guys, I feel like...

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:56.940
 Mrs Cameron.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:02.420
 So her name is Olympia and she is 30 feet shorter than the statue of Liberty.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.420
 Oh, wow.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.420
 Yeah.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:13.340
 Her arms consist of 27 foot tall evergreens and she has 16 skis for eyelashes and 2,000 feet

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.340
 of rope hair.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.340
 She is amazing.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:20.980
 And five red autotires for lips, which were painted by the Mahousuk Kids Association.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.980
 So basically the whole town got together and made this...

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.740
 This is from the photo, this absolute travesty of a snow person.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.980
 I don't know what the parrot is made of, because presumably that's the size of a bus.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:37.180
 The parrot knows it's made of muslin, chicken wire and wood frame by the MSAD number 44 elementary

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.180
 school children.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.180
 Yeah.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.180
 It's amazing.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:44.220
 I have to say, if that magically came to life and approached me one night, I would run for

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.220
 the hills.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.220
 And why is that might...

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:47.220
 Why would that happen?

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.220
 We're liking that.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.220
 Like in the snowman.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.220
 Oh, I see.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.220
 Christmas things.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.020
 I would not go walking in the air with that meat.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.500
 I would sit indoors with a hairdryer on full blast if it came near me.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.060
 I mean, it's not 100% clear just looking at this from a bit of a distance that she

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.060
 is a woman.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.060
 It's one of the eyelashes.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.060
 It's one of the eyelashes.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.180
 They give you any eyelashes in the classic cartoon version of gender.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.180
 I think a snow vagina will be a bit much at this.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.020
 You don't see many snow penises on the old snowman, do you?

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.020
 You do, too.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.020
 Walking.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.020
 You don't.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.020
 Maybe you don't.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.020
 You don't.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.020
 Hang it down in walking in the air.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.020
 I didn't notice.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.020
 You see a lot of snow penises.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.020
 So.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.500
 Have you guys heard about the oldest ever ice?

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.500
 Oh.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.500
 Is it an Antarctica?

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.500
 Yes, it is.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.500
 It's discovered this year.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.460
 It dates back, guys.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.780
 2.7 million years.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:35.780
 What?

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.780
 Yeah.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.540
 Is that the one that Putin drank?

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.540
 I'm sincerely hoping not.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:41.540
 Do you not remember that?

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.540
 He did that.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.100
 They drilled down to some really old ice and they melted it and Putin drank it.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.620
 Well, just dropped it in a whiskey or something.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.620
 He's going to live forever.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:54.220
 No, he wasn't down at the bottom of the hole, eating the ice and then they dropped down

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.220
 to him.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:59.740
 Yeah, no, so as a climate scientist, keep on drilling down because the snow that falls

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:04.700
 and then compacts an Antarctica, obviously, not obviously, but it has tiny bubbles of air,

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.540
 which tell you a huge amount about the climate 2 million years ago and you can find out how

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.700
 much carbon dioxide there was and what that means for the temperature of the earth, which

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.860
 is going to be very useful for us over the next century.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:21.660
 But this year in April, there was a freezer in Canada where they had ice cores that

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.780
 dated back thousands and thousands of years.

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.300
 Yeah, your way ahead of me, Carried.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.300
 No.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.300
 There was a freezer malfunction.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.300
 No.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.300
 And they melted.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.300
 Guys.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.620
 I've had that with ice cream and it's really disappointing.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.620
 Yeah.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.620
 It is so disappointing.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.620
 Well, imagine if there was 22,000 years of history in your ice cream.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.580
 If it's green and black chocolate, I'd be as upset as I would be.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:47.920
 And the director of the Canadian ice core archives guy called Martin Sharp and he said, "Fuck!"

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.260
 This is a bad day for Martin Sharp.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.660
 He said, "I've had better days."

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.460
 Oh, you love Martin.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.620
 But by a massive stroke of luck, which sounds crazy, but there was a massive stroke of

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:04.740
 like 90% of it was saved, solely because camera crew had been filming a documentary about

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.180
 this ice core archive and they had said, "Can we move most of it into this other freezer

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.180
 which has better lighting?"

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.180
 No.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.180
 So thank god.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.180
 Wow.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.180
 Most of it was saved.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.180
 That's amazing.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.180
 Is it like an ice cream where if it re-freezes, it's not quite as good?

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.180
 I think that's right.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.180
 I think that's right.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.980
 And then you still eat it, but you think, "Oh, I should have eaten this early."

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:20.980
 Yeah.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.300
 It's hard to shove the little bubbles of ancient carbon dioxide back in at the right

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.300
 height.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.500
 Well, that's something though, because they're like time capsules, but from literally millions

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:32.900
 of years ago, I kind of find the fact that these bubbles are 2.7 million years old, more

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.580
 exciting than the ice, because it's like a little world, even though it doesn't have the

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:40.620
 cool stuff like the blue Peter, Baton, or whatever, inside it, it's still like a little

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.620
 time capsule.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.540
 Apparently, you're not supposed to make snowmen in Antarctica.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.540
 Really?

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.540
 Why?

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.540
 It's a boo according to the telegraph.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:48.540
 It's a boo.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:49.540
 They're so uptight.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:54.940
 Apparently, the rules are designed to prevent the Antarctic's animals from being disturbed.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.940
 Yeah.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.940
 That's fair enough.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:57.940
 Animals, penguins?

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:58.940
 I don't know.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:29:59.940
 They might be like, "What is that?"

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:00.940
 Yeah.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:01.940
 You know, "Hey, that's my snow."

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.620
 It might be like, "I came into your house and rolled up all your cushions and made a giant

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.620
 cushion, man."

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:06.620
 And you woke up.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.620
 Yeah.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.220
 It does sound like I'd wake up, because it sounds like that happened in a dream, I think, the

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.220
 other day.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.220
 It sounds like the penguins.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.220
 They're like, just in my no business.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.220
 Suddenly, someone's taking all their like hours.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.700
 The Antarctica had no land animals, permanent land animals, apart from that tiny fly.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.700
 Got penguins.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.700
 I think it says now.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.900
 Yeah, but they live in the sea.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:28.020
 I think we did this on QI, the only permanent land animal is a midge with no wings.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.900
 Hey, and what the midge doesn't have feelings?

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.900
 Yeah.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.580
 It's even worse for the midge, because if you could be quite a small snowman, but to them,

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.380
 it's going to look like that one from Maine.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.380
 The princess.

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.380
 The princess.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.380
 Okay.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:40.380
 I now understand.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.740
 Andy has a point, because what about the Antarctic bases they built and all the snowing

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:44.740
 stations?

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.900
 No one's like, "Hey, we're disturbing them, are they?"

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.900
 No.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:48.900
 The penguins are fine with that.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:49.900
 Yeah, they're fine.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:57.900
 But let's start with the midges.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.780
 Okay, it's time for a final fact.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.180
 And that is my fact this week.

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:07.060
 My fact is that the first person ever to use the word "sponge cake" was Jane Austen.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.060
 Oh.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.060
 Oh.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.060
 Good old Jane.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.060
 Good old Jane.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.980
 Now, we mentioned this, because Carrie had you are in an imporised comedy group called

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.980
 "Ostentatious", which is about Jane Austen.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:16.980
 Yeah, I am, eh, Jane.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.980
 Great.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.980
 She's in that with me.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:19.980
 I'm a perger.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:20.980
 I'm a perger, yeah.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:21.980
 Joe is a perger, isn't that Rachel Powers?

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.980
 He's a great comic, isn't he?

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:23.980
 He's an amazing guy.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.980
 He does very well.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.980
 Andy is also in that group with me.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:27.980
 I am.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:28.980
 I'm in Austen.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:29.980
 Yes.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.980
 And you guys have got some big shows coming up.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:31.980
 We have.

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:32.980
 We're going to the West End for three dates.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:33.980
 The Piccadilly Theatre.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.980
 We're going to December 5th, January 23rd, and special Valentine's Day, February 13th.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:39.980
 Go the day before.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.980
 That's what all the fashionable couples are doing.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.980
 And then, on February the 14th, you can do something actually fun.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.980
 Yeah.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:46.980
 Exactly.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:47.980
 Exactly.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.980
 At the Piccadilly Theatre at 730, yeah, Austen Tatias are playing their biggest dates yet.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.980
 And we've both seen it, and it's amazing.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:53.980
 It's fantastic, yeah.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:54.980
 So, sponge cake.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.980
 So, we know our Jane Austen, right, Andy?

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:57.980
 We know our Jane Austen.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.980
 But she coined the word sponge cake.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.980
 She's got a few citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, and this is...

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.980
 So, it doesn't mean that she invented the sponge cake.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.980
 She's the first person just to write it down.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.980
 They called it something else before her.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.980
 Do they call it cake sponge?

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.980
 Yeah.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:16.980
 So, the first record of the word comes from her writings.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.980
 I'm not even convinced it's a word.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.980
 Well, is it two words or is it one word?

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.980
 I thought she wrote it down hyphenated.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.980
 She wrote it down hyphenated in a letter to her sister.

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:28.980
 She said, "You know how interesting the purchase of a sponge cake is to me."

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:32.980
 I think it was a famous Jane Austen sense of humour coming in there.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.980
 So, it's interesting.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.980
 The first mention of a sponge cake, is it being given a sick burn in a letter?

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.980
 Which is a shame, because sponge cake is a great thing.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.980
 But do you know the words that she either coined or first usage,

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.980
 the first evidence of it comes from her?

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.980
 I went through the OED and found as many as I could.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.980
 Did you read the whole thing?

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:51.980
 Well...

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.980
 I've only started at the beginning, I can't believe it.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:54.980
 Hard fact, no.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.980
 Antibilius.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:57.980
 Ooh.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.980
 They're all kind of very ostony words, the ones.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.980
 Like there's coddle, cousinly.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.980
 She invented coddle.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.980
 She didn't invent them, I suppose.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.980
 But she's the first example we have of it.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:08.980
 Okay.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.980
 But isn't it like you coddle an egg?

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:11.980
 Yeah.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.980
 Yeah, so maybe it's coddle in just that specific term as a molly coddle.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:16.980
 Right, yeah, yeah.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.980
 Irrepressible obtrusiveness.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.980
 Tittope.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.980
 What's tittope?

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.980
 Tittope.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.980
 It's the study of titt.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.980
 Tittope.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:26.980
 Tittope.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.980
 Sorry, I'm sorry.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:28.980
 I'm sorry.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:29.980
 It's apology.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:30.980
 Tittope.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.980
 I'm already photographing.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:32.980
 Oh, I'm getting confused.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:33.980
 Tittope.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.980
 I think it means like a tittope.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.980
 Oh, yes.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.980
 And there's suppose a tittope is a mistake or something?

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.980
 No.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.980
 Darcy's always tittopping, isn't he?

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.980
 That bull went really tittopping.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.980
 That's how Lizzie felt.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.980
 Garde as into garde about.

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.980
 You're kidding, the verbal use of garde.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:54.980
 That's cool.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:55.980
 I think that's better than sponge cakes, to be honest.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:56.980
 Yes, it is.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.980
 Garde about.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:58.980
 They're quite neat words.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:59.980
 Yeah, that's what I think as well.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:02.980
 It's not like Shakespeare who just invented "the" and "an".

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.980
 All the main words.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.980
 Before that, we just literally garde.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.980
 I've got some mind-blowing news on that, Anna.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:12.980
 Oh, yeah.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.980
 So Shakespeare's always said that Shakespeare invented 1700 words, right?

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.980
 And I'm always saying it.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.980
 And so the words include "bump, hurry, road".

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.980
 I mean, it's nonsense.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:32.980
 So the reason that he gets all these citations is because the first team of people

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:37.980
 in Piling the Oxford English Dictionary knew his works intimately because they were all lexicographers.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:41.980
 So when they were thinking, "Where's the word critical?"

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.980
 They say, "Oh, there is a critical in whatever play it was."

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.980
 And then, now that we've got better technology, we're going back and we're finding way earlier ones.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.980
 So we thought that the word puke was a Shakespearean coinage.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:56.980
 Turns out it dates back to 1465, almost two centuries before Shakespeare wrote it.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.980
 I bet you also was saying the word "road".

00:34:58.980 --> 00:34:59.980
 Come on.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.980
 No, it wasn't gone on a road.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.980
 Yeah, because it would be weird if Shakespeare's plays were just full of words that no one had heard of.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.980
 Well, the audience would be back full.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.980
 Well, imagine the reviews, you know?

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.980
 But you know people say, "No, I find Shakespeare harder to understand."

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.980
 Perhaps that's what's happening.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.980
 In the 16th century, people are like, "I don't know. It's not about. I can't really find a road."

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.980
 Did you see the amazing website right, like ostin.com?

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:23.980
 No.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.980
 So it tells you you couldn't type in a word and it will tell you how many times you used it.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.980
 So she only used the word "swoon" four times.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.980
 We used that word quite a lot.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.980
 She used the word "curtzy" six times.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.980
 She never used the word "marval".

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:38.980
 So was it...

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.980
 She had embedded superheroes in us.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:42.980
 No, no.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.980
 She was mainly using the word "DC".

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.980
 She did?

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.980
 There were things that I think that she may have invented.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.980
 Like, so the phrase "Tom Dick or Harry" I think comes from her.

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.980
 And you can imagine her thinking that up from her own head.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:56.980
 Right?

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:57.980
 Or dog tired.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:58.980
 Comes from Jane Austen.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.980
 Again, like, that's the kind of thing maybe she had made up.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:02.980
 Good writing.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:03.980
 Yeah.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.980
 If I've told you once, I've told you 100 times.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:06.980
 No, she came up with that.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:07.980
 Yeah, that was from her.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:08.980
 That is a biggie.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:09.980
 That's probably her.

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:10.980
 I'd say that's her lasting achievement.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.980
 Yeah, but you're only saying that because you've been told that a lot of times.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.980
 I think it's about puke.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:16.980
 Yeah.

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:23.980
 Jane Austen wrote not very well according to this professor.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.980
 This is really interesting.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:26.980
 I'm bristling.

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.980
 According to a lot of people as well.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:32.980
 I've put a lot of men throughout the years have written a heart of views of her.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.980
 Well, Virginia Woolf didn't like her much.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:35.980
 Oh, no, that is true.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.980
 Well, Virginia Woolf was a man.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.980
 It's extremely interesting you raised Virginia Woolf.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.980
 So this is a study done by his professor Catherine Sutherland.

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:47.980
 And basically, what she's saying is Jane Austen didn't write like we think she wrote.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:48.980
 That was the work of an editor.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:52.980
 So I agree with Carrie Hadd and Andy that, like, her novels are perfection in terms

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.980
 of, like, the construction of the sentences and the English language.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.980
 But what this academic says is that that was all the editor.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:03.980
 And if you look at her works, her first drafts of works, she writes totally differently.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:04.980
 They're just...

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.980
 They're just dolarbings with prey on the back of a mirror.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.980
 So Darcy, big nice man, came in the room.

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:10.980
 Yeah.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.980
 And he was like, so nice.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.980
 Well, she was more experimental.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.980
 So it actually sounds like she was more interesting.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.980
 And she said that she wrote a bit more like Virginia Woolf.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.980
 So for instance, when she had exchanges between characters, like speech exchange,

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.980
 like speech exchanges, she wouldn't separate out one speaker from another.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.980
 So it would all be like, blurred in a more stream of consciousness,

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.980
 it kind of way.

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.980
 Which is keeping the idea of speech, which is so good at.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:31.980
 The speech is so good.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:32.980
 Yeah.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.980
 Well, the editor was wanting her to separate it out.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:35.980
 And she couldn't spell.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.980
 So she didn't know which one, first, of I&E.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:40.980
 She didn't know punctuation.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.980
 But also, most people didn't spell.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.980
 Yeah, the rules hadn't been set.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.980
 You and on you had not been set, though.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:46.980
 Yes.

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.980
 The rules hadn't been set.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.980
 I think maybe she was a little bit worse than other writers at the time.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.980
 And also, she didn't separate things into paragraphs very well.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.980
 She was a woman in the 19th century, or the one before that.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:57.980
 She didn't.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.980
 She hadn't had a lot of education.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:01.980
 I'm not saying she didn't do very well.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.980
 We're really bristling, aren't we?

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.980
 Could it be that she didn't try and write sponge cake?

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.980
 She just misspelled sponge carcass.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:10.980
 Sponge cake.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:11.980
 What, what is that in, Jane?

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:15.980
 You know how interesting the purchase of a sponge cake is to me.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.980
 That is a way more interesting letter to be fair.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.980
 Virginia Woolf said that one of the reasons that she was so popular

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.980
 is there are 25 elderly gentlemen living in the neighborhood of London

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.980
 who resent any slight upon her genius

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.980
 as if it were an insult to the chastity of their aunts.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:33.980
 Wow.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:34.980
 And that's a lovely sentence.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:35.980
 She's equally brilliant writer.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.980
 Virginia Woolf.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:37.980
 I know it's so sad.

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.980
 They're both so fantastic and yet didn't like each other.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.980
 Well, it wasn't that many opinions on the show table.

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.980
 They will come in the years after my death.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.980
 A woman who is crap.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:51.980
 And I will call her Virginia Woolf, but spell wool from her.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.980
 But didn't Charlotte Bronte hate her as well?

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.980
 I'm sure it's a quote from Bronte that said,

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.980
 "I read that and I recognize no love that I've ever known."

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.980
 I can imagine the Bronte is not getting along with her.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.980
 You were all howling on a moor somewhere.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:04.980
 Very different vibe.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.980
 But wasn't it that when the Brontes came out they were really popular

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.980
 and Jane Austen went out of favour for all of them?

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.980
 Completely out of favour.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:14.980
 And actually, I think it's partly only due to cinema that she's back in.

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.980
 So silent movies, very bad.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:17.980
 Improvised comedy.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:18.980
 Oh, yeah.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.980
 We have affected her sales quite heavily.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.980
 Silent movies, I think, would have been terrible for Austin

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.980
 because it's all conversation.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.980
 I think the first adaptation was 1940, a bright impression.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.980
 Yes, an amazing film, black and white film.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.980
 Starring Laurence Olivier.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:33.980
 Yes.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:34.980
 Lizzie Bennett.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:35.980
 First of all.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.980
 There's been some amazing spin-offs.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.980
 I don't know anyone looked into this.

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:45.980
 I mean, obviously the Austin industry, myself and Andy are employed by,

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:46.980
 is huge.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:50.980
 And there's lots of fan fiction and lots of people writing other books.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.980
 So I just looked up, like, top of the top 20 of other books.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.980
 There's just, like, definitely not Mr Darcy.

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:56.980
 Prom and prejudice.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:57.980
 Colonel Brandon Styrie.

00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:58.980
 Pride and prejudice.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:39:59.980
 And zombies.

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:00.980
 Mr Darcy takes a wife.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:02.980
 Pride and prejudice continues.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.980
 They read titles from my show.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:04.980
 Wow.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.980
 Like, they are incredible amounts.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.980
 I read that a lot of people do this fan fiction

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.980
 because there's not enough sex in the actual version.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:12.980
 Yes, a lot of it is sexy.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.980
 Darcy's passions, Pride and Prejudice we told through his eyes,

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:20.980
 by Regina Jeffers, I think is a little bit more sexy than her stuff,

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.980
 because she doesn't really go into it, it has to be said.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.980
 Darcy and Elizabeth, nights and days at Pemberley.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:26.980
 Oh, really?

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.980
 These are all available to my guys.

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.980
 More nights and days are right.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.980
 Hot nights at Pemberley.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.980
 Mr Darcy's undoing a Pride and Prejudice variation.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.980
 Do you know her sexiest line, maybe,

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.980
 or the line that most overtly refers to sex?

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:42.980
 No.

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:43.980
 It's pretty--

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.980
 It's a list of sponge cocks.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.980
 I would like to see sponge cocks square pants.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.980
 The kids TV show.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.980
 Oh, my God.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.980
 This is just a real classic Jane Auster line.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.980
 It's in Mansfield Park, Fanny Price, the main character.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.980
 Fanny Price is the root name.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:58.980
 It's Fanny.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:40:59.980
 It's Fanny.

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.980
 No, it's a reference to her getting pregnant.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.980
 And the sentence is just about, it's one of the last sentences.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.980
 It's about how Fanny Price now has been to come into some money

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.980
 just after they had been married long enough

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.980
 to begin to want an increase of income.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.980
 Oh.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.980
 That's not the rudest line in Mansfield Park.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.980
 It is an overt reference to sex, though.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.980
 Well, would you like an overt reference to something else?

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:20.980
 You know I would.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.980
 It's in Mansfield Park as well.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.980
 And there's a character called Mary Crawford,

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:25.980
 who's a bad, bad girl.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.980
 And she's talking about the admiralty.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.980
 And she says she used to know a load of admirals.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:32.980
 And she says,

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:36.980
 "Of rears and vices, I saw enough."

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:37.980
 Of rears and vices.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:38.980
 And vices.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:39.980
 "Of rears and vices."

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:40.980
 "Of rears and vices."

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.980
 "Of rears and vices."

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:42.980
 "Of rears and vices."

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.980
 Which are both kinds of admiral, but they're also both references to something else.

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:45.980
 I don't get it.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.980
 So vices as in woodwork.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:48.980
 Yes, okay.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.980
 "Rearers in the back of the room."

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:51.980
 Yes.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:52.980
 Yeah, no.

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:53.980
 And that's an incredibly filthy line.

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:54.980
 That is quite raunchy.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.980
 I don't know.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.980
 People are, the academic community is divided over whether it refers to Sodomile or Spanking.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.980
 But it's one of the two.

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:06.980
 I find it hint that Mary Corpid is a very saucy, not, not nice lady.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.980
 And that's our main character in trouble.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:09.980
 So that's what she's doing.

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:10.980
 A good character study.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.980
 She could have said that she's known a lot of seemingly.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:19.980
 And without that spelling, she had to play that quite obvious.

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:23.980
 You can play Jane Austen role playing game now, which I really want to play.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:24.980
 I want to play life.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:25.980
 Yes.

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.980
 So if you don't want to book out for ostentatious.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:32.980
 No, there's this online role playing game and it sounds really fun.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:34.980
 I think I saw that at the video game.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:35.980
 Yeah.

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:38.980
 You get to pick a character and then you have all these interactions.

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:43.980
 So some guardian journalist went and played it and started out by making this character

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:48.980
 who lost her handkerchief and then found it and then went for a walk and bumped into a gentleman.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.980
 Although the writer did say that while she was going on this virtual walk,

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:56.980
 she saw a bunch of sheep stacked on top of each other.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.980
 So some of the algorithms in the game need some ironing out, she said.

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.980
 Every ostentatious novel there's a discreet sheep stack.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.980
 My lord will it be?

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.980
 The sheep are stacked so fine today.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:14.980
 About ten years ago, an ostentbuff and an author sent off some of her manuscripts

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.980
 to various British publishers, seeing if you could get them published.

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:21.980
 And he made very slight changes to the title and the characters.

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:28.980
 And the pseudonym he used was Alison Lady as an A Lady, which is an ostent's pseudonym.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.980
 It was not the world's greatest pseudonym.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.980
 He's the guy who runs the Jane Austen Festival in Bath.

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:35.980
 Well you know him well.

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:40.980
 They all rejected the manuscripts and only one of them spotted the fact that it was almost identical to Austen's work.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:44.980
 He got one letter back from Penguin, he just sent them Pride and Prejudice.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:49.980
 And they wrote back saying thank you for your recent letter and chapters from your book First Impressions.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:52.980
 It seems like a really original and interesting rite.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:55.980
 I'm going to say I really do like Penguin though, don't you?

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.980
 I'll show them around the corner.

00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:58.980
 Excellent publisher.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:43:59.980
 Oh gosh.

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:00.980
 Amazing.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.980
 And thank God they haven't spotted the art book.

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:04.980
 It's just a complete rip-off of Bleek House.

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:11.980
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.980
 Thank you very much indeed for listening.

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.980
 We will be back again next week with another podcast.

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:22.980
 But until then you can check us out on Twitter. We are at no such thing and we will have individual Twitter accounts.

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.980
 I'm on @AndruHunterM, James.

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:25.980
 @JamesHarkin, Carried.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:26.980
 @LadyCarried.

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.980
 And Anna?

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.980
 You can email podcasts at qi.com.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:34.980
 Yeah, and if you want to come and see us on tour, we've just announced a whole new bunch of tour dates.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:40.980
 We're going all over the UK and you can see that at qi.com/fishevents.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.980
 You can also see our book.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.980
 We're publishing a book which is coming out very soon.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.980
 You can get that by going to www.i.com/fishevents.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:59.980
 You can go to the ATG website or you can go to ostentatiousimpro.com for its last shows.

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:03.980
 And that has all the booking links for all our London shows and our UK tour as well.

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:04.980
 Lovely.

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:05.980
 Okay, we'll see you next week.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:06.980
 Thank you very much for listening.

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:07.980
 Goodbye.

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.980
 Goodbye.
