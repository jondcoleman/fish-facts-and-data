00:00:12,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode.
00:00:16,00:00:18,"No such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:18,00:00:21,coming to you from the QI office in Covent Garden.
00:00:21,00:00:23,My name is Andrew Hunter Murray and I'm sitting here
00:00:23,00:00:25,"with James Harkin, Anna Teginski,"
00:00:25,00:00:28,and our special guest this week is Carrie Lloyd.
00:00:28,00:00:30,Carrie Ad is a comedian we all know.
00:00:30,00:00:31,She's been on QI a load of times.
00:00:31,00:00:34,"She's in an improvised show called ostentatious,"
00:00:34,00:00:37,which is Jane Austen based improvised comedy with me.
00:00:37,00:00:40,And she also is the presenter and host
00:00:40,00:00:43,"and producer and everything of the podcast grief cast,"
00:00:43,00:00:47,"which is about grief and about people you've lost,"
00:00:47,00:00:49,but it's also very uplifting and charming
00:00:49,00:00:50,and funny and wonderful.
00:00:50,00:00:52,So do give that a listen.
00:00:52,00:00:54,"Okay, starting with fact number one this week,"
00:00:54,00:00:57,and that is Carrie Lloyd.
00:00:57,00:01:00,My fact is that Unity Mittford was the only person
00:01:00,00:01:04,to be BFFs with Churchill and Hitler.
00:01:04,00:01:06,"- She was best friends forever,"
00:01:06,00:01:09,just for any 80s kids in the room.
00:01:09,00:01:11,"- Yeah, she was definitely best buddies,"
00:01:11,00:01:12,Bezzies with Hitler.
00:01:12,00:01:14,She was very Bezzies with Hitler.
00:01:14,00:01:17,But she was also very old family friends with Churchill.
00:01:17,00:01:20,"And at some point, just before war broke out,"
00:01:20,00:01:22,"so she was living in Germany,"
00:01:22,00:01:25,basically completely in Hitler's inner circle.
00:01:25,00:01:26,She was completely there.
00:01:26,00:01:28,She used to write to her friend Winston
00:01:28,00:01:31,"and beg him very regularly to make peace with Hitler,"
00:01:31,00:01:34,because she really believed in both countries.
00:01:34,00:01:37,"Now, caveat, yes, she was a massive fascist, obviously."
00:01:37,00:01:38,"Not my saying I love her,"
00:01:38,00:01:41,but she did really believe that England and Germany
00:01:41,00:01:43,could work together and become this incredible superpower.
00:01:43,00:01:47,"And she always said, if they go to war, I'll kill myself."
00:01:47,00:01:49,I'll kill because these are my two greatest sides of my country.
00:01:49,00:01:51,"And spoiler alert, the moment war broke out,"
00:01:51,00:01:53,she went into a park and she shot herself in the head.
00:01:53,00:01:55,But spoiler spoiler alert.
00:01:55,00:01:56,It didn't work.
00:01:56,00:01:59,She survived with the bullet in her head.
00:01:59,00:02:00,Wow.
00:02:00,00:02:02,But then she did also die due to an infection.
00:02:02,00:02:04,"But much later, much, much later."
00:02:04,00:02:08,"So Hitler, her BFF, when she did shoot herself in her head,"
00:02:08,00:02:10,"Hitler felt so bad, obviously it was his fault."
00:02:10,00:02:12,"Hashtag, you caused the war."
00:02:12,00:02:15,He arranged for a train to take her to Switzerland
00:02:15,00:02:16,and then her mother.
00:02:16,00:02:19,"And I think it was Debo, the young sister, came and got her."
00:02:19,00:02:21,"But he, you know, wars breaking out,"
00:02:21,00:02:22,everyone's leaving countries.
00:02:22,00:02:24,Hitler made sure that she got out of Germany
00:02:24,00:02:26,and he knew she was going back to Britain.
00:02:26,00:02:27,And he funded her healthcare in Germany.
00:02:27,00:02:30,"It's very easy to accidentally read the story and go,"
00:02:30,00:02:31,"oh, that's quite nice."
00:02:31,00:02:32,"I know, yes."
00:02:32,00:02:34,"I know, again, he was a massive fascist,"
00:02:34,00:02:38,"but also, I think he was quite big into it."
00:02:38,00:02:40,"He was one of the worst, I would say."
00:02:40,00:02:42,"You know, there's a theory about Hitler funding all this."
00:02:42,00:02:46,"So the theory is that her sister, Deborah and her mother,"
00:02:46,00:02:49,took her home after she tried to kill herself.
00:02:49,00:02:54,She then recuperated at a little nursing home in a village
00:02:54,00:02:57,called Wiggington in Oxfordshire.
00:02:57,00:02:59,The home was a maternity home.
00:02:59,00:03:00,This.
00:03:00,00:03:01,And there is a story--
00:03:01,00:03:02,This is rubbish.
00:03:02,00:03:04,--there is a story from the woman who ran the home
00:03:04,00:03:06,that she may have had a baby.
00:03:06,00:03:09,And the baby had a tiny mustache.
00:03:09,00:03:12,That was a massive fascist.
00:03:12,00:03:13,"Yeah, and so the journalist who wrote about this,"
00:03:13,00:03:16,she asked the woman who she thought the father might be.
00:03:16,00:03:19,"And she said, well, my mother always said, it was Hitler's."
00:03:19,00:03:22,"Although there is no record of this happening,"
00:03:22,00:03:25,so it's probable there is not a secret Hitler love child.
00:03:25,00:03:27,"But they definitely copped off, didn't they?"
00:03:27,00:03:28,"No, also, that's a good--"
00:03:28,00:03:31,"Yeah, there's a lot of-- like, it was very suspicious."
00:03:31,00:03:34,"In the inner circle, all the Germans hated her."
00:03:34,00:03:35,"They were like, there's this British woman"
00:03:35,00:03:37,who Hitler literally-- she would advise him
00:03:37,00:03:38,and wind him up on stuff.
00:03:38,00:03:42,"And she was extremely jealous of Eva Braun, as well."
00:03:42,00:03:44,"And Eva Braun was very jealous of her, though, right?"
00:03:44,00:03:45,"Yeah, so Unity definitely was another thing."
00:03:45,00:03:49,"But what I read seems to be that nothing happened,"
00:03:49,00:03:51,"basically, he was kind of using her,"
00:03:51,00:03:52,because she was extremely useful.
00:03:52,00:03:54,And the other weird thing about Unity
00:03:54,00:03:57,"is her middle name was Valkyrie, Unity Valkyrie Mittford."
00:03:57,00:03:59,And she was born in the town of Swastika.
00:03:59,00:04:00,So weird.
00:04:00,00:04:01,So weird.
00:04:01,00:04:04,And so it said that he was very superstitious.
00:04:04,00:04:05,And it was said when he found this stuff out about her.
00:04:05,00:04:08,"And she was a six-foot blonde, blue-eyed woman"
00:04:08,00:04:10,that he kind of felt like she was very lucky.
00:04:10,00:04:14,"But apparently, there was no way they ever slept together,"
00:04:14,00:04:16,but she definitely would have.
00:04:16,00:04:18,And she used to kind of hang out with other fascists.
00:04:18,00:04:20,And she slept with Churchill.
00:04:20,00:04:25,"No, but her sister, Deca, was married to Esmond Romney,"
00:04:25,00:04:28,who the big room it is that he was Churchill's secret son.
00:04:28,00:04:29,"And it was all sort of hidden, though."
00:04:29,00:04:30,He was actually a nephew.
00:04:30,00:04:33,"But yeah, I thought Churchill was quite happily married, though."
00:04:33,00:04:36,It's not like that massive fascist Hitler.
00:04:36,00:04:39,So this town of Swastika is in Ontario.
00:04:39,00:04:40,Yes.
00:04:40,00:04:45,"And they wanted to change the name during the war to Winston,"
00:04:45,00:04:47,because of obvious reasons.
00:04:47,00:04:49,"And they even did it, I think."
00:04:49,00:04:50,Or at least they got pretty close.
00:04:50,00:04:53,But then everyone who was living there said no.
00:04:53,00:04:54,And so they took down all the new signs.
00:04:54,00:04:55,And they said no.
00:04:55,00:04:58,We were called Swastika before Hitler came along.
00:04:58,00:05:00,We came with the idea first.
00:05:00,00:05:01,Why should we change our names?
00:05:01,00:05:04,"And they were named after the symbol,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,"which was a good luck symbol, is it Hindi?"
00:05:06,00:05:07,Or Hinduism.
00:05:07,00:05:08,"Yeah, Hinduism."
00:05:08,00:05:11,So that's where they're beforehand.
00:05:11,00:05:14,It doesn't have a fact about that guy--
00:05:14,00:05:15,"I think possibly also in Canada, who"
00:05:15,00:05:17,was called Adolf Hitler.
00:05:17,00:05:18,And it was asked if you're going to change your name.
00:05:18,00:05:23,"And he said, I'm not going to let one guy ruin the name."
00:05:23,00:05:24,And he didn't change his name.
00:05:24,00:05:27,Then they were amazing family.
00:05:27,00:05:28,"Yeah, there literally isn't one of them"
00:05:28,00:05:30,that wasn't somehow involved in something.
00:05:30,00:05:34,"So Unity was-- well, they were all bizarre, but she was bizarre."
00:05:34,00:05:37,"So she said that her and her sister grew up,"
00:05:37,00:05:39,"her to be a fascist, her sister, one of her sisters,"
00:05:39,00:05:40,that could be a communist.
00:05:40,00:05:43,And she said that they used to scratch--
00:05:43,00:05:45,"she would scratch Swastika, and her sister"
00:05:45,00:05:48,would scratch Hammer and Sickle into the window of the bedroom
00:05:48,00:05:50,"that they shared together, and the scratch was still there."
00:05:50,00:05:52,And so they really pursued their dreams.
00:05:52,00:05:54,There was an article in The Guardian about how
00:05:54,00:05:56,they're kind of inspiring in a twisted way.
00:05:56,00:05:58,"Because she was like, I'm in love with Hitler."
00:05:58,00:05:59,I'm going to go track them down.
00:05:59,00:06:00,And she didn't.
00:06:00,00:06:01,She went to Germany.
00:06:01,00:06:03,And she sat in a cafe that he frequented.
00:06:03,00:06:04,She sat there every day.
00:06:04,00:06:06,"Yeah, she sat there every single day."
00:06:06,00:06:07,"Until eventually, he was like, who's"
00:06:07,00:06:09,that six-foot-blown woman that keeps staring at me?
00:06:09,00:06:11,And that's how she got to know him.
00:06:11,00:06:13,"And apparently, she told-- she wrote to Decker and said,"
00:06:13,00:06:16,"this is my plan, like any good obsessed teenager."
00:06:16,00:06:17,This is how I'm going to get him.
00:06:17,00:06:20,"And so her and Decker, Jessica Mittford, shared a room,"
00:06:20,00:06:23,and they had a chalk line down the middle of the room.
00:06:23,00:06:25,"And at one end was a bust of Lenin,"
00:06:25,00:06:26,and the other end was a picture of Hitler.
00:06:26,00:06:27,Wow.
00:06:27,00:06:29,But they were obviously still sisters
00:06:29,00:06:30,and loved each other very much.
00:06:30,00:06:32,And then completely opposite.
00:06:32,00:06:34,"But obviously, growing up in exactly the same household."
00:06:34,00:06:37,"Do you think maybe, like, sometimes brothers and sisters"
00:06:37,00:06:39,"go against their brothers and sisters, right?"
00:06:39,00:06:39,Yeah.
00:06:39,00:06:41,"Well, if you read any of the Mittford stuff,"
00:06:41,00:06:44,"there's an amazing biography by Mary S. Lovell,"
00:06:44,00:06:47,"which is the best Mittford S. want to be, which"
00:06:47,00:06:49,says that they all of them had these incredibly obsessive
00:06:49,00:06:51,personalities and filled them with--
00:06:51,00:06:53,"so either fascism or communism, or Pam,"
00:06:53,00:06:55,who was obsessed with farming.
00:06:55,00:06:57,"She's all the best, yeah."
00:06:57,00:06:58,Pam is the one that--
00:06:58,00:06:58,Pam's the one that--
00:06:58,00:07:00,Pam's the one that everyone forgets.
00:07:00,00:07:02,But she introduced a new breed of chicken into this country.
00:07:02,00:07:04,"Yeah, so--"
00:07:04,00:07:06,And Pam apparently was quite a wit.
00:07:06,00:07:08,"And like, Evelyn Moore was in love with her."
00:07:08,00:07:09,But the only people who had her jokes were the chickens.
00:07:09,00:07:10,"Yeah, exactly."
00:07:10,00:07:11,They were sad.
00:07:11,00:07:12,With her six.
00:07:12,00:07:13,So there was--
00:07:13,00:07:14,Yeah.
00:07:14,00:07:16,And there's a brother who died in the war.
00:07:16,00:07:19,"And then you have Nancy, who was a very famous writer, Diana,"
00:07:19,00:07:21,who obviously also being a bit fascist.
00:07:21,00:07:22,They do not--
00:07:22,00:07:23,I don't know if you're well on that list.
00:07:23,00:07:25,"The mistress of Oswald Mosley, head of the bridge."
00:07:25,00:07:27,"She was the wife, the wife of eventual wife of Oswald Mosley."
00:07:27,00:07:30,"Well, I was just referring to the courting effect."
00:07:30,00:07:33,She was the only famously said Hitler had beautiful blue eyes.
00:07:33,00:07:34,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:34,00:07:36,Did she tell Stephen Fry this?
00:07:36,00:07:36,"Well, Stephen--"
00:07:36,00:07:38,"Actually, he mentioned that on QI."
00:07:38,00:07:38,Yeah.
00:07:38,00:07:41,"He says that-- Stephen Fry says that she said to him,"
00:07:41,00:07:43,"of course, you never met Hitler, did you?"
00:07:43,00:07:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:45,00:07:46,"She was an incredible woman, Diana."
00:07:46,00:07:48,And she was said to be the most beautiful woman of her age.
00:07:48,00:07:51,"Like, men were literally falling over."
00:07:51,00:07:53,"And then she married a Guinness, and had an affair,"
00:07:53,00:07:57,"not a pine-egg in his mouth, and then had an affair with Oswald"
00:07:57,00:07:59,"Mosley, and then ended up marrying him."
00:07:59,00:08:00,"And then went to prison, right?"
00:08:00,00:08:01,Went to prison.
00:08:01,00:08:03,And she was the only-- during the war they
00:08:03,00:08:04,were interred.
00:08:04,00:08:07,And she and another woman were allowed their husbands
00:08:07,00:08:08,in Holloway prison.
00:08:08,00:08:10,So she was in Holloway women's prison.
00:08:10,00:08:11,And then Oswald was allowed to join up.
00:08:11,00:08:13,Because Churchill said that was OK.
00:08:13,00:08:15,Because he was mates with the family.
00:08:15,00:08:18,And Nancy Metford was famous for doing the upper class
00:08:18,00:08:20,and lower class rights in Kingston.
00:08:20,00:08:23,You and non-You were the famous essay she wrote about.
00:08:23,00:08:24,So great ways.
00:08:24,00:08:28,"What things show you off as being posh on not posh, right?"
00:08:28,00:08:28,Yes.
00:08:28,00:08:30,Have you got to test for us?
00:08:30,00:08:32,I couldn't do one.
00:08:32,00:08:36,"How do you pronounce the word, which"
00:08:36,00:08:39,refers to a large cat with a mane?
00:08:39,00:08:40,Lion?
00:08:40,00:08:41,Lion?
00:08:41,00:08:41,No.
00:08:41,00:08:42,"Not posh, not posh."
00:08:42,00:08:43,"Oh, no."
00:08:43,00:08:44,Lion?
00:08:44,00:08:46,"Oh, you're pretty posh, isn't it?"
00:08:46,00:08:47,"I'm putting it on, I'm picking it."
00:08:47,00:08:48,It rhymes with barn.
00:08:48,00:08:49,"Apparently, lawn."
00:08:49,00:08:50,"Lawn, yeah."
00:08:50,00:08:53,"How do you pronounce the game, which I like to play,"
00:08:53,00:08:56,where I hit little balls around with a stick in a field?
00:08:56,00:08:58,Golf.
00:08:58,00:09:00,Goof.
00:09:00,00:09:02,Goof.
00:09:02,00:09:03,Goof.
00:09:03,00:09:04,Goof.
00:09:04,00:09:04,"Oh, yeah, goof."
00:09:04,00:09:05,"Who's it, goof?"
00:09:05,00:09:06,Like Darren Goff.
00:09:06,00:09:08,Go and play a game of golf.
00:09:08,00:09:09,"Oh, wow."
00:09:09,00:09:10,There was a study recently that found
00:09:10,00:09:13,the queen has become less posh over the course of her reign.
00:09:13,00:09:17,"As in, if you listen to her vowels from 1953, she's still quite posh."
00:09:17,00:09:19,"She's still quite posh, though."
00:09:19,00:09:20,"Not as posh, though."
00:09:20,00:09:21,"If you listen to the older recordings, it's almost like--"
00:09:21,00:09:23,But that's her accent is less posh.
00:09:23,00:09:26,She still lives in a massive family.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"She hasn't kept it real recently, yeah."
00:09:28,00:09:30,"But she talks quite straight, I think, as what we're saying."
00:09:30,00:09:32,"She lives in a palace, but she talks pretty straight."
00:09:32,00:09:33,She says BFF.
00:09:33,00:09:34,Yeah.
00:09:34,00:09:36,But wasn't the non-new you thing part of it
00:09:36,00:09:41,was about that thing where people who want to be posh put on posh words?
00:09:41,00:09:44,So things like Serviette instead of napkin.
00:09:44,00:09:46,So it wasn't about telling the posh from the working class.
00:09:46,00:09:50,It was about telling the posh from the middle class who wanted to be you.
00:09:50,00:09:54,The really posh don't say the posh word.
00:09:54,00:09:59,"They just call it a napkin, whereas the social climber says the Serviette."
00:09:59,00:10:00,Exactly.
00:10:00,00:10:02,"What you call it a mouth face wipe, but like that."
00:10:02,00:10:05,It's just a plain old weirdo.
00:10:05,00:10:09,"Yeah, Nancy was very like a Serbic and witty about."
00:10:09,00:10:11,So she was sort of taking the piss out of people.
00:10:11,00:10:13,"There was a lot of piss taking involve, wasn't there?"
00:10:13,00:10:14,Yeah.
00:10:14,00:10:18,"Apparently a gentleman, when he's drunk, may become amorous or mordlin"
00:10:18,00:10:24,"or vomit in public, but he would never become truculent."
00:10:24,00:10:26,That's how you know Andy's so common.
00:10:26,00:10:27,Regularly truculent.
00:10:27,00:10:28,"Fighty, fighty."
00:10:28,00:10:31,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:10:31,00:10:38,"OK, it's time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:10:38,00:10:43,"My fact this week is that in the 1920s, doctors prescribed intentionally terrifying flights"
00:10:43,00:10:45,and aeroplanes to cure deafness.
00:10:45,00:10:46,That's true.
00:10:46,00:10:48,"Why did they think that that would, what was their reason?"
00:10:48,00:10:51,"Well, I would think maybe because it makes your ears pop."
00:10:51,00:10:53,"Yeah, but likes it that."
00:10:53,00:10:54,It was not that.
00:10:54,00:10:55,"No, it was the shock factor."
00:10:55,00:10:59,"So it actually, it actually started with someone who couldn't speak."
00:10:59,00:11:04,It was an Army serviceman who I think lost the ability to speak during the First World War.
00:11:04,00:11:09,"And this is in 1921, this doctor called Charles McInerney said it was a psychological problem"
00:11:09,00:11:13,and that the solution would be going into a plane and being treated to a series of loop
00:11:13,00:11:18,the loops and nose dives and spins and things that made him think he was going to die.
00:11:18,00:11:21,"And lo and behold, he took this prescription, he did it."
00:11:21,00:11:25,"He stepped off the plane and he said, I don't know if I can speak anymore."
00:11:25,00:11:27,And it turned out he could because he said that.
00:11:27,00:11:29,And then it started being touted as a cure for everything.
00:11:29,00:11:30,Including deafness.
00:11:30,00:11:35,"So, deaf flights were a thing that was quite commonly prescribed."
00:11:35,00:11:41,"And Charles Lindbergh, very famous obviously aviator on his business card, he had deaf flights"
00:11:41,00:11:44,as one of the things that he offered to really take deaf people up.
00:11:44,00:11:48,The idea was that people might have suffered from these things for psychological reasons.
00:11:48,00:11:51,You were saying that you were a shell shocky kind of thing.
00:11:51,00:11:52,Yeah.
00:11:52,00:11:56,"So were they take, yeah, was it only if you develop deafness or was it more like, oh,"
00:11:56,00:11:57,I'd been deaf since birth?
00:11:57,00:11:59,There were some people who were deaf since birth.
00:11:59,00:12:06,"So for example, in 1930, there was a boxer called Fred Mayhem, his nickname was Dummy, which"
00:12:06,00:12:09,is a cruel nickname because he'd been deaf since the edge of eight months.
00:12:09,00:12:10,Oh my God.
00:12:10,00:12:11,So he took a flight in 1930.
00:12:11,00:12:13,It was designed to cure his hearing.
00:12:13,00:12:16,It was designed to cure his hearing with a parachute jump that he was going to take out
00:12:16,00:12:17,"of the plane, okay?"
00:12:17,00:12:21,"In front of a crowd of thousands, the parachute failed to open."
00:12:21,00:12:22,Oh my God.
00:12:22,00:12:23,And he died.
00:12:23,00:12:25,"Where's the happy ending, Andy?"
00:12:25,00:12:28,"Probably in the next factor, I'm afraid."
00:12:28,00:12:30,And sometimes people did die.
00:12:30,00:12:36,"The idea also was that it had to be a surprise, so the patients were told that."
00:12:36,00:12:37,Where are we going?
00:12:37,00:12:42,"Don't worry, just put on this backpack."
00:12:42,00:12:45,They were told they were just going in a flight because it was the altitude that cured
00:12:45,00:12:46,the deafness.
00:12:46,00:12:47,Right.
00:12:47,00:12:50,And then they'd go up in the flight and then it would be a horrible shock when you suddenly
00:12:50,00:12:53,started nose diving towards the ground or spinning around in circles because obviously
00:12:53,00:12:56,"if you knew it was going to happen, then the cure wasn't going to be effective."
00:12:56,00:13:01,"Have you heard about this flight that happened in, well, when did I have, in 1969 with Alan"
00:13:01,00:13:02,Funt?
00:13:02,00:13:03,Have you heard this before?
00:13:03,00:13:05,I don't think I've ever heard the word Alan Funt before.
00:13:05,00:13:06,Alan Funt.
00:13:06,00:13:07,I remember.
00:13:07,00:13:11,"He was the host of a prank show in America that was like absolutely massive, kind of like"
00:13:11,00:13:15,"candid camera sort of, you know, it was called candid camera."
00:13:15,00:13:16,I feel like a fuck.
00:13:16,00:13:17,What a fuck.
00:13:17,00:13:20,"Alan Funt hosted candid camera, which is like the original you've been framed."
00:13:20,00:13:25,"And he was hugely, hugely famous as much as, I would say, Jamie Beatles in his day."
00:13:25,00:13:29,And he was on a flight with his family and they had a camera crew because they were going
00:13:29,00:13:34,to film like this new prank show and it got taken hostage.
00:13:34,00:13:37,"So the plane, a guy stands up and it was at the time apparently there was loads of this"
00:13:37,00:13:40,happening and they were just constantly in '96 and being taken to Cuba.
00:13:40,00:13:42,It was like quite fashionable.
00:13:42,00:13:44,So everyone starts panicking.
00:13:44,00:13:49,"Then some of the passengers see Alan Funt and go, oh, it's a prank."
00:13:49,00:13:51,And it wasn't a prank.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"So Alan Funt standing up and he's like, it's not a prank, which obviously is what Alan"
00:13:53,00:13:54,Funt would do if it was a prank.
00:13:54,00:13:59,So the whole plane starts laughing and relaxing because they think it's a prank.
00:13:59,00:14:03,And I think they even got flown to Cuba and they were on the ground for like five hours
00:14:03,00:14:06,with everyone really relaxing king in a minute.
00:14:06,00:14:09,"Yeah, it seems like the whole plane thinking in a minute the camera's going to come out."
00:14:09,00:14:10,We're going to laugh.
00:14:10,00:14:13,And they were winding him up the whole time and he was with his wife and child.
00:14:13,00:14:18,And the daughter has recounted it and said like they just thought he was getting more and
00:14:18,00:14:20,more frustrated and upset because no one would believe it.
00:14:20,00:14:21,"Well, the hijacker."
00:14:21,00:14:22,"No, Alan Funt."
00:14:22,00:14:25,Eventually Funt hijacked the plane and he stopped.
00:14:25,00:14:26,Yeah.
00:14:26,00:14:29,Tied me to anywhere apart from Cuba.
00:14:29,00:14:30,It did happen a lot.
00:14:30,00:14:33,"I remember Andy had a fact where there was a guy who said, take me to Cuba, but the flight"
00:14:33,00:14:34,was already going to.
00:14:34,00:14:35,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:35,00:14:36,"Oh, my God."
00:14:36,00:14:40,"That's a book of parakeet, failures, classic that one."
00:14:40,00:14:41,Yeah.
00:14:41,00:14:42,Charles Lindbergh.
00:14:42,00:14:43,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:43,00:14:46,"One of his other specialities listed on his business card, which is an amazing business"
00:14:46,00:14:48,"card, by the way, including death lights."
00:14:48,00:14:51,One of the other things he offered was a plane change in mid air.
00:14:51,00:14:52,Yeah.
00:14:52,00:14:57,This was a trick in early aerial circuses where you would just climb out of the plane you
00:14:57,00:15:00,were in or flying and climb into another plane next to you.
00:15:00,00:15:05,"That's, would you do that if you're traveling and you do it for an exchange or is it a trick?"
00:15:05,00:15:06,"It's a trick, right?"
00:15:06,00:15:07,I was concerned.
00:15:07,00:15:10,"If anyone changing your flight was in the old days, if anyone from Ryanair is listening,"
00:15:10,00:15:13,they will be considering that.
00:15:13,00:15:15,He was a real dead devil in some way.
00:15:15,00:15:20,"So Lindbergh, he did New York to Paris in 1924."
00:15:20,00:15:22,I did not know this thing about it.
00:15:22,00:15:26,"He had to get rid of all non-essential equipment, make the plane as light as possible."
00:15:26,00:15:29,So he took out all non-essential equipment and then he put a big fuel tank on the front
00:15:29,00:15:32,of the plane so he could have as much fuel as he needed.
00:15:32,00:15:35,"Unfortunately, that meant he could not see out in front of him."
00:15:35,00:15:36,No.
00:15:36,00:15:37,I'm not even kidding.
00:15:37,00:15:38,"Oh, my God."
00:15:38,00:15:40,"To see out of the plane in front of him, he had a few options."
00:15:40,00:15:42,He installed a periscope in the cockpit.
00:15:42,00:15:43,"Oh, my God."
00:15:43,00:15:48,He also sometimes just had to open the right hand door to peek out the front.
00:15:48,00:15:49,"Oh, my God."
00:15:49,00:15:54,And his final option was just to turn the plane sideways for a bit.
00:15:54,00:15:56,That's how I drive.
00:15:56,00:15:57,It does work.
00:15:57,00:15:58,It does.
00:15:58,00:16:02,"But, yeah, aerial acrobatics was super popular in the 1920s."
00:16:02,00:16:06,It was this very specific phase because a lot of people learned to fly in the First World
00:16:06,00:16:08,War and then they realized they could make a living out of it.
00:16:08,00:16:13,"And barn storming, it was called, and it became this very popular thing."
00:16:13,00:16:16,"And I can't tell if it was, I think the etymology of it is vaguely unclear."
00:16:16,00:16:22,"It's either because people would often do these amazing aerial acrobatics in, like, fields."
00:16:22,00:16:23,And people would stand by a barn and watch.
00:16:23,00:16:27,But also quite a common trick they'd do is to fly through a barn.
00:16:27,00:16:31,"So they'd open the doors of the barn, and then you had to fly your plane through the barn"
00:16:31,00:16:32,and come out the other end.
00:16:32,00:16:35,"It's not where the trope of bursting into a barn, and then you burst out the other end"
00:16:35,00:16:37,"and all the chickens, you know, flapping around, madly."
00:16:37,00:16:39,"The trope, you know, it happens in every show."
00:16:39,00:16:42,It's a sign-failed run into a barn.
00:16:42,00:16:45,It happens less than a pun that's showing.
00:16:45,00:16:51,"But is that obviously where the word barn store, it was a real barn store, man?"
00:16:51,00:16:52,I think it is.
00:16:52,00:16:57,"I've seen videos of them flying through, and I'm sure that must be where it comes from."
00:16:57,00:16:58,"Yeah, it must be."
00:16:58,00:16:59,Yeah.
00:16:59,00:17:03,I think they played some stunt games of tennis on plates.
00:17:03,00:17:04,"No, oh my gosh."
00:17:04,00:17:05,On the wings.
00:17:05,00:17:06,On the wings?
00:17:06,00:17:10,"From one wing to another, there are a few photos of people doing, oh, it's wing-walking."
00:17:10,00:17:12,"You know, normally you're just sort of discreetly strapped to the plane."
00:17:12,00:17:15,You're not standing completely free because obviously you'd immediately fall off.
00:17:15,00:17:19,Does that mean you had to hit the ball ahead of where the person was at this eye?
00:17:19,00:17:21,"I mean, how does physics work, aren't they?"
00:17:21,00:17:26,I think the person who really suffers is the ballboy.
00:17:26,00:17:29,"There's a guy called Omar Locklear, who was a 20s stunt pilot."
00:17:29,00:17:33,"I think was the first person to fly from one plane to another in mid-air, possibly."
00:17:33,00:17:34,Sorry.
00:17:34,00:17:35,Fly from one plane to another.
00:17:35,00:17:36,"Sorry, climb."
00:17:36,00:17:41,He launched a smaller plane out of the window of a John Hood jet.
00:17:41,00:17:43,That's incredible.
00:17:43,00:17:48,So Omar Locklear was a stunt pilot in the 20s in a film called The Great Air Robbery.
00:17:48,00:17:53,"His one stunt he did, he climbed down from a plane to a speeding car, fought the baddie"
00:17:53,00:17:57,"for a bit, kicked the baddie out of the car, then he grabbed the plane's undercarriage"
00:17:57,00:18:01,and climbed back into it as the car overturned and crashed.
00:18:01,00:18:03,You should never climb back into someone's undercarriage.
00:18:03,00:18:05,It's very weird.
00:18:05,00:18:09,Do you know another old cure for deafness around about this time?
00:18:09,00:18:16,The 1920s and before was to make your own artificial eardrum or have an artificial eardrum inserted.
00:18:16,00:18:17,You could order them.
00:18:17,00:18:18,I was going to say online.
00:18:18,00:18:24,They sent you things that were of a made of else claw or pig's bladder or fishbone or something
00:18:24,00:18:28,"called gold beater's skin, which I didn't know about, but your dad probably would, Andy,"
00:18:28,00:18:33,because it's in used in the gold leaf making process and apparently it's animal intestine.
00:18:33,00:18:37,"Anyway, you put this on a little stick and you put it in your ear and it apparently replaced"
00:18:37,00:18:38,your eardrum.
00:18:38,00:18:46,"It didn't work, but it was invented in 1853 or pioneered by a doctor called Joseph Toinby,"
00:18:46,00:18:48,who is Polly Toinby's great grandfather.
00:18:48,00:18:49,Wow.
00:18:49,00:18:50,Isn't that weird?
00:18:50,00:18:51,That's good.
00:18:51,00:18:53,I read the other day and I haven't looked into this.
00:18:53,00:18:59,I just saw the headline that your eardrum moves the same way as your eyes move.
00:18:59,00:19:04,"So when your eyes kind of move to the left or right, your eardrum slightly move around."
00:19:04,00:19:05,Wow.
00:19:05,00:19:08,"It is, you know, when they, like, can't say I've seen just doing it themselves, our eardrums"
00:19:08,00:19:09,is obviously doing it.
00:19:09,00:19:10,Yeah.
00:19:10,00:19:11,Oh my god.
00:19:11,00:19:12,I can kind of feel it.
00:19:12,00:19:13,If you remember.
00:19:13,00:19:14,All right.
00:19:14,00:19:17,"I mean, you think that might be your ear bones moving in your jaw."
00:19:17,00:19:18,Oh yeah.
00:19:18,00:19:19,"Yeah, it might be."
00:19:19,00:19:20,All right.
00:19:20,00:19:22,"The other thing with, you know, like, well, I can feel it too."
00:19:22,00:19:24,"Yes, it might be your ear bones."
00:19:24,00:19:25,You have ear bones too.
00:19:25,00:19:26,I don't know.
00:19:26,00:19:27,Is it the ear bone?
00:19:27,00:19:28,No.
00:19:28,00:19:29,I'm just moving my eyes.
00:19:29,00:19:30,"Oh, wait."
00:19:30,00:19:31,There's something moving in there.
00:19:31,00:19:32,Yeah.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"I think that's your jaw moving, which is connecting to your ear bones."
00:19:34,00:19:36,Why would my jaw move when I'm just moving my eyes?
00:19:36,00:19:39,Because you're moving the muscles around your eyes to look that way.
00:19:39,00:19:43,"Carrie, I've been really into logical facts-based explanations here."
00:19:43,00:19:47,So this is kind of a psychological affliction that they thought could be cured by flying.
00:19:47,00:19:52,And there was another fashion for curing psychological affliction in about the 1920s.
00:19:52,00:19:54,And this was pioneered by this doctor called Henry Cotton.
00:19:54,00:19:55,And I'd never heard of this.
00:19:55,00:20:01,But he thought that all madness or depression or anxiety was caused by physical stuff and
00:20:01,00:20:03,could all be cured by surgery.
00:20:03,00:20:07,So he used to just pull more and more body parts out of people until they were cured.
00:20:07,00:20:08,So we'd start with the teeth.
00:20:08,00:20:12,So you'd go in and you'd pull out all of your teeth if you were mad.
00:20:12,00:20:14,"And then if you still, he'd go for another body part."
00:20:14,00:20:15,He'd keep on going.
00:20:15,00:20:16,So then-
00:20:16,00:20:17,He's like that game operative.
00:20:17,00:20:18,"No, no, no."
00:20:18,00:20:19,I bet he invented it.
00:20:19,00:20:20,"He was like, I get it."
00:20:20,00:20:21,Yeah.
00:20:21,00:20:22,It was fun.
00:20:22,00:20:23,It was not like operation.
00:20:23,00:20:26,"He'd go tonsils next and then adenoise, and then he'd remove your colon."
00:20:26,00:20:27,If you still weren't here.
00:20:27,00:20:30,"I feel like you need your colon, don't you?"
00:20:30,00:20:31,I feel like you need--
00:20:31,00:20:32,What about the appendix?
00:20:32,00:20:33,No.
00:20:33,00:20:37,"I mean, once my stomach's gone, yes, my anxiety is going to go because I'm trying to deal"
00:20:37,00:20:38,with not having a stomach.
00:20:38,00:20:39,Yeah.
00:20:39,00:20:40,So I'm probably just going to be really upset.
00:20:40,00:20:41,Probably not.
00:20:41,00:20:43,"Well, platypluses don't have stomachs."
00:20:43,00:20:44,Don't they?
00:20:44,00:20:46,"No, they used to be very anxious."
00:20:46,00:20:47,I don't know.
00:20:47,00:20:48,They don't.
00:20:48,00:20:50,And they used to-- this happened to my granny.
00:20:50,00:20:54,They used to pull out all your teeth as prevention for tooth decay.
00:20:54,00:20:58,"So when you were like 18 or 21, and this was offered to her, she was extremely poor working"
00:20:58,00:20:59,car salient.
00:20:59,00:21:02,"And so they said, well, to save you some money and worrying about your teeth, just take"
00:21:02,00:21:03,them all out.
00:21:03,00:21:04,Did you go for it?
00:21:04,00:21:06,"Yes, you had to hold everything or tooth removed at any moment."
00:21:06,00:21:07,My granny was offered it.
00:21:07,00:21:08,Didn't take them all from me.
00:21:08,00:21:09,My lady.
00:21:09,00:21:10,My lady.
00:21:10,00:21:11,Yeah.
00:21:11,00:21:15,This guy did pull out his own children's and wife's teeth as soon as he had children and a
00:21:15,00:21:16,wife.
00:21:16,00:21:17,So he had children and a wife over there.
00:21:17,00:21:20,At what point in the ceremony or the reception did he do it?
00:21:20,00:21:21,The christening.
00:21:21,00:21:22,There's one in there.
00:21:22,00:21:23,Now I'll kiss the bride.
00:21:23,00:21:25,"Well, just one thing before I do it."
00:21:25,00:21:28,You may now fly over the bride's mouth open.
00:21:28,00:21:37,"Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is James Huckett."
00:21:37,00:21:42,"Okay, my fact this week is that there is a patch of snow in Scotland that fell 11 years"
00:21:42,00:21:44,ago and is just melted this week.
00:21:44,00:21:45,That is amazing.
00:21:45,00:21:46,It's sad.
00:21:46,00:21:47,It's very sad.
00:21:47,00:21:48,I thought it was amazing.
00:21:48,00:21:50,"When I looked into it, I realized it was sad."
00:21:50,00:21:51,Super sad.
00:21:51,00:21:52,"The first one was like, wow."
00:21:52,00:21:53,Oh.
00:21:53,00:21:54,Sad.
00:21:54,00:21:59,So there are these people who kind of always looking for the last bit of snow that's on the Scottish
00:21:59,00:22:00,mountains.
00:22:00,00:22:03,"And most years, it's still there when it starts snowing again."
00:22:03,00:22:07,So it's always going to be there and actually it always melts from the top.
00:22:07,00:22:10,So the bit at the bottom will have been there for the whole time.
00:22:10,00:22:14,"But this week, and I'm going on a bit of a limb because as we're doing this podcast,"
00:22:14,00:22:19,"I think there might still be a tiny bit there, but it's like a bit the size of a rucksack"
00:22:19,00:22:20,or something.
00:22:20,00:22:21,There's hardly anything.
00:22:21,00:22:25,"And it looks like it's on its last legs, probably, we're recording this on September 29th."
00:22:25,00:22:28,"And I think by the 30th or by the start of October, it'll definitely be gone."
00:22:28,00:22:32,"God, but you're in trouble if there's an uninfected blizzard in Scotland over the next week."
00:22:32,00:22:33,"Yeah, exactly."
00:22:33,00:22:34,Yeah.
00:22:34,00:22:38,Hasn't it only disappeared six times in the last 300 years or something?
00:22:38,00:22:39,Yeah.
00:22:39,00:22:40,I'd like that.
00:22:40,00:22:41,"So, yeah."
00:22:41,00:22:45,"In the last 300 years, there have only been six times when there's been no snow on the"
00:22:45,00:22:46,ground in Britain.
00:22:46,00:22:47,"God, yeah."
00:22:47,00:22:50,"Every time you listen to the news at the moment, you feel like it's end of days."
00:22:50,00:22:53,"And you read a story like that where you go, and the snow has also gone."
00:22:53,00:22:54,"And you think, oh, God."
00:22:54,00:22:56,But it's got a name.
00:22:56,00:22:57,Yeah.
00:22:57,00:22:58,And there's a few of them.
00:22:58,00:23:00,I think the one that I'm talking about is called the Spinks.
00:23:00,00:23:01,Yeah.
00:23:01,00:23:05,And it's because there's a rock above it that looks a bit like the Spinks.
00:23:05,00:23:06,I don't know.
00:23:06,00:23:07,That was the reason.
00:23:07,00:23:08,Yeah.
00:23:08,00:23:09,And what do you think it was?
00:23:09,00:23:12,I thought it was like the patch of snow asked you a riddle when you get there.
00:23:12,00:23:16,"And if you answer wrong, it folds you into its cold heart."
00:23:16,00:23:17,I don't know.
00:23:17,00:23:18,That's how it keeps going.
00:23:18,00:23:19,Yeah.
00:23:19,00:23:22,But there's one more virgin to come and ask you the question.
00:23:22,00:23:23,"Andy, whenever."
00:23:23,00:23:24,Hey.
00:23:24,00:23:28,So these people are very interesting guys.
00:23:28,00:23:30,There's no patch hunters.
00:23:30,00:23:31,Yes.
00:23:31,00:23:33,"And so we only know about this because of this guy, Ian Cameron."
00:23:33,00:23:34,Yeah.
00:23:34,00:23:35,And he's like one of the main guys.
00:23:35,00:23:39,And he often goes and tries to find these patches and then we'll take photos of them.
00:23:39,00:23:43,"And then eventually, pretty much if Ian Cameron says they're not there anymore, they're"
00:23:43,00:23:44,probably not there anymore.
00:23:44,00:23:45,Yeah.
00:23:45,00:23:48,"And he's got a Facebook group which you can go on and, you know, every few days he posts"
00:23:48,00:23:51,"and he's like, oh, there's still a little bit left here, but probably not tomorrow."
00:23:51,00:23:56,But and all of the data he gathers is really useful for climate scientists because he's
00:23:56,00:23:59,"got a record stretching back years and years now, which is very useful in terms of the"
00:23:59,00:24:00,temperature on the ground.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"And this is what they think it's climate change, is that what?"
00:24:02,00:24:03,Yeah.
00:24:03,00:24:04,What he is quite circumspect about it.
00:24:04,00:24:08,"He says, look, I'm just going to leave it to the scientists to decide this kind of stuff."
00:24:08,00:24:10,I wish more people would take that too.
00:24:10,00:24:13,"I suppose it seems pretty likely that it's climate change, right?"
00:24:13,00:24:18,"Well, you know, what I like Ian, I can leave it to the scientists, but clearly it's bad."
00:24:18,00:24:22,"But he told the new statesman when they spoke to him, he said, it might sound weird to say,"
00:24:22,00:24:25,but it's like seeing an elderly relative or an old friend.
00:24:25,00:24:28,You're slightly disappointed if it's not in as good a condition.
00:24:28,00:24:29,Oh.
00:24:29,00:24:32,And you're really disappointed if you turn up and it's not there.
00:24:32,00:24:33,Yeah.
00:24:33,00:24:34,"He is all about the snow, isn't he?"
00:24:34,00:24:35,Yeah.
00:24:35,00:24:39,"He just, he only cares about these snow patches and he says he, I'm sure he cares about"
00:24:39,00:24:40,other things.
00:24:40,00:24:45,"He's a wife covering herself in snow, look at me, Ian, look at me."
00:24:45,00:24:47,"His children wearing snow hats, eating snow."
00:24:47,00:24:50,He's desperately putting carrots out in front of their nose.
00:24:50,00:24:52,"Daddy, are we snow now?"
00:24:52,00:24:53,"No, you're hot."
00:24:53,00:24:55,You're hot and you're nothing to me.
00:24:55,00:24:59,"It's so easy, it's not like that being Ian's child."
00:24:59,00:25:05,"I would like to have said he actually reported he's an enthusiast, but he is not mad."
00:25:05,00:25:07,So tell that to his poor melting wife.
00:25:07,00:25:12,I think Ian Cameron is a bit of a hero because he's like looking at this kind of thing and
00:25:12,00:25:16,"not, not what else is, but actually it's like you say really good data and..."
00:25:16,00:25:17,"No, he's amazing."
00:25:17,00:25:18,"It's amazing, obviously."
00:25:18,00:25:24,"What people do seem to be taking notice, there's a whole Wikipedia article called Snow Patches"
00:25:24,00:25:28,"in Scotland, which I suspect maybe Ian Cameron wrote this."
00:25:28,00:25:33,"There are things like, it's so weird, it does seem to be a big thing based on this."
00:25:33,00:25:37,"So it describes a relatively little known snow patch, which was Scotland's largest at the"
00:25:37,00:25:38,time of writing.
00:25:38,00:25:43,"It said this patch does not appear in the no literature on the subject, so it may be"
00:25:43,00:25:44,very under-recorded.
00:25:44,00:25:46,Only the hips does know about that one.
00:25:46,00:25:47,It's really obscure.
00:25:47,00:25:48,You probably haven't heard of it.
00:25:48,00:25:49,Do you want some good news?
00:25:49,00:25:50,Sure.
00:25:50,00:25:51,Sure.
00:25:51,00:25:53,You don't know about the world's tallest snow woman?
00:25:53,00:25:54,Of course.
00:25:54,00:25:55,"Guys, I feel like..."
00:25:55,00:25:56,Mrs Cameron.
00:25:56,00:26:02,So her name is Olympia and she is 30 feet shorter than the statue of Liberty.
00:26:02,00:26:03,"Oh, wow."
00:26:03,00:26:04,Yeah.
00:26:04,00:26:13,"Her arms consist of 27 foot tall evergreens and she has 16 skis for eyelashes and 2,000 feet"
00:26:13,00:26:14,of rope hair.
00:26:14,00:26:15,She is amazing.
00:26:15,00:26:20,"And five red autotires for lips, which were painted by the Mahousuk Kids Association."
00:26:20,00:26:23,So basically the whole town got together and made this...
00:26:23,00:26:27,"This is from the photo, this absolute travesty of a snow person."
00:26:27,00:26:31,"I don't know what the parrot is made of, because presumably that's the size of a bus."
00:26:31,00:26:37,"The parrot knows it's made of muslin, chicken wire and wood frame by the MSAD number 44 elementary"
00:26:37,00:26:38,school children.
00:26:38,00:26:39,Yeah.
00:26:39,00:26:40,It's amazing.
00:26:40,00:26:44,"I have to say, if that magically came to life and approached me one night, I would run for"
00:26:44,00:26:45,the hills.
00:26:45,00:26:46,And why is that might...
00:26:46,00:26:47,Why would that happen?
00:26:47,00:26:48,We're liking that.
00:26:48,00:26:49,Like in the snowman.
00:26:49,00:26:50,"Oh, I see."
00:26:50,00:26:51,Christmas things.
00:26:51,00:26:54,I would not go walking in the air with that meat.
00:26:54,00:26:57,I would sit indoors with a hairdryer on full blast if it came near me.
00:26:57,00:27:01,"I mean, it's not 100% clear just looking at this from a bit of a distance that she"
00:27:01,00:27:02,is a woman.
00:27:02,00:27:03,It's one of the eyelashes.
00:27:03,00:27:04,It's one of the eyelashes.
00:27:04,00:27:07,They give you any eyelashes in the classic cartoon version of gender.
00:27:07,00:27:10,I think a snow vagina will be a bit much at this.
00:27:10,00:27:14,"You don't see many snow penises on the old snowman, do you?"
00:27:14,00:27:15,"You do, too."
00:27:15,00:27:16,Walking.
00:27:16,00:27:17,You don't.
00:27:17,00:27:18,Maybe you don't.
00:27:18,00:27:19,You don't.
00:27:19,00:27:20,Hang it down in walking in the air.
00:27:20,00:27:21,I didn't notice.
00:27:21,00:27:22,You see a lot of snow penises.
00:27:22,00:27:23,So.
00:27:23,00:27:26,Have you guys heard about the oldest ever ice?
00:27:26,00:27:27,Oh.
00:27:27,00:27:29,Is it an Antarctica?
00:27:29,00:27:30,"Yes, it is."
00:27:30,00:27:31,It's discovered this year.
00:27:31,00:27:33,"It dates back, guys."
00:27:33,00:27:34,2.7 million years.
00:27:34,00:27:35,What?
00:27:35,00:27:36,Yeah.
00:27:36,00:27:38,Is that the one that Putin drank?
00:27:38,00:27:40,I'm sincerely hoping not.
00:27:40,00:27:41,Do you not remember that?
00:27:41,00:27:42,He did that.
00:27:42,00:27:46,They drilled down to some really old ice and they melted it and Putin drank it.
00:27:46,00:27:47,"Well, just dropped it in a whiskey or something."
00:27:47,00:27:49,He's going to live forever.
00:27:49,00:27:54,"No, he wasn't down at the bottom of the hole, eating the ice and then they dropped down"
00:27:54,00:27:55,to him.
00:27:55,00:27:59,"Yeah, no, so as a climate scientist, keep on drilling down because the snow that falls"
00:27:59,00:28:04,"and then compacts an Antarctica, obviously, not obviously, but it has tiny bubbles of air,"
00:28:04,00:28:08,which tell you a huge amount about the climate 2 million years ago and you can find out how
00:28:08,00:28:12,"much carbon dioxide there was and what that means for the temperature of the earth, which"
00:28:12,00:28:15,is going to be very useful for us over the next century.
00:28:15,00:28:21,"But this year in April, there was a freezer in Canada where they had ice cores that"
00:28:21,00:28:23,dated back thousands and thousands of years.
00:28:23,00:28:25,"Yeah, your way ahead of me, Carried."
00:28:25,00:28:26,No.
00:28:26,00:28:27,There was a freezer malfunction.
00:28:27,00:28:28,No.
00:28:28,00:28:29,And they melted.
00:28:29,00:28:30,Guys.
00:28:30,00:28:32,I've had that with ice cream and it's really disappointing.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Yeah.
00:28:33,00:28:34,It is so disappointing.
00:28:34,00:28:36,"Well, imagine if there was 22,000 years of history in your ice cream."
00:28:36,00:28:40,"If it's green and black chocolate, I'd be as upset as I would be."
00:28:40,00:28:47,"And the director of the Canadian ice core archives guy called Martin Sharp and he said, ""Fuck!"""
00:28:47,00:28:51,This is a bad day for Martin Sharp.
00:28:51,00:28:52,"He said, ""I've had better days."""
00:28:52,00:28:54,"Oh, you love Martin."
00:28:54,00:28:57,"But by a massive stroke of luck, which sounds crazy, but there was a massive stroke of"
00:28:57,00:29:04,"like 90% of it was saved, solely because camera crew had been filming a documentary about"
00:29:04,00:29:08,"this ice core archive and they had said, ""Can we move most of it into this other freezer"
00:29:08,00:29:09,"which has better lighting?"""
00:29:09,00:29:10,No.
00:29:10,00:29:11,So thank god.
00:29:11,00:29:12,Wow.
00:29:12,00:29:13,Most of it was saved.
00:29:13,00:29:14,That's amazing.
00:29:14,00:29:15,"Is it like an ice cream where if it re-freezes, it's not quite as good?"
00:29:15,00:29:16,I think that's right.
00:29:16,00:29:17,I think that's right.
00:29:17,00:29:19,"And then you still eat it, but you think, ""Oh, I should have eaten this early."""
00:29:19,00:29:20,Yeah.
00:29:20,00:29:24,It's hard to shove the little bubbles of ancient carbon dioxide back in at the right
00:29:24,00:29:25,height.
00:29:25,00:29:28,"Well, that's something though, because they're like time capsules, but from literally millions"
00:29:28,00:29:32,"of years ago, I kind of find the fact that these bubbles are 2.7 million years old, more"
00:29:32,00:29:36,"exciting than the ice, because it's like a little world, even though it doesn't have the"
00:29:36,00:29:40,"cool stuff like the blue Peter, Baton, or whatever, inside it, it's still like a little"
00:29:40,00:29:41,time capsule.
00:29:41,00:29:44,"Apparently, you're not supposed to make snowmen in Antarctica."
00:29:44,00:29:45,Really?
00:29:45,00:29:46,Why?
00:29:46,00:29:47,It's a boo according to the telegraph.
00:29:47,00:29:48,It's a boo.
00:29:48,00:29:49,They're so uptight.
00:29:49,00:29:54,"Apparently, the rules are designed to prevent the Antarctic's animals from being disturbed."
00:29:54,00:29:55,Yeah.
00:29:55,00:29:56,That's fair enough.
00:29:56,00:29:57,"Animals, penguins?"
00:29:57,00:29:58,I don't know.
00:29:58,00:29:59,"They might be like, ""What is that?"""
00:29:59,00:30:00,Yeah.
00:30:00,00:30:01,"You know, ""Hey, that's my snow."""
00:30:01,00:30:04,"It might be like, ""I came into your house and rolled up all your cushions and made a giant"
00:30:04,00:30:05,"cushion, man."""
00:30:05,00:30:06,And you woke up.
00:30:06,00:30:07,Yeah.
00:30:07,00:30:10,"It does sound like I'd wake up, because it sounds like that happened in a dream, I think, the"
00:30:10,00:30:11,other day.
00:30:11,00:30:12,It sounds like the penguins.
00:30:12,00:30:13,"They're like, just in my no business."
00:30:13,00:30:14,"Suddenly, someone's taking all their like hours."
00:30:14,00:30:17,"The Antarctica had no land animals, permanent land animals, apart from that tiny fly."
00:30:17,00:30:18,Got penguins.
00:30:18,00:30:19,I think it says now.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"Yeah, but they live in the sea."
00:30:21,00:30:28,"I think we did this on QI, the only permanent land animal is a midge with no wings."
00:30:28,00:30:29,"Hey, and what the midge doesn't have feelings?"
00:30:29,00:30:30,Yeah.
00:30:30,00:30:34,"It's even worse for the midge, because if you could be quite a small snowman, but to them,"
00:30:34,00:30:36,it's going to look like that one from Maine.
00:30:36,00:30:37,The princess.
00:30:37,00:30:38,The princess.
00:30:38,00:30:39,Okay.
00:30:39,00:30:40,I now understand.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"Andy has a point, because what about the Antarctic bases they built and all the snowing"
00:30:43,00:30:44,stations?
00:30:44,00:30:46,"No one's like, ""Hey, we're disturbing them, are they?"""
00:30:46,00:30:47,No.
00:30:47,00:30:48,The penguins are fine with that.
00:30:48,00:30:49,"Yeah, they're fine."
00:30:49,00:30:57,But let's start with the midges.
00:30:57,00:30:59,"Okay, it's time for a final fact."
00:30:59,00:31:01,And that is my fact this week.
00:31:01,00:31:07,"My fact is that the first person ever to use the word ""sponge cake"" was Jane Austen."
00:31:07,00:31:08,Oh.
00:31:08,00:31:09,Oh.
00:31:09,00:31:10,Good old Jane.
00:31:10,00:31:11,Good old Jane.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"Now, we mentioned this, because Carrie had you are in an imporised comedy group called"
00:31:13,00:31:15,"""Ostentatious"", which is about Jane Austen."
00:31:15,00:31:16,"Yeah, I am, eh, Jane."
00:31:16,00:31:17,Great.
00:31:17,00:31:18,She's in that with me.
00:31:18,00:31:19,I'm a perger.
00:31:19,00:31:20,"I'm a perger, yeah."
00:31:20,00:31:21,"Joe is a perger, isn't that Rachel Powers?"
00:31:21,00:31:22,"He's a great comic, isn't he?"
00:31:22,00:31:23,He's an amazing guy.
00:31:23,00:31:24,He does very well.
00:31:24,00:31:26,Andy is also in that group with me.
00:31:26,00:31:27,I am.
00:31:27,00:31:28,I'm in Austen.
00:31:28,00:31:29,Yes.
00:31:29,00:31:30,And you guys have got some big shows coming up.
00:31:30,00:31:31,We have.
00:31:31,00:31:32,We're going to the West End for three dates.
00:31:32,00:31:33,The Piccadilly Theatre.
00:31:33,00:31:38,"We're going to December 5th, January 23rd, and special Valentine's Day, February 13th."
00:31:38,00:31:39,Go the day before.
00:31:39,00:31:41,That's what all the fashionable couples are doing.
00:31:41,00:31:44,"And then, on February the 14th, you can do something actually fun."
00:31:44,00:31:45,Yeah.
00:31:45,00:31:46,Exactly.
00:31:46,00:31:47,Exactly.
00:31:47,00:31:50,"At the Piccadilly Theatre at 730, yeah, Austen Tatias are playing their biggest dates yet."
00:31:50,00:31:52,"And we've both seen it, and it's amazing."
00:31:52,00:31:53,"It's fantastic, yeah."
00:31:53,00:31:54,"So, sponge cake."
00:31:54,00:31:56,"So, we know our Jane Austen, right, Andy?"
00:31:56,00:31:57,We know our Jane Austen.
00:31:57,00:31:59,But she coined the word sponge cake.
00:31:59,00:32:02,"She's got a few citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, and this is..."
00:32:02,00:32:05,"So, it doesn't mean that she invented the sponge cake."
00:32:05,00:32:07,She's the first person just to write it down.
00:32:07,00:32:09,They called it something else before her.
00:32:09,00:32:11,Do they call it cake sponge?
00:32:11,00:32:12,Yeah.
00:32:12,00:32:16,"So, the first record of the word comes from her writings."
00:32:16,00:32:18,I'm not even convinced it's a word.
00:32:18,00:32:20,"Well, is it two words or is it one word?"
00:32:20,00:32:22,I thought she wrote it down hyphenated.
00:32:22,00:32:24,She wrote it down hyphenated in a letter to her sister.
00:32:24,00:32:28,"She said, ""You know how interesting the purchase of a sponge cake is to me."""
00:32:28,00:32:32,I think it was a famous Jane Austen sense of humour coming in there.
00:32:32,00:32:33,"So, it's interesting."
00:32:33,00:32:37,"The first mention of a sponge cake, is it being given a sick burn in a letter?"
00:32:37,00:32:40,"Which is a shame, because sponge cake is a great thing."
00:32:40,00:32:44,"But do you know the words that she either coined or first usage,"
00:32:44,00:32:46,the first evidence of it comes from her?
00:32:46,00:32:49,I went through the OED and found as many as I could.
00:32:49,00:32:50,Did you read the whole thing?
00:32:50,00:32:51,Well...
00:32:51,00:32:53,"I've only started at the beginning, I can't believe it."
00:32:53,00:32:54,"Hard fact, no."
00:32:54,00:32:56,Antibilius.
00:32:56,00:32:57,Ooh.
00:32:57,00:32:59,"They're all kind of very ostony words, the ones."
00:32:59,00:33:02,"Like there's coddle, cousinly."
00:33:02,00:33:03,She invented coddle.
00:33:03,00:33:05,"She didn't invent them, I suppose."
00:33:05,00:33:07,But she's the first example we have of it.
00:33:07,00:33:08,Okay.
00:33:08,00:33:10,But isn't it like you coddle an egg?
00:33:10,00:33:11,Yeah.
00:33:11,00:33:15,"Yeah, so maybe it's coddle in just that specific term as a molly coddle."
00:33:15,00:33:16,"Right, yeah, yeah."
00:33:16,00:33:19,Irrepressible obtrusiveness.
00:33:19,00:33:20,Tittope.
00:33:20,00:33:22,What's tittope?
00:33:22,00:33:23,Tittope.
00:33:23,00:33:24,It's the study of titt.
00:33:24,00:33:25,Tittope.
00:33:25,00:33:26,Tittope.
00:33:26,00:33:27,"Sorry, I'm sorry."
00:33:27,00:33:28,I'm sorry.
00:33:28,00:33:29,It's apology.
00:33:29,00:33:30,Tittope.
00:33:30,00:33:31,I'm already photographing.
00:33:31,00:33:32,"Oh, I'm getting confused."
00:33:32,00:33:33,Tittope.
00:33:33,00:33:35,I think it means like a tittope.
00:33:35,00:33:38,"Oh, yes."
00:33:38,00:33:41,And there's suppose a tittope is a mistake or something?
00:33:41,00:33:42,No.
00:33:42,00:33:44,"Darcy's always tittopping, isn't he?"
00:33:44,00:33:46,That bull went really tittopping.
00:33:46,00:33:48,That's how Lizzie felt.
00:33:48,00:33:50,Garde as into garde about.
00:33:50,00:33:53,"You're kidding, the verbal use of garde."
00:33:53,00:33:54,That's cool.
00:33:54,00:33:55,"I think that's better than sponge cakes, to be honest."
00:33:55,00:33:56,"Yes, it is."
00:33:56,00:33:57,Garde about.
00:33:57,00:33:58,They're quite neat words.
00:33:58,00:33:59,"Yeah, that's what I think as well."
00:33:59,00:34:02,"It's not like Shakespeare who just invented ""the"" and ""an""."
00:34:02,00:34:04,All the main words.
00:34:04,00:34:07,"Before that, we just literally garde."
00:34:07,00:34:11,"I've got some mind-blowing news on that, Anna."
00:34:11,00:34:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:34:12,00:34:16,"So Shakespeare's always said that Shakespeare invented 1700 words, right?"
00:34:16,00:34:18,And I'm always saying it.
00:34:18,00:34:23,"And so the words include ""bump, hurry, road""."
00:34:23,00:34:26,"I mean, it's nonsense."
00:34:26,00:34:32,So the reason that he gets all these citations is because the first team of people
00:34:32,00:34:37,in Piling the Oxford English Dictionary knew his works intimately because they were all lexicographers.
00:34:37,00:34:41,"So when they were thinking, ""Where's the word critical?"""
00:34:41,00:34:44,"They say, ""Oh, there is a critical in whatever play it was."""
00:34:44,00:34:48,"And then, now that we've got better technology, we're going back and we're finding way earlier ones."
00:34:48,00:34:51,So we thought that the word puke was a Shakespearean coinage.
00:34:51,00:34:56,"Turns out it dates back to 1465, almost two centuries before Shakespeare wrote it."
00:34:56,00:34:58,"I bet you also was saying the word ""road""."
00:34:58,00:34:59,Come on.
00:34:59,00:35:02,"No, it wasn't gone on a road."
00:35:02,00:35:06,"Yeah, because it would be weird if Shakespeare's plays were just full of words that no one had heard of."
00:35:06,00:35:08,"Well, the audience would be back full."
00:35:08,00:35:10,"Well, imagine the reviews, you know?"
00:35:10,00:35:12,"But you know people say, ""No, I find Shakespeare harder to understand."""
00:35:12,00:35:14,Perhaps that's what's happening.
00:35:14,00:35:19,"In the 16th century, people are like, ""I don't know. It's not about. I can't really find a road."""
00:35:19,00:35:22,"Did you see the amazing website right, like ostin.com?"
00:35:22,00:35:23,No.
00:35:23,00:35:26,So it tells you you couldn't type in a word and it will tell you how many times you used it.
00:35:26,00:35:30,"So she only used the word ""swoon"" four times."
00:35:30,00:35:33,We used that word quite a lot.
00:35:33,00:35:35,"She used the word ""curtzy"" six times."
00:35:35,00:35:37,"She never used the word ""marval""."
00:35:37,00:35:38,So was it...
00:35:38,00:35:41,She had embedded superheroes in us.
00:35:41,00:35:42,"No, no."
00:35:42,00:35:44,"She was mainly using the word ""DC""."
00:35:44,00:35:46,She did?
00:35:46,00:35:49,There were things that I think that she may have invented.
00:35:49,00:35:52,"Like, so the phrase ""Tom Dick or Harry"" I think comes from her."
00:35:52,00:35:55,And you can imagine her thinking that up from her own head.
00:35:55,00:35:56,Right?
00:35:56,00:35:57,Or dog tired.
00:35:57,00:35:58,Comes from Jane Austen.
00:35:58,00:36:01,"Again, like, that's the kind of thing maybe she had made up."
00:36:01,00:36:02,Good writing.
00:36:02,00:36:03,Yeah.
00:36:03,00:36:05,"If I've told you once, I've told you 100 times."
00:36:05,00:36:06,"No, she came up with that."
00:36:06,00:36:07,"Yeah, that was from her."
00:36:07,00:36:08,That is a biggie.
00:36:08,00:36:09,That's probably her.
00:36:09,00:36:10,I'd say that's her lasting achievement.
00:36:10,00:36:13,"Yeah, but you're only saying that because you've been told that a lot of times."
00:36:13,00:36:15,I think it's about puke.
00:36:15,00:36:16,Yeah.
00:36:16,00:36:23,Jane Austen wrote not very well according to this professor.
00:36:23,00:36:25,This is really interesting.
00:36:25,00:36:26,I'm bristling.
00:36:26,00:36:28,According to a lot of people as well.
00:36:28,00:36:32,I've put a lot of men throughout the years have written a heart of views of her.
00:36:32,00:36:34,"Well, Virginia Woolf didn't like her much."
00:36:34,00:36:35,"Oh, no, that is true."
00:36:35,00:36:38,"Well, Virginia Woolf was a man."
00:36:38,00:36:40,It's extremely interesting you raised Virginia Woolf.
00:36:40,00:36:43,So this is a study done by his professor Catherine Sutherland.
00:36:43,00:36:47,"And basically, what she's saying is Jane Austen didn't write like we think she wrote."
00:36:47,00:36:48,That was the work of an editor.
00:36:48,00:36:52,"So I agree with Carrie Hadd and Andy that, like, her novels are perfection in terms"
00:36:52,00:36:55,"of, like, the construction of the sentences and the English language."
00:36:55,00:36:59,But what this academic says is that that was all the editor.
00:36:59,00:37:03,"And if you look at her works, her first drafts of works, she writes totally differently."
00:37:03,00:37:04,They're just...
00:37:04,00:37:07,They're just dolarbings with prey on the back of a mirror.
00:37:07,00:37:09,"So Darcy, big nice man, came in the room."
00:37:09,00:37:10,Yeah.
00:37:10,00:37:11,"And he was like, so nice."
00:37:11,00:37:13,"Well, she was more experimental."
00:37:13,00:37:15,So it actually sounds like she was more interesting.
00:37:15,00:37:18,And she said that she wrote a bit more like Virginia Woolf.
00:37:18,00:37:21,"So for instance, when she had exchanges between characters, like speech exchange,"
00:37:21,00:37:24,"like speech exchanges, she wouldn't separate out one speaker from another."
00:37:24,00:37:27,"So it would all be like, blurred in a more stream of consciousness,"
00:37:27,00:37:28,it kind of way.
00:37:28,00:37:30,"Which is keeping the idea of speech, which is so good at."
00:37:30,00:37:31,The speech is so good.
00:37:31,00:37:32,Yeah.
00:37:32,00:37:34,"Well, the editor was wanting her to separate it out."
00:37:34,00:37:35,And she couldn't spell.
00:37:35,00:37:39,"So she didn't know which one, first, of I&E."
00:37:39,00:37:40,She didn't know punctuation.
00:37:40,00:37:42,"But also, most people didn't spell."
00:37:42,00:37:43,"Yeah, the rules hadn't been set."
00:37:43,00:37:45,"You and on you had not been set, though."
00:37:45,00:37:46,Yes.
00:37:46,00:37:47,The rules hadn't been set.
00:37:47,00:37:49,I think maybe she was a little bit worse than other writers at the time.
00:37:49,00:37:52,"And also, she didn't separate things into paragraphs very well."
00:37:52,00:37:56,"She was a woman in the 19th century, or the one before that."
00:37:56,00:37:57,She didn't.
00:37:57,00:37:59,She hadn't had a lot of education.
00:37:59,00:38:01,I'm not saying she didn't do very well.
00:38:01,00:38:03,"We're really bristling, aren't we?"
00:38:03,00:38:06,Could it be that she didn't try and write sponge cake?
00:38:06,00:38:09,She just misspelled sponge carcass.
00:38:09,00:38:10,Sponge cake.
00:38:10,00:38:11,"What, what is that in, Jane?"
00:38:11,00:38:15,You know how interesting the purchase of a sponge cake is to me.
00:38:15,00:38:18,That is a way more interesting letter to be fair.
00:38:18,00:38:22,Virginia Woolf said that one of the reasons that she was so popular
00:38:22,00:38:26,is there are 25 elderly gentlemen living in the neighborhood of London
00:38:26,00:38:29,who resent any slight upon her genius
00:38:29,00:38:32,as if it were an insult to the chastity of their aunts.
00:38:32,00:38:33,Wow.
00:38:33,00:38:34,And that's a lovely sentence.
00:38:34,00:38:35,She's equally brilliant writer.
00:38:35,00:38:36,Virginia Woolf.
00:38:36,00:38:37,I know it's so sad.
00:38:37,00:38:39,They're both so fantastic and yet didn't like each other.
00:38:39,00:38:41,"Well, it wasn't that many opinions on the show table."
00:38:41,00:38:44,They will come in the years after my death.
00:38:44,00:38:46,A woman who is crap.
00:38:46,00:38:51,"And I will call her Virginia Woolf, but spell wool from her."
00:38:51,00:38:53,But didn't Charlotte Bronte hate her as well?
00:38:53,00:38:56,"I'm sure it's a quote from Bronte that said,"
00:38:56,00:38:59,"""I read that and I recognize no love that I've ever known."""
00:38:59,00:39:01,I can imagine the Bronte is not getting along with her.
00:39:01,00:39:03,You were all howling on a moor somewhere.
00:39:03,00:39:04,Very different vibe.
00:39:04,00:39:07,But wasn't it that when the Brontes came out they were really popular
00:39:07,00:39:09,and Jane Austen went out of favour for all of them?
00:39:09,00:39:10,Completely out of favour.
00:39:10,00:39:14,"And actually, I think it's partly only due to cinema that she's back in."
00:39:14,00:39:16,"So silent movies, very bad."
00:39:16,00:39:17,Improvised comedy.
00:39:17,00:39:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:39:18,00:39:20,We have affected her sales quite heavily.
00:39:20,00:39:23,"Silent movies, I think, would have been terrible for Austin"
00:39:23,00:39:26,because it's all conversation.
00:39:26,00:39:29,"I think the first adaptation was 1940, a bright impression."
00:39:29,00:39:31,"Yes, an amazing film, black and white film."
00:39:31,00:39:32,Starring Laurence Olivier.
00:39:32,00:39:33,Yes.
00:39:33,00:39:34,Lizzie Bennett.
00:39:34,00:39:35,First of all.
00:39:35,00:39:39,There's been some amazing spin-offs.
00:39:39,00:39:41,I don't know anyone looked into this.
00:39:41,00:39:45,"I mean, obviously the Austin industry, myself and Andy are employed by,"
00:39:45,00:39:46,is huge.
00:39:46,00:39:50,And there's lots of fan fiction and lots of people writing other books.
00:39:50,00:39:53,"So I just looked up, like, top of the top 20 of other books."
00:39:53,00:39:55,"There's just, like, definitely not Mr Darcy."
00:39:55,00:39:56,Prom and prejudice.
00:39:56,00:39:57,Colonel Brandon Styrie.
00:39:57,00:39:58,Pride and prejudice.
00:39:58,00:39:59,And zombies.
00:39:59,00:40:00,Mr Darcy takes a wife.
00:40:00,00:40:02,Pride and prejudice continues.
00:40:02,00:40:03,They read titles from my show.
00:40:03,00:40:04,Wow.
00:40:04,00:40:06,"Like, they are incredible amounts."
00:40:06,00:40:09,I read that a lot of people do this fan fiction
00:40:09,00:40:11,because there's not enough sex in the actual version.
00:40:11,00:40:12,"Yes, a lot of it is sexy."
00:40:12,00:40:15,"Darcy's passions, Pride and Prejudice we told through his eyes,"
00:40:15,00:40:20,"by Regina Jeffers, I think is a little bit more sexy than her stuff,"
00:40:20,00:40:23,"because she doesn't really go into it, it has to be said."
00:40:23,00:40:25,"Darcy and Elizabeth, nights and days at Pemberley."
00:40:25,00:40:26,"Oh, really?"
00:40:26,00:40:27,These are all available to my guys.
00:40:27,00:40:29,More nights and days are right.
00:40:29,00:40:31,Hot nights at Pemberley.
00:40:31,00:40:34,Mr Darcy's undoing a Pride and Prejudice variation.
00:40:34,00:40:37,"Do you know her sexiest line, maybe,"
00:40:37,00:40:41,or the line that most overtly refers to sex?
00:40:41,00:40:42,No.
00:40:42,00:40:43,It's pretty--
00:40:43,00:40:44,It's a list of sponge cocks.
00:40:44,00:40:47,I would like to see sponge cocks square pants.
00:40:47,00:40:49,The kids TV show.
00:40:49,00:40:50,"Oh, my God."
00:40:50,00:40:52,This is just a real classic Jane Auster line.
00:40:52,00:40:55,"It's in Mansfield Park, Fanny Price, the main character."
00:40:55,00:40:57,Fanny Price is the root name.
00:40:57,00:40:58,It's Fanny.
00:40:58,00:40:59,It's Fanny.
00:40:59,00:41:01,"No, it's a reference to her getting pregnant."
00:41:01,00:41:03,"And the sentence is just about, it's one of the last sentences."
00:41:03,00:41:06,It's about how Fanny Price now has been to come into some money
00:41:06,00:41:08,just after they had been married long enough
00:41:08,00:41:10,to begin to want an increase of income.
00:41:10,00:41:11,Oh.
00:41:11,00:41:13,That's not the rudest line in Mansfield Park.
00:41:13,00:41:15,"It is an overt reference to sex, though."
00:41:15,00:41:19,"Well, would you like an overt reference to something else?"
00:41:19,00:41:20,You know I would.
00:41:20,00:41:22,It's in Mansfield Park as well.
00:41:22,00:41:24,"And there's a character called Mary Crawford,"
00:41:24,00:41:25,"who's a bad, bad girl."
00:41:25,00:41:28,And she's talking about the admiralty.
00:41:28,00:41:31,And she says she used to know a load of admirals.
00:41:31,00:41:32,"And she says,"
00:41:32,00:41:36,"""Of rears and vices, I saw enough."""
00:41:36,00:41:37,Of rears and vices.
00:41:37,00:41:38,And vices.
00:41:38,00:41:39,"""Of rears and vices."""
00:41:39,00:41:40,"""Of rears and vices."""
00:41:40,00:41:41,"""Of rears and vices."""
00:41:41,00:41:42,"""Of rears and vices."""
00:41:42,00:41:44,"Which are both kinds of admiral, but they're also both references to something else."
00:41:44,00:41:45,I don't get it.
00:41:45,00:41:47,So vices as in woodwork.
00:41:47,00:41:48,"Yes, okay."
00:41:48,00:41:50,"""Rearers in the back of the room."""
00:41:50,00:41:51,Yes.
00:41:51,00:41:52,"Yeah, no."
00:41:52,00:41:53,And that's an incredibly filthy line.
00:41:53,00:41:54,That is quite raunchy.
00:41:54,00:41:55,I don't know.
00:41:55,00:41:58,"People are, the academic community is divided over whether it refers to Sodomile or Spanking."
00:41:58,00:42:00,But it's one of the two.
00:42:00,00:42:06,"I find it hint that Mary Corpid is a very saucy, not, not nice lady."
00:42:06,00:42:08,And that's our main character in trouble.
00:42:08,00:42:09,So that's what she's doing.
00:42:09,00:42:10,A good character study.
00:42:10,00:42:12,She could have said that she's known a lot of seemingly.
00:42:12,00:42:19,"And without that spelling, she had to play that quite obvious."
00:42:19,00:42:23,"You can play Jane Austen role playing game now, which I really want to play."
00:42:23,00:42:24,I want to play life.
00:42:24,00:42:25,Yes.
00:42:25,00:42:28,So if you don't want to book out for ostentatious.
00:42:28,00:42:32,"No, there's this online role playing game and it sounds really fun."
00:42:32,00:42:34,I think I saw that at the video game.
00:42:34,00:42:35,Yeah.
00:42:35,00:42:38,You get to pick a character and then you have all these interactions.
00:42:38,00:42:43,So some guardian journalist went and played it and started out by making this character
00:42:43,00:42:48,who lost her handkerchief and then found it and then went for a walk and bumped into a gentleman.
00:42:48,00:42:52,"Although the writer did say that while she was going on this virtual walk,"
00:42:52,00:42:56,she saw a bunch of sheep stacked on top of each other.
00:42:56,00:43:00,"So some of the algorithms in the game need some ironing out, she said."
00:43:00,00:43:03,Every ostentatious novel there's a discreet sheep stack.
00:43:03,00:43:05,My lord will it be?
00:43:05,00:43:07,The sheep are stacked so fine today.
00:43:07,00:43:14,"About ten years ago, an ostentbuff and an author sent off some of her manuscripts"
00:43:14,00:43:17,"to various British publishers, seeing if you could get them published."
00:43:17,00:43:21,And he made very slight changes to the title and the characters.
00:43:21,00:43:28,"And the pseudonym he used was Alison Lady as an A Lady, which is an ostent's pseudonym."
00:43:28,00:43:31,It was not the world's greatest pseudonym.
00:43:31,00:43:34,He's the guy who runs the Jane Austen Festival in Bath.
00:43:34,00:43:35,Well you know him well.
00:43:35,00:43:40,They all rejected the manuscripts and only one of them spotted the fact that it was almost identical to Austen's work.
00:43:40,00:43:44,"He got one letter back from Penguin, he just sent them Pride and Prejudice."
00:43:44,00:43:49,And they wrote back saying thank you for your recent letter and chapters from your book First Impressions.
00:43:49,00:43:52,It seems like a really original and interesting rite.
00:43:52,00:43:55,"I'm going to say I really do like Penguin though, don't you?"
00:43:55,00:43:57,I'll show them around the corner.
00:43:57,00:43:58,Excellent publisher.
00:43:58,00:43:59,Oh gosh.
00:43:59,00:44:00,Amazing.
00:44:00,00:44:02,And thank God they haven't spotted the art book.
00:44:02,00:44:04,It's just a complete rip-off of Bleek House.
00:44:04,00:44:11,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts."
00:44:11,00:44:13,Thank you very much indeed for listening.
