00:00:14,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:23,to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anna Tuginski, James Harkin, and Andrew"
00:00:28,00:00:32,Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:32,00:00:37,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:42,"Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact, my fact this week is that early proposals"
00:00:42,00:00:47,for raising the Titanic back to the ocean's surface included filling it up with ping pong
00:00:47,00:00:56,"balls, injecting 180,000 tons of Vaseline into it, and turning the ship itself into an ice"
00:00:56,00:00:58,rig.
00:00:58,00:01:03,What if another ship came along and then hit the Titanic?
00:01:03,00:01:08,It'd be a great reveal if you did hit an iceberg and it cracked open and so it was the
00:01:08,00:01:10,actual Titanic inside.
00:01:10,00:01:11,Exactly.
00:01:11,00:01:15,"I mean, who's got enough ping pong balls to do the first one of these things?"
00:01:15,00:01:18,That is a large number of ping pong balls.
00:01:18,00:01:20,"Are these all entirely serious suggestions, I guess, is what I'm trying to say."
00:01:20,00:01:26,"Yeah, well to an extent they are, you know, they're not necessarily practical, but in"
00:01:26,00:01:29,"most of the cases, we've seen that some of these methods work."
00:01:29,00:01:35,"So for example, the ping pong ball idea, that was actually used, not actual ping pong balls,"
00:01:35,00:01:39,but the premise of putting ping pong balls into a ship was used by a Danish engineer called
00:01:39,00:01:46,"Karl Kroyer, and back in 1964 there was a crash of a ship in the harbor in Kuwait city,"
00:01:46,00:01:51,"and the ship went down 6,000 sheep were on it, and so they were going to block the ocean,"
00:01:51,00:01:55,and the problem is that the harbor is where they pump drinking water from for the city.
00:01:55,00:02:00,"So they needed to get the sheep out as quick as possible, and they needed to get the ship"
00:02:00,00:02:01,up in one piece.
00:02:01,00:02:07,"So this guy, Karl Kroyer, had the idea of filling it with ping pong balls and idea which"
00:02:07,00:02:13,he got from an old Disney comic strip of Donald Duck and how he salvaged the ship by pumping
00:02:13,00:02:17,"it full of ping pong balls and it raising, and he developed these sort of new ping pong"
00:02:17,00:02:23,"balls that were sort of a lot smaller sort of pearl size, and they did it."
00:02:23,00:02:25,They successfully raised the ship.
00:02:25,00:02:26,That's not a ping pong ball.
00:02:26,00:02:30,"If it's size, if it's that small, it's not a ping pong ball anymore, because I'd love"
00:02:30,00:02:32,to see you try and play ping pong with one of those.
00:02:32,00:02:38,"But no, so, but this guy raised a bunch of ships using this method, and he tried to patent"
00:02:38,00:02:42,"it, but the patent was rejected because they said the idea comes from Donald Duck."
00:02:42,00:02:46,"He's the original holder of this idea, yeah, because it was in a cartoon, so they refused"
00:02:46,00:02:47,him the patent.
00:02:47,00:02:53,"Flash forward to modern times, the Mythbusters TV show successfully raised a ship using ping"
00:02:53,00:02:54,pong balls.
00:02:54,00:02:59,"The ship was called the myth-tannic, too, and they pumped 27,000 ping pong balls into it,"
00:02:59,00:03:03,"and it brought the boat back to the surface, so they claim it's plausible."
00:03:03,00:03:06,It's not a busted idea that Donald Duck could raise a ship with ping pong balls.
00:03:06,00:03:09,"So we're saying that the Titanic thing is feasible, is that what you're saying?"
00:03:09,00:03:13,"Not really, because when you get that low, the ping pong balls would be crushed, they'd"
00:03:13,00:03:15,be decimated before they even got to the bottom.
00:03:15,00:03:17,"Oh, yeah, because of the pressure."
00:03:17,00:03:20,"Exactly, so that's where it's not practical."
00:03:20,00:03:22,"However, the idea of lifting a ship is practical."
00:03:22,00:03:23,Cool.
00:03:23,00:03:24,What's with the ping pong balls?
00:03:24,00:03:27,"Is it just that their flotation device is, so it's like having a really weird looking"
00:03:27,00:03:28,life jacket.
00:03:28,00:03:29,"Yeah, exactly."
00:03:29,00:03:30,That's exactly it.
00:03:30,00:03:31,"Yeah, they flot it."
00:03:31,00:03:36,"That's why you never see ping pong players being lost at sea, just doesn't happen, because"
00:03:36,00:03:40,they always keep a few in the pocket just in case they're angry.
00:03:40,00:03:46,And you can use the bat as an all once you get to the surface and get yourself to safety.
00:03:46,00:03:52,There was a proposal to use dynamite to get the ship back up.
00:03:52,00:03:55,"Well, there was a proposal to blow it up with dynamite five days after it sank."
00:03:55,00:03:58,Was that an idea that was come up with by Wiley Coyote?
00:03:58,00:04:02,"Yes, because Donald Duck is coming up with ideas."
00:04:02,00:04:08,"So, this was genuinely five days after it sank, still April 1912, Vincent Astor, who was"
00:04:08,00:04:12,"the son of John Jacob Astor, the richest man on board the Titanic."
00:04:12,00:04:17,"His father had been lost on the Titanic, and he said, ""We should just drop a powerful"
00:04:17,00:04:23,"explosive to recover the bodies to dislodge the bodies from the ship."""
00:04:23,00:04:26,"Number of problems with this, firstly, knowing you exactly where the ship was, it turns"
00:04:26,00:04:30,"out that it's in two pieces, 600 metres apart."
00:04:30,00:04:34,And he was only deterred from this project when people said that the extreme pressure would
00:04:34,00:04:39,have compressed all the passengers on board so they were jelly.
00:04:39,00:04:42,"So you wouldn't get the bodies of your loved ones back, you would just get a kind of jelly."
00:04:42,00:04:44,"That actually turns out to be wrong, but..."
00:04:44,00:04:45,"Oh, really?"
00:04:45,00:04:49,"The people did not turn into jelly, right?"
00:04:49,00:04:55,"Well, I think that the water down there is really low in calcium, and so your bones kind"
00:04:55,00:04:56,of dissolve.
00:04:56,00:04:57,I think I read that.
00:04:57,00:04:58,"Oh, right."
00:04:58,00:04:59,Okay.
00:04:59,00:05:00,I think.
00:05:00,00:05:02,So let's look at some of the other ideas that they had done.
00:05:02,00:05:06,"This thing about Vaseline, I looked at the website that you sent, which had all of these"
00:05:06,00:05:07,ideas on.
00:05:07,00:05:11,"And on the website, it says, ""There is no proof that Vaseline can float."""
00:05:11,00:05:12,Yes.
00:05:12,00:05:15,And the practical suggestion from this.
00:05:15,00:05:17,There must be some evidence about whether Vaseline floats or not.
00:05:17,00:05:18,"That's what I thought, right?"
00:05:18,00:05:23,"It must be because it's not beyond the realms of man to check, right?"
00:05:23,00:05:28,"I don't have any Vaseline in my house, and I can't leave the house to buy some, so I don't"
00:05:28,00:05:30,"have any evidence, and I googled it."
00:05:30,00:05:35,"And if you search, does Vaseline float or Vaseline doesn't float or Vaseline floats?"
00:05:35,00:05:38,There doesn't seem to be any answers on Google.
00:05:38,00:05:41,So I actually still don't know whether Vaseline floats or not.
00:05:41,00:05:43,I've got a tub of Vaseline in my home.
00:05:43,00:05:44,Let's do it.
00:05:44,00:05:45,"Oh, it's another experiment."
00:05:45,00:05:46,"Oh, experiment time."
00:05:46,00:05:47,You'll take a slither bathroom.
00:05:47,00:05:48,Shall I go and get it?
00:05:48,00:05:49,Yeah.
00:05:49,00:05:50,Yeah.
00:05:50,00:05:51,Let's see.
00:05:51,00:05:52,"Hang on, hang on, hang on."
00:05:52,00:05:53,We've become blue-peaser.
00:05:53,00:05:54,Okay.
00:05:54,00:05:55,Okay.
00:05:55,00:05:57,And these back with some Vaseline.
00:05:57,00:05:58,I'm back.
00:05:58,00:05:59,Yep.
00:05:59,00:06:00,If you got some water to go with that Vaseline.
00:06:00,00:06:01,I've got some water.
00:06:01,00:06:07,"I'm just putting it, this is the stuff that MythBusters rejected, being not quite good"
00:06:07,00:06:08,enough to make the grade.
00:06:08,00:06:09,Okay.
00:06:09,00:06:10,So can you see this?
00:06:10,00:06:11,So I've got it.
00:06:11,00:06:12,I've got a little measuring jug of water.
00:06:12,00:06:14,Like a Parachute jug.
00:06:14,00:06:16,I'm just going to try the whole tub of Vaseline.
00:06:16,00:06:17,All right.
00:06:17,00:06:19,"The whole tub floats, but it's mostly air."
00:06:19,00:06:21,So that proves nothing.
00:06:21,00:06:27,"But what you could do is get up maybe 100,000 of them and treat them like ping pong balls."
00:06:27,00:06:28,Okay.
00:06:28,00:06:29,Okay.
00:06:29,00:06:36,I'm just going to scoop out a little knob of Vaseline.
00:06:36,00:06:37,Okay.
00:06:37,00:06:40,"I'm dropping it in three, two, one."
00:06:40,00:06:41,It floats.
00:06:41,00:06:42,It floats.
00:06:42,00:06:43,There we go.
00:06:43,00:06:44,That's one of life's great mysteries.
00:06:44,00:06:45,I'm looking.
00:06:45,00:06:47,You're trying to make it not float and it keeps floating.
00:06:47,00:06:48,Yeah.
00:06:48,00:06:51,"So your finger, your finger's the Titanic."
00:06:51,00:06:52,Look.
00:06:52,00:06:53,You're airborne.
00:06:53,00:06:55,Look how good it is.
00:06:55,00:07:00,What an underwhelming spot.
00:07:00,00:07:02,We should mostly stick to just talking about facts.
00:07:02,00:07:06,"I'm thinking just based on the last couple of episodes, that's experimenting."
00:07:06,00:07:07,So what about the iceberg?
00:07:07,00:07:08,Who's the idea was that?
00:07:08,00:07:09,The iceberg.
00:07:09,00:07:16,"Um, this first cropped up as far as I can tell in a 1977 issue of new scientist and it"
00:07:16,00:07:23,"was a man called Arthur Hickey, an unemployed haulage contractor from Warsaw who claims to"
00:07:23,00:07:29,be the officially appointed salvage master of the Titanic salvage company.
00:07:29,00:07:30,He claims.
00:07:30,00:07:33,"So it's not verified in the article, whether that's true or not."
00:07:33,00:07:37,"That's interesting though, that you said that he's unemployed, but also a haulage contractor"
00:07:37,00:07:43,"and also the head of this Titanic raising thing, he sounds like the least unemployed person"
00:07:43,00:07:44,I've ever heard.
00:07:44,00:07:45,You're right.
00:07:45,00:07:46,This guy's too much work.
00:07:46,00:07:47,Yeah.
00:07:47,00:07:48,"Um, so, uh, yeah."
00:07:48,00:07:52,"So he approached, um, and this is according to, uh, the new scientist says, according to a"
00:07:52,00:07:56,"recent issue of the B.O.C. group newspapers, which is the British oxygen company."
00:07:56,00:08:00,"He approached them off the back of a, a vivid dream that he had about turning the ship into"
00:08:00,00:08:04,"an iceberg, um, and allowing it to float to the surface."
00:08:04,00:08:09,"And I, I tried to find more about it. I think the idea is that they'd have to pump like half"
00:08:09,00:08:12,a million tons of liquid nitrogen down to it in order to do it.
00:08:12,00:08:17,"And I think the idea was there was going to be a mesh, a wire mesh that they would create"
00:08:17,00:08:24,"around the Titanic for that to then be the, the basis for the block of which it would stop."
00:08:24,00:08:26,And then that would slowly bring it back up to the surface.
00:08:26,00:08:31,"It is quite effectively dubious to get any of the Titanic back, isn't it?"
00:08:31,00:08:36,"I think a lot of the survivors were really anti-it, um, when they were still alive and a lot"
00:08:36,00:08:40,"of the families of the survivors now are saying, look, you know, people died and they ended"
00:08:40,00:08:41,up at the bottom of the sea.
00:08:41,00:08:46,"And probably it's not a good idea to, you know, to start the rest, yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:08:46,00:08:47,Yeah.
00:08:47,00:08:48,Yeah.
00:08:48,00:08:49,Yeah.
00:08:49,00:08:50,Yeah.
00:08:50,00:08:51,"It's, it's of mass grave sites, isn't it?"
00:08:51,00:08:52,Yeah.
00:08:52,00:08:55,"But it can be extremely useful dredging up ships, uh, because it might tell us the origin"
00:08:55,00:09:02,"of the universe. So some concepts are a really, really crucial source of a certain, of what's"
00:09:02,00:09:07,called low background metals and low background metals are totally essential for experiments
00:09:07,00:09:09,like looking for dark matter.
00:09:09,00:09:12,So looking for like all this dark matter in the universe that we don't know where it is
00:09:12,00:09:14,or looking for anti-matter.
00:09:14,00:09:18,"They're also really important for making guide encounters, for instance, because they don't"
00:09:18,00:09:20,emit any radiation at all.
00:09:20,00:09:22,They don't emit any particles.
00:09:22,00:09:26,"And the reason is, this is why they're called low background metals, that they're on ships"
00:09:26,00:09:30,that were built before the nuclear testing that started in the 1940s.
00:09:30,00:09:34,"And so all metal that's been manufactured, taken out of the earth and made into something"
00:09:34,00:09:39,"useful, since then has had radioactivity in it, just like we all do because of all that"
00:09:39,00:09:43,nuclear testing that left the world very radioactive.
00:09:43,00:09:45,"So all these ships built before, non-radioactive."
00:09:45,00:09:49,And then they were sunk to the bottom of the sea so they're totally protected from the radio
00:09:49,00:09:55,"activity. And they're the only place that you can find these low background lead and steel,"
00:09:55,00:09:57,which experiments need.
00:09:57,00:10:01,"So for instance, when they're dressing up, there's always this debate between archaeologists"
00:10:01,00:10:04,"who are like, we want this from our museum, please."
00:10:04,00:10:08,"And the scientists who are like, but we want to melt it all down for our experiments, please."
00:10:08,00:10:11,"And then the gravesite people who say, please leave it there."
00:10:11,00:10:12,Isn't that cool?
00:10:12,00:10:13,That is really amazing.
00:10:13,00:10:14,It's very cool.
00:10:14,00:10:18,"I've got an ethical dilemma for you, Titanic related."
00:10:18,00:10:20,Do you get married on the Titanic?
00:10:20,00:10:21,Are we talking about now?
00:10:21,00:10:24,Because that's quite a wet wedding.
00:10:24,00:10:25,Yeah.
00:10:25,00:10:29,"Two people have genuinely got married on the Titanic, since it sank."
00:10:29,00:10:30,That's impossible.
00:10:30,00:10:33,So they dived down in a diving bell or something.
00:10:33,00:10:38,"They dived down in a submersible, they're called David Lieberwitz and Kimberley Miller."
00:10:38,00:10:42,"And they won a trip to the Titanic, but I think they only won one ticket and they were told"
00:10:42,00:10:43,by the guys organizing it.
00:10:43,00:10:47,"We'll let the other one if you come along, but only if you agree to get married."
00:10:47,00:10:50,"Well, because they were a couple."
00:10:50,00:10:53,"And it was a way of raising publicity for this thing, this trip."
00:10:53,00:10:57,And they had to wear flame retardant suits and they had to crouch down on their knees for
00:10:57,00:11:00,"the ceremony because the submersible they were in was so tiny, but they were actually on"
00:11:00,00:11:05,"the bow of the ship, where the famous scene is in the movie, ""I'm the King of the World"","
00:11:05,00:11:06,all of this.
00:11:06,00:11:11,"And anyway, raised a lot of controversy, as you can probably imagine, and the reports"
00:11:11,00:11:12,were really good.
00:11:12,00:11:17,"Apparently, the couple rejected the assertion that their marriage was typically American and"
00:11:17,00:11:20,the height of bad taste.
00:11:20,00:11:24,"And the guy organizing it said, ""What's got to be remembered is that every time a couple"
00:11:24,00:11:28,"gets married in a church, they have to walk through a graveyard to get to the altar."""
00:11:28,00:11:29,That's such a good point.
00:11:29,00:11:31,"Well, it's a point."
00:11:31,00:11:32,It's a point.
00:11:32,00:11:33,It's incredible.
00:11:33,00:11:34,Good on them.
00:11:34,00:11:35,Yeah.
00:11:35,00:11:36,Imagine how claustrophobic that would be.
00:11:36,00:11:39,I think that's the least enjoyable wedding I can imagine.
00:11:39,00:11:44,"I think so, also, like if one of them changes their mind just before it happens, they've"
00:11:44,00:11:50,"got a very long trip back up to the surface in a very small, yeah."
00:11:50,00:11:56,One person who is seen as the person who survived the longest in the ocean and then was rescued
00:11:56,00:11:59,and survived was a guy called Charles Yoffin.
00:11:59,00:12:04,"He was the chief baker on board the Titanic, and when he plunged into the ocean, he was"
00:12:04,00:12:08,"seen plunging with two bottles of whiskey on him, which he downed while he was in there,"
00:12:08,00:12:10,and he survived for two hours.
00:12:10,00:12:13,"Most people perished after 15 minutes, but he survived two hours."
00:12:13,00:12:19,"He had the two bottles of whiskey and the alcohol somehow, they claimed, helped him to keep"
00:12:19,00:12:21,his body temperature going.
00:12:21,00:12:24,"He was also on a rough made out of baguettes though, wasn't he?"
00:12:24,00:12:25,Which didn't help.
00:12:25,00:12:29,"Sure, you would make your odds out of baguettes rather than your raft."
00:12:29,00:12:33,"I guess the baguette is a multi-purpose tool, you can lash a hundred together and then"
00:12:33,00:12:36,use two more.
00:12:36,00:12:40,"He was a complete legend, so the interview to him after the Titanic sunk, and it sounds"
00:12:40,00:12:44,"like he was just chilled the whole way through, and he wasn't just downing whiskey."
00:12:44,00:12:48,"He did try and save lots of people first, so he made sure the lifeboats were all stocked"
00:12:48,00:12:53,"with all his baked goods aside from the stuff he used to make the raft, and he threw lots"
00:12:53,00:12:57,"of deck chairs overboard to make makeshift kind of rafts for people, so they could grab"
00:12:57,00:12:58,onto.
00:12:58,00:13:03,"And then he said he just went back to his bed, downed whiskey, watched the water come under"
00:13:03,00:13:08,"the door, pretty calmly, just kind of chilled, and then eventually he knew that it was best"
00:13:08,00:13:12,"to stay on the ship, much like Jack in Titanic."
00:13:12,00:13:16,"Stay on the ship until the very last second, because you want to minimise your time in the"
00:13:16,00:13:17,water.
00:13:17,00:13:20,"Went in the water, usually if you're hammered, which he was, that would be really awful for"
00:13:20,00:13:25,"you, because all your vessels of phasodilated and you lose all the heat superfast."
00:13:25,00:13:29,"But they think, because he was so relaxed, because of this whiskey and his general personality,"
00:13:29,00:13:35,"it overrode the shock, I think it's the shock that kills lots of people, and the trauma"
00:13:35,00:13:37,often is what kills you.
00:13:37,00:13:44,"Imagine being that chilled as a humid, that even at the Titanic crash and sinking, you're"
00:13:44,00:13:48,"still like, it's alright, I believe you can move the deck chairs around."
00:13:48,00:13:53,"I mean, we always hear about rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, and in the first"
00:13:53,00:14:01,"7th attempt, I've never heard of what actually happened to the deck chairs."
00:14:01,00:14:05,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:14:05,00:14:13,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 1927, an owl was found that had another owl in its stomach,"
00:14:13,00:14:17,and that owl had a third owl in its stomach.
00:14:17,00:14:18,This is incredible.
00:14:18,00:14:23,I guess you could say they were cannibals.
00:14:23,00:14:25,You said you could say that.
00:14:25,00:14:29,"Honestly, I've been waiting to say that since you sent this fact around to all of us to research,"
00:14:29,00:14:33,and it was underwhelming as a moment for me.
00:14:33,00:14:40,It was up there with the floating Vaseline for all of us in underwhelming states.
00:14:40,00:14:41,This is amazing.
00:14:41,00:14:47,"Yeah, this is what is called an inter-specific owl trophic chain, which basically means"
00:14:47,00:14:50,"an owl eats an owl, which eats another owl."
00:14:50,00:14:57,"It's pretty much the only version of it I could find in owls at least, and it was a bad"
00:14:57,00:14:58,owl.
00:14:58,00:15:02,"It was shot in New England, and when they opened it up, it had a long eared owl inside"
00:15:02,00:15:07,"it, and when they opened that up, it had an eastern screech owl inside it."
00:15:07,00:15:12,"What we can say about it is that owls, they do eat other birds, and they eat other owls."
00:15:12,00:15:18,"We can learn about what they eat by looking in the stomachs, but it also shows the second"
00:15:18,00:15:23,"owl must have eaten the third owl quite quickly before it was eaten itself, if you know"
00:15:23,00:15:24,what I mean.
00:15:24,00:15:25,It wasn't even remnants.
00:15:25,00:15:26,It was almost Russian dolls.
00:15:26,00:15:28,It was almost Russian dolls.
00:15:28,00:15:32,It wasn't full because obviously you have to chew your owls before you can't eat a whole
00:15:32,00:15:33,owl.
00:15:33,00:15:35,I forgot that you don't just down an owl for real.
00:15:35,00:15:39,"Yeah, but also, the Russian dolls would be incredibly distressing if you open them up,"
00:15:39,00:15:43,"and they were just the minstrel maids of another Russian doll inside that, and then inside"
00:15:43,00:15:45,"that, they were more bloodied remnants."
00:15:45,00:15:50,"There would be more realistic though, I'm this."
00:15:50,00:15:52,It would be absolutely great.
00:15:52,00:15:53,Yeah.
00:15:53,00:15:54,"And yeah, owls, they eat other owls."
00:15:54,00:15:55,They eat lots of stuff.
00:15:55,00:15:56,They're amazing.
00:15:56,00:15:57,Well.
00:15:57,00:15:58,So this is the only example of this.
00:15:58,00:15:59,"What's it called, owl trophic?"
00:15:59,00:16:00,Something rather?
00:16:00,00:16:01,"Well, owl owl action."
00:16:01,00:16:03,I call it owl ow action.
00:16:03,00:16:09,"I call it inter-specific owl trophic chain, but you can call it kind of bowelism if"
00:16:09,00:16:10,you want.
00:16:10,00:16:13,I'm going to go kind of bowelism because I think scientists need to wait for more than
00:16:13,00:16:17,one instance of something before they come up with an unnecessarily long and complicated
00:16:17,00:16:18,name for it.
00:16:18,00:16:23,I think Andy might well have coined a new scientific term here.
00:16:23,00:16:24,This is exciting.
00:16:24,00:16:25,This is exciting.
00:16:25,00:16:26,A scientific term.
00:16:26,00:16:27,Very quickly.
00:16:27,00:16:30,This is like the only example of an animal eating an animal eating an animal of the same
00:16:30,00:16:31,species.
00:16:31,00:16:34,"The closest I could think of was something we covered in one of the book of the years,"
00:16:34,00:16:41,"which was when a shark was eaten by a shark that was caught by the shark, Greg Norman."
00:16:41,00:16:44,I forgot about that.
00:16:44,00:16:46,He's a golfer whose nickname is the shark.
00:16:46,00:16:47,Yeah.
00:16:47,00:16:48,He was fishing.
00:16:48,00:16:50,"Otherwise, we're just saying the shark whose name is Greg Norman."
00:16:50,00:16:51,"No, he doesn't make any sense."
00:16:51,00:16:52,I do call Greg Norman.
00:16:52,00:16:56,"If you have a pet shark, you're very unlikely to name it Greg Norman, are you?"
00:16:56,00:16:57,"No, I'm not."
00:16:57,00:17:01,You're going to call it snappy or stop it.
00:17:01,00:17:05,"But yeah, Greg Norman, the golfer was fishing and he caught a shark and then that shark"
00:17:05,00:17:09,"started eating another shark, so it was a three shark."
00:17:09,00:17:14,We have a couple of examples in the fossil record of animals eating other animals that have
00:17:14,00:17:20,"just eaten other animals, so for instance, they found a fish, which was eaten by an amphibian,"
00:17:20,00:17:25,"which was then eaten by a shark, and that was found in southwestern Germany, and then"
00:17:25,00:17:30,"we also found a snake, which was eaten by a lizard, which was just eaten a beetle."
00:17:30,00:17:34,"And weirdly, so these are the only two versions I could find in the whole fossil record, and"
00:17:34,00:17:39,"that was also found in Germany, so it seems there was something about German animals"
00:17:39,00:17:40,in the Lake Cretaceous.
00:17:40,00:17:47,"Don't want to get racist about it, but it seemed like they were up for this kind of thing."
00:17:47,00:17:49,I'm not counting the beetle.
00:17:49,00:17:50,No.
00:17:50,00:17:51,"I just, a beetle."
00:17:51,00:17:52,What the hell is that?
00:17:52,00:17:54,That doesn't count as an impressive matrioshka.
00:17:54,00:17:57,That's if you get to the end of your matrioshka and there's a grain of rice at the bottom
00:17:57,00:18:00,of something and you're supposed to count that.
00:18:00,00:18:03,You need something that's effectively the same size as the thing that's eaten it to
00:18:03,00:18:04,be impressive.
00:18:04,00:18:05,Okay.
00:18:05,00:18:06,"You're right, sure."
00:18:06,00:18:10,"So the owl is the opposite of a duck, I think."
00:18:10,00:18:11,That's right.
00:18:11,00:18:12,Yeah.
00:18:12,00:18:14,And owl is the opposite of a duck.
00:18:14,00:18:16,I think you're going to have to give us a bit more.
00:18:16,00:18:18,My question still holds.
00:18:18,00:18:20,So what is a duck famous for?
00:18:20,00:18:21,Cracking.
00:18:21,00:18:22,"Cracking, yeah."
00:18:22,00:18:23,Okay.
00:18:23,00:18:24,"And owls don't crack, of course."
00:18:24,00:18:30,"No, like it's famous for having like feathers which kind of repel water, right?"
00:18:30,00:18:31,Water off a duck's back.
00:18:31,00:18:36,"And so I can live in the water, and whenever any, whenever it rains on them or whenever"
00:18:36,00:18:38,"any water gets on them, it just goes straight off them."
00:18:38,00:18:42,But owls are one of the few birds that don't have this at all.
00:18:42,00:18:47,And they have got rid of any ability to repel water from their feathers.
00:18:47,00:18:49,"And so if they get wet, it's an absolute nightmare."
00:18:49,00:18:54,"If they go into the water to try and catch a fish or something like that, they can't even"
00:18:54,00:18:58,"jump out and fly away because the feathers, it's like a sheep trying to fly away."
00:18:58,00:19:01,The feathers are just so full of water they can't get out.
00:19:01,00:19:04,And so they'll end up swimming instead of flying.
00:19:04,00:19:05,That's how it flies there.
00:19:05,00:19:11,"But the reason is that if they had oil on their feathers, they would make more noise when"
00:19:11,00:19:16,they flew around and they want to be as stealthy as possible so they can catch their prey.
00:19:16,00:19:21,And so they've done away with the ability for water to flow off them in order to be more
00:19:21,00:19:23,"stealthy, which I think is really cool."
00:19:23,00:19:24,That is amazing.
00:19:24,00:19:26,They are the opposite of ducks.
00:19:26,00:19:27,Point proven.
00:19:27,00:19:31,"Presumably if it starts raining at night when an owl's hunting, you do hear the sound"
00:19:31,00:19:37,of owls just dropping out of the air and onto the ground.
00:19:37,00:19:41,"You can't hear owls, basically, until they are about three feet from your head, by which"
00:19:41,00:19:44,"point it is too late, because they're so silent."
00:19:44,00:19:49,"And so we don't really, we've got some idea about why they're so quiet."
00:19:49,00:19:51,But I think the full mechanism has yet to be properly explained.
00:19:51,00:19:55,There was a review last year about just why they are so quiet.
00:19:55,00:19:58,"Yeah, they've looked at their feathers haven't they, and they've found that they've got"
00:19:58,00:20:04,"like little wrinkly bits on the side, which means that when air comes, it kind of forms"
00:20:04,00:20:09,"tiny little vortices, which make less noise than if there was a load of turbulence."
00:20:09,00:20:10,Wow.
00:20:10,00:20:11,Is that unique in the world of birds?
00:20:11,00:20:13,I haven't checked them all.
00:20:13,00:20:14,I think it is.
00:20:14,00:20:17,"I think, I mean, there are about 200 species of owl, and some of them are really loud."
00:20:17,00:20:20,"The largest owl in the world is the, I think it's called the Blackest and Fish Owl."
00:20:20,00:20:25,"And that, because it's hunting fish, fish can't hear anything that you're doing above"
00:20:25,00:20:26,"the water, and they don't care."
00:20:26,00:20:31,"So those owls are incredibly loud, because they're not trying to listen for mice."
00:20:31,00:20:37,"But most owls are unbelievably quiet, and they're really slow as well."
00:20:37,00:20:38,This is a thing.
00:20:38,00:20:42,"I think, apart from birds that can actively hover, owls might be the slowest birds in the"
00:20:42,00:20:43,world.
00:20:43,00:20:46,They can fly as slowly as two miles an hour.
00:20:46,00:20:48,So you could easily outrun an owl?
00:20:48,00:20:50,"No, that's not what I'm saying."
00:20:50,00:20:53,I'm not saying that top speed is too much of an owl.
00:20:53,00:20:57,"So when they come at you and they're only three feet away, it's fine, because you have plenty"
00:20:57,00:20:58,of time to react.
00:20:58,00:21:02,You just walk over to the other side of the garden.
00:21:02,00:21:04,It's strong away.
00:21:04,00:21:08,Did you know the owls were responsible for the second world war?
00:21:08,00:21:09,God.
00:21:09,00:21:11,This is from the book Owl.
00:21:11,00:21:13,It's a book all about owls by Desmer Morris.
00:21:13,00:21:19,And there was a mythical bird called the Chick Chani owl.
00:21:19,00:21:20,I think it was Caribbean.
00:21:20,00:21:23,"It was on Andros Island, that's where it was."
00:21:23,00:21:25,"And it looked like an owl, and it was based on a real owl, which had gone extinct a few"
00:21:25,00:21:26,hundred years before.
00:21:26,00:21:32,"Anyway, as a young man, Neville Chamberlain was shopping down trees on Andros Island."
00:21:32,00:21:36,"And he came across a Chick Chani nest, a nest of this, I must say, mythical bird."
00:21:36,00:21:39,"This is all in the book, Owl."
00:21:39,00:21:44,"His work was refused to touch the nest, but he ignored them, and he chopped down the tree"
00:21:44,00:21:45,himself.
00:21:45,00:21:47,And this created a curse on him.
00:21:47,00:21:54,"Then, some years later, he became the British Prime Minister, and failed to stop Hitler's"
00:21:54,00:21:55,aggressive expansion.
00:21:55,00:21:59,And that's supposedly why his failure at the Munich conference happened.
00:21:59,00:22:00,Why is Andy like?
00:22:00,00:22:02,"To say this kind of shit, I'm not having enough."
00:22:02,00:22:04,I think he's not.
00:22:04,00:22:05,"I mean, who's supposing that?"
00:22:05,00:22:08,"Is it Desmer Morris, the author of the book, Owl, who I must say has a vested interest"
00:22:08,00:22:10,in giving Owls a stronger role in history?
00:22:10,00:22:14,Is it Desmer Morris who's supposed that this curse happened?
00:22:14,00:22:15,I don't think he created this story.
00:22:15,00:22:20,"I think the story is probably one that's quite local to the region, and quite historically"
00:22:20,00:22:21,specific.
00:22:21,00:22:25,"I'm not saying it was the only factor in the second one, but I don't think we can discount"
00:22:25,00:22:26,it.
00:22:26,00:22:27,That's a good point.
00:22:27,00:22:32,"Hey, I was looking into people who've had Owls for pets, because I know that some people"
00:22:32,00:22:35,"do keep Owls, but I wondered if that was ever a fashion."
00:22:35,00:22:38,"I didn't find many people, but one person who did have an Owl for a pet was Florence"
00:22:38,00:22:40,Nightingale.
00:22:40,00:22:41,Florence Nightingale.
00:22:41,00:22:48,"She had an Owl that she got from Athens, which was called Athena, and when she left Athens,"
00:22:48,00:22:53,"she took with her not only the Owl, but she had a secada called Plato, and two tortoises,"
00:22:53,00:22:55,"Mr and Mrs Hill, unfortunately."
00:22:55,00:23:00,They must have felt like such intellectual inferiorism at the dinner table with Athena
00:23:00,00:23:01,of Plato.
00:23:01,00:23:06,"Well, Mr and Mrs Hill, were they married or were they brother-assister?"
00:23:06,00:23:07,"Oh, not specific."
00:23:07,00:23:08,Fine.
00:23:08,00:23:09,Very good people.
00:23:09,00:23:10,"Well, they could have been unrelated hills, I guess."
00:23:10,00:23:15,"And then Mrs Hill got married to another hill, I guess, tortoises, but they're still"
00:23:15,00:23:16,hung out with their brother.
00:23:16,00:23:17,Yeah.
00:23:17,00:23:22,"And then she presumably split Mrs Hill up from her husband, the other Mr Hill, in order"
00:23:22,00:23:23,to adopt them as pets.
00:23:23,00:23:24,Exactly.
00:23:24,00:23:27,"Not all the evidence points towards the spouses, doesn't it?"
00:23:27,00:23:28,It does.
00:23:28,00:23:29,It does.
00:23:29,00:23:32,"Unfortunately, the animals became, so there were four of them."
00:23:32,00:23:40,"They became three when, unfortunately, Athena ate Plato, secada."
00:23:40,00:23:45,"So but she saw that as two pets merging into one, which was more convenient because she carried"
00:23:45,00:23:49,the owl around with her a lot when she went on walks and so on.
00:23:49,00:23:50,Wow.
00:23:50,00:23:55,I wonder how many parents have ever tried that excuse on their children when the dog is just
00:23:55,00:23:56,eating the cat?
00:23:56,00:23:57,"No, it's all right."
00:23:57,00:24:01,You've got both of them now.
00:24:01,00:24:07,"So Athena, unfortunately, Florence Nightingale, known as someone who nursed a lot of people"
00:24:07,00:24:12,"in the Crimean War, Athena is actually a casualty of the Crimean War because when Florence"
00:24:12,00:24:18,"went to the Crimean War, she left Athena in her house in the attic with some food and assuming"
00:24:18,00:24:21,that she would survive on any mice that would be running around.
00:24:21,00:24:26,And she abandoned that house and they eventually went back and they found Athena dead inside
00:24:26,00:24:30,"the attic, because obviously, I know what you're saying, but I wouldn't say that's a casualty"
00:24:30,00:24:31,of the Crimean War.
00:24:31,00:24:38,Oh really?
00:24:38,00:24:41,That's something you read out at the end of the traumatising news of another battle of
00:24:41,00:24:42,the Crimean War.
00:24:42,00:24:43,And it lighten news.
00:24:43,00:24:48,"An owl has been abandoned to die, and that's it."
00:24:48,00:24:52,"Well, if you live in London, you can still visit Athena the owl because it was, there's"
00:24:52,00:24:55,"no point now, it was recovered and sent to taxidermy."
00:24:55,00:25:00,So Athena the owl is kept at St Thomas's in the Florence Nightingale Museum.
00:25:00,00:25:07,I wonder if anyone's opened up a theme that's to see if Plato's still there.
00:25:07,00:25:13,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy."
00:25:13,00:25:17,My fact is that almost every Englishman at the Battle of Agincourt ate a small amount
00:25:17,00:25:20,of soil just before the battle started.
00:25:20,00:25:22,"Wow, why did they do that?"
00:25:22,00:25:23,Yeah.
00:25:23,00:25:25,Why did they do that?
00:25:25,00:25:27,It's a good question.
00:25:27,00:25:30,I think it was symbolic.
00:25:30,00:25:35,"Well, obviously it was symbolic because there was no practical, there was no nutritional"
00:25:35,00:25:36,value to this.
00:25:36,00:25:37,No.
00:25:37,00:25:39,So we should say briefly what Agincourt was.
00:25:39,00:25:45,It was one of the principally remembered battles of the Hundred Years War or the series
00:25:45,00:25:49,of wars that we now we know as the Hundred Years War was in 1415 and the reason it's widely
00:25:49,00:25:53,remembered in England is because it was a big English victory over France and a lot
00:25:53,00:25:57,of the other battles of the Hundred Years War have slightly been allowed to slip
00:25:57,00:25:58,into history.
00:25:58,00:26:02,"They're quite well known in France, so I would say the other battles of the Hundred Years"
00:26:02,00:26:03,War.
00:26:03,00:26:04,Hundred percent.
00:26:04,00:26:07,"Between the two sides, we're covering memorials of all the battles, except the English"
00:26:07,00:26:08,War.
00:26:08,00:26:11,"All our Frenchist listeners right now are going, well, I've not heard this."
00:26:11,00:26:14,They've dug up something really nice here.
00:26:14,00:26:17,"They genuinely, in France, it's not really taught."
00:26:17,00:26:21,"I mean, do write in if you have heard of it, but I think it's not famous at all in France,"
00:26:21,00:26:26,"which is bizarre because for any non-British listeners, Agincourt is extremely well-known"
00:26:26,00:26:27,here.
00:26:27,00:26:30,"For that reason, even though it was super short, it only lasted maybe half an hour."
00:26:30,00:26:33,I found the brilliant website.
00:26:33,00:26:38,It's run by the University of Southampton that has a list of everyone who was fighting Agincourt.
00:26:38,00:26:43,"Actually everyone who they could find from the whole Hundred Years War, but they have the"
00:26:43,00:26:47,"specific people who they know are Agincourt and it's a great long list, obviously there"
00:26:47,00:26:53,"were thousands and thousands of soldiers, so I went through that and we had one guy called"
00:26:53,00:26:56,"Thomas Sadler, who actually was a Sadler."
00:26:56,00:26:57,That was his job.
00:26:57,00:27:02,There was a guy called John Horsey who was a knight and there was a guy called Matthew Boer
00:27:02,00:27:03,who was an archer.
00:27:03,00:27:04,It was not cool.
00:27:04,00:27:05,It was not cool.
00:27:05,00:27:10,"And they also have the whole French team as well, like all the French soldiers that were"
00:27:10,00:27:11,there.
00:27:11,00:27:15,And there were 64 French soldiers at the Battle of Agincourt called Colin.
00:27:15,00:27:16,Really?
00:27:16,00:27:17,Wow.
00:27:17,00:27:19,And four of those were called Colin Poisson.
00:27:19,00:27:20,Colin the fish.
00:27:20,00:27:21,Colin the fish.
00:27:21,00:27:22,Colin Poisson.
00:27:22,00:27:24,Colin Poisson's at the Battle of Agincourt.
00:27:24,00:27:25,Seriously.
00:27:25,00:27:26,Wow.
00:27:26,00:27:28,Are we sure that's real?
00:27:28,00:27:29,That's real.
00:27:29,00:27:30,That's real.
00:27:30,00:27:31,Playtosa card is there.
00:27:31,00:27:32,It's real.
00:27:32,00:27:33,It's real.
00:27:33,00:27:37,They should get the academics onto this list because there's been debate raging since
00:27:37,00:27:42,"the Battle of Agincourt about how many soldiers fought there and it's still very, very"
00:27:42,00:27:43,vigorous.
00:27:43,00:27:46,So they should just count all the names on that because there's all sorts of exaggerations.
00:27:46,00:27:50,So the English got taught for a good few hundred years that they were outnumbered about
00:27:50,00:27:55,"10 times or 20 times, you know, the French had hundreds of thousands of times more soldiers."
00:27:55,00:27:59,"But I think they think now that it was about two to one, don't they, in terms of outnumbering."
00:27:59,00:28:00,Yeah.
00:28:00,00:28:01,Which is still good.
00:28:01,00:28:04,"But the English had more archers, twice as many archers."
00:28:04,00:28:09,"So if you do, again, if you're a broad listener, if you do a word association, Agincourt, I think"
00:28:09,00:28:13,people go longbow because that was the huge deal at Agincourt.
00:28:13,00:28:18,It was that English decided we're going to just rely on having most of our people being
00:28:18,00:28:19,archers.
00:28:19,00:28:23,"We've got this great longbow that the Welsh gave us, thank you, Wales."
00:28:23,00:28:27,"And we're just going to fire at them from behind, whereas the French were a bit more into"
00:28:27,00:28:33,"their chivalry and their knights in shining, heavy, annoying armour."
00:28:33,00:28:34,And they didn't really like the bow.
00:28:34,00:28:35,They thought it was a bit unjentlemently.
00:28:35,00:28:39,"So they just had shed loads of cavalry, which, as it turned out, when it was pissing"
00:28:39,00:28:44,"with rain and the mud was thigh deep and the horses just sank into it, was a disadvantage."
00:28:44,00:28:48,"Well, the thing is it's like, in theory, it's not that much of a disadvantage because"
00:28:48,00:28:52,"if you're wearing a full suit of armour, there's not many places that those arrows can get"
00:28:52,00:28:53,in.
00:28:53,00:28:56,"Like, it could hit you in the neck, it could hit you in the groin, there's one or two other"
00:28:56,00:28:57,places.
00:28:57,00:29:00,"All the places where it could hit you are not very nice, but the chances are it would bounce"
00:29:00,00:29:01,off you.
00:29:01,00:29:06,"But of course, what happened was the arrows hit the horses and then the horses just went"
00:29:06,00:29:11,crazy because they'd been hit by an arrow and they unseated the riders who were then
00:29:11,00:29:16,in a whole load of mud with a whole load of extremely heavy armour and just were sitting
00:29:16,00:29:19,"ducks for the, for the edge."
00:29:19,00:29:22,With the opposite of sitting owls.
00:29:22,00:29:23,Yes.
00:29:23,00:29:28,"There was a moment just before the battle because all the English archers were facing,"
00:29:28,00:29:31,"a lot of them facing the French lines, they had a stake in the ground in front of them"
00:29:31,00:29:34,"as an anti-cavary device, you know, which is a good one."
00:29:34,00:29:37,"When you say stake, you mean a piece of what?"
00:29:37,00:29:42,"No, I mean, I mean a nice t-bone steak with some horse radish."
00:29:42,00:29:48,"It was to try and freak out the French horses, they're saying, ""This is what you're going"
00:29:48,00:29:50,"to have to be after this battle, no, sorry."""
00:29:50,00:29:54,"They had a massive sharpened wooden stake and they stuck it in the ground, you know, facing"
00:29:54,00:29:55,the French lines.
00:29:55,00:29:59,"But there was this weird moment just before the battle where all the English were told,"
00:29:59,00:30:03,can you advance a bit so that we are in range of the French cavalry because the French
00:30:03,00:30:06,hadn't lined up and started moving yet.
00:30:06,00:30:10,"And the English had to come around to the front of their stake, all these archers, he"
00:30:10,00:30:16,"the stake out of the ground, very strong exercise required to do that, it's quite an exertion."
00:30:16,00:30:21,"Move the stake forward a fair bit so you're in line, so that you're in range of the French"
00:30:21,00:30:25,"and then hammer the stake back into the ground, facing the French cavalry again."
00:30:25,00:30:26,Wow.
00:30:26,00:30:28,"And you have to do all of this while you're completely exposed, your back is to the"
00:30:28,00:30:32,enemy and the French observed this happening and did nothing about it.
00:30:32,00:30:37,"It was a really strange lapse on the French side and I, yeah, I'm sure proper historians"
00:30:37,00:30:40,"could account for it, but I just don't know why that happened."
00:30:40,00:30:44,"I think it was a big disadvantage to attack, so I always think the beginning of a battle reminds"
00:30:44,00:30:48,"me a bit of the beginning of a cycling race, you know what those races change, you like"
00:30:48,00:30:49,"cycling, where they in the village room."
00:30:49,00:30:53,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, where they all really, really slow to set off with and as soon as one of"
00:30:53,00:30:54,them goes.
00:30:54,00:30:55,"Oh, exactly."
00:30:55,00:30:57,"Omnick, Omnick, Omnick, or something, I can't remember."
00:30:57,00:30:58,Yes.
00:30:58,00:30:59,What's the disadvantage?
00:30:59,00:31:00,Why is it bad to start?
00:31:00,00:31:05,"In cycling, what it is is if you're in someone's slipstream, it's a lot easier, so"
00:31:05,00:31:08,"it's better for them to go first, you to go behind them and then you can overtake them at"
00:31:08,00:31:11,"the last second, but I don't know why it's in battle."
00:31:11,00:31:17,"In battle, same thing, it's a slipstream issue, it's easier to defend than to attack"
00:31:17,00:31:21,"with the generally accepted wisdom, so you didn't want to be the army attacking."
00:31:21,00:31:23,"I think you probably, you know, you start losing your shape when you attack, whereas you"
00:31:23,00:31:24,keep it when you defend.
00:31:24,00:31:29,"So there was this weird moment where before the battle, they had their battle lines lined"
00:31:29,00:31:33,"up and they sent some heralds to meet in the middle and say, hey, are you going to"
00:31:33,00:31:37,"the cave and then the other heralds said no and vice versa, so the heralds went back"
00:31:37,00:31:39,"and said, okay, we're at war."
00:31:39,00:31:43,"And then no one moved for ages, they just stood staring at each other because no one wanted"
00:31:43,00:31:44,to be the first to attack.
00:31:44,00:31:48,"And yeah, the French won, attacking won, attacking and eventually the English thought,"
00:31:48,00:31:49,"I saw it, we'll do it then."
00:31:49,00:31:54,"Isn't that a large, wasn't there that stat about during wartime, about how many bullets"
00:31:54,00:31:57,were shot to miss as opposed to kill?
00:31:57,00:32:01,People would fire above the heads of the enemy because they didn't want to be someone
00:32:01,00:32:02,who took a life.
00:32:02,00:32:06,Because like a huge number of shots were aimed to miss.
00:32:06,00:32:09,"They say that about Vietnam, don't they?"
00:32:09,00:32:12,"Yeah, I think that's a slightly different thing more about the psychology of not wanting"
00:32:12,00:32:14,"to kill someone, isn't it?"
00:32:14,00:32:18,"Oh, so you think that not starting is just purely out of strategy?"
00:32:18,00:32:19,That's what that's the way it has to study.
00:32:19,00:32:20,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:32:20,00:32:22,You're not starting it.
00:32:22,00:32:26,These guys did not have a problem with killing as many people as they possibly could.
00:32:26,00:32:27,Okay.
00:32:27,00:32:28,Don't you worry.
00:32:28,00:32:33,"I don't know if there's any benefit of that out there, right?"
00:32:33,00:32:36,"Do you know that a few years after the war, six years after the Battle of Ashencourt, Henry"
00:32:36,00:32:43,"the Fifth sent back a cavalry of soldiers back to France, and do you guys know why?"
00:32:43,00:32:48,He had left his wallet in that same car.
00:32:48,00:32:50,"No, I don't know."
00:32:50,00:32:52,He sent them in to collect the foreskin of Jesus.
00:32:52,00:32:54,"Of course, that was going to be my next guess."
00:32:54,00:32:57,"Yeah, I knew if I gave you a bit more time."
00:32:57,00:32:58,Wow.
00:32:58,00:33:03,"So he got married to Catherine, who was the daughter of the French king, and she was expecting"
00:33:03,00:33:04,her first baby.
00:33:04,00:33:10,"And he heard rumors that France had the foreskin of Jesus Christ there, one of the holy relics."
00:33:10,00:33:17,"So he sent his men back in to pick it up without any sort of hassle or resistance, and they"
00:33:17,00:33:18,brought it back.
00:33:18,00:33:19,And it was brought to Catherine.
00:33:19,00:33:24,"And supposedly, as it's reported, the scent of the foreskin helped her to give birth"
00:33:24,00:33:27,to Henry the Fifth in a nice calm way.
00:33:27,00:33:32,"So as if they rub it under her nose, and the sweet scent, I don't know if they dangled"
00:33:32,00:33:34,"it like an air freshener in front of her, or if they actually physically robbed it."
00:33:34,00:33:38,I don't think they used the foreskin of Jesus as an air freshener.
00:33:38,00:33:44,"You wouldn't have that in the Christmas tree dangling in your car, would you?"
00:33:44,00:33:47,What flavor is this?
00:33:47,00:33:51,"Yeah, no, but supposedly in the scent of it, the sweet scent of it helped her for a natural"
00:33:51,00:33:52,birth.
00:33:52,00:33:54,"So yeah, what a great baby shower present."
00:33:54,00:33:57,"That really outdoes all the other presents at a baby shower, doesn't it?"
00:33:57,00:34:02,"If you're the one who's brought Jesus' foreskin, they always say about, really, like, privileged"
00:34:02,00:34:03,children.
00:34:03,00:34:08,"They were born with Jesus' foreskin in the mouth, don't they?"
00:34:08,00:34:12,"We've probably been excommunicated multiple times for mentioning Jesus' foreskin, haven't"
00:34:12,00:34:13,we?
00:34:13,00:34:14,Yeah.
00:34:14,00:34:15,Why not one more time?
00:34:15,00:34:16,Yeah.
00:34:16,00:34:17,So I go on now.
00:34:17,00:34:18,That's what we're on Catherine.
00:34:18,00:34:21,"I read another thing, which is that Samuel Peep's kissed her."
00:34:21,00:34:22,Did he?
00:34:22,00:34:25,What?
00:34:25,00:34:26,Yeah.
00:34:26,00:34:27,But this was 200 years between.
00:34:27,00:34:28,200 years between.
00:34:28,00:34:29,Yeah.
00:34:29,00:34:30,So he wrote this in his diary.
00:34:30,00:34:36,"It was show Tuesday, 1669, and she was buried in Westminster Abbey, and she had an alabaster"
00:34:36,00:34:41,"and all that sort of stuff, but a lot of attacks happened, I think it was Henry VIII, got rid"
00:34:41,00:34:48,"of the alabaster, didn't like the idea of her, but her coffin, her crypt, was still there,"
00:34:48,00:34:54,"and it busted open in 1669, revealing her corpse inside, so the lid was open, and people"
00:34:54,00:35:00,"could visit the open lid of Catherine, and Samuel Peep's leaned in and gave her a kiss,"
00:35:00,00:35:07,"and reported it in his diary that at 36 years old, and I did kiss a queen, he wrote, it was"
00:35:07,00:35:08,on his birthday.
00:35:08,00:35:14,"I mean, did he really kiss a queen, or did he just, you know, nozzella cups?"
00:35:14,00:35:16,"Kiss the two hundred-year-old corpse, yeah."
00:35:16,00:35:19,"It feels like a bit of a stretch, it feels a bit me too, to be honest."
00:35:19,00:35:23,"A queen's a queen forever, but the queen always refers to Queen Elizabeth as her majesty,"
00:35:23,00:35:25,as if the Queen Elizabeth I first.
00:35:25,00:35:26,Okay.
00:35:26,00:35:27,Yeah.
00:35:27,00:35:31,"I'm with Peep, so I think he nailed it, a great birthday present, it's up there with four"
00:35:31,00:35:36,"skin of Jesus, in terms of good gifts."
00:35:36,00:35:41,"Some of the myths about Ashen Car come from Shakespeare, because he wrote Henry V, in"
00:35:41,00:35:46,"great play, that is mostly set at the Battle of Ashen Car, and one of the characters"
00:35:46,00:35:53,"in Henry V is Fulstaff, and he is based on a real person who was there, who was not called"
00:35:53,00:35:58,"Fulstaff, but was called Falsstaff, who was a famous person, who was at the battle, and later"
00:35:58,00:36:01,went on to run a pub in Sothek.
00:36:01,00:36:08,"But this guy, I think the BBC need to make a massive budget TV series about Falsstaff,"
00:36:08,00:36:10,because he is amazing.
00:36:10,00:36:15,"He fought at the Battle of Ashen Car, he won another battle, the Battle of the Herrings,"
00:36:15,00:36:19,"he was at the sea, and the French came to attack him, and he got a load of herring barrels"
00:36:19,00:36:24,"and put them all in a big line, and then hit behind them and attacked the French from"
00:36:24,00:36:25,there.
00:36:25,00:36:31,"He fought against Joan of Arc, at the Siege of Orleans, and the was rumours that John Fasstaff"
00:36:31,00:36:37,"was coming, and the brother of Joan of Arc decided not to tell her, because everyone was"
00:36:37,00:36:41,"so scared of this guy, and they thought they know that Fasstaff is coming, then everyone's"
00:36:41,00:36:46,"going to panic, so they didn't tell her, and Joan of Arc said to her, ""Brother, bastard"
00:36:46,00:36:50,"bastard, in the name of God, I command you that as soon as you hear of Fasstaff's coming,"
00:36:50,00:36:54,"you will let me know, for if he gets through without my knowing it, I swear to you that I"
00:36:54,00:36:57,"will have your head caught off."""
00:36:57,00:37:02,"And he was at another battle where the English got routed, and he was one of the only people"
00:37:02,00:37:06,"whose group of soldiers managed to survive, but it meant that everyone else thought that"
00:37:06,00:37:07,he'd been cowardly.
00:37:07,00:37:10,"When he hadn't been cowardly, it had just been the way that the battle had worked out,"
00:37:10,00:37:15,"and he lost his reputation and had to go back to the UK, and he'd been a hero, but everyone"
00:37:15,00:37:20,"thought he was a coward, and he's just amazing, and then all of his money went to the foundation"
00:37:20,00:37:21,of modeling college.
00:37:21,00:37:22,Okay.
00:37:22,00:37:26,"So, here's like this suit that finally rejuvenating Fasstaff's reputation, is that what we're"
00:37:26,00:37:27,doing today?
00:37:27,00:37:28,I think so.
00:37:28,00:37:29,We're saving Fasstaff.
00:37:29,00:37:31,He was the Baron of Silly in France.
00:37:31,00:37:34,"I mean, what mod do you need about this guy?"
00:37:34,00:37:35,He was brilliant.
00:37:35,00:37:40,"But as you're tied, although a bit of a misleading title, if I went to see the Baron of Silly as"
00:37:40,00:37:41,a movie...
00:37:41,00:37:43,"He is Shakespeare's recurring character, isn't he?"
00:37:43,00:37:46,"I always like that there's a rip, you know, pops up three times."
00:37:46,00:37:47,Yeah.
00:37:47,00:37:48,Feels like a funny Easter egg.
00:37:48,00:37:51,"Every time you come, it's a little call back."
00:37:51,00:37:57,"Henry the Fifth has obviously used a lot still today, that rousing speech that he gives"
00:37:57,00:38:01,"in, for many things, like football, you know, if there's the World Cup, someone might"
00:38:01,00:38:03,do an advert giving that speech.
00:38:03,00:38:09,But one person who was particularly fond of it and got into movies as a result during World
00:38:09,00:38:11,War II was Winston Churchill.
00:38:11,00:38:18,So Churchill actively became a producer or a sort of accredited help on a movie of Henry
00:38:18,00:38:24,the Fifth and enlisted Lawrence Olivier to play it because he wanted it to be seen as
00:38:24,00:38:30,"a stirring thing for the British, and trailers were released on the day that the troops were"
00:38:30,00:38:34,"invading Normandy, and they used a trailer where they showed modern day London and then brought"
00:38:34,00:38:40,"it back into the old London to sort of help people get excited that, you know, this is something"
00:38:40,00:38:42,will conquer and something that will do.
00:38:42,00:38:45,It's not the only time that Winston Churchill did that either during World War II.
00:38:45,00:38:49,"He then got Lawrence Olivier to make another, and when I say got him, he encouraged him,"
00:38:49,00:38:55,"but I guess that was a pretty strong encouragement during the wartime, to make a movie about Nelson"
00:38:55,00:39:00,"and Emma Hamilton, because in the movie, which was made predominantly for Americans, he"
00:39:00,00:39:05,wanted to draw parallels between Napoleon and Adolf Hitler and have the American public
00:39:05,00:39:10,see that movie as something whereby they needed to come and get behind it.
00:39:10,00:39:13,So Lawrence Olivier is sort of like a bizarre propaganda spy for the British.
00:39:13,00:39:17,Maybe if Winston Churchill spent less time directing films and more time winning the
00:39:17,00:39:18,"war, it wouldn't have lasted six years."
00:39:18,00:39:19,Yeah.
00:39:19,00:39:20,"Well, maybe if…"
00:39:20,00:39:21,The counterpoint.
00:39:21,00:39:26,"There's a Chamberlain hadn't seen that owl that time, then we wouldn't have had a war in"
00:39:26,00:39:27,the first place.
00:39:27,00:39:28,That's true.
00:39:28,00:39:30,There was so many big hits.
00:39:30,00:39:36,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna."
00:39:36,00:39:40,My fact this week is that the first known coloring book was meant for adults.
00:39:40,00:39:41,Wow.
00:39:41,00:39:48,"It's just been re-found, rediscovered, or in 2017, it was rediscovered."
00:39:48,00:39:53,"If they just find one that had been coloured in, is that what happened?"
00:39:53,00:39:57,"It actually hasn't been coloured in, so someone obviously had it and then didn't even use"
00:39:57,00:39:58,it.
00:39:58,00:39:59,"Because otherwise, you wouldn't be able to tell it was a coloring in book."
00:39:59,00:40:00,No.
00:40:00,00:40:01,"If it's been coloured in really well, it's just…"
00:40:01,00:40:02,Yes.
00:40:02,00:40:03,That's really a good point.
00:40:03,00:40:07,"Imagine if you had a kid so good at coloring in, people would browse through the coloring"
00:40:07,00:40:09,"in book, just thought it was a book."
00:40:09,00:40:13,"Yeah, they would think that you had a really weird taste of books today."
00:40:13,00:40:21,"There seems to be all the books on your bookcase, just pictures of birds."
00:40:21,00:40:26,"Well, this was pictures of flowers, in fact, so this was a book called The Flourest, published"
00:40:26,00:40:34,"in 1760 by a guy called Robert Seer, and rediscovered in a Missouri Botanic Garden in 2017."
00:40:34,00:40:38,"And it said on the front cover, it was for the use and amusement of gentlemen and ladies."
00:40:38,00:40:42,"And then, inside, it had instructions for how to colour all the pictures in, so it was"
00:40:42,00:40:43,just lots of pictures.
00:40:43,00:40:47,"So you can look it up online, it's very beautiful, it's all publicly available."
00:40:47,00:40:51,"And it had techniques, it told you what colour you should do the flowers, so none of this"
00:40:51,00:40:54,freedom that the kids have now.
00:40:54,00:40:59,"And it had sort of the recipes to mix your own colours, or it said, you can also get pre-mixed"
00:40:59,00:41:02,"colours from the publisher of this book, FRII, if you want."
00:41:02,00:41:03,And it was great.
00:41:03,00:41:05,"Don't know why the person didn't colour it in, I would have."
00:41:05,00:41:09,"Well, maybe he didn't have all the specific coloured pencils that you'd need it to have"
00:41:09,00:41:13,"to do it, because if you're not allowed to have your own freedom and colour all your"
00:41:13,00:41:16,"flowers in black, like I used to do with all my colouring books then."
00:41:16,00:41:17,"Oh, I know."
00:41:17,00:41:18,So emo.
00:41:18,00:41:19,Wow.
00:41:19,00:41:20,So I should have a little go.
00:41:20,00:41:21,So emo.
00:41:21,00:41:22,"Yeah, you're right."
00:41:22,00:41:27,"Maybe it was like, when you know when you buy an electric toy for a kid and they open it up"
00:41:27,00:41:31,"and you realise it hasn't come with the batteries, it was like that and you got home and then"
00:41:31,00:41:33,ready to have to order the bloody paints.
00:41:33,00:41:37,"But actually, isn't it true that someone had been using the book to press flowers?"
00:41:37,00:41:39,I think this one that they found.
00:41:39,00:41:41,So they opened it up and they hadn't coloured it in.
00:41:41,00:41:45,But they seem sort of placed flowers on top of where they should have been coloured in.
00:41:45,00:41:46,Yeah.
00:41:46,00:41:48,Completely misunderstood in the first book.
00:41:48,00:41:49,"Well, that's true."
00:41:49,00:41:50,"Well, it was the first one."
00:41:50,00:41:51,"Like, it's not obvious what to do, is it?"
00:41:51,00:41:52,Yeah.
00:41:52,00:41:53,That's the first ever one.
00:41:53,00:41:58,Maybe it was built as a pressier flowers book and we then changed it into a colouring book.
00:41:58,00:42:01,"Oh, what is it you were meant to put the flower on top of the outline of the flower?"
00:42:01,00:42:02,Yeah.
00:42:02,00:42:03,Fill it in.
00:42:03,00:42:04,"Like a football sticker album, basically."
00:42:04,00:42:05,Yes.
00:42:05,00:42:06,Yes.
00:42:06,00:42:07,Yes.
00:42:07,00:42:08,First panini.
00:42:08,00:42:09,Is this the first panini album?
00:42:09,00:42:10,Yeah.
00:42:10,00:42:12,It's explicitly not what this is.
00:42:12,00:42:16,"He's very clear in the instructions, but there should be one of those."
00:42:16,00:42:21,"Anna, from the article you sent around, it looks like there were some earlier not full colouring"
00:42:21,00:42:25,"books, but there were illustrations distributing which were designed to be coloured in by readers."
00:42:25,00:42:26,These woodcuts of Christ.
00:42:26,00:42:29,"Well, a lot of people did colour them in, yeah."
00:42:29,00:42:30,Yeah.
00:42:30,00:42:31,"Yeah, from the 15th century."
00:42:31,00:42:34,And we know that people colour them in because we have all these different versions
00:42:34,00:42:38,"of them where some people have just done, it's the picture of the crucifixion."
00:42:38,00:42:40,Some people have just done the blood or some people have just coloured in.
00:42:40,00:42:44,The Christ figure and then some people have gone to town and they've coloured in the angels
00:42:44,00:42:45,and they've coloured in the background.
00:42:45,00:42:48,Did anyone colour everything in black or?
00:42:48,00:42:49,No.
00:42:49,00:42:50,No.
00:42:50,00:42:51,No.
00:42:51,00:42:54,We went through so much charcoal when I was a child.
00:42:54,00:42:57,But they were good.
00:42:57,00:42:59,"They're gorgeous things, yeah."
00:42:59,00:43:00,They are.
00:43:00,00:43:01,"And people used to hang them up, didn't they?"
00:43:01,00:43:04,I like the idea of the art on your wall being something that you'd half made.
00:43:04,00:43:09,So we just say a woodcut was just when they carved into wood and then the manufacturers
00:43:09,00:43:11,rolled ink over the wood.
00:43:11,00:43:15,So all the bits that were carved had no ink in them.
00:43:15,00:43:16,And then you say you had the outline.
00:43:16,00:43:20,"And then yeah, people would paint them home and hang them on the walls to impress visitors."
00:43:20,00:43:25,"Well, why do you look at some of those woodcuts and stuff like that from around that time,"
00:43:25,00:43:28,"which would have been what, 15th or 16th century?"
00:43:28,00:43:30,"Like juror, for instance, things like that."
00:43:30,00:43:33,"You kind of think you look at those if you're in a museum and think, well, why didn't"
00:43:33,00:43:34,people colour those in?
00:43:34,00:43:36,It makes complete sense.
00:43:36,00:43:37,Yeah.
00:43:37,00:43:38,Yeah.
00:43:38,00:43:39,"Well, they did."
00:43:39,00:43:43,"So this was the first explicit colouring book meant for the purpose, but probably inspired"
00:43:43,00:43:46,by the fact that everyone was colouring in their manuscripts all the time.
00:43:46,00:43:49,"So there are lots of manuscripts that exist that people at home would colour in, because"
00:43:49,00:43:51,there was no colour printing.
00:43:51,00:43:55,And so even very limited by that point colour printing.
00:43:55,00:43:57,So people just would do it themselves.
00:43:57,00:43:58,That's so cool.
00:43:58,00:44:01,Do you guys want to know one pleasing irony of colouring in?
00:44:01,00:44:02,"Oh, yes."
00:44:02,00:44:08,"In 1962, in the early '60s, there was a huge great craze for colouring in books massive."
00:44:08,00:44:09,And lots of those were for adults too.
00:44:09,00:44:13,Barbara Streisand released a song in 1962 called My Coloring Book.
00:44:13,00:44:14,Really?
00:44:14,00:44:19,And it was a minor hit for maybe realise how well Barbara Streisand is for one thing.
00:44:19,00:44:22,"But, pleasingly, there is now a Barbara Streisand colouring in book."
00:44:22,00:44:23,"Oh, very nice."
00:44:23,00:44:24,That is good.
00:44:24,00:44:25,Yeah.
00:44:25,00:44:27,"I don't think it's linked to the song, especially, it's just that there are colouring books."
00:44:27,00:44:31,"Well, '60s, that was a huge boom for the colouring in book, wasn't it?"
00:44:31,00:44:34,And particularly as a tool of satire.
00:44:34,00:44:35,So there were a few books.
00:44:35,00:44:40,"JFK Coloring in book, which stayed in the charts for like 14 weeks on the New York Times, Bessell"
00:44:40,00:44:41,was list.
00:44:41,00:44:44,"But they were released not to be coloured in, basically."
00:44:44,00:44:46,They were colouring books that you were meant to leave alone.
00:44:46,00:44:50,Because they were sort of a new version of a great satirical cartoon that would appear
00:44:50,00:44:53,in the newspapers or in the magazine.
00:44:53,00:44:58,So they found that there was no boom in sales of crayons and pencil colour pencils in
00:44:58,00:45:02,the period where there was the boom of all these big colouring books that were released.
00:45:02,00:45:03,Really?
00:45:03,00:45:04,Yeah.
00:45:04,00:45:08,I see humour books where the captions underneath gave you a great gag.
00:45:08,00:45:13,So there was one about being corporate and so you would have to colour in the suit that
00:45:13,00:45:14,"I have to wear, which is grey."
00:45:14,00:45:17,Please colour it in grey or I'll be fired.
00:45:17,00:45:18,"That was the first one, I think."
00:45:18,00:45:21,"So I like the fact that the first modern colouring book was, you were supposed to colour everything"
00:45:21,00:45:22,in grey.
00:45:22,00:45:24,"James, you would have loved it with your little charcoal."
00:45:24,00:45:25,Yeah.
00:45:25,00:45:26,That's a wrong shade.
00:45:26,00:45:27,That was pretty dark.
00:45:27,00:45:28,"That one, wasn't it?"
00:45:28,00:45:30,"It was like, this is my train."
00:45:30,00:45:32,It takes me to the office every day.
00:45:32,00:45:36,"You meet lots of interesting people on the train, colour them all grey."
00:45:36,00:45:37,Yeah.
00:45:37,00:45:41,"And then the only bit where you had to put any colour in, it was like, this is my pill."
00:45:41,00:45:42,It is round.
00:45:42,00:45:43,It is pink.
00:45:43,00:45:44,It makes me not care.
00:45:44,00:45:45,Yeah.
00:45:45,00:45:46,That's pretty dark.
00:45:46,00:45:47,It is really dark.
00:45:47,00:45:51,It's called the executive colouring book if anyone wants to check it out.
00:45:51,00:45:53,"Did you see the conspiracy theory one, Den?"
00:45:53,00:45:54,I thought this would be…
00:45:54,00:45:55,"I did, I loved it."
00:45:55,00:45:56,Yeah.
00:45:56,00:45:57,It's so good.
00:45:57,00:46:01,"It has a blank page and it says, how many communists can you find in this picture?"
00:46:01,00:46:02,I can find eleven.
00:46:02,00:46:03,Amazing.
00:46:03,00:46:09,"There was a modern colouring book, craze, which a lot of listeners will probably remember,"
00:46:09,00:46:10,which was about three years ago.
00:46:10,00:46:14,"I've almost all the listeners, I will say, Andy, unless you've got some very young ones."
00:46:14,00:46:17,Some of our older listeners might remember that.
00:46:17,00:46:25,"I mean, you might not have been paying attention to the colouring in trend, oh my word."
00:46:25,00:46:30,"Yeah, but there was obviously a huge rash of new books published and I found an article"
00:46:30,00:46:32,"from the Scottish Library website, the Scottish National Library."
00:46:32,00:46:37,"It has an article in 2016, headlined, yes, we have colouring books in our library, but sorry,"
00:46:37,00:46:41,you can't colour them in and this is just clarifying what you couldn't do in this kind of
00:46:41,00:46:42,library.
00:46:42,00:46:43,"That's really interesting though, isn't it?"
00:46:43,00:46:47,"If you go to the library and you get a colouring book, surely you should be like, what's"
00:46:47,00:46:50,the point of getting that out if you can't colour it in?
00:46:50,00:46:51,"That's weird, isn't it?"
00:46:51,00:46:52,"Wow, quite."
00:46:52,00:46:55,"Well, it said it also went on to clarify, you can come and look at the magic eye books"
00:46:55,00:46:59,"and squint at them and see the pictures hidden in the pages, but you can look at it,"
00:46:59,00:47:01,not solve our pseudo-coup books.
00:47:01,00:47:02,"Ah, yes."
00:47:02,00:47:06,"What you could do is colour them in and then tipx out your colouring afterwards, and then"
00:47:06,00:47:09,the next person could colour out your tipx.
00:47:09,00:47:13,"Well, I sometimes think it's fun to try and do a crossword."
00:47:13,00:47:17,"If you don't have a pen on you, you can just do the crossword in your head and, you know,"
00:47:17,00:47:20,that's a fun way of spending time and time.
00:47:20,00:47:23,"Yeah, so you could do your colouring book in your head."
00:47:23,00:47:27,"Went out the lines again, oh, fuck."
00:47:27,00:47:31,"Did the website also say, ""Can the guy who keeps pressing plants into our books, please"
00:47:31,00:47:35,"refrain from that in the future?"""
00:47:35,00:47:36,Do we think they're good or bad?
00:47:36,00:47:39,"There's some controversy about whether you should even give colouring books to children,"
00:47:39,00:47:42,because maybe it's huge controversy.
00:47:42,00:47:43,Is that?
00:47:43,00:47:45,Because it might make them violence or something.
00:47:45,00:47:46,"Oh, wow."
00:47:46,00:47:50,"James, I know you had a very dark upbringing, but some of us put colours in our colouring."
00:47:50,00:47:54,"I was just thinking, like, usually when there's a moral panic about not giving things"
00:47:54,00:47:57,"to children, it's because it's going to turn them to drugs or violence."
00:47:57,00:48:02,The call of duty colouring book might prompt children to violence or whatever.
00:48:02,00:48:03,It's a really good point.
00:48:03,00:48:06,"I don't think this is something that's been considered yet, but this was first raised"
00:48:06,00:48:12,"in the 1950s by the sort of leader in our education guy called Victor Lovenfeld, and he said"
00:48:12,00:48:17,"colouring books have a devastating effect on children, and it's because they don't let"
00:48:17,00:48:18,them develop their own ideas.
00:48:18,00:48:23,"So the idea is that you've given them a picture, and they just have to stick within the confines"
00:48:23,00:48:28,"of that picture, and he was saying not only do they not inspire children to be imaginative,"
00:48:28,00:48:32,"but also they kind of make them have really low self confidence, because children look"
00:48:32,00:48:35,"at these really good pictures in the colouring book, and they think, well, I'm never going"
00:48:35,00:48:36,to draw as well as that.
00:48:36,00:48:39,"I've just tried to draw sunshine, and it ended up as square."
00:48:39,00:48:43,And so they're not even going to attempt to draw themselves.
00:48:43,00:48:46,And there is quite a lot of back and forth thinking about whether it's bad for children's
00:48:46,00:48:47,imaginations.
00:48:47,00:48:49,"And then they start getting violence, I guess, after that."
00:48:49,00:48:51,"And then they put a punch in the face, yeah."
00:48:51,00:48:52,That's really interesting.
00:48:52,00:48:57,"You know, these colouring books were, it's colour by numbers, so it might be, when you look"
00:48:57,00:49:01,"at it, sometimes you might look at it, you might not see what the image is until you colour"
00:49:01,00:49:04,"it in, and then you realise what it is."
00:49:04,00:49:08,"There was one of those in the Netherlands, and it turned out that, when you coloured it"
00:49:08,00:49:13,"in, it was actually Adolf Hitler, and the problem was that they had, they'd bought these"
00:49:13,00:49:17,"colouring books, but they'd never coloured them in to see what the images were, and it"
00:49:17,00:49:20,was only when people took them home and coloured them in that they realised that it was
00:49:20,00:49:26,"bad, and they said they deeply regretted the incident, and it remains unclear why Hitler"
00:49:26,00:49:28,was included in the colouring books.
00:49:28,00:49:32,"And the guy said his suspicion is that the man who created it, because it was someone"
00:49:32,00:49:36,"in India who'd created this book, they just didn't know who Hitler was and they'd taken him"
00:49:36,00:49:40,"out of, you know, just a book of historical figures."
00:49:40,00:49:44,"Well, they just took the time man of the year for 1938."
00:49:44,00:49:45,Yeah.
00:49:45,00:49:53,"While we're on paint by numbers, this is very similar to colouring in obviously."
00:49:53,00:49:59,"So Dan, we know who invented them, again, because it's relatively recently, it was invented,"
00:49:59,00:50:03,"but it was a guy called Dan Robbins, who only died last year, actually."
00:50:03,00:50:08,"It was in 1951, and he was working at a paint company, and he was given the task of selling"
00:50:08,00:50:14,"more paint, and he came up with this method to sell small quantities of paint, but it was"
00:50:14,00:50:16,"popular, obviously, he'd sell a lot."
00:50:16,00:50:22,"And there's an online museum of paint by numbers, which has 60,000 of them, and it says that"
00:50:22,00:50:25,he is the most exhibited artist in the world.
00:50:25,00:50:30,"His work, you know, he does all the drawings, it has been displayed on more walls than any"
00:50:30,00:50:31,other artist.
00:50:31,00:50:33,Which is quite a pleasing idea.
00:50:33,00:50:37,"It's a loose definition of the word artist, isn't it?"
00:50:37,00:50:41,"He always said this is not, when you're doing a paint by numbers, it's not art per se,"
00:50:41,00:50:46,"but you are getting the same sensation as people have when they are creating art, and that's"
00:50:46,00:50:48,a kind of gateway in some ways.
00:50:48,00:50:50,So he was always very modest about what it was.
00:50:50,00:50:56,"So was the idea that, like, if they had a lot of orange paint to sell, for instance, they"
00:50:56,00:51:01,"might do a load of paint by numbers with umpillempers in them, or something, they would sell oranges."
00:51:01,00:51:02,Yeah.
00:51:02,00:51:03,Or oranges.
00:51:03,00:51:04,Yeah.
00:51:04,00:51:05,I knew there was something famous.
00:51:05,00:51:09,"There was orange in colour, but I just can't think of it."
00:51:09,00:51:12,Wasn't I almost went for blackpool football kits?
00:51:12,00:51:13,"Oh, wow."
00:51:13,00:51:14,That would have been niche.
00:51:14,00:51:15,It's too niche.
00:51:15,00:51:20,"If they had a lot of black paint to sell, they specifically marketed it to the heart."
00:51:20,00:51:24,"He was claimed that he was inspired by Leonardo da Vinci, so in his autobiography, he wrote"
00:51:24,00:51:28,that he'd once heard Leonardo da Vinci would hand out numbered patterns to his apprentices
00:51:28,00:51:31,"in his workshops, and then the apprentices could fill in the colours."
00:51:31,00:51:36,And I must have wasted about six hours yesterday trying to find any original evidence
00:51:36,00:51:40,"that Leonardo da Vinci, all Michelangelo, which was also sometimes claimed, did this, and"
00:51:40,00:51:41,I can't.
00:51:41,00:51:45,"So I'm begging you, any art historians out there, if you've got evidence of this, please"
00:51:45,00:51:46,write it in.
00:51:46,00:51:49,"But there used to be hung on people's walls, which I find odd."
00:51:49,00:51:52,"When I did paint by numbers, it wasn't the sort of thing my mum would then frame put"
00:51:52,00:51:53,on the wall.
00:51:53,00:51:54,But people would hang on.
00:51:54,00:51:55,There wasn't the fifties.
00:51:55,00:51:56,What were you doing?
00:51:56,00:52:00,The President Eisenhower had them hung up in the corridor in the wild.
00:52:00,00:52:01,"Oh, really?"
00:52:01,00:52:02,That's so cool.
00:52:02,00:52:05,"Look, if Donald Trump could do it without going out of the lines, he would do exactly"
00:52:05,00:52:07,the same thing.
00:52:07,00:52:13,"Okay, that's it."
00:52:13,00:52:14,That is all of our facts.
00:52:14,00:52:15,Thank you so much for listening.

00:52:34,00:52:38,"All of our previous episodes are there, links to merchandise are there as well."
00:52:38,00:52:42,"And yeah, guys, still hope you're safe, still hope you're doing okay."

00:52:45,00:52:49,"Until then, we'll be back again next week with another episode, and we'll see you then."
00:52:49,00:52:56,Goodbye.
00:52:56,00:53:01,I've wasted a full cycling trip's worth of Vaseline here.
00:53:01,00:53:02,What do you do?
00:53:02,00:53:03,You're cycling.
00:53:03,00:53:06,"Oh, Anna, you will be able to find that if you look it up online."
00:53:06,00:53:07,Yeah.
00:53:07,00:53:08,Okay.
00:53:08,00:53:11,"It's certainly not going inside your pants, put it that way."
00:53:11,00:53:12,"No, hang on."
00:53:12,00:53:13,No.
00:53:13,00:53:16,It's certainly not going outside your pants.
00:53:16,00:53:17,Yeah.
