00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:20,060
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,680
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,440
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anna Tuginski, James Harkin, and Andrew

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,480
 Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,920
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,800
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact, my fact this week is that early proposals

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,760
 for raising the Titanic back to the ocean's surface included filling it up with ping pong

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:56,360
 balls, injecting 180,000 tons of Vaseline into it, and turning the ship itself into an ice

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,360
 rig.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,880
 What if another ship came along and then hit the Titanic?

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,360
 It'd be a great reveal if you did hit an iceberg and it cracked open and so it was the

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,360
 actual Titanic inside.

14
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,360
 Exactly.

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,960
 I mean, who's got enough ping pong balls to do the first one of these things?

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,200
 That is a large number of ping pong balls.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,840
 Are these all entirely serious suggestions, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,320
 Yeah, well to an extent they are, you know, they're not necessarily practical, but in

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,040
 most of the cases, we've seen that some of these methods work.

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,200
 So for example, the ping pong ball idea, that was actually used, not actual ping pong balls,

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,920
 but the premise of putting ping pong balls into a ship was used by a Danish engineer called

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,360
 Karl Kroyer, and back in 1964 there was a crash of a ship in the harbor in Kuwait city,

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,600
 and the ship went down 6,000 sheep were on it, and so they were going to block the ocean,

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,600
 and the problem is that the harbor is where they pump drinking water from for the city.

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,720
 So they needed to get the sheep out as quick as possible, and they needed to get the ship

26
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
 up in one piece.

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,160
 So this guy, Karl Kroyer, had the idea of filling it with ping pong balls and idea which

28
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:13,200
 he got from an old Disney comic strip of Donald Duck and how he salvaged the ship by pumping

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,920
 it full of ping pong balls and it raising, and he developed these sort of new ping pong

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,320
 balls that were sort of a lot smaller sort of pearl size, and they did it.

31
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,080
 They successfully raised the ship.

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,560
 That's not a ping pong ball.

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,400
 If it's size, if it's that small, it's not a ping pong ball anymore, because I'd love

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,840
 to see you try and play ping pong with one of those.

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,120
 But no, so, but this guy raised a bunch of ships using this method, and he tried to patent

36
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,320
 it, but the patent was rejected because they said the idea comes from Donald Duck.

37
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,880
 He's the original holder of this idea, yeah, because it was in a cartoon, so they refused

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
 him the patent.

39
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,160
 Flash forward to modern times, the Mythbusters TV show successfully raised a ship using ping

40
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
 pong balls.

41
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,360
 The ship was called the myth-tannic, too, and they pumped 27,000 ping pong balls into it,

42
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,280
 and it brought the boat back to the surface, so they claim it's plausible.

43
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,560
 It's not a busted idea that Donald Duck could raise a ship with ping pong balls.

44
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,960
 So we're saying that the Titanic thing is feasible, is that what you're saying?

45
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,240
 Not really, because when you get that low, the ping pong balls would be crushed, they'd

46
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,760
 be decimated before they even got to the bottom.

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,800
 Oh, yeah, because of the pressure.

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,040
 Exactly, so that's where it's not practical.

49
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,640
 However, the idea of lifting a ship is practical.

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
 Cool.

51
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
 What's with the ping pong balls?

52
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,920
 Is it just that their flotation device is, so it's like having a really weird looking

53
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
 life jacket.

54
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
 Yeah, exactly.

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
 That's exactly it.

56
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
 Yeah, they flot it.

57
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,600
 That's why you never see ping pong players being lost at sea, just doesn't happen, because

58
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
 they always keep a few in the pocket just in case they're angry.

59
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,080
 And you can use the bat as an all once you get to the surface and get yourself to safety.

60
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,400
 There was a proposal to use dynamite to get the ship back up.

61
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,360
 Well, there was a proposal to blow it up with dynamite five days after it sank.

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,120
 Was that an idea that was come up with by Wiley Coyote?

63
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,280
 Yes, because Donald Duck is coming up with ideas.

64
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,680
 So, this was genuinely five days after it sank, still April 1912, Vincent Astor, who was

65
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,600
 the son of John Jacob Astor, the richest man on board the Titanic.

66
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,520
 His father had been lost on the Titanic, and he said, "We should just drop a powerful

67
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,600
 explosive to recover the bodies to dislodge the bodies from the ship."

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,760
 Number of problems with this, firstly, knowing you exactly where the ship was, it turns

69
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,000
 out that it's in two pieces, 600 metres apart.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,680
 And he was only deterred from this project when people said that the extreme pressure would

71
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,440
 have compressed all the passengers on board so they were jelly.

72
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,520
 So you wouldn't get the bodies of your loved ones back, you would just get a kind of jelly.

73
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,360
 That actually turns out to be wrong, but...

74
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
 Oh, really?

75
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,080
 The people did not turn into jelly, right?

76
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,200
 Well, I think that the water down there is really low in calcium, and so your bones kind

77
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
 of dissolve.

78
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
 I think I read that.

79
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
 Oh, right.

80
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
 Okay.

81
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
 I think.

82
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,320
 So let's look at some of the other ideas that they had done.

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,680
 This thing about Vaseline, I looked at the website that you sent, which had all of these

84
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
 ideas on.

85
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,920
 And on the website, it says, "There is no proof that Vaseline can float."

86
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
 Yes.

87
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,240
 And the practical suggestion from this.

88
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,600
 There must be some evidence about whether Vaseline floats or not.

89
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,800
 That's what I thought, right?

90
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,520
 It must be because it's not beyond the realms of man to check, right?

91
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,080
 I don't have any Vaseline in my house, and I can't leave the house to buy some, so I don't

92
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,240
 have any evidence, and I googled it.

93
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,520
 And if you search, does Vaseline float or Vaseline doesn't float or Vaseline floats?

94
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,000
 There doesn't seem to be any answers on Google.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,240
 So I actually still don't know whether Vaseline floats or not.

96
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,720
 I've got a tub of Vaseline in my home.

97
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
 Let's do it.

98
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
 Oh, it's another experiment.

99
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
 Oh, experiment time.

100
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
 You'll take a slither bathroom.

101
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
 Shall I go and get it?

102
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
 Yeah.

103
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
 Yeah.

104
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
 Let's see.

105
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
 Hang on, hang on, hang on.

106
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
 We've become blue-peaser.

107
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
 Okay.

108
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
 Okay.

109
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,320
 And these back with some Vaseline.

110
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
 I'm back.

111
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
 Yep.

112
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,920
 If you got some water to go with that Vaseline.

113
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
 I've got some water.

114
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,160
 I'm just putting it, this is the stuff that MythBusters rejected, being not quite good

115
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
 enough to make the grade.

116
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
 Okay.

117
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160
 So can you see this?

118
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
 So I've got it.

119
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,640
 I've got a little measuring jug of water.

120
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,320
 Like a Parachute jug.

121
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,560
 I'm just going to try the whole tub of Vaseline.

122
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
 All right.

123
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,840
 The whole tub floats, but it's mostly air.

124
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,160
 So that proves nothing.

125
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,120
 But what you could do is get up maybe 100,000 of them and treat them like ping pong balls.

126
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
 Okay.

127
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
 Okay.

128
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,720
 I'm just going to scoop out a little knob of Vaseline.

129
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
 Okay.

130
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,560
 I'm dropping it in three, two, one.

131
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
 It floats.

132
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
 It floats.

133
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
 There we go.

134
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
 That's one of life's great mysteries.

135
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
 I'm looking.

136
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,760
 You're trying to make it not float and it keeps floating.

137
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
 Yeah.

138
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,760
 So your finger, your finger's the Titanic.

139
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
 Look.

140
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
 You're airborne.

141
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
 Look how good it is.

142
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,200
 What an underwhelming spot.

143
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,480
 We should mostly stick to just talking about facts.

144
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,680
 I'm thinking just based on the last couple of episodes, that's experimenting.

145
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
 So what about the iceberg?

146
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,800
 Who's the idea was that?

147
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
 The iceberg.

148
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,040
 Um, this first cropped up as far as I can tell in a 1977 issue of new scientist and it

149
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:23,880
 was a man called Arthur Hickey, an unemployed haulage contractor from Warsaw who claims to

150
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,360
 be the officially appointed salvage master of the Titanic salvage company.

151
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
 He claims.

152
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,000
 So it's not verified in the article, whether that's true or not.

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,480
 That's interesting though, that you said that he's unemployed, but also a haulage contractor

154
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,040
 and also the head of this Titanic raising thing, he sounds like the least unemployed person

155
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
 I've ever heard.

156
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
 You're right.

157
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
 This guy's too much work.

158
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
 Yeah.

159
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
 Um, so, uh, yeah.

160
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,400
 So he approached, um, and this is according to, uh, the new scientist says, according to a

161
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,800
 recent issue of the B.O.C. group newspapers, which is the British oxygen company.

162
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,760
 He approached them off the back of a, a vivid dream that he had about turning the ship into

163
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,720
 an iceberg, um, and allowing it to float to the surface.

164
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,120
 And I, I tried to find more about it. I think the idea is that they'd have to pump like half

165
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,760
 a million tons of liquid nitrogen down to it in order to do it.

166
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,480
 And I think the idea was there was going to be a mesh, a wire mesh that they would create

167
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:24,040
 around the Titanic for that to then be the, the basis for the block of which it would stop.

168
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,840
 And then that would slowly bring it back up to the surface.

169
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,080
 It is quite effectively dubious to get any of the Titanic back, isn't it?

170
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,160
 I think a lot of the survivors were really anti-it, um, when they were still alive and a lot

171
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,760
 of the families of the survivors now are saying, look, you know, people died and they ended

172
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
 up at the bottom of the sea.

173
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,560
 And probably it's not a good idea to, you know, to start the rest, yeah, yeah, exactly.

174
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
 Yeah.

175
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
 Yeah.

176
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
 Yeah.

177
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
 Yeah.

178
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
 It's, it's of mass grave sites, isn't it?

179
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
 Yeah.

180
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,760
 But it can be extremely useful dredging up ships, uh, because it might tell us the origin

181
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,000
 of the universe. So some concepts are a really, really crucial source of a certain, of what's

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,600
 called low background metals and low background metals are totally essential for experiments

183
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,280
 like looking for dark matter.

184
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,280
 So looking for like all this dark matter in the universe that we don't know where it is

185
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,000
 or looking for anti-matter.

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,560
 They're also really important for making guide encounters, for instance, because they don't

187
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,520
 emit any radiation at all.

188
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,440
 They don't emit any particles.

189
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,280
 And the reason is, this is why they're called low background metals, that they're on ships

190
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,560
 that were built before the nuclear testing that started in the 1940s.

191
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,640
 And so all metal that's been manufactured, taken out of the earth and made into something

192
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,960
 useful, since then has had radioactivity in it, just like we all do because of all that

193
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,160
 nuclear testing that left the world very radioactive.

194
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,960
 So all these ships built before, non-radioactive.

195
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,440
 And then they were sunk to the bottom of the sea so they're totally protected from the radio

196
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,480
activity. And they're the only place that you can find these low background lead and steel,

197
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,480
 which experiments need.

198
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,720
 So for instance, when they're dressing up, there's always this debate between archaeologists

199
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,280
 who are like, we want this from our museum, please.

200
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,560
 And the scientists who are like, but we want to melt it all down for our experiments, please.

201
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,320
 And then the gravesite people who say, please leave it there.

202
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
 Isn't that cool?

203
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
 That is really amazing.

204
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,320
 It's very cool.

205
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,080
 I've got an ethical dilemma for you, Titanic related.

206
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,360
 Do you get married on the Titanic?

207
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,760
 Are we talking about now?

208
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,320
 Because that's quite a wet wedding.

209
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
 Yeah.

210
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,760
 Two people have genuinely got married on the Titanic, since it sank.

211
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
 That's impossible.

212
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,080
 So they dived down in a diving bell or something.

213
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,040
 They dived down in a submersible, they're called David Lieberwitz and Kimberley Miller.

214
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,000
 And they won a trip to the Titanic, but I think they only won one ticket and they were told

215
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,400
 by the guys organizing it.

216
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,360
 We'll let the other one if you come along, but only if you agree to get married.

217
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,680
 Well, because they were a couple.

218
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,880
 And it was a way of raising publicity for this thing, this trip.

219
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,160
 And they had to wear flame retardant suits and they had to crouch down on their knees for

220
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,400
 the ceremony because the submersible they were in was so tiny, but they were actually on

221
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,560
 the bow of the ship, where the famous scene is in the movie, "I'm the King of the World",

222
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
 all of this.

223
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,440
 And anyway, raised a lot of controversy, as you can probably imagine, and the reports

224
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
 were really good.

225
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,800
 Apparently, the couple rejected the assertion that their marriage was typically American and

226
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,280
 the height of bad taste.

227
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,760
 And the guy organizing it said, "What's got to be remembered is that every time a couple

228
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,280
 gets married in a church, they have to walk through a graveyard to get to the altar."

229
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,680
 That's such a good point.

230
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,280
 Well, it's a point.

231
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
 It's a point.

232
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
 It's incredible.

233
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
 Good on them.

234
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
 Yeah.

235
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,520
 Imagine how claustrophobic that would be.

236
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,800
 I think that's the least enjoyable wedding I can imagine.

237
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,640
 I think so, also, like if one of them changes their mind just before it happens, they've

238
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,400
 got a very long trip back up to the surface in a very small, yeah.

239
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:56,120
 One person who is seen as the person who survived the longest in the ocean and then was rescued

240
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,880
 and survived was a guy called Charles Yoffin.

241
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,320
 He was the chief baker on board the Titanic, and when he plunged into the ocean, he was

242
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,960
 seen plunging with two bottles of whiskey on him, which he downed while he was in there,

243
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,560
 and he survived for two hours.

244
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,800
 Most people perished after 15 minutes, but he survived two hours.

245
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,160
 He had the two bottles of whiskey and the alcohol somehow, they claimed, helped him to keep

246
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,480
 his body temperature going.

247
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,040
 He was also on a rough made out of baguettes though, wasn't he?

248
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,040
 Which didn't help.

249
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,160
 Sure, you would make your odds out of baguettes rather than your raft.

250
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,880
 I guess the baguette is a multi-purpose tool, you can lash a hundred together and then

251
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,880
 use two more.

252
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,480
 He was a complete legend, so the interview to him after the Titanic sunk, and it sounds

253
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,720
 like he was just chilled the whole way through, and he wasn't just downing whiskey.

254
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,480
 He did try and save lots of people first, so he made sure the lifeboats were all stocked

255
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,240
 with all his baked goods aside from the stuff he used to make the raft, and he threw lots

256
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,200
 of deck chairs overboard to make makeshift kind of rafts for people, so they could grab

257
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
 onto.

258
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,040
 And then he said he just went back to his bed, downed whiskey, watched the water come under

259
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,640
 the door, pretty calmly, just kind of chilled, and then eventually he knew that it was best

260
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,240
 to stay on the ship, much like Jack in Titanic.

261
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,280
 Stay on the ship until the very last second, because you want to minimise your time in the

262
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
 water.

263
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,880
 Went in the water, usually if you're hammered, which he was, that would be really awful for

264
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,600
 you, because all your vessels of phasodilated and you lose all the heat superfast.

265
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,920
 But they think, because he was so relaxed, because of this whiskey and his general personality,

266
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,600
 it overrode the shock, I think it's the shock that kills lots of people, and the trauma

267
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,840
 often is what kills you.

268
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:44,080
 Imagine being that chilled as a humid, that even at the Titanic crash and sinking, you're

269
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,680
 still like, it's alright, I believe you can move the deck chairs around.

270
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,080
 I mean, we always hear about rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, and in the first

271
00:13:53,080 --> 00:14:01,880
 7th attempt, I've never heard of what actually happened to the deck chairs.

272
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,800
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

273
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,240
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1927, an owl was found that had another owl in its stomach,

274
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,000
 and that owl had a third owl in its stomach.

275
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,520
 This is incredible.

276
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,040
 I guess you could say they were cannibals.

277
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,360
 You said you could say that.

278
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,760
 Honestly, I've been waiting to say that since you sent this fact around to all of us to research,

279
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,360
 and it was underwhelming as a moment for me.

280
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,440
 It was up there with the floating Vaseline for all of us in underwhelming states.

281
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
 This is amazing.

282
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,960
 Yeah, this is what is called an inter-specific owl trophic chain, which basically means

283
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,600
 an owl eats an owl, which eats another owl.

284
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:57,660
 It's pretty much the only version of it I could find in owls at least, and it was a bad

285
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,660
 owl.

286
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,960
 It was shot in New England, and when they opened it up, it had a long eared owl inside

287
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,960
 it, and when they opened that up, it had an eastern screech owl inside it.

288
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,840
 What we can say about it is that owls, they do eat other birds, and they eat other owls.

289
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:18,200
 We can learn about what they eat by looking in the stomachs, but it also shows the second

290
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,300
 owl must have eaten the third owl quite quickly before it was eaten itself, if you know

291
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,300
 what I mean.

292
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,300
 It wasn't even remnants.

293
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,700
 It was almost Russian dolls.

294
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,300
 It was almost Russian dolls.

295
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,660
 It wasn't full because obviously you have to chew your owls before you can't eat a whole

296
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,660
 owl.

297
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,920
 I forgot that you don't just down an owl for real.

298
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,680
 Yeah, but also, the Russian dolls would be incredibly distressing if you open them up,

299
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,360
 and they were just the minstrel maids of another Russian doll inside that, and then inside

300
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,480
 that, they were more bloodied remnants.

301
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,340
 There would be more realistic though, I'm this.

302
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,480
 It would be absolutely great.

303
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
 Yeah.

304
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
 And yeah, owls, they eat other owls.

305
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
 They eat lots of stuff.

306
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
 They're amazing.

307
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
 Well.

308
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
 So this is the only example of this.

309
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
 What's it called, owl trophic?

310
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
 Something rather?

311
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
 Well, owl owl action.

312
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,480
 I call it owl ow action.

313
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,320
 I call it inter-specific owl trophic chain, but you can call it kind of bowelism if

314
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
 you want.

315
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,920
 I'm going to go kind of bowelism because I think scientists need to wait for more than

316
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,920
 one instance of something before they come up with an unnecessarily long and complicated

317
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
 name for it.

318
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,080
 I think Andy might well have coined a new scientific term here.

319
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
 This is exciting.

320
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
 This is exciting.

321
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
 A scientific term.

322
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
 Very quickly.

323
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,880
 This is like the only example of an animal eating an animal eating an animal of the same

324
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
 species.

325
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,840
 The closest I could think of was something we covered in one of the book of the years,

326
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:41,280
 which was when a shark was eaten by a shark that was caught by the shark, Greg Norman.

327
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,480
 I forgot about that.

328
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,040
 He's a golfer whose nickname is the shark.

329
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
 Yeah.

330
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
 He was fishing.

331
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
 Otherwise, we're just saying the shark whose name is Greg Norman.

332
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,040
 No, he doesn't make any sense.

333
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
 I do call Greg Norman.

334
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,040
 If you have a pet shark, you're very unlikely to name it Greg Norman, are you?

335
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
 No, I'm not.

336
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,280
 You're going to call it snappy or stop it.

337
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,560
 But yeah, Greg Norman, the golfer was fishing and he caught a shark and then that shark

338
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,360
 started eating another shark, so it was a three shark.

339
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,240
 We have a couple of examples in the fossil record of animals eating other animals that have

340
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,760
 just eaten other animals, so for instance, they found a fish, which was eaten by an amphibian,

341
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,320
 which was then eaten by a shark, and that was found in southwestern Germany, and then

342
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,920
 we also found a snake, which was eaten by a lizard, which was just eaten a beetle.

343
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,840
 And weirdly, so these are the only two versions I could find in the whole fossil record, and

344
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,320
 that was also found in Germany, so it seems there was something about German animals

345
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
 in the Lake Cretaceous.

346
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,320
 Don't want to get racist about it, but it seemed like they were up for this kind of thing.

347
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,160
 I'm not counting the beetle.

348
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
 No.

349
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
 I just, a beetle.

350
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
 What the hell is that?

351
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,000
 That doesn't count as an impressive matrioshka.

352
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,400
 That's if you get to the end of your matrioshka and there's a grain of rice at the bottom

353
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,680
 of something and you're supposed to count that.

354
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,880
 You need something that's effectively the same size as the thing that's eaten it to

355
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
 be impressive.

356
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
 Okay.

357
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
 You're right, sure.

358
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,720
 So the owl is the opposite of a duck, I think.

359
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
 That's right.

360
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
 Yeah.

361
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,040
 And owl is the opposite of a duck.

362
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,120
 I think you're going to have to give us a bit more.

363
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,320
 My question still holds.

364
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,920
 So what is a duck famous for?

365
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
 Cracking.

366
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
 Cracking, yeah.

367
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,920
 Okay.

368
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
 And owls don't crack, of course.

369
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:30,400
 No, like it's famous for having like feathers which kind of repel water, right?

370
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,800
 Water off a duck's back.

371
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,120
 And so I can live in the water, and whenever any, whenever it rains on them or whenever

372
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,600
 any water gets on them, it just goes straight off them.

373
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,480
 But owls are one of the few birds that don't have this at all.

374
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,320
 And they have got rid of any ability to repel water from their feathers.

375
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,760
 And so if they get wet, it's an absolute nightmare.

376
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,400
 If they go into the water to try and catch a fish or something like that, they can't even

377
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,320
 jump out and fly away because the feathers, it's like a sheep trying to fly away.

378
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,600
 The feathers are just so full of water they can't get out.

379
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,640
 And so they'll end up swimming instead of flying.

380
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
 That's how it flies there.

381
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,600
 But the reason is that if they had oil on their feathers, they would make more noise when

382
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,800
 they flew around and they want to be as stealthy as possible so they can catch their prey.

383
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,000
 And so they've done away with the ability for water to flow off them in order to be more

384
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,520
 stealthy, which I think is really cool.

385
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
 That is amazing.

386
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,680
 They are the opposite of ducks.

387
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
 Point proven.

388
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,160
 Presumably if it starts raining at night when an owl's hunting, you do hear the sound

389
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:37,040
 of owls just dropping out of the air and onto the ground.

390
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,400
 You can't hear owls, basically, until they are about three feet from your head, by which

391
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,720
 point it is too late, because they're so silent.

392
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,240
 And so we don't really, we've got some idea about why they're so quiet.

393
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,680
 But I think the full mechanism has yet to be properly explained.

394
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,960
 There was a review last year about just why they are so quiet.

395
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,640
 Yeah, they've looked at their feathers haven't they, and they've found that they've got

396
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,320
 like little wrinkly bits on the side, which means that when air comes, it kind of forms

397
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,160
 tiny little vortices, which make less noise than if there was a load of turbulence.

398
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
 Wow.

399
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,960
 Is that unique in the world of birds?

400
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,160
 I haven't checked them all.

401
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
 I think it is.

402
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,560
 I think, I mean, there are about 200 species of owl, and some of them are really loud.

403
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,840
 The largest owl in the world is the, I think it's called the Blackest and Fish Owl.

404
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,200
 And that, because it's hunting fish, fish can't hear anything that you're doing above

405
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,480
 the water, and they don't care.

406
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,920
 So those owls are incredibly loud, because they're not trying to listen for mice.

407
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,680
 But most owls are unbelievably quiet, and they're really slow as well.

408
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
 This is a thing.

409
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,960
 I think, apart from birds that can actively hover, owls might be the slowest birds in the

410
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
 world.

411
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,320
 They can fly as slowly as two miles an hour.

412
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,560
 So you could easily outrun an owl?

413
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,480
 No, that's not what I'm saying.

414
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,840
 I'm not saying that top speed is too much of an owl.

415
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,680
 So when they come at you and they're only three feet away, it's fine, because you have plenty

416
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
 of time to react.

417
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,200
 You just walk over to the other side of the garden.

418
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,480
 It's strong away.

419
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,960
 Did you know the owls were responsible for the second world war?

420
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
 God.

421
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,480
 This is from the book Owl.

422
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,840
 It's a book all about owls by Desmer Morris.

423
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,240
 And there was a mythical bird called the Chick Chani owl.

424
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
 I think it was Caribbean.

425
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,360
 It was on Andros Island, that's where it was.

426
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,920
 And it looked like an owl, and it was based on a real owl, which had gone extinct a few

427
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
 hundred years before.

428
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:32,320
 Anyway, as a young man, Neville Chamberlain was shopping down trees on Andros Island.

429
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,920
 And he came across a Chick Chani nest, a nest of this, I must say, mythical bird.

430
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,640
 This is all in the book, Owl.

431
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,200
 His work was refused to touch the nest, but he ignored them, and he chopped down the tree

432
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
 himself.

433
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,080
 And this created a curse on him.

434
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:54,480
 Then, some years later, he became the British Prime Minister, and failed to stop Hitler's

435
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,480
 aggressive expansion.

436
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,200
 And that's supposedly why his failure at the Munich conference happened.

437
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
 Why is Andy like?

438
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,840
 To say this kind of shit, I'm not having enough.

439
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,120
 I think he's not.

440
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,600
 I mean, who's supposing that?

441
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,840
 Is it Desmer Morris, the author of the book, Owl, who I must say has a vested interest

442
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,800
 in giving Owls a stronger role in history?

443
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,000
 Is it Desmer Morris who's supposed that this curse happened?

444
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,480
 I don't think he created this story.

445
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,960
 I think the story is probably one that's quite local to the region, and quite historically

446
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
 specific.

447
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,840
 I'm not saying it was the only factor in the second one, but I don't think we can discount

448
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
 it.

449
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
 That's a good point.

450
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,600
 Hey, I was looking into people who've had Owls for pets, because I know that some people

451
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,080
 do keep Owls, but I wondered if that was ever a fashion.

452
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,480
 I didn't find many people, but one person who did have an Owl for a pet was Florence

453
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,720
 Nightingale.

454
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
 Florence Nightingale.

455
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:48,400
 She had an Owl that she got from Athens, which was called Athena, and when she left Athens,

456
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,240
 she took with her not only the Owl, but she had a secada called Plato, and two tortoises,

457
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,560
 Mr and Mrs Hill, unfortunately.

458
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:00,400
 They must have felt like such intellectual inferiorism at the dinner table with Athena

459
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
 of Plato.

460
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,320
 Well, Mr and Mrs Hill, were they married or were they brother-assister?

461
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
 Oh, not specific.

462
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
 Fine.

463
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
 Very good people.

464
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,880
 Well, they could have been unrelated hills, I guess.

465
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,600
 And then Mrs Hill got married to another hill, I guess, tortoises, but they're still

466
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,800
 hung out with their brother.

467
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
 Yeah.

468
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,960
 And then she presumably split Mrs Hill up from her husband, the other Mr Hill, in order

469
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
 to adopt them as pets.

470
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
 Exactly.

471
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,520
 Not all the evidence points towards the spouses, doesn't it?

472
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
 It does.

473
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
 It does.

474
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,760
 Unfortunately, the animals became, so there were four of them.

475
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:40,320
 They became three when, unfortunately, Athena ate Plato, secada.

476
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,280
 So but she saw that as two pets merging into one, which was more convenient because she carried

477
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,880
 the owl around with her a lot when she went on walks and so on.

478
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
 Wow.

479
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,240
 I wonder how many parents have ever tried that excuse on their children when the dog is just

480
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
 eating the cat?

481
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
 No, it's all right.

482
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,480
 You've got both of them now.

483
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,360
 So Athena, unfortunately, Florence Nightingale, known as someone who nursed a lot of people

484
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,320
 in the Crimean War, Athena is actually a casualty of the Crimean War because when Florence

485
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,120
 went to the Crimean War, she left Athena in her house in the attic with some food and assuming

486
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,600
 that she would survive on any mice that would be running around.

487
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,000
 And she abandoned that house and they eventually went back and they found Athena dead inside

488
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,560
 the attic, because obviously, I know what you're saying, but I wouldn't say that's a casualty

489
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
 of the Crimean War.

490
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:38,520
 Oh really?

491
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,400
 That's something you read out at the end of the traumatising news of another battle of

492
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
 the Crimean War.

493
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
 And it lighten news.

494
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,120
 An owl has been abandoned to die, and that's it.

495
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,480
 Well, if you live in London, you can still visit Athena the owl because it was, there's

496
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,480
 no point now, it was recovered and sent to taxidermy.

497
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,200
 So Athena the owl is kept at St Thomas's in the Florence Nightingale Museum.

498
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:07,200
 I wonder if anyone's opened up a theme that's to see if Plato's still there.

499
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,360
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

500
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,800
 My fact is that almost every Englishman at the Battle of Agincourt ate a small amount

501
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,760
 of soil just before the battle started.

502
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,680
 Wow, why did they do that?

503
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,680
 Yeah.

504
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,240
 Why did they do that?

505
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,600
 It's a good question.

506
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,360
 I think it was symbolic.

507
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,400
 Well, obviously it was symbolic because there was no practical, there was no nutritional

508
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
 value to this.

509
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
 No.

510
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,520
 So we should say briefly what Agincourt was.

511
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,080
 It was one of the principally remembered battles of the Hundred Years War or the series

512
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,640
 of wars that we now we know as the Hundred Years War was in 1415 and the reason it's widely

513
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,080
 remembered in England is because it was a big English victory over France and a lot

514
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,360
 of the other battles of the Hundred Years War have slightly been allowed to slip

515
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
 into history.

516
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,360
 They're quite well known in France, so I would say the other battles of the Hundred Years

517
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
 War.

518
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
 Hundred percent.

519
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,600
 Between the two sides, we're covering memorials of all the battles, except the English

520
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
 War.

521
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,760
 All our Frenchist listeners right now are going, well, I've not heard this.

522
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,280
 They've dug up something really nice here.

523
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,040
 They genuinely, in France, it's not really taught.

524
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,320
 I mean, do write in if you have heard of it, but I think it's not famous at all in France,

525
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,760
 which is bizarre because for any non-British listeners, Agincourt is extremely well-known

526
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
 here.

527
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,760
 For that reason, even though it was super short, it only lasted maybe half an hour.

528
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,000
 I found the brilliant website.

529
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,960
 It's run by the University of Southampton that has a list of everyone who was fighting Agincourt.

530
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,200
 Actually everyone who they could find from the whole Hundred Years War, but they have the

531
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,880
 specific people who they know are Agincourt and it's a great long list, obviously there

532
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,760
 were thousands and thousands of soldiers, so I went through that and we had one guy called

533
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,840
 Thomas Sadler, who actually was a Sadler.

534
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
 That was his job.

535
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,760
 There was a guy called John Horsey who was a knight and there was a guy called Matthew Boer

536
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
 who was an archer.

537
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,920
 It was not cool.

538
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
 It was not cool.

539
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,360
 And they also have the whole French team as well, like all the French soldiers that were

540
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
 there.

541
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,280
 And there were 64 French soldiers at the Battle of Agincourt called Colin.

542
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
 Really?

543
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
 Wow.

544
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,480
 And four of those were called Colin Poisson.

545
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
 Colin the fish.

546
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
 Colin the fish.

547
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
 Colin Poisson.

548
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
 Colin Poisson's at the Battle of Agincourt.

549
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
 Seriously.

550
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
 Wow.

551
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,360
 Are we sure that's real?

552
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,360
 That's real.

553
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,360
 That's real.

554
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,360
 Playtosa card is there.

555
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
 It's real.

556
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,360
 It's real.

557
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,680
 They should get the academics onto this list because there's been debate raging since

558
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,240
 the Battle of Agincourt about how many soldiers fought there and it's still very, very

559
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
 vigorous.

560
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,760
 So they should just count all the names on that because there's all sorts of exaggerations.

561
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,600
 So the English got taught for a good few hundred years that they were outnumbered about

562
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,960
 10 times or 20 times, you know, the French had hundreds of thousands of times more soldiers.

563
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,800
 But I think they think now that it was about two to one, don't they, in terms of outnumbering.

564
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
 Yeah.

565
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
 Which is still good.

566
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,080
 But the English had more archers, twice as many archers.

567
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,040
 So if you do, again, if you're a broad listener, if you do a word association, Agincourt, I think

568
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,880
 people go longbow because that was the huge deal at Agincourt.

569
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,720
 It was that English decided we're going to just rely on having most of our people being

570
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
 archers.

571
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,560
 We've got this great longbow that the Welsh gave us, thank you, Wales.

572
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,440
 And we're just going to fire at them from behind, whereas the French were a bit more into

573
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,120
 their chivalry and their knights in shining, heavy, annoying armour.

574
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
 And they didn't really like the bow.

575
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,760
 They thought it was a bit unjentlemently.

576
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,640
 So they just had shed loads of cavalry, which, as it turned out, when it was pissing

577
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,360
 with rain and the mud was thigh deep and the horses just sank into it, was a disadvantage.

578
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,200
 Well, the thing is it's like, in theory, it's not that much of a disadvantage because

579
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,600
 if you're wearing a full suit of armour, there's not many places that those arrows can get

580
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
 in.

581
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,920
 Like, it could hit you in the neck, it could hit you in the groin, there's one or two other

582
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
 places.

583
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,800
 All the places where it could hit you are not very nice, but the chances are it would bounce

584
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
 off you.

585
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,920
 But of course, what happened was the arrows hit the horses and then the horses just went

586
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,120
 crazy because they'd been hit by an arrow and they unseated the riders who were then

587
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,920
 in a whole load of mud with a whole load of extremely heavy armour and just were sitting

588
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,200
 ducks for the, for the edge.

589
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,000
 With the opposite of sitting owls.

590
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Yes.

591
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,600
 There was a moment just before the battle because all the English archers were facing,

592
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,760
 a lot of them facing the French lines, they had a stake in the ground in front of them

593
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,520
 as an anti-cavary device, you know, which is a good one.

594
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,200
 When you say stake, you mean a piece of what?

595
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,280
 No, I mean, I mean a nice t-bone steak with some horse radish.

596
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:48,240
 It was to try and freak out the French horses, they're saying, "This is what you're going

597
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,520
 to have to be after this battle, no, sorry."

598
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,760
 They had a massive sharpened wooden stake and they stuck it in the ground, you know, facing

599
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
 the French lines.

600
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,720
 But there was this weird moment just before the battle where all the English were told,

601
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,520
 can you advance a bit so that we are in range of the French cavalry because the French

602
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,160
 hadn't lined up and started moving yet.

603
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,720
 And the English had to come around to the front of their stake, all these archers, he

604
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,840
 the stake out of the ground, very strong exercise required to do that, it's quite an exertion.

605
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,120
 Move the stake forward a fair bit so you're in line, so that you're in range of the French

606
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,040
 and then hammer the stake back into the ground, facing the French cavalry again.

607
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
 Wow.

608
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,800
 And you have to do all of this while you're completely exposed, your back is to the

609
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,280
 enemy and the French observed this happening and did nothing about it.

610
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,840
 It was a really strange lapse on the French side and I, yeah, I'm sure proper historians

611
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,640
 could account for it, but I just don't know why that happened.

612
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,760
 I think it was a big disadvantage to attack, so I always think the beginning of a battle reminds

613
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,120
 me a bit of the beginning of a cycling race, you know what those races change, you like

614
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,760
 cycling, where they in the village room.

615
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, where they all really, really slow to set off with and as soon as one of

616
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
 them goes.

617
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,640
 Oh, exactly.

618
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,640
 Omnick, Omnick, Omnick, or something, I can't remember.

619
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,640
 Yes.

620
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
 What's the disadvantage?

621
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,640
 Why is it bad to start?

622
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,160
 In cycling, what it is is if you're in someone's slipstream, it's a lot easier, so

623
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,560
 it's better for them to go first, you to go behind them and then you can overtake them at

624
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,560
 the last second, but I don't know why it's in battle.

625
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:17,960
 In battle, same thing, it's a slipstream issue, it's easier to defend than to attack

626
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,000
 with the generally accepted wisdom, so you didn't want to be the army attacking.

627
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,520
 I think you probably, you know, you start losing your shape when you attack, whereas you

628
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
 keep it when you defend.

629
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,240
 So there was this weird moment where before the battle, they had their battle lines lined

630
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,920
 up and they sent some heralds to meet in the middle and say, hey, are you going to

631
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,680
 the cave and then the other heralds said no and vice versa, so the heralds went back

632
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,400
 and said, okay, we're at war.

633
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,480
 And then no one moved for ages, they just stood staring at each other because no one wanted

634
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,720
 to be the first to attack.

635
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,520
 And yeah, the French won, attacking won, attacking and eventually the English thought,

636
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,720
 I saw it, we'll do it then.

637
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,240
 Isn't that a large, wasn't there that stat about during wartime, about how many bullets

638
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,200
 were shot to miss as opposed to kill?

639
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,640
 People would fire above the heads of the enemy because they didn't want to be someone

640
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
 who took a life.

641
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,480
 Because like a huge number of shots were aimed to miss.

642
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,280
 They say that about Vietnam, don't they?

643
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,720
 Yeah, I think that's a slightly different thing more about the psychology of not wanting

644
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,040
 to kill someone, isn't it?

645
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,440
 Oh, so you think that not starting is just purely out of strategy?

646
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,960
 That's what that's the way it has to study.

647
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

648
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,280
 You're not starting it.

649
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,960
 These guys did not have a problem with killing as many people as they possibly could.

650
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
 Okay.

651
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
 Don't you worry.

652
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,120
 I don't know if there's any benefit of that out there, right?

653
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,680
 Do you know that a few years after the war, six years after the Battle of Ashencourt, Henry

654
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:43,640
 the Fifth sent back a cavalry of soldiers back to France, and do you guys know why?

655
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,200
 He had left his wallet in that same car.

656
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,040
 No, I don't know.

657
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,680
 He sent them in to collect the foreskin of Jesus.

658
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,680
 Of course, that was going to be my next guess.

659
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,080
 Yeah, I knew if I gave you a bit more time.

660
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,080
 Wow.

661
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,760
 So he got married to Catherine, who was the daughter of the French king, and she was expecting

662
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,760
 her first baby.

663
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:10,120
 And he heard rumors that France had the foreskin of Jesus Christ there, one of the holy relics.

664
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:17,160
 So he sent his men back in to pick it up without any sort of hassle or resistance, and they

665
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
 brought it back.

666
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,760
 And it was brought to Catherine.

667
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,360
 And supposedly, as it's reported, the scent of the foreskin helped her to give birth

668
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,200
 to Henry the Fifth in a nice calm way.

669
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,000
 So as if they rub it under her nose, and the sweet scent, I don't know if they dangled

670
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,960
 it like an air freshener in front of her, or if they actually physically robbed it.

671
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,760
 I don't think they used the foreskin of Jesus as an air freshener.

672
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,040
 You wouldn't have that in the Christmas tree dangling in your car, would you?

673
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,200
 What flavor is this?

674
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,560
 Yeah, no, but supposedly in the scent of it, the sweet scent of it helped her for a natural

675
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
 birth.

676
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,760
 So yeah, what a great baby shower present.

677
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,480
 That really outdoes all the other presents at a baby shower, doesn't it?

678
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,200
 If you're the one who's brought Jesus' foreskin, they always say about, really, like, privileged

679
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
 children.

680
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,600
 They were born with Jesus' foreskin in the mouth, don't they?

681
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,240
 We've probably been excommunicated multiple times for mentioning Jesus' foreskin, haven't

682
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
 we?

683
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,240
 Yeah.

684
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,240
 Why not one more time?

685
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,240
 Yeah.

686
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
 So I go on now.

687
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,240
 That's what we're on Catherine.

688
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,040
 I read another thing, which is that Samuel Peep's kissed her.

689
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
 Did he?

690
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,040
 What?

691
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,040
 Yeah.

692
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
 But this was 200 years between.

693
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,040
 200 years between.

694
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
 Yeah.

695
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
 So he wrote this in his diary.

696
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:36,600
 It was show Tuesday, 1669, and she was buried in Westminster Abbey, and she had an alabaster

697
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,880
 and all that sort of stuff, but a lot of attacks happened, I think it was Henry VIII, got rid

698
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:48,440
 of the alabaster, didn't like the idea of her, but her coffin, her crypt, was still there,

699
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:54,400
 and it busted open in 1669, revealing her corpse inside, so the lid was open, and people

700
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:00,800
 could visit the open lid of Catherine, and Samuel Peep's leaned in and gave her a kiss,

701
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,760
 and reported it in his diary that at 36 years old, and I did kiss a queen, he wrote, it was

702
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
 on his birthday.

703
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,960
 I mean, did he really kiss a queen, or did he just, you know, nozzella cups?

704
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
 Kiss the two hundred-year-old corpse, yeah.

705
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,960
 It feels like a bit of a stretch, it feels a bit me too, to be honest.

706
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,960
 A queen's a queen forever, but the queen always refers to Queen Elizabeth as her majesty,

707
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,800
 as if the Queen Elizabeth I first.

708
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
 Okay.

709
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
 Yeah.

710
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,440
 I'm with Peep, so I think he nailed it, a great birthday present, it's up there with four

711
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,080
 skin of Jesus, in terms of good gifts.

712
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,080
 Some of the myths about Ashen Car come from Shakespeare, because he wrote Henry V, in

713
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:46,600
 great play, that is mostly set at the Battle of Ashen Car, and one of the characters

714
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:53,680
 in Henry V is Fulstaff, and he is based on a real person who was there, who was not called

715
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,920
 Fulstaff, but was called Falsstaff, who was a famous person, who was at the battle, and later

716
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,480
 went on to run a pub in Sothek.

717
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:08,840
 But this guy, I think the BBC need to make a massive budget TV series about Falsstaff,

718
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,440
 because he is amazing.

719
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,240
 He fought at the Battle of Ashen Car, he won another battle, the Battle of the Herrings,

720
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,960
 he was at the sea, and the French came to attack him, and he got a load of herring barrels

721
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,080
 and put them all in a big line, and then hit behind them and attacked the French from

722
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,280
 there.

723
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,840
 He fought against Joan of Arc, at the Siege of Orleans, and the was rumours that John Fasstaff

724
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:37,520
 was coming, and the brother of Joan of Arc decided not to tell her, because everyone was

725
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,680
 so scared of this guy, and they thought they know that Fasstaff is coming, then everyone's

726
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,440
 going to panic, so they didn't tell her, and Joan of Arc said to her, "Brother, bastard

727
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,760
 bastard, in the name of God, I command you that as soon as you hear of Fasstaff's coming,

728
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,880
 you will let me know, for if he gets through without my knowing it, I swear to you that I

729
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,320
 will have your head caught off."

730
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:02,000
 And he was at another battle where the English got routed, and he was one of the only people

731
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,320
 whose group of soldiers managed to survive, but it meant that everyone else thought that

732
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
 he'd been cowardly.

733
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,800
 When he hadn't been cowardly, it had just been the way that the battle had worked out,

734
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,520
 and he lost his reputation and had to go back to the UK, and he'd been a hero, but everyone

735
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,440
 thought he was a coward, and he's just amazing, and then all of his money went to the foundation

736
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,960
 of modeling college.

737
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,960
 Okay.

738
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,880
 So, here's like this suit that finally rejuvenating Fasstaff's reputation, is that what we're

739
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
 doing today?

740
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
 I think so.

741
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
 We're saving Fasstaff.

742
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,760
 He was the Baron of Silly in France.

743
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,080
 I mean, what mod do you need about this guy?

744
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
 He was brilliant.

745
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,760
 But as you're tied, although a bit of a misleading title, if I went to see the Baron of Silly as

746
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
 a movie...

747
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,240
 He is Shakespeare's recurring character, isn't he?

748
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,360
 I always like that there's a rip, you know, pops up three times.

749
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
 Yeah.

750
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,360
 Feels like a funny Easter egg.

751
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,080
 Every time you come, it's a little call back.

752
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:57,000
 Henry the Fifth has obviously used a lot still today, that rousing speech that he gives

753
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,520
 in, for many things, like football, you know, if there's the World Cup, someone might

754
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,640
 do an advert giving that speech.

755
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:09,080
 But one person who was particularly fond of it and got into movies as a result during World

756
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,480
 War II was Winston Churchill.

757
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:18,400
 So Churchill actively became a producer or a sort of accredited help on a movie of Henry

758
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,400
 the Fifth and enlisted Lawrence Olivier to play it because he wanted it to be seen as

759
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,040
 a stirring thing for the British, and trailers were released on the day that the troops were

760
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,880
 invading Normandy, and they used a trailer where they showed modern day London and then brought

761
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,040
 it back into the old London to sort of help people get excited that, you know, this is something

762
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,240
 will conquer and something that will do.

763
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,560
 It's not the only time that Winston Churchill did that either during World War II.

764
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,560
 He then got Lawrence Olivier to make another, and when I say got him, he encouraged him,

765
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:55,920
 but I guess that was a pretty strong encouragement during the wartime, to make a movie about Nelson

766
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,660
 and Emma Hamilton, because in the movie, which was made predominantly for Americans, he

767
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,800
 wanted to draw parallels between Napoleon and Adolf Hitler and have the American public

768
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,120
 see that movie as something whereby they needed to come and get behind it.

769
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,520
 So Lawrence Olivier is sort of like a bizarre propaganda spy for the British.

770
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,080
 Maybe if Winston Churchill spent less time directing films and more time winning the

771
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,680
 war, it wouldn't have lasted six years.

772
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,680
 Yeah.

773
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
 Well, maybe if…

774
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,680
 The counterpoint.

775
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,240
 There's a Chamberlain hadn't seen that owl that time, then we wouldn't have had a war in

776
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,240
 the first place.

777
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,240
 That's true.

778
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,640
 There was so many big hits.

779
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,360
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

780
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,920
 My fact this week is that the first known coloring book was meant for adults.

781
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,920
 Wow.

782
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,240
 It's just been re-found, rediscovered, or in 2017, it was rediscovered.

783
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,200
 If they just find one that had been coloured in, is that what happened?

784
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,120
 It actually hasn't been coloured in, so someone obviously had it and then didn't even use

785
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
 it.

786
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,920
 Because otherwise, you wouldn't be able to tell it was a coloring in book.

787
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
 No.

788
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
 If it's been coloured in really well, it's just…

789
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
 Yes.

790
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
 That's really a good point.

791
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,600
 Imagine if you had a kid so good at coloring in, people would browse through the coloring

792
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,080
 in book, just thought it was a book.

793
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,960
 Yeah, they would think that you had a really weird taste of books today.

794
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:21,960
 There seems to be all the books on your bookcase, just pictures of birds.

795
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,400
 Well, this was pictures of flowers, in fact, so this was a book called The Flourest, published

796
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:34,160
 in 1760 by a guy called Robert Seer, and rediscovered in a Missouri Botanic Garden in 2017.

797
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,520
 And it said on the front cover, it was for the use and amusement of gentlemen and ladies.

798
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,120
 And then, inside, it had instructions for how to colour all the pictures in, so it was

799
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,320
 just lots of pictures.

800
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,280
 So you can look it up online, it's very beautiful, it's all publicly available.

801
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,960
 And it had techniques, it told you what colour you should do the flowers, so none of this

802
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,320
 freedom that the kids have now.

803
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,000
 And it had sort of the recipes to mix your own colours, or it said, you can also get pre-mixed

804
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,480
 colours from the publisher of this book, FRII, if you want.

805
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
 And it was great.

806
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,680
 Don't know why the person didn't colour it in, I would have.

807
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,400
 Well, maybe he didn't have all the specific coloured pencils that you'd need it to have

808
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,160
 to do it, because if you're not allowed to have your own freedom and colour all your

809
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,160
 flowers in black, like I used to do with all my colouring books then.

810
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,160
 Oh, I know.

811
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
 So emo.

812
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,160
 Wow.

813
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,160
 So I should have a little go.

814
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
 So emo.

815
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,160
 Yeah, you're right.

816
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,640
 Maybe it was like, when you know when you buy an electric toy for a kid and they open it up

817
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,200
 and you realise it hasn't come with the batteries, it was like that and you got home and then

818
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,680
 ready to have to order the bloody paints.

819
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,920
 But actually, isn't it true that someone had been using the book to press flowers?

820
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,320
 I think this one that they found.

821
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,720
 So they opened it up and they hadn't coloured it in.

822
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,960
 But they seem sort of placed flowers on top of where they should have been coloured in.

823
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
 Yeah.

824
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
 Completely misunderstood in the first book.

825
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
 Well, that's true.

826
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
 Well, it was the first one.

827
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,960
 Like, it's not obvious what to do, is it?

828
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,960
 Yeah.

829
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,960
 That's the first ever one.

830
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,160
 Maybe it was built as a pressier flowers book and we then changed it into a colouring book.

831
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,960
 Oh, what is it you were meant to put the flower on top of the outline of the flower?

832
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
 Yeah.

833
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
 Fill it in.

834
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,960
 Like a football sticker album, basically.

835
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
 Yes.

836
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,960
 Yes.

837
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,960
 Yes.

838
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,960
 First panini.

839
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
 Is this the first panini album?

840
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
 Yeah.

841
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,400
 It's explicitly not what this is.

842
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,560
 He's very clear in the instructions, but there should be one of those.

843
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,640
 Anna, from the article you sent around, it looks like there were some earlier not full colouring

844
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,760
 books, but there were illustrations distributing which were designed to be coloured in by readers.

845
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,760
 These woodcuts of Christ.

846
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,000
 Well, a lot of people did colour them in, yeah.

847
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 Yeah.

848
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,320
 Yeah, from the 15th century.

849
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,720
 And we know that people colour them in because we have all these different versions

850
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,800
 of them where some people have just done, it's the picture of the crucifixion.

851
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,920
 Some people have just done the blood or some people have just coloured in.

852
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,480
 The Christ figure and then some people have gone to town and they've coloured in the angels

853
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,480
 and they've coloured in the background.

854
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,120
 Did anyone colour everything in black or?

855
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,120
 No.

856
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,120
 No.

857
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,120
 No.

858
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,080
 We went through so much charcoal when I was a child.

859
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,960
 But they were good.

860
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,200
 They're gorgeous things, yeah.

861
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,200
 They are.

862
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,200
 And people used to hang them up, didn't they?

863
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,560
 I like the idea of the art on your wall being something that you'd half made.

864
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,720
 So we just say a woodcut was just when they carved into wood and then the manufacturers

865
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,360
 rolled ink over the wood.

866
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,120
 So all the bits that were carved had no ink in them.

867
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,880
 And then you say you had the outline.

868
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,160
 And then yeah, people would paint them home and hang them on the walls to impress visitors.

869
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,360
 Well, why do you look at some of those woodcuts and stuff like that from around that time,

870
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,000
 which would have been what, 15th or 16th century?

871
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,440
 Like juror, for instance, things like that.

872
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,720
 You kind of think you look at those if you're in a museum and think, well, why didn't

873
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,720
 people colour those in?

874
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,200
 It makes complete sense.

875
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,200
 Yeah.

876
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,200
 Yeah.

877
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,200
 Well, they did.

878
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,160
 So this was the first explicit colouring book meant for the purpose, but probably inspired

879
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,080
 by the fact that everyone was colouring in their manuscripts all the time.

880
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,920
 So there are lots of manuscripts that exist that people at home would colour in, because

881
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,480
 there was no colour printing.

882
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,200
 And so even very limited by that point colour printing.

883
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,120
 So people just would do it themselves.

884
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,120
 That's so cool.

885
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,040
 Do you guys want to know one pleasing irony of colouring in?

886
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,720
 Oh, yes.

887
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:08,000
 In 1962, in the early '60s, there was a huge great craze for colouring in books massive.

888
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,480
 And lots of those were for adults too.

889
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,880
 Barbara Streisand released a song in 1962 called My Coloring Book.

890
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
 Really?

891
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,280
 And it was a minor hit for maybe realise how well Barbara Streisand is for one thing.

892
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,960
 But, pleasingly, there is now a Barbara Streisand colouring in book.

893
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,960
 Oh, very nice.

894
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,960
 That is good.

895
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,960
 Yeah.

896
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,960
 I don't think it's linked to the song, especially, it's just that there are colouring books.

897
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,320
 Well, '60s, that was a huge boom for the colouring in book, wasn't it?

898
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,080
 And particularly as a tool of satire.

899
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,080
 So there were a few books.

900
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:40,440
 JFK Coloring in book, which stayed in the charts for like 14 weeks on the New York Times, Bessell

901
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,440
 was list.

902
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,000
 But they were released not to be coloured in, basically.

903
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,600
 They were colouring books that you were meant to leave alone.

904
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,800
 Because they were sort of a new version of a great satirical cartoon that would appear

905
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,080
 in the newspapers or in the magazine.

906
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:58,960
 So they found that there was no boom in sales of crayons and pencil colour pencils in

907
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,840
 the period where there was the boom of all these big colouring books that were released.

908
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,840
 Really?

909
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,840
 Yeah.

910
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,640
 I see humour books where the captions underneath gave you a great gag.

911
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,280
 So there was one about being corporate and so you would have to colour in the suit that

912
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,680
 I have to wear, which is grey.

913
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,040
 Please colour it in grey or I'll be fired.

914
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,040
 That was the first one, I think.

915
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,880
 So I like the fact that the first modern colouring book was, you were supposed to colour everything

916
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,880
 in grey.

917
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,880
 James, you would have loved it with your little charcoal.

918
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,880
 Yeah.

919
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,880
 That's a wrong shade.

920
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,880
 That was pretty dark.

921
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,880
 That one, wasn't it?

922
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,600
 It was like, this is my train.

923
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,400
 It takes me to the office every day.

924
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,400
 You meet lots of interesting people on the train, colour them all grey.

925
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,400
 Yeah.

926
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,560
 And then the only bit where you had to put any colour in, it was like, this is my pill.

927
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,720
 It is round.

928
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
 It is pink.

929
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,720
 It makes me not care.

930
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,720
 Yeah.

931
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,720
 That's pretty dark.

932
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
 It is really dark.

933
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,960
 It's called the executive colouring book if anyone wants to check it out.

934
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,920
 Did you see the conspiracy theory one, Den?

935
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,920
 I thought this would be…

936
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,920
 I did, I loved it.

937
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,920
 Yeah.

938
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,920
 It's so good.

939
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,520
 It has a blank page and it says, how many communists can you find in this picture?

940
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,520
 I can find eleven.

941
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,520
 Amazing.

942
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:09,440
 There was a modern colouring book, craze, which a lot of listeners will probably remember,

943
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,440
 which was about three years ago.

944
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,680
 I've almost all the listeners, I will say, Andy, unless you've got some very young ones.

945
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,240
 Some of our older listeners might remember that.

946
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:25,040
 I mean, you might not have been paying attention to the colouring in trend, oh my word.

947
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,080
 Yeah, but there was obviously a huge rash of new books published and I found an article

948
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,880
 from the Scottish Library website, the Scottish National Library.

949
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,760
 It has an article in 2016, headlined, yes, we have colouring books in our library, but sorry,

950
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,720
 you can't colour them in and this is just clarifying what you couldn't do in this kind of

951
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
 library.

952
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,720
 That's really interesting though, isn't it?

953
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,960
 If you go to the library and you get a colouring book, surely you should be like, what's

954
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,280
 the point of getting that out if you can't colour it in?

955
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,280
 That's weird, isn't it?

956
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,280
 Wow, quite.

957
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,880
 Well, it said it also went on to clarify, you can come and look at the magic eye books

958
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,760
 and squint at them and see the pictures hidden in the pages, but you can look at it,

959
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,520
 not solve our pseudo-coup books.

960
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,520
 Ah, yes.

961
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,760
 What you could do is colour them in and then tipx out your colouring afterwards, and then

962
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,760
 the next person could colour out your tipx.

963
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,040
 Well, I sometimes think it's fun to try and do a crossword.

964
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,680
 If you don't have a pen on you, you can just do the crossword in your head and, you know,

965
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,000
 that's a fun way of spending time and time.

966
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,600
 Yeah, so you could do your colouring book in your head.

967
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,240
 Went out the lines again, oh, fuck.

968
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,240
 Did the website also say, "Can the guy who keeps pressing plants into our books, please

969
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,160
 refrain from that in the future?"

970
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,680
 Do we think they're good or bad?

971
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,680
 There's some controversy about whether you should even give colouring books to children,

972
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,360
 because maybe it's huge controversy.

973
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,360
 Is that?

974
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,800
 Because it might make them violence or something.

975
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,800
 Oh, wow.

976
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,520
 James, I know you had a very dark upbringing, but some of us put colours in our colouring.

977
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,400
 I was just thinking, like, usually when there's a moral panic about not giving things

978
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,200
 to children, it's because it's going to turn them to drugs or violence.

979
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,040
 The call of duty colouring book might prompt children to violence or whatever.

980
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,040
 It's a really good point.

981
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,680
 I don't think this is something that's been considered yet, but this was first raised

982
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:12,760
 in the 1950s by the sort of leader in our education guy called Victor Lovenfeld, and he said

983
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,240
 colouring books have a devastating effect on children, and it's because they don't let

984
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,680
 them develop their own ideas.

985
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,400
 So the idea is that you've given them a picture, and they just have to stick within the confines

986
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:28,600
 of that picture, and he was saying not only do they not inspire children to be imaginative,

987
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,160
 but also they kind of make them have really low self confidence, because children look

988
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,480
 at these really good pictures in the colouring book, and they think, well, I'm never going

989
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,480
 to draw as well as that.

990
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,560
 I've just tried to draw sunshine, and it ended up as square.

991
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,000
 And so they're not even going to attempt to draw themselves.

992
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,240
 And there is quite a lot of back and forth thinking about whether it's bad for children's

993
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,240
 imaginations.

994
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,320
 And then they start getting violence, I guess, after that.

995
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,640
 And then they put a punch in the face, yeah.

996
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,640
 That's really interesting.

997
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,960
 You know, these colouring books were, it's colour by numbers, so it might be, when you look

998
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,880
 at it, sometimes you might look at it, you might not see what the image is until you colour

999
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,520
 it in, and then you realise what it is.

1000
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,200
 There was one of those in the Netherlands, and it turned out that, when you coloured it

1001
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,680
 in, it was actually Adolf Hitler, and the problem was that they had, they'd bought these

1002
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,320
 colouring books, but they'd never coloured them in to see what the images were, and it

1003
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,560
 was only when people took them home and coloured them in that they realised that it was

1004
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:26,280
 bad, and they said they deeply regretted the incident, and it remains unclear why Hitler

1005
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,880
 was included in the colouring books.

1006
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,840
 And the guy said his suspicion is that the man who created it, because it was someone

1007
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,920
 in India who'd created this book, they just didn't know who Hitler was and they'd taken him

1008
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,040
 out of, you know, just a book of historical figures.

1009
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,480
 Well, they just took the time man of the year for 1938.

1010
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,480
 Yeah.

1011
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:53,800
 While we're on paint by numbers, this is very similar to colouring in obviously.

1012
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:59,600
 So Dan, we know who invented them, again, because it's relatively recently, it was invented,

1013
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,520
 but it was a guy called Dan Robbins, who only died last year, actually.

1014
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,680
 It was in 1951, and he was working at a paint company, and he was given the task of selling

1015
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:14,440
 more paint, and he came up with this method to sell small quantities of paint, but it was

1016
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,480
 popular, obviously, he'd sell a lot.

1017
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,560
 And there's an online museum of paint by numbers, which has 60,000 of them, and it says that

1018
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,600
 he is the most exhibited artist in the world.

1019
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,200
 His work, you know, he does all the drawings, it has been displayed on more walls than any

1020
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,200
 other artist.

1021
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,360
 Which is quite a pleasing idea.

1022
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,760
 It's a loose definition of the word artist, isn't it?

1023
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,960
 He always said this is not, when you're doing a paint by numbers, it's not art per se,

1024
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,600
 but you are getting the same sensation as people have when they are creating art, and that's

1025
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,400
 a kind of gateway in some ways.

1026
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,960
 So he was always very modest about what it was.

1027
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:56,600
 So was the idea that, like, if they had a lot of orange paint to sell, for instance, they

1028
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,880
 might do a load of paint by numbers with umpillempers in them, or something, they would sell oranges.

1029
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,880
 Yeah.

1030
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,880
 Or oranges.

1031
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,880
 Yeah.

1032
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,880
 I knew there was something famous.

1033
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,280
 There was orange in colour, but I just can't think of it.

1034
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,160
 Wasn't I almost went for blackpool football kits?

1035
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,160
 Oh, wow.

1036
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,160
 That would have been niche.

1037
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,160
 It's too niche.

1038
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:20,840
 If they had a lot of black paint to sell, they specifically marketed it to the heart.

1039
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,880
 He was claimed that he was inspired by Leonardo da Vinci, so in his autobiography, he wrote

1040
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,840
 that he'd once heard Leonardo da Vinci would hand out numbered patterns to his apprentices

1041
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,560
 in his workshops, and then the apprentices could fill in the colours.

1042
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:36,080
 And I must have wasted about six hours yesterday trying to find any original evidence

1043
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:40,560
 that Leonardo da Vinci, all Michelangelo, which was also sometimes claimed, did this, and

1044
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,560
 I can't.

1045
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,760
 So I'm begging you, any art historians out there, if you've got evidence of this, please

1046
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,760
 write it in.

1047
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,280
 But there used to be hung on people's walls, which I find odd.

1048
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,960
 When I did paint by numbers, it wasn't the sort of thing my mum would then frame put

1049
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,960
 on the wall.

1050
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,960
 But people would hang on.

1051
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,960
 There wasn't the fifties.

1052
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,960
 What were you doing?

1053
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,960
 The President Eisenhower had them hung up in the corridor in the wild.

1054
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,960
 Oh, really?

1055
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,960
 That's so cool.

1056
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,360
 Look, if Donald Trump could do it without going out of the lines, he would do exactly

1057
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,240
 the same thing.

1058
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:13,400
 Okay, that's it.

1059
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,400
 That is all of our facts.

1060
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,720
 Thank you so much for listening.

1061
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,360
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said over the

1062
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,160
 course of this podcast, you can get us on our Twitter accounts.

1063
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,640
 I'm on @Sriberland.

1064
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,640
 James.

1065
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,640
 At James Harkin.

1066
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,640
 Andy.

1067
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,640
 At Andrew Hunter M.

1068
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,640
 And Anna.

1069
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,640
 You can email podcast@QI.com.

1070
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,120
 Yeah, but you can go to our group account, which is @no such thing, or go to our website.

1071
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,640
 No such thing as a fish.com.

1072
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,920
 All of our previous episodes are there, links to merchandise are there as well.

1073
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,360
 And yeah, guys, still hope you're safe, still hope you're doing okay.

1074
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,760
 Hopefully we'll get past all this very soon and back out into the world.

1075
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,720
 Until then, we'll be back again next week with another episode, and we'll see you then.

1076
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:56,880
 Goodbye.

1077
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,280
 I've wasted a full cycling trip's worth of Vaseline here.

1078
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,280
 What do you do?

1079
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,280
 You're cycling.

1080
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,680
 Oh, Anna, you will be able to find that if you look it up online.

1081
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,680
 Yeah.

1082
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,680
 Okay.

1083
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,640
 It's certainly not going inside your pants, put it that way.

1084
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,640
 No, hang on.

1085
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,640
 No.

1086
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,840
 It's certainly not going outside your pants.

1087
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,840
 Yeah.

1088
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:27,840
