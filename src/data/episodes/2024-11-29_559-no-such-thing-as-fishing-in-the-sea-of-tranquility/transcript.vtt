 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Perth.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Right in the dark, I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 and James Harkin, and once again, we have gather ground on microphones

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 What are they putting the water here?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 My fact is that if you run a restaurant,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 one of the best ways to sabotage a rival is to get them a Michelin star.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 It's the kiss of death.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 It's the kiss of death for a restaurant.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 This is so cool.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 So this was a study that was published in the Strategic Management Journal.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Basically, the author tracked down restaurants that had been awarded a Michelin star recently

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 and found that they are likely to close over the following however long it is.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Let's say a year.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Do we know why?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Yes, we do.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 You become famous for a start.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Oh yeah, that's terrible.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Your customers change.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 People start coming from hundreds of miles away because you've got a Michelin star, you know.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 They get more demanding.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 You match their demands, you do fancier food, costs rise.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Chefs want their salaries to go up.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 They're likely to leave because they've got the golden aura about them now.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 The whole thing is a disaster, and you're likely to end up shutting down.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 It's like a resource curse, basically.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Yeah.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 So yeah, and it happens.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 And then once you've got one or two, everyone chases the third,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 and that's when it gets really dangerous because it gets incredibly expensive.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 So restaurant owners have started rejecting them, saying we don't need this in our life.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 We don't need to be seen as good.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 We're fine.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Well, they're not allowed.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Well, they officially weren't allowed to, were they, until quite recently?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 You can't reject a Michelin star?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Well, I think what Michelin said for a long time, because Marco Pierre White,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 I think was the first person in the '90s to say this is bullshit.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Can't take the pressure.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Take it back.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 And they were like, it's not yours, it's the restaurants, mate.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 You can't give it back.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 But I think they did make an exception.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Finally, there's a guy called Sebastian Bra, who ran Le Souquet,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 and he just hated having a Michelin star so much that eventually Michelin said,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 "It is difficult for us to have a restaurant in the guide which desperately does not wish to be in it."

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 So they did agree to remove it for the first time.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 But it is the pressure, isn't it?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 And the fact that you don't know, and I didn't realise this, but you don't know why you've got it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 You don't know it's coming, and when it appears in the guide,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 there's not like someone right through a view explaining here are the elements of your dishes that we enjoyed.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 And as you say, you overturn your menu.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 So it could be that the reason you got it was for that amazing slice of white bread as you enter.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 And once you ditch that from the menu straight away, you're nothing again.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 That's the thing.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 You don't know that someone is in your restaurant judging you for the Michelin star.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 But not only that, people who work at Michelin don't know who those people are as well.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 The top level, they have no idea, right?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Yes, you get hired. Someone within the company obviously brings you in to do it.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 And you're out on the road for so many weeks per year.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 I used to work as a secret restaurant person.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Out. You were a Michelin star?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 I'm allowed to talk about it now because it's been so long.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 But for quite a long time, you're not allowed to say anything because...

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Are you serious?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Well, I'm half serious.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 What?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Yeah, the start of it was serious, and then it went into whimsy quite quickly.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 You used to work?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 I did use to work as a person who went round restaurants, sort of, seeing how good they were.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 For Michelin?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 No, for Michelin. No, for just some company in Bolton.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 The Michelin of Bolton. What were they called?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 I can't say.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 James, we'll have to wipe all of your memories on the way out now.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Can I just say, I like some of the amazing things that they have on the menus.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 So, Muggeritz in San Sebastian in Spain has edible stones sitting atop an edible mould.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Wow.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Does that sound nice?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 No, it doesn't.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 OK, well, Quince in San Francisco, they have a meal which is served on an iPad.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 It's a truffle meal, and then it comes on the iPad,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 and then there's some beautiful sort of stuff on the iPad that you can press and stuff like that.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Is it wet?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Like a little wet meal on the iPad.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 I suppose it's a little bit moist, but not wet enough.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 These days, you know, iPads and iPhones are quite waterproof, aren't they?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Where do they put a cork up the...

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Excuse me?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 The entry port.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 The port.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Maybe they put it in plastic, I'm not quite sure.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Has he had that, James?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 No, I haven't had any of these. These are old places I want to go to.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 So, Brose in Lecce in Italy, they serve a ricotta foam served in a plastic cast of the chef's mouth.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Wow.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 OK.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Now, you have... Have you read the review of Brose,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 which is the greatest thing you'll ever read,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 and it is on a blog called everywhereist.com,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 and it does talk about Brose.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 It's 27 courses, lasts almost five hours,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 and basically you don't get any food, seemed to be the conclusion.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Because actually the chef's mouth is closed when it gives a new...

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 The mouth just eats the meal before you can get to it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 So they serve things like frozen air that's suddenly melted before they could eat it.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Nothing is bigger than a tiny, tiny teaspoon.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 There was one moment in like course 19 where one of the women said,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 "She got excited because they put a little drop of sauce on the plate."

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 And then she thought, "Oh, they'll put a piece of meat on top."

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 And then the waiter comes by with an eye dropper

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 and squeezes a droplet on top of it and says,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 "We've infused these droplets with meat molecules."

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Is this a positive review?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 It's unbelievably negative.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 So much so that the owner of the restaurant actually replied,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 and you know on TripAdvisor, sometimes someone leaves a bad review

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 and the restaurant owner replies underneath and you think,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 "Don't get involved, mate. What are you doing?"

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 And this guy replied with a drawing of a horse underneath which he said,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 "This is a drawing of a horse. It doesn't make me an artist."

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 And it went on and on into more and more beautiful analogies.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 What is art? What is food? What is a chef? What looks beautiful?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 Someone who owns a restaurant shouldn't be asking, "What is a chef?"

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 I think a lot of people agreed.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 That was probably quite good for their business.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Bad reviews can be quite good.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Because if you see a restaurant on Google or whatever and it's got five stars,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 you do suspect, don't you?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 What do you suspect?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 What do I suspect?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 What's a lie? It's a fake.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 It's all the restaurant owner's friends, you know.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 It's just nonsense.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Oh, really?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 If you see a 4.2, you think that's my level.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 I don't deserve better, nor do I want better than 4.2.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 In fact, Ash, Soundy, his favourite rating, he was telling me the other day, is 3.7.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Ash, that is our...

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 He craves the 3.7.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Michelin, by the way, had three star ratings that you could get right.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 So one meant it was worth a stop if it was one star Michelin.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Two was it was worth a detour.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 So if you saw that on the way, let's go out of our way.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 And then three is worth a journey in order to get to it.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 But they've changed that in recent years where you can get Michelin sort of labels to attach to yourself.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 OK.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 One of which is for restaurants that are deemed not good enough,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 not good enough for a Michelin star, but still worth eating at.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Just 3.6.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Yeah, 3.6, exactly.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Yeah, they do other things now for sustainability, for how green the produce and all that stuff is.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 So there's multiple Michelin levels now.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 That thing you're saying about them being worth a journey, worth a detour, blah, blah, blah.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 That's all from the very early days, which I think we mentioned in the past,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 which is where it was all set up basically by Michelin who make tyres to sell more tyres.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 What if we just send people around France on road trips for food?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 They'll wear out their tyres, they'll buy more tyres.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 The whole thing mushroomed down.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 It's a tyre selling enterprise that has got way out of hand, basically.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 But they contributed, I love this, to D-Day Michelin

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 because the Allied officers who landed on the beaches at Normandy in 1944

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 were all carrying the 1939 Michelin Guide to France in their pockets.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Really?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Because they had incredible maps of France.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 There were no, you know, there were no co-operates of guides.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Really?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 I think they had removed the restaurants.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 I think they might have slightly adjusted it.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Surely you tear the page out.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 They held up in Northern Normandy for a few days

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 because there's a really brilliant Moule restaurant.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 You've got to get everyone through it.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 You have to try this, Barry, you have to.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Do you know, behind us on the screen for the audience to see here,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 we've got a logo of the Michelin Man, a very famous character.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 Incredible how big and rich the history of the Michelin Man is.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 It was voted the greatest logo of all time by 22 designers

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 as part of advertising logos.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 He was known as the road drunkard to begin with.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 And his name is a translation of "drinking to be done".

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Sorry, Michelin Man?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 No, his name is "bibendum".

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Exactly, it was a Latin name.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Sorry, yeah, in his French name, and Latin name rather.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 And so he became massive, but the question that I never thought to ask is,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 "Tires obviously are black, why is he white?"

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 And the answer is that tires used to be white.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 Yeah.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 So he predates black tires.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Like this is how old this logo is, yeah.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 And he's looking good for his age.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 And he's called the drinking stuff up because that's what these tires can do.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 They drink up the road, that's the idea.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 By drinking, I think it is a gerund, "bibendum".

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 They still get their money off tires because they make a huge loss on their guides.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 They don't make any money from them

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 because they have to spend so much freaking money on five-star meals.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 So there was even, I was listening to an interview with their head chef at Alinea in Chicago.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 I mean, foodies will be cringing my pronunciation probably,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 it's a very good restaurant in Chicago.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 And they said the amount that they spent sending Michelin judges to that restaurant alone

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 was much more than the total profit from all the guide selling in Chicago.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Amazing.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Amazing.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 It's not a money maker.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 I thought I'd look at some Australian fine dining.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 Oh, really?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 As soon as we're here, yeah.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 And then when you couldn't find any, you went for France.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 There is a vegan restaurant in Canberra that was fined $16,000

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 because they had a cockroach infestation

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 and they didn't want to kill them because they didn't want to kill any little insects.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Oh, really?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Apparently they had a real problem with German cockroaches

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 and a single female German cockroach can give off 100,000 offspring in a month.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Wow.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 That, so I, there was a news story that came out, I think it was in July of this year or something,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 German cockroaches.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 So that's the cockroach that is everywhere in houses and in restaurants and so on.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 In Germany.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Well, here's the amazing thing.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 For 250 years, it's been a mystery as to where they come from

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 and a scientist in Perth, as part of the university here,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 has discovered German cockroaches aren't actually from Germany.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 No.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 Huge discovery, huge finding.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Do we know where, are they from Austria?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Because that's kind of Germany.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 It's kind of Germany.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Wow.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 No, it's the Bay.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 I missed it in 1938.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 They did DNA testing on it and it's from the Bay of Bengal in India.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Oh, really?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Yes, they traced it and they mapped out this whole journey.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 It would have had to get on a boat and travel over and they worked out all that stuff.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 But they don't appear in the wild.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 All the cockroaches that we have appear.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 They only appear in five-star restaurants.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Yes, they're Michelin star roaches.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Yeah.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 No, you will never find them in the wild.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 It's purely on our houses and restaurants and shops and so on.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 Wow.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 They're all restaurants, isn't it?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Yeah.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 The first Australian cookbook was written by Edward Abbott.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 It's very Australian, I have to say.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 This guy once assaulted the Prime Minister of Australia with an umbrella.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 The book has recipes for roast wombat and kangaroo brains.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 And at one stage there's advice of what to do if you're having a conversation

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 and a drunk person interrupts you.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 What's the advice?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 I didn't write it down.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Ah!

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 At one stage it says we advise ugly people not to go to parties.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 OK.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 And men who aren't that handsome may at least endeavour to not appear uglier

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 than they can help.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Good advice.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 It is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 OK, my fact this week is that in America you can buy designer snakes

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 with emojis on them.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Look at that, isn't that cute?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 We have a picture behind us.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 It's not cute.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 You can't even see its head.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Something can't be cute if you can't see its head.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 It actually looks more...

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 It looks more jack-o'-lantern.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 It looks like a Halloween snake, doesn't it?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Yeah.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Well, in fairness, this is nature doing this.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 It's not a computer.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 So, you know, you have to take what you get.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 Right.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Really.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 But this is a few people in America, in particular someone called Justin Kabilka.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Justin Kabilka has been breeding these bull pythons for quite a long time

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 and one of the times the egg hatched and what should come out

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 but this snake patterned with these orange faces on its body

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 and he could sell it and he makes lots of other snakes.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 You can get ones with two heads.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 You can get ones which feel like human skin when you touch them.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Horrible.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 No, you're not fancy that perp.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 They're amazing.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 They do feel quite nice.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Yeah, everyone thinks they're going to be slimy, but they're not actually.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 They're not slimy at all. They're nice and smooth.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 But I think if you touch the snake and it felt like a human,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 it would be worse with it.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Yeah.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Do we have a snake yet?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Because you know they shed their skin all the time.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Do we have one that's like a past the parcel where it's a new design under each shed?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 That's a good idea.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 Yeah.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 I bet they're working on it.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 That'd be cool.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 So, these are, like I say, they're bull pythons

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 and we think probably because they evolved below ground,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 they kept a lot of mutations which allowed them to change their colours

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 because they wouldn't have so many predators under there.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 So, normally if you're living on the surface,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 you either have lots of colours to scare people off

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 or more commonly you blend into the background

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 because they're underground, they have all these extra little genes.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Right.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 What's amazing?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 So, this is like, I'd never heard of this before, James,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 before you telling us this.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 And this is, there's a huge market for this.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 And these snakes go for such a huge amount of money

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 because they may give birth to snakes

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 and then you have further designer snakes, right?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 So, it's like...

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 So, it's like he's made them, right, just to be clear.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 It's not like he's sitting there randomly hoping.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Like, he literally chooses two snakes to breed.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 So, he'll say, "I have a design in mind.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 I'm seeing a picture of the Eiffel Tower."

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 And then two years later, he'll have a snake with the Eiffel Tower on it

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 because he makes them have sense of it.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Well, he has one that looks like Stonehenge

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 and it mates with one that looks like Big Ben

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 and eventually it comes...

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 He does it, he'll put them in a room, get some Barrywide on,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 just put a nice little spread out and just watch them go.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Actually, one thing that happens is these snakes,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 whenever there's a thunderstorm, they all get really horny.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 And if there's one, if he's not expecting a thunderstorm

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 and suddenly here's a bit of a rumble,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 he has to go, "Shit!"

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 And he has to run in and get all the snakes

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 that he wants to have sex with each other

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 and put them next to each other so that they'll have sex.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Wow, that's amazing.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Also, he does basically reveals.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 So what they call this, they're called morphs.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 When he's got a new design that he's invented and he drops.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 It's like he's a TikTok musician or Beyonce.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 He just drops the latest snake

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 and then you've got to get in quick and buy it as quick as possible, right?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 So people monitor his site and his place for the next drop.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 And you get a preview, don't you?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 And this is the sort of thing, you have this weird thing

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 when you do our job where you start researching

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 and because everyone in the field knows about it,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 you think, "Does the whole world know about this?"

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 So the story of the whole world knows about this,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 but Python breeders, anyone who owns a Python

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 tends to cut their eggs open before they hatch.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 And it's so weird.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 I think everyone in this room knew that.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Everyone knew that, right?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 So often in the wild, they don't survive.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 So quite a lot of the time,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Python's egg teeth, the tooth they have to crack themselves out of the egg,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 doesn't work properly, they can't break themselves out,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 they suffocate, they're a bit weak.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 And so if you are a snake pet owner,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 then you'll open the egg to sort of help them out a bit.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 And for this guy, it really helps them out

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 because he opens the egg, takes a picture, puts it on TikTok,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 and you can see this little snake inside the egg

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 with the perfect pattern.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 I think he live streams the cutting of the egg,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 so you can watch the people tune in.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 It's like it's a kinder egg, you know?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Andy, I don't think you approve of this practice.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 I don't at all.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 It's just interesting, isn't it? People have such fun hobbies.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 It is.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 There's something disgusting about it, and I can't work out what.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 It's like going to Jurassic Park.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 He has this giant warehouse where there's over 2,000 pythons.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 He's constantly, as James says, running around in matching pairs.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Oh, there's a thunderstorm, he's running around getting all the horned dogs.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 He's bringing them all together.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 He says his language because each of these morphs get given their own name.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 And in the interview that James, I think, found this effect from,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 this guy, Kabilka, he says that he was aiming for,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 and then all of that I'm about to say are types of different morphs that he's invented.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 An orange dream, yellow belly, enchi, leopard,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 desert ghost carrying clown jeans.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 So a clown jean, just to give you an idea,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 is a snake that's morphed where it has little tears.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 It comes out of your pocket, but it keeps coming out of your pocket.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Is that it?

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 That's it.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Well, you open an egg and there's like 20 of them inside.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 And I should just say, because Dan alluded to it,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 yeah, this comes from an article in The New Yorker

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 by someone called Rebecca Giggs who wrote it.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 It's a great article and I recommend you look it up.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 Yeah.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 And sorry, just because you jumped in with a brilliant joke.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 No, sorry, I'll do it again.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 No, no, so the clown jean is, he's morphed little tears under the eyes

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 that you might get on a clown.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 So like, it's really specific stuff.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Or a murderer in prison.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 Yes.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Sorry?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Yes.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 You remember your time in the big house?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Yeah.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Those people weren't crying.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Yeah.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 And they weren't clowns.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 It's got that snake that's got thug life across its belly.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 So, pythons in general, have you heard of the Florida Python Challenge?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 No.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 This is a great challenge you can do.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Is it like a cinnamon challenge?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 You don't get to eat them, sadly.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 Basically, Florida is overrun with pythons.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 They arrived, and since they arrived, since 2000, the year 2000,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 90% of furry animals have mysteriously gone missing in Florida.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Oh.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Because the pythons have goled them up.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 It's not mysterious, is it?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 It's not mysterious at all.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 All the biomass that used to be covered in fluff is now Python.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Wow.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 That is the problem.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 And they're now eating each other.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 So the Florida are trying to keep a lid on it.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 They're eating the fluffy animals.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 Don't.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 Don't.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 It's too soon.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 It's too soon.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 It's too soon.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 That is weirdly the most disturbing thing that's happened in this podcast so far.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 But they set up basically this Python challenge,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 and the category is a novice professional and military,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 and the humans, that is.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 And they, you have to, there's a woman called Donna Khalil,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 who I read a great profile of.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 She's 62 years old.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 She won this year for catching 19.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 She rides them.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 She kills them.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 She rides them.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 She rides them to kill them, to catch them and kill them.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Because you have to sort of throw yourself on them, wrestle them.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 And they're massive.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 Oh, because they're so big, sorry.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 They're huge.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 One of them she caught was 18 feet long.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 It's amazing that she over her life has caught and dispatched nearly 900 pythons.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 That is mental.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 It's crazy.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 They are making a difference.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 I think there were 150,000 there, a 99% decrease in wildlife,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 and I think they've euthanized 11,000.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 They say euthanized, so it doesn't sound like that.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 We're just sending people out into the wild to murder them.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 There were 150,000, and now they've got 11,000.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 No, no, no.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 There's still about 149,000.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 They've just caught 11,000.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 That sounds like that problem has been solved.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 I think so.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 There was actually, very sadly, the story I'm about to tell,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 a dog dies in a Chihuahua.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 But this happens in Australia as well.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 There was a story in 2014 where an Australian python

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 managed to make its way into a kennel of a dog, a little Chihuahua.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 And the owners found out that their Chihuahua had been eaten,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 and it couldn't get out because the Chihuahua had been

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 chained inside of the kennel.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 So there was just a python sitting there with a chain

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 coming out of its mouth, and it couldn't get rid of it.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 And it was just like, it was a bit awkward.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Me?

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 Where's the mother going?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 It jumped in there.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 And they had to take it to a vet and remove the chain

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 from the python.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 So it just caught in the act completely.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 I can't believe you just felt the need to give us

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 a trigger warning about a Chihuahua dying.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 I know that is sad, but come on, we've got to grow up a bit,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 haven't we?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 OK.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Thank you for telling me off in front of 1,500 people.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Sorry to Chihuahua fans.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 I've got one where just trigger warning, people might die in this.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 This is...

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 It's going to make our podcast a lot longer.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 This is a snake called the matzakwatl.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 And if you drink a tincture made from its venom,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 according to the Aztecs,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 you will continually have an erect feral member

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 and constantly eject your semen and die of lasciviousness.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Basically, you'll spapp yourself to death.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Really?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 No.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 According to Aztecs.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Continually?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Continually, yeah.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 So you end up just a husk.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 Ironically, like a snake that shed its skin,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 you'll just be like...

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 That is ironic.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 But you've had a damn good time, haven't you?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 All the husks have their thumbs up.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Their thumbs up what?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 I have a very niche fact here

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 that no one except me and my children are going to like,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 but there's a very famous WWF wrestler

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 called Jake the Snake Roberts.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 Any Jake the Snake Roberts fans in?

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 I've had a few, yeah.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Well, all your kids are in today.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 And yeah, so Jake the Snake Roberts,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 he used to come to the ring with a live snake in a bag,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 and his move was, at the end of the match,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 he would reveal the python or viper onto the stage.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 And it was real.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 It bit into wrestlers, and it really harmed a lot of them.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 It was quite a dangerous gimmick.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 Wrestlers, they've traveled for basically the entire year

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 to a new city for every single wrestling recording,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 and this was something he had to lug around America

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 everywhere he was going,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 and he revealed not too long ago

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 that actually he is terrified of snakes.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 His entire career, he's been petrified.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 He wakes up in his hotel room at night going,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 "Fuck, where has it escaped?"

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 And so the thought was,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 because wrestling often, the wrestlers get given the gimmicks,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 and they have to make a career out of it.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Turns out he created his own gimmick,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 and they said, "Why would you do that?"

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 And he said, "I was stoned, and I pitched it."

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 And they went, "Yes, and it's stuck."

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 So his whole career has been in fear, yeah.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 Wow, anyone think these people aren't the smartest tools in the shed?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 Smartest tools in the shed? Sure.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 I don't know if Australia is home to any native species of snake,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 but... No, no.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Exciting news from the UK.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 We've just got a new one.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 The new one is called the Ischelapian, or Ischelapian,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 and it should be too cold for it to live in the UK,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 because it's a bit cold there.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 But it finds warmth in human-built attics and wall cavities.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 Oh, it's a house snake. It sounds like a house snake.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 It's a house snake. Oh, God, yeah.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 And they mostly live in Wales,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 in a place called... Oh, sorry.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 They live in walls in Wales, mostly.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 But there was a scientist from the University of Bournemouth

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 called Tom Major, weirdly,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 who said, "You do get the odd person

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 "who is not a fan of them being here,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 "but generally they are well-received."

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 I call bullshit.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 He said, "If you find one in your attic personally,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 "I would just let it be, as you wouldn't really know it was there."

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 Fair enough. Just move out.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 They're very shy. What was weird about him being called Tom Major?

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 Well, it sounds like Major Tom.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 Oh, I thought you were saying it sounds like former Prime Minister John Major.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 That, too. That, too.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 If the snake was found in space

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 with an astronaut called Tom Major, that would have been...

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 Do you know what snakes do in space? I found out.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 No, go on.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 Oh, my God. Slammed down.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 They don't live there.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 They don't live there. There are no snakes in space native to space,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 but if you put a snake in space,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 they will either...

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 They get a bit confused, as you would,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 but they either attack their own tail,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 thinking it's a rival,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 or they hug themselves, thinking they found a friend.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 How far do you think a snake swallows itself

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 before it realises it's itself?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 And how embarrassing is it when they have to reverse out?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 I saw the Michelin star. I just thought this was a good place to eat.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 So, let's get on to fact number three, and that is Anna.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 My fact this week is that the largest Catholic diocese

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 is Orlando, because it includes the moon.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 But you didn't know that?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 This is based on the Catholic Code of Canon Law, 1917,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 which I know everyone's memorised,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 which says, "Any newly discovered territory

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 is placed under the jurisdiction of the diocese

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 from which the expedition which discovered that territory left."

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 And, of course, in 1969, Apollo 11,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 went from Cape Canaveral, which is in Orlando,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 to the movie theatre where it was faked.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 So, according to some people, landed on the moon,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 and the Bishop of Orlando at the time

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 was a guy called Reverend William Borders,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 who did seem quite endearingly keen to emphasise

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 that he was now Bishop of the moon.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 Yeah, he kept hanging on about it, didn't he?

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 He did, wasn't he? He met the Pope in 1916.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 There was a bit of a joke in 1968, Bishop,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 but he was the founding Bishop of that diocese in 1968.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 That was sort of when it was properly instituted.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Right.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 And there was a bit of joshing when Apollo 11 launched,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 like, "Oh, who's that then?"

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 And he was like, "Oh, it's me. It's very, very funny. Ah-ha-ha."

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 And then he...

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 I don't think you're delivering it as good as...

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 At some point, he met the Pope next year,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 and then he suddenly became deadly serious.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 He said, "Well, of course, the moon is mine, your holiness."

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 He said, "It's Canon Law."

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 I mean, it's a dubious...

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 Apparently, the current Bishop of Orlando

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 is a guy called Bishop John Noonan,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 who does not consider himself the Bishop of the Moon.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Well, that's what his press secretary says,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 and I want to know if she's run it by him.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 When she says, "I'm sure he doesn't consider himself,"

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 I bet he read that news story and went, "Fuck off, mate."

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 Yeah.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Why do you think I took the job?

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 When they had that first discussion,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 there was this guy, Borders, who said that he was the Bishop.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 There was Cardinal Cuck,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 who was the military ordinariate at the Air Force Base.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 So he was, like, the priest at the Air Force Base,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 and he said that he should.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 And then there was the Archbishop of Miami,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 who was Coleman Carroll,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 and he said that he should be the Bishop of the Moon

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 because the moon is always over Miami.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 Oh.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Yes.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 What the fuck is he talking about? No, it's not.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 Sorry.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 This is just...

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 It's just a priest banter.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Oh, no!

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 But what I...

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 But I don't get it.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 I don't get it. It's not always going to Miami.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 No, but it's probably a phrase, Andy.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 I think you're taking it too seriously.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 It's not a phrase. No, I'm with Andy because I googled this.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 I was like, "This must be an in-joke of Miami thing.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 "The moon's always over Miami." No, no.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 What he's saying is, "Oh, yeah, when we look up at night,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 "the moon's always there."

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Has he ever spoken to anyone who doesn't live in Miami?

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 Yeah. That's the joke.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 I see. No, I see. That is a good joke.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 It's priest banter, Andy.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 I don't think I was cut out for the priesthood.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 I just... I wouldn't have fit in.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 It's the actual largest Catholic diocese on Earth,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 would you say?

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 Can you define diocese quickly?

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 Okay, yeah, it's the area that's looked after by a bishop.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 Okay.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 So, for instance, there will be a diocese around Perth,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 perhaps, and it might involve quite a lot of Western Australians.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 They don't need them all over the little villages.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 Something non-very broadly inhabited.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 So, Mongolia would be a good...

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Yeah, that's a good guess.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 It's quite close, actually.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 It is in Erkutsk in Russia.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 And interestingly, if Erkutsk, this Catholic area,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 decided to secede from Russia,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 so it's not part of Russia anymore.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Good luck, guys.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 I think they take quite a debut of that.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 Well, they're busy on the other front, so...

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Okay.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 If the people of Erkutsk, the Catholics of Erkutsk,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 which, admittedly, is only 0.4% of the area,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 but if they decide to secede,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 Russia won't be the biggest country anymore.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 Do you know what would be the biggest country?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 The current and second biggest.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Canada.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 Canada, Canada, Canada.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 No, not Canada.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 It would be the newly seceded area of Erkutsk.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 No.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Because it's more than half of Russia.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 No.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 Is that diocese?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Yeah.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Oh, they've got to do it.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 It would be so funny.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 Now you're liking the Bishop jokes.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 Maybe I would have been good.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 You know the whole thing about moon ownership?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 Uh-huh.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Okay.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 So it's like sometimes you can buy a plot of the moon.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 So all of those things are fake, basically.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 There's a load of jostling at the moment,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 because everyone's kind of agreed

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 that no one actually owns interplanetary bodies.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 But at the moment, the USA, for example,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 is trying to set up a thing called Coordinated Lunar Time

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 as a kind of proto-colonisation,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 like if you control the time,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 it's sort of an acknowledgement that it's kind of yours.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Oh, okay.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 But really, no one owns it.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 And all those things where you buy an acre of the moon

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 are all madey-uppy.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 So Robert Coles was a guy in 1955

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 who sold off huge chunks of the moon.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 The Interplanetary Development Corporation

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 sold it off for a dollar an acre.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 Pretty cheap, if real, which it wasn't.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 But you got the...

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 It was quite good this, though,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 because you got the mineral rights

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 to anything under your acre of moon.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 You also got beach and fishing rights

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 in the Sea of Tranquility.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 See what you did there?

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 Right.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 And you got the right to participate

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 in all winter sports on the lunar Alps.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 Cool.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 Cool.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 I think that was fun.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Apollo 11 is when this bishop

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 was claiming ownership of the moon, right?

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Yeah.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 A lot of the Apollo astronauts

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 were surprisingly religious.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 James Irwin, who was Apollo 15,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 he was a literal creationist.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 He went up to the moon to prove

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 that God created the Earth in seven days.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 And there was a moment when he was up there

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 when a thing happened where

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 a decision needed to be made,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 and he thought, "I could message NASA

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 and say, 'How do I fix this thing?'

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 Or I could just ask God."

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 And so he asked God,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 and God said, "Oh, it's the blue wire."

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Or whatever.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 And he did what God said.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 What?

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 And it worked.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 Yeah.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 So this was on the moon,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 an isolated man with one other human.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 So God basically told him

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 the thing that he got told in his training.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 That's one way of looking at it, absolutely.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 To be fair, the reception to God

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 is much better when you're on the moon, isn't it?

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 Yes.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 You're way closer.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 There's no conflict.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 Exactly.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 But so when he came back to Earth,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 he set up a religious group,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 and his first expedition post-going to the moon

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 was going to Mount Ararat to look for Noah's Ark.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 Did he find it?

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 He thinks that he did find a few bits of...

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 Because you think it would be obvious

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 when you did find Noah's Ark, wouldn't you?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 You'd think so, but it's broken up now.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 It's not giant Ark.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 I think we would have spotted it.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 Yeah, with all the animals,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 or like a pair of animals looking out of each window.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 They'd be dead now.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 But check this out.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 There's this one fascinating story

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 when he was up Mount Ararat looking for it.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 So he was climbing, and he got really tired.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 So he decided, okay, today abandon the trek,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 head back to where our base is,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 and let's recuperate and go tomorrow.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 So while he was walking down on his own,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 he took a pause and he kneeled down

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 to put on some crampons onto his boots,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 and he was struck suddenly from behind

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 by a giant falling rock,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 and it just knocked him down the hill.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 He knocked out five teeth.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 He had deep cuts to his eyes and his nose.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 He sprained his neck and he messed up his ribs.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 So he just camped there for the night.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 Unfortunately, once he had got his sleeping bag

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 out of his bag and got into it,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 he zipped himself up,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 and once he was asleep,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 he slipped down the mountain like a sled

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 and hurt himself all over again

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 when he bashed into multiple boulders.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 So he woke up, lowered down, and it was on a slide.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 And God is like, "This was for bothering me

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 while you were on the moon."

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 So he climbed back up in his sleeping bag,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 and just before he got to the top,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 like a worm, like he went back up,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 and then he slid back down again and crashed.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 What, for fun, sorry?

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 'Cause he was like, "That was a nice green one."

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 Every time he went and got near to the bit that was flat,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 he slid back down.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 It happened three or four times.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 - You got to climb out of the sleeping bag, mate.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 How dumb is this guy? - Yeah.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 He eventually passed out, and he woke up,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 and he was connected to his pillow

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 because there was so much blood that had solidified on it.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 Yeah, he should have died on Mount Ararat.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 It's the most, like, Mr Bean adventure

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 amongst this search.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 But he was a creationist on the moon.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Any idiot can be an astronaut.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 That's what we've learned here.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 I do think it's interesting,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 'cause he must have had a conception of where heaven is

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 and where God lives, and, like, where do you think heaven is?

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 - Up. - It's up.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 It's somewhere vague, right?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 - Opposite of hell. - It's in a parallel universe.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 It's opposite of hell, so I think we often think of it

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 as somewhere a bit different dimensionally.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 But until people like Galileo,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Christians thought there were three heavens.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 The first heaven was bird heaven.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 That's where the birds live. - Oh.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 That's where they're flying around.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 The second heaven is star heaven. - Oh, sorry.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 But does that mean that all the birds are already in heaven?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 They've been very, very good.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 Exciting new theory, yes.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 So bird heaven, and then above that, do you say star heaven?

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Star heaven. And above that is Empyrean heaven,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 and that's where God lives, and that's where you'll go.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 And if you asked a medieval person,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 where would you go when you die, they were very clear.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 They look up where the birds are, they're like,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 and then above that, if I kept going up in a ladder,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 there's stars, and if I kept going up, there's where I'll die.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 And it's such a weird way of conceiving of it, right?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 So when Galileo and Co saw planets and worked out

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 the different things, went around different things,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 that really fucked it up more than we can imagine.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 So just for clarity, were the birds higher than birds actually flew?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 No, they just thought heaven was low.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 They didn't think birds were high, they thought heaven was low.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 But if you climbed a tree, you didn't get into bird heaven.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 You couldn't just say, like, I'm just going to cut my losses,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 I'm going to stay in bird heaven. I know I'm in bird heaven.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 And what about emus? Are they just been really bad?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 Well, the devil's bird, obviously.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 What I'm trying to say is, where is the living birds?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 Are they flying next to the ghost, dead birds?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 No, no, no, no, all the dead things are in the top heaven.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 Just where the birds are, we're like,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 well, that's the first layer of heaven.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 OK, so it's beyond West Africa.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 Just where the bird heaven, as in it's where birds go after they die.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 It's named after the people who live there.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 I got confused about that.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 But that was like, people did hold on to that theory for quite a long time.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 And when the hot air ballooning was invented,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 there was a group called the Muggletonians,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 and they wanted it to be banned,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 because they thought people who hot air ballooned would bump into heaven.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 It's cheating.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 They refused to accept the laws of gravity.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 But your mate should have done that.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 And they believed that God takes no notice of everyday events on Earth

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 and will never intervene in anything.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 I mean, checked out so far. Yeah.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 But that meant that there was no point doing any kind of worship,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 because God clearly isn't listening.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 So let's just not go to church.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 And let's just balloon.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 Well, no, no, you're not allowed to do that.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 Because that's cheating.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 You might be in heaven, everyone you met in heaven,

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 you'd have to say, are you a good guy or just a balloonist?

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 Because God wasn't listening and you weren't worshiping,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 you would have meetings instead and you'd just go to the pub and chat.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 Sounds nice, doesn't it?

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 Describing the modern day.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 Modern secular society, yeah.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 We were talking about a very big Catholic space,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 the big diocese.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 I thought I'd try and find a very small Catholic space.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 Great thinking.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 Thank you.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 So I don't think we've ever talked about priest holes.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 So 16th century, a lot of persecution on both sides.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 So be fair, a bad time to be anybody, the 16th century.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 Anyway, but when Catholicism was illegal in England,

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 if you were caught with a priest, they would be taken away and tortured

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 and executed and you might be as well.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 So lots of houses had these priest holes where you just hide your own priest.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 And there's a place in England called Hindlip Hall,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 which has 12 separate priest holes.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 Some priest holes had their own priest holes.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 Were you hiding a priest from the other priest?

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 It's where you're our only priest.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 It was basically a bluff.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 If they come in and they find your priest hole,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 they're like, "You've got a priest hole."

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 And you'd be like, "Yeah, but there's no priest in it."

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 Then they leave and you open up the second hole.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 You wouldn't put the shitter priest in the second hole.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 You might put the shitter priest in the outer hole.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 I don't think, "Well, if we lose one priest, that's fine."

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 You got it.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 That's it for this household.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 Bye-bye.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 The guy who built these holes,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 he was a Jesuit brother called Nicholas Owen.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 He spent 20 years creating the chambers in various houses,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 hidden walls, hidden compartments, everything.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 He was caught and tortured for it.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 He is now the patron saint of illusionists.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Oh.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 How good is that?

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 That's great.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 It's time to move on to our final fact of the show,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 and that is my fact.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 My fact this week is that the Oscar-winning movie,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 The Summer of '42,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 is the only movie to be based on a novel

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 that was written after the movie was made.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 What?

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 What?

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 Explain.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 I'm not a traveller, everybody.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 That's what I'm talking about.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 No, so this was a big movie in its day.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 It was called Summer of '42,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 and there was a writer called Herman Rorscher

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 who wrote the movie.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 The movie went into production.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 It was being made.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 And then, as often happens,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 novelizations of the movie are written.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 So Herman Rorscher wrote his own novelization

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 of the screenplay.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 They released it prior to the movie coming out,

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 but it became such a massive hit as a book

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 that everyone started going,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 "Oh, my God, they're making a movie of this book,"

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 even though the book was of the movie.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 And then the people within Hollywood went,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 "Well, let's roll with that."

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 So the movie was billed as based on the book,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 Summer of '42 by Herman Rorscher.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 And so it was very confusing

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 because it got nominated for a bunch of Oscars.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 It won an Oscar.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 It was not nominated for best adapted screenplay.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 It was just outright screenplay

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 because they knew inside.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Yeah, so it's one example where the popularity

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 of the second product was so big that it clipped.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 The only example.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 Let's not pretend we get all conjured.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 Yeah, maybe, you're right.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 Pretty amazing.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 Was it 1942?

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 When was it?

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 No, the Summer of '42.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 This was a 1970s movie, in the '70s.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 Yeah, I feel like just to interrupt,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 I feel like Andy might have another example.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 Do you?

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 Step in.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 It's a kind of example of things getting incredibly tangled

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 with the novel-to-movie thing.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 So Bram Stoker's Dracula was turned into a novel

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 after the film came out.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 What?

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 What's it?

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 Yeah, with eight pages of color photos.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 Oh, that's a good idea.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 They said, "Let's do a book of the film of the book."

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 Got it.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 Do you know what I mean?

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 Great expectations.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 That was novelized again.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Like, it's a novel.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 I don't know.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 I found it weird.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 Dumanji, I love this.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 Dumanji was based on a book, right?

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 By Chris Van Alsberg.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 That was turned into a screen story,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 which was turned into a screen play,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 which was turned into a film,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 which was then novelized into a novel.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 So it started as a book.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 It went through the entire sausage machine

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 and ended up being a different book.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 I want to ask you to repeat that,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 but I will just...

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 I'll re-listen when the edit comes out.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 I'm not even following it.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 Mark of confidence.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 I don't want to listen now, but...

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 There was one...

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 So Robert Sheckley, a writer,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 wrote a book called "The Tenth Victim"

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 in 1965.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 And that was a novelization.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 And I think novelizations were slightly more respected than...

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 Because they were newer, basically.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 So people didn't know that they were all going to be shit.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 So it was a novelization of an Italian film,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 by the same name, called "The Tenth Victim",

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 but the film was based on another book by Sheckley,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 called "The Seventh Victim".

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 OK.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 And I don't know more about that, actually.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 There is a movie that was based on a poster.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 As in, the poster came first, and then the movie came out.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 Can we guess it?

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 This poster has done so well.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 Yes, I think you can guess it, actually.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 Oh, my God! The scream.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 Oh, my God! Dan!

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 I said "Oh, my God" first, which is the equivalent of buzzing in.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 Sorry.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 And I believe the first person to say,

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 "Oh, my God" was Anna Tyshinski.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 Uh, is it scream?

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 No.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 For fuck's sake, Dan, what a stupid Tyshinski!

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 I reckon the audience might get it.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 It's a very iconic poster.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 A work of art.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 Star Wars, no.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 Snake's on a train, no.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 Shrek, Shrek 3, though.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 Shrek's based on a book, actually.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 Is it?

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 Yeah.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 Jaws?

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 No, the answer is "The Usual Suspects".

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Oh!

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 And apparently, a reporter at the Sundance Film Festival

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 asked the guy, McQuarrie, who was making it,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 he said, "What's your next movie?"

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 And he had this idea of these people lined up,

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 and he said, "Oh, I guess it's about a bunch of criminals

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 who met at a police line-up or something."

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 Right.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 And then, because he had the idea of the image first,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 and then he thought,

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 "Well, how are we going to turn this into a movie?"

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 Yeah, right.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 Oh, cool.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 I've never heard of this example I'm going to mention.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 So, when we just said to the audience name,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 someone said, "Star Wars" out there, right?

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 Okay, so, when a new hope came out,

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 there was so much money that was behind that first movie,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 and they were hoping that George Lucas

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 was going to write the second movie,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 which became "Empire Strike Back", right?

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 So, the novelization of a new hope was written in 1976

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 by a guy called Alan Dean Foster,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 and he was contracted to do two books,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 in case the first movie bombed

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 and they couldn't produce George Lucas' next movie.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 So, Alan Dean Foster, the novelization guy,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 write a sequel using all the props that we used in the first movie

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 so that we can make your novelization

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 instead of George Lucas' idea for "Empire Strike Back".

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 Wait, I don't understand.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 What, in case George Lucas' didn't work?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 Because they could save the money,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 because they already have the props.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 Exactly.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 So, if it didn't work, if that first movie didn't work,

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 we were going to get a second movie

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 called "Splinter of the Mind's Eye",

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 and it was published before "Empire Strike Back" came out,

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 and it has a completely different plot.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 It's based on a jungle planet.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 Han Solo and Chewbacca are not in it,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 because Harrison Ford hadn't signed up for the second movie yet,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 so they didn't want to include him.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 But no one had told Alan Dean Foster at this point

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 that Leia and Luke were brother and sister.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 Oh, no.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 Spoilers down, sorry.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 Sorry.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 So, the whole book is sexual tension between brother and sister.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 I've got some extracts.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 Luke felt the warmth of the body next to him,

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 framed in the light from above.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 The princess looked more radiant than ever.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 Leia, he began, "I" and then pulls out,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 but not pulls out in that respect.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 Damn.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 Oh, for sure.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 Come on.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 The princess grew aware of how tightly she was clinging to him.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 The proximity engendered a wash of confused emotion.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 It would be proper to disengage,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 to move away a little proper,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 but not nearly so satisfying.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 And then "Empire Strike Back" came out,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 and Alan Dean Foster was like, "What the fuck, George?"

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 "I've written an incest novel."

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 He is amazing, Alan Dean Foster.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 But with Star Wars, they refused to show him what anything looked like.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 They refused to even tell him what anything was really.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 So, he had to write the character Jabba the Hutt,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 without knowing whether he was a human or a massive slug.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 And so, he just fudges it in the text.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 And this happened with, like, he did the novel of the film Alien,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 and again, they refused to send him any pictures of the alien,

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 because they were keeping it under wraps.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 So, he just had to kind of guess.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Jabba the Hutt is just a combination of a human and a massive slug, right?

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 Oh, Anna.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 No, he's a massive slug.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 Oh, right, but with a human face.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 No, he doesn't have a cute face.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 He doesn't have a slug's face, I'll say that.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 Maybe I know some weird-looking people.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 Oh, OK, sorry, he's just a slug, got it.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 He's not a slug, he's a sort of space.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 He's like a space slug.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 But he has done absolutely everything, Alan Dean Foster.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 He's done Star Trek, he's done Transformers, Terminator.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 His first job was for an Italian Lady Tarzan movie, right?

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:11.040
 Which was in Italian no subtitles available so he had to completely like guess what was happening

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:25.280
 But he did exactly what your guy did James he put based it on some production paintings

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:29.440
 Oh, yeah turned that into the novel and when the book came out somewhere from Disney said we love this book

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:33.680
 Can we turn it into a film and he said no, it's a film already. It's an Italian lady Tarzan for a

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:36.560
 I didn't know that Star Wars left the EU. Sorry

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:44.480
 This is actually this is like being within the bubble. So every single listener to this podcast will know this except me until yesterday

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.520
 But the EU of course is

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.120
 The expanded universe, which I didn't know that that was

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:59.280
 What are you talking about? You know the expanded universe of any film is the it's when you do a video game or you do a novel

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.040
 It's the expanded non-canon movie, but it's still canon

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.200
 So oh like the spin-off novels and all that other shit

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.960
 And the phrase expanded universe was invented for Star Wars

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:18.080
 And it left the EU in 2012 and I just think it's very interesting that Star Wars is now divided into sort of two different quantum realities

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.960
 Because what do you mean it left the EU? Well, I mean that

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:28.560
 George Lucas made three more films. Yes, they are mostly about trade negotiations actually. So it's kind of perfect that this is the

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.440
 Boris Johnson

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.720
 I'm a giant slug. What are you talking about?

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.600
 We're the human face

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:44.720
 And it was incredibly controversial among Star Wars fans because

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:50.880
 People had been told when the first three Star Wars films came out that the only subsequent films would be prequels

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.360
 Which they were right the next three were prequels

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:59.200
 So everyone who was writing in the expanded universe novels and comic books and stuff like that were writing sequels

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.800
 Stuff that happens after the first three films then of course

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:08.560
 Disney took over 2012 and released the next three which correct me if I'm wrong are sequels, right?

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:13.600
 They happen the events happen after so that completely fucked with the Star Wars universe

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:19.360
 And so they split into two universes now. They've left the EU in 2011 the distributor of the film drive

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.880
 You know the film drive. Yeah, Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling, right?

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:27.840
 It was sued by a woman from michigan called Sarah Deming for saying it didn't contain enough driving

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.800
 [Laughter]

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:37.920
 He's saying it bore very little similarity to a chase or race action film having very little driving in the motion picture

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:42.000
 Is he in the car the whole time? He's in the car a lot of the time, but it's more in the first half

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.600
 The second half is a bit more depressing and a bit less driving based. Oh, I sort of got pretty good

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:51.360
 How much did she sue for? Oh, probably some standard american amount like five zillion dollars. Anyway, I don't think she won

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:55.120
 It was unsuccessful, but you can sue based on trailers, can't you?

00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.160
 Can you? There was that film yesterday, which was a Richard Curtis film about one of the Beatles never existed

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:04.640
 But only one guy remembered them. Yeah, that was sued by a couple of fans

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.080
 Um

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:11.840
 Because the trailer had featured Anna de Amas who's a famous actress and then she wasn't in the final film

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:19.040
 And they had paid $3.99 each to watch this film on amazon prime. So naturally they sued for five million dollars

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.680
 Wow

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.480
 I think she is in the final film. Well, I think she's

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.800
 I think she's in on the chat show bit drastically cut because she wasn't much bigger part of it

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.160
 Because she was basically cut from the final film. It's like she never existed

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:37.280
 And these two losers are the only people who remember her which is the plot of the film. Oh my god. Yes

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:48.640
 That is it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening Perth. You were awesome

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.040
 We will be back again

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:55.360
 And until then tune in next week for another episode. We'll see you then. Goodbye

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.360
 Bye

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.360
 You

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.360
 You

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.360
 You

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.940
 (upbeat music)
