00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Perth.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Right in the dark, I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 and James Harkin, and once again, we have gather ground on microphones

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 And in a particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 What are they putting the water here?

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 My fact is that if you run a restaurant,

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 one of the best ways to sabotage a rival is to get them a Michelin star.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 It's the kiss of death.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 It's the kiss of death for a restaurant.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 This is so cool.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 So this was a study that was published in the Strategic Management Journal.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Basically, the author tracked down restaurants that had been awarded a Michelin star recently

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 and found that they are likely to close over the following however long it is.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Let's say a year.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Do we know why?

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Yes, we do.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 You become famous for a start.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Oh yeah, that's terrible.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Your customers change.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 People start coming from hundreds of miles away because you've got a Michelin star, you know.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 They get more demanding.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 You match their demands, you do fancier food, costs rise.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Chefs want their salaries to go up.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 They're likely to leave because they've got the golden aura about them now.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 The whole thing is a disaster, and you're likely to end up shutting down.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 It's like a resource curse, basically.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Yeah.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 So yeah, and it happens.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And then once you've got one or two, everyone chases the third,

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 and that's when it gets really dangerous because it gets incredibly expensive.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 So restaurant owners have started rejecting them, saying we don't need this in our life.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 We don't need to be seen as good.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 We're fine.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Well, they're not allowed.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Well, they officially weren't allowed to, were they, until quite recently?

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 You can't reject a Michelin star?

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Well, I think what Michelin said for a long time, because Marco Pierre White,

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I think was the first person in the '90s to say this is bullshit.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Can't take the pressure.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Take it back.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And they were like, it's not yours, it's the restaurants, mate.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 You can't give it back.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 But I think they did make an exception.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Finally, there's a guy called Sebastian Bra, who ran Le Souquet,

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 and he just hated having a Michelin star so much that eventually Michelin said,

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 "It is difficult for us to have a restaurant in the guide which desperately does not wish to be in it."

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 So they did agree to remove it for the first time.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 But it is the pressure, isn't it?

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And the fact that you don't know, and I didn't realise this, but you don't know why you've got it.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 You don't know it's coming, and when it appears in the guide,

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 there's not like someone right through a view explaining here are the elements of your dishes that we enjoyed.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And as you say, you overturn your menu.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 So it could be that the reason you got it was for that amazing slice of white bread as you enter.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And once you ditch that from the menu straight away, you're nothing again.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 That's the thing.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 You don't know that someone is in your restaurant judging you for the Michelin star.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 But not only that, people who work at Michelin don't know who those people are as well.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 The top level, they have no idea, right?

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Yes, you get hired. Someone within the company obviously brings you in to do it.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And you're out on the road for so many weeks per year.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I used to work as a secret restaurant person.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Out. You were a Michelin star?

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I'm allowed to talk about it now because it's been so long.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 But for quite a long time, you're not allowed to say anything because...

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Are you serious?

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Well, I'm half serious.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 What?

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Yeah, the start of it was serious, and then it went into whimsy quite quickly.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 You used to work?

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I did use to work as a person who went round restaurants, sort of, seeing how good they were.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 For Michelin?

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 No, for Michelin. No, for just some company in Bolton.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 The Michelin of Bolton. What were they called?

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I can't say.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 James, we'll have to wipe all of your memories on the way out now.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Can I just say, I like some of the amazing things that they have on the menus.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 So, Muggeritz in San Sebastian in Spain has edible stones sitting atop an edible mould.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Wow.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Does that sound nice?

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 No, it doesn't.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 OK, well, Quince in San Francisco, they have a meal which is served on an iPad.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 It's a truffle meal, and then it comes on the iPad,

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 and then there's some beautiful sort of stuff on the iPad that you can press and stuff like that.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Is it wet?

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Like a little wet meal on the iPad.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I suppose it's a little bit moist, but not wet enough.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 These days, you know, iPads and iPhones are quite waterproof, aren't they?

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Where do they put a cork up the...

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Excuse me?

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 The entry port.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 The port.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Maybe they put it in plastic, I'm not quite sure.

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Has he had that, James?

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 No, I haven't had any of these. These are old places I want to go to.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 So, Brose in Lecce in Italy, they serve a ricotta foam served in a plastic cast of the chef's mouth.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Wow.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 OK.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Now, you have... Have you read the review of Brose,

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 which is the greatest thing you'll ever read,

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 and it is on a blog called everywhereist.com,

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 and it does talk about Brose.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 It's 27 courses, lasts almost five hours,

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 and basically you don't get any food, seemed to be the conclusion.

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Because actually the chef's mouth is closed when it gives a new...

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 The mouth just eats the meal before you can get to it.

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 So they serve things like frozen air that's suddenly melted before they could eat it.

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Nothing is bigger than a tiny, tiny teaspoon.

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 There was one moment in like course 19 where one of the women said,

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 "She got excited because they put a little drop of sauce on the plate."

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And then she thought, "Oh, they'll put a piece of meat on top."

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And then the waiter comes by with an eye dropper

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 and squeezes a droplet on top of it and says,

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 "We've infused these droplets with meat molecules."

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Is this a positive review?

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 It's unbelievably negative.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 So much so that the owner of the restaurant actually replied,

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 and you know on TripAdvisor, sometimes someone leaves a bad review

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 and the restaurant owner replies underneath and you think,

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 "Don't get involved, mate. What are you doing?"

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 And this guy replied with a drawing of a horse underneath which he said,

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 "This is a drawing of a horse. It doesn't make me an artist."

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And it went on and on into more and more beautiful analogies.

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 What is art? What is food? What is a chef? What looks beautiful?

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Someone who owns a restaurant shouldn't be asking, "What is a chef?"

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 I think a lot of people agreed.

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 That was probably quite good for their business.

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Bad reviews can be quite good.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Because if you see a restaurant on Google or whatever and it's got five stars,

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 you do suspect, don't you?

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 What do you suspect?

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 What do I suspect?

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 What's a lie? It's a fake.

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 It's all the restaurant owner's friends, you know.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 It's just nonsense.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Oh, really?

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 If you see a 4.2, you think that's my level.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I don't deserve better, nor do I want better than 4.2.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 In fact, Ash, Soundy, his favourite rating, he was telling me the other day, is 3.7.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Ash, that is our...

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 He craves the 3.7.

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Michelin, by the way, had three star ratings that you could get right.

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 So one meant it was worth a stop if it was one star Michelin.

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Two was it was worth a detour.

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 So if you saw that on the way, let's go out of our way.

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And then three is worth a journey in order to get to it.

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 But they've changed that in recent years where you can get Michelin sort of labels to attach to yourself.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 OK.

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 One of which is for restaurants that are deemed not good enough,

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 not good enough for a Michelin star, but still worth eating at.

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Just 3.6.

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Yeah, 3.6, exactly.

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Yeah, they do other things now for sustainability, for how green the produce and all that stuff is.

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 So there's multiple Michelin levels now.

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 That thing you're saying about them being worth a journey, worth a detour, blah, blah, blah.

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 That's all from the very early days, which I think we mentioned in the past,

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 which is where it was all set up basically by Michelin who make tyres to sell more tyres.

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 What if we just send people around France on road trips for food?

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 They'll wear out their tyres, they'll buy more tyres.

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 The whole thing mushroomed down.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 It's a tyre selling enterprise that has got way out of hand, basically.

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 But they contributed, I love this, to D-Day Michelin

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 because the Allied officers who landed on the beaches at Normandy in 1944

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 were all carrying the 1939 Michelin Guide to France in their pockets.

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Really?

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Because they had incredible maps of France.

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 There were no, you know, there were no co-operates of guides.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Really?

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I think they had removed the restaurants.

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 I think they might have slightly adjusted it.

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Surely you tear the page out.

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 They held up in Northern Normandy for a few days

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 because there's a really brilliant Moule restaurant.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 You've got to get everyone through it.

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 You have to try this, Barry, you have to.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Do you know, behind us on the screen for the audience to see here,

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 we've got a logo of the Michelin Man, a very famous character.

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Incredible how big and rich the history of the Michelin Man is.

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 It was voted the greatest logo of all time by 22 designers

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 as part of advertising logos.

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 He was known as the road drunkard to begin with.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And his name is a translation of "drinking to be done".

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Sorry, Michelin Man?

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 No, his name is "bibendum".

189
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Exactly, it was a Latin name.

190
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Sorry, yeah, in his French name, and Latin name rather.

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And so he became massive, but the question that I never thought to ask is,

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 "Tires obviously are black, why is he white?"

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And the answer is that tires used to be white.

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Yeah.

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 So he predates black tires.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Like this is how old this logo is, yeah.

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And he's looking good for his age.

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And he's called the drinking stuff up because that's what these tires can do.

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 They drink up the road, that's the idea.

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 By drinking, I think it is a gerund, "bibendum".

201
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 They still get their money off tires because they make a huge loss on their guides.

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 They don't make any money from them

203
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 because they have to spend so much freaking money on five-star meals.

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 So there was even, I was listening to an interview with their head chef at Alinea in Chicago.

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 I mean, foodies will be cringing my pronunciation probably,

206
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 it's a very good restaurant in Chicago.

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 And they said the amount that they spent sending Michelin judges to that restaurant alone

208
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 was much more than the total profit from all the guide selling in Chicago.

209
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Amazing.

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Amazing.

211
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 It's not a money maker.

212
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I thought I'd look at some Australian fine dining.

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Oh, really?

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 As soon as we're here, yeah.

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 And then when you couldn't find any, you went for France.

216
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 There is a vegan restaurant in Canberra that was fined $16,000

217
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 because they had a cockroach infestation

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 and they didn't want to kill them because they didn't want to kill any little insects.

219
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Oh, really?

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Apparently they had a real problem with German cockroaches

221
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 and a single female German cockroach can give off 100,000 offspring in a month.

222
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Wow.

223
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 That, so I, there was a news story that came out, I think it was in July of this year or something,

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 German cockroaches.

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 So that's the cockroach that is everywhere in houses and in restaurants and so on.

226
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 In Germany.

227
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Well, here's the amazing thing.

228
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 For 250 years, it's been a mystery as to where they come from

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 and a scientist in Perth, as part of the university here,

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 has discovered German cockroaches aren't actually from Germany.

231
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 No.

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Huge discovery, huge finding.

233
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Do we know where, are they from Austria?

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Because that's kind of Germany.

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 It's kind of Germany.

236
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Wow.

237
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 No, it's the Bay.

238
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 I missed it in 1938.

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 They did DNA testing on it and it's from the Bay of Bengal in India.

240
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Oh, really?

241
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Yes, they traced it and they mapped out this whole journey.

242
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 It would have had to get on a boat and travel over and they worked out all that stuff.

243
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 But they don't appear in the wild.

244
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 All the cockroaches that we have appear.

245
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 They only appear in five-star restaurants.

246
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Yes, they're Michelin star roaches.

247
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Yeah.

248
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 No, you will never find them in the wild.

249
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 It's purely on our houses and restaurants and shops and so on.

250
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Wow.

251
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 They're all restaurants, isn't it?

252
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Yeah.

253
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 The first Australian cookbook was written by Edward Abbott.

254
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 It's very Australian, I have to say.

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 This guy once assaulted the Prime Minister of Australia with an umbrella.

256
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 The book has recipes for roast wombat and kangaroo brains.

257
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 And at one stage there's advice of what to do if you're having a conversation

258
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 and a drunk person interrupts you.

259
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 What's the advice?

260
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 I didn't write it down.

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Ah!

262
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 At one stage it says we advise ugly people not to go to parties.

263
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 OK.

264
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 And men who aren't that handsome may at least endeavour to not appear uglier

265
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 than they can help.

266
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Good advice.

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 It is time for fact number two and that is James.

268
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 OK, my fact this week is that in America you can buy designer snakes

269
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 with emojis on them.

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Look at that, isn't that cute?

271
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 We have a picture behind us.

272
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 It's not cute.

273
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 You can't even see its head.

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Something can't be cute if you can't see its head.

275
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 It actually looks more...

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 It looks more jack-o'-lantern.

277
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 It looks like a Halloween snake, doesn't it?

278
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Yeah.

279
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Well, in fairness, this is nature doing this.

280
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 It's not a computer.

281
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 So, you know, you have to take what you get.

282
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Right.

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Really.

284
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 But this is a few people in America, in particular someone called Justin Kabilka.

285
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Justin Kabilka has been breeding these bull pythons for quite a long time

286
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 and one of the times the egg hatched and what should come out

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 but this snake patterned with these orange faces on its body

288
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 and he could sell it and he makes lots of other snakes.

289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 You can get ones with two heads.

290
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 You can get ones which feel like human skin when you touch them.

291
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Horrible.

292
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 No, you're not fancy that perp.

293
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 They're amazing.

294
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 They do feel quite nice.

295
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Yeah, everyone thinks they're going to be slimy, but they're not actually.

296
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 They're not slimy at all. They're nice and smooth.

297
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 But I think if you touch the snake and it felt like a human,

298
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 it would be worse with it.

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Yeah.

300
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Do we have a snake yet?

301
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Because you know they shed their skin all the time.

302
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Oh, yeah.

303
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Do we have one that's like a past the parcel where it's a new design under each shed?

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 That's a good idea.

305
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Yeah.

306
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 I bet they're working on it.

307
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 That'd be cool.

308
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 So, these are, like I say, they're bull pythons

309
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 and we think probably because they evolved below ground,

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 they kept a lot of mutations which allowed them to change their colours

311
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 because they wouldn't have so many predators under there.

312
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 So, normally if you're living on the surface,

313
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 you either have lots of colours to scare people off

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 or more commonly you blend into the background

315
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 because they're underground, they have all these extra little genes.

316
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Right.

317
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 What's amazing?

318
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 So, this is like, I'd never heard of this before, James,

319
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 before you telling us this.

320
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 And this is, there's a huge market for this.

321
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And these snakes go for such a huge amount of money

322
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 because they may give birth to snakes

323
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 and then you have further designer snakes, right?

324
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 So, it's like...

325
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 So, it's like he's made them, right, just to be clear.

326
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 It's not like he's sitting there randomly hoping.

327
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Like, he literally chooses two snakes to breed.

328
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 So, he'll say, "I have a design in mind.

329
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 I'm seeing a picture of the Eiffel Tower."

330
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 And then two years later, he'll have a snake with the Eiffel Tower on it

331
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 because he makes them have sense of it.

332
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Well, he has one that looks like Stonehenge

333
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 and it mates with one that looks like Big Ben

334
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 and eventually it comes...

335
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 He does it, he'll put them in a room, get some Barrywide on,

336
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 just put a nice little spread out and just watch them go.

337
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Actually, one thing that happens is these snakes,

338
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 whenever there's a thunderstorm, they all get really horny.

339
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And if there's one, if he's not expecting a thunderstorm

340
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 and suddenly here's a bit of a rumble,

341
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 he has to go, "Shit!"

342
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 And he has to run in and get all the snakes

343
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 that he wants to have sex with each other

344
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 and put them next to each other so that they'll have sex.

345
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Wow, that's amazing.

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Also, he does basically reveals.

347
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 So what they call this, they're called morphs.

348
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 When he's got a new design that he's invented and he drops.

349
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 It's like he's a TikTok musician or Beyonce.

350
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 He just drops the latest snake

351
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 and then you've got to get in quick and buy it as quick as possible, right?

352
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 So people monitor his site and his place for the next drop.

353
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And you get a preview, don't you?

354
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And this is the sort of thing, you have this weird thing

355
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 when you do our job where you start researching

356
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 and because everyone in the field knows about it,

357
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 you think, "Does the whole world know about this?"

358
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 So the story of the whole world knows about this,

359
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 but Python breeders, anyone who owns a Python

360
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 tends to cut their eggs open before they hatch.

361
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 And it's so weird.

362
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 I think everyone in this room knew that.

363
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Everyone knew that, right?

364
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 So often in the wild, they don't survive.

365
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 So quite a lot of the time,

366
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Python's egg teeth, the tooth they have to crack themselves out of the egg,

367
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 doesn't work properly, they can't break themselves out,

368
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 they suffocate, they're a bit weak.

369
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And so if you are a snake pet owner,

370
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 then you'll open the egg to sort of help them out a bit.

371
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And for this guy, it really helps them out

372
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 because he opens the egg, takes a picture, puts it on TikTok,

373
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 and you can see this little snake inside the egg

374
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 with the perfect pattern.

375
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 I think he live streams the cutting of the egg,

376
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 so you can watch the people tune in.

377
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 It's like it's a kinder egg, you know?

378
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Andy, I don't think you approve of this practice.

379
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 I don't at all.

380
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 It's just interesting, isn't it? People have such fun hobbies.

381
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 It is.

382
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 There's something disgusting about it, and I can't work out what.

383
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 It's like going to Jurassic Park.

384
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 He has this giant warehouse where there's over 2,000 pythons.

385
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 He's constantly, as James says, running around in matching pairs.

386
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Oh, there's a thunderstorm, he's running around getting all the horned dogs.

387
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 He's bringing them all together.

388
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 He says his language because each of these morphs get given their own name.

389
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And in the interview that James, I think, found this effect from,

390
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 this guy, Kabilka, he says that he was aiming for,

391
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 and then all of that I'm about to say are types of different morphs that he's invented.

392
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 An orange dream, yellow belly, enchi, leopard,

393
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 desert ghost carrying clown jeans.

394
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 So a clown jean, just to give you an idea,

395
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 is a snake that's morphed where it has little tears.

396
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 It comes out of your pocket, but it keeps coming out of your pocket.

397
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Is that it?

398
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 That's it.

399
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Well, you open an egg and there's like 20 of them inside.

400
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 And I should just say, because Dan alluded to it,

401
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 yeah, this comes from an article in The New Yorker

402
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 by someone called Rebecca Giggs who wrote it.

403
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 It's a great article and I recommend you look it up.

404
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Yeah.

405
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And sorry, just because you jumped in with a brilliant joke.

406
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 No, sorry, I'll do it again.

407
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 No, no, so the clown jean is, he's morphed little tears under the eyes

408
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 that you might get on a clown.

409
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 So like, it's really specific stuff.

410
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Or a murderer in prison.

411
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Yes.

412
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Sorry?

413
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Yes.

414
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 You remember your time in the big house?

415
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Yeah.

416
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Those people weren't crying.

417
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Yeah.

418
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And they weren't clowns.

419
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 It's got that snake that's got thug life across its belly.

420
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 So, pythons in general, have you heard of the Florida Python Challenge?

421
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 No.

422
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 This is a great challenge you can do.

423
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Is it like a cinnamon challenge?

424
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 You don't get to eat them, sadly.

425
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Basically, Florida is overrun with pythons.

426
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 They arrived, and since they arrived, since 2000, the year 2000,

427
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 90% of furry animals have mysteriously gone missing in Florida.

428
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Oh.

429
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Because the pythons have goled them up.

430
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It's not mysterious, is it?

431
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 It's not mysterious at all.

432
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 All the biomass that used to be covered in fluff is now Python.

433
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Wow.

434
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 That is the problem.

435
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 And they're now eating each other.

436
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 So the Florida are trying to keep a lid on it.

437
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 They're eating the fluffy animals.

438
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Don't.

439
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Don't.

440
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 It's too soon.

441
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 It's too soon.

442
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 It's too soon.

443
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 That is weirdly the most disturbing thing that's happened in this podcast so far.

444
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 But they set up basically this Python challenge,

445
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 and the category is a novice professional and military,

446
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 and the humans, that is.

447
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And they, you have to, there's a woman called Donna Khalil,

448
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 who I read a great profile of.

449
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 She's 62 years old.

450
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 She won this year for catching 19.

451
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 She rides them.

452
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 She kills them.

453
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 She rides them.

454
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 She rides them to kill them, to catch them and kill them.

455
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Because you have to sort of throw yourself on them, wrestle them.

456
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And they're massive.

457
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Oh, because they're so big, sorry.

458
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 They're huge.

459
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 One of them she caught was 18 feet long.

460
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 It's amazing that she over her life has caught and dispatched nearly 900 pythons.

461
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 That is mental.

462
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 It's crazy.

463
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 They are making a difference.

464
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 I think there were 150,000 there, a 99% decrease in wildlife,

465
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 and I think they've euthanized 11,000.

466
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 They say euthanized, so it doesn't sound like that.

467
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 We're just sending people out into the wild to murder them.

468
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 There were 150,000, and now they've got 11,000.

469
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 No, no, no.

470
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 There's still about 149,000.

471
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 They've just caught 11,000.

472
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 That sounds like that problem has been solved.

473
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 I think so.

474
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 There was actually, very sadly, the story I'm about to tell,

475
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 a dog dies in a Chihuahua.

476
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 But this happens in Australia as well.

477
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 There was a story in 2014 where an Australian python

478
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 managed to make its way into a kennel of a dog, a little Chihuahua.

479
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And the owners found out that their Chihuahua had been eaten,

480
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 and it couldn't get out because the Chihuahua had been

481
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 chained inside of the kennel.

482
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 So there was just a python sitting there with a chain

483
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 coming out of its mouth, and it couldn't get rid of it.

484
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And it was just like, it was a bit awkward.

485
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Me?

486
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Where's the mother going?

487
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It jumped in there.

488
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 And they had to take it to a vet and remove the chain

489
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 from the python.

490
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 So it just caught in the act completely.

491
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I can't believe you just felt the need to give us

492
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 a trigger warning about a Chihuahua dying.

493
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 I know that is sad, but come on, we've got to grow up a bit,

494
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 haven't we?

495
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 OK.

496
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Thank you for telling me off in front of 1,500 people.

497
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Sorry to Chihuahua fans.

498
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 I've got one where just trigger warning, people might die in this.

499
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 This is...

500
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 It's going to make our podcast a lot longer.

501
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 This is a snake called the matzakwatl.

502
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And if you drink a tincture made from its venom,

503
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 according to the Aztecs,

504
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 you will continually have an erect feral member

505
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 and constantly eject your semen and die of lasciviousness.

506
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Basically, you'll spapp yourself to death.

507
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Really?

508
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 No.

509
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 According to Aztecs.

510
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Continually?

511
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Continually, yeah.

512
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 So you end up just a husk.

513
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Ironically, like a snake that shed its skin,

514
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 you'll just be like...

515
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 That is ironic.

516
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 But you've had a damn good time, haven't you?

517
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 All the husks have their thumbs up.

518
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Their thumbs up what?

519
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I have a very niche fact here

520
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 that no one except me and my children are going to like,

521
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 but there's a very famous WWF wrestler

522
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 called Jake the Snake Roberts.

523
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Any Jake the Snake Roberts fans in?

524
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 I've had a few, yeah.

525
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Well, all your kids are in today.

526
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And yeah, so Jake the Snake Roberts,

527
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 he used to come to the ring with a live snake in a bag,

528
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 and his move was, at the end of the match,

529
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 he would reveal the python or viper onto the stage.

530
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 And it was real.

531
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 It bit into wrestlers, and it really harmed a lot of them.

532
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 It was quite a dangerous gimmick.

533
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Wrestlers, they've traveled for basically the entire year

534
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 to a new city for every single wrestling recording,

535
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 and this was something he had to lug around America

536
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 everywhere he was going,

537
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 and he revealed not too long ago

538
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 that actually he is terrified of snakes.

539
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 His entire career, he's been petrified.

540
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 He wakes up in his hotel room at night going,

541
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 "Fuck, where has it escaped?"

542
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And so the thought was,

543
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 because wrestling often, the wrestlers get given the gimmicks,

544
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 and they have to make a career out of it.

545
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Turns out he created his own gimmick,

546
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 and they said, "Why would you do that?"

547
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And he said, "I was stoned, and I pitched it."

548
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And they went, "Yes, and it's stuck."

549
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 So his whole career has been in fear, yeah.

550
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Wow, anyone think these people aren't the smartest tools in the shed?

551
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Smartest tools in the shed? Sure.

552
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 I don't know if Australia is home to any native species of snake,

553
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 but... No, no.

554
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Exciting news from the UK.

555
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 We've just got a new one.

556
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 The new one is called the Ischelapian, or Ischelapian,

557
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 and it should be too cold for it to live in the UK,

558
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 because it's a bit cold there.

559
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 But it finds warmth in human-built attics and wall cavities.

560
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Oh, it's a house snake. It sounds like a house snake.

561
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 It's a house snake. Oh, God, yeah.

562
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And they mostly live in Wales,

563
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 in a place called... Oh, sorry.

564
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 They live in walls in Wales, mostly.

565
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 But there was a scientist from the University of Bournemouth

566
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 called Tom Major, weirdly,

567
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 who said, "You do get the odd person

568
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 "who is not a fan of them being here,

569
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 "but generally they are well-received."

570
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 I call bullshit.

571
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 He said, "If you find one in your attic personally,

572
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 "I would just let it be, as you wouldn't really know it was there."

573
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Fair enough. Just move out.

574
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 They're very shy. What was weird about him being called Tom Major?

575
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Well, it sounds like Major Tom.

576
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Oh, I thought you were saying it sounds like former Prime Minister John Major.

577
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 That, too. That, too.

578
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 If the snake was found in space

579
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 with an astronaut called Tom Major, that would have been...

580
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Do you know what snakes do in space? I found out.

581
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 No, go on.

582
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Oh, my God. Slammed down.

583
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 They don't live there.

584
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 They don't live there. There are no snakes in space native to space,

585
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 but if you put a snake in space,

586
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 they will either...

587
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 They get a bit confused, as you would,

588
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 but they either attack their own tail,

589
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 thinking it's a rival,

590
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 or they hug themselves, thinking they found a friend.

591
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 How far do you think a snake swallows itself

592
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 before it realises it's itself?

593
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 And how embarrassing is it when they have to reverse out?

594
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 I saw the Michelin star. I just thought this was a good place to eat.

595
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 So, let's get on to fact number three, and that is Anna.

596
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 My fact this week is that the largest Catholic diocese

597
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 is Orlando, because it includes the moon.

598
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 But you didn't know that?

599
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 This is based on the Catholic Code of Canon Law, 1917,

600
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 which I know everyone's memorised,

601
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 which says, "Any newly discovered territory

602
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 is placed under the jurisdiction of the diocese

603
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 from which the expedition which discovered that territory left."

604
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 And, of course, in 1969, Apollo 11,

605
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 went from Cape Canaveral, which is in Orlando,

606
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 to the movie theatre where it was faked.

607
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 So, according to some people, landed on the moon,

608
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 and the Bishop of Orlando at the time

609
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 was a guy called Reverend William Borders,

610
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 who did seem quite endearingly keen to emphasise

611
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 that he was now Bishop of the moon.

612
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Yeah, he kept hanging on about it, didn't he?

613
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 He did, wasn't he? He met the Pope in 1916.

614
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 There was a bit of a joke in 1968, Bishop,

615
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 but he was the founding Bishop of that diocese in 1968.

616
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 That was sort of when it was properly instituted.

617
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Right.

618
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And there was a bit of joshing when Apollo 11 launched,

619
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 like, "Oh, who's that then?"

620
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 And he was like, "Oh, it's me. It's very, very funny. Ah-ha-ha."

621
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And then he...

622
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 I don't think you're delivering it as good as...

623
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 At some point, he met the Pope next year,

624
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 and then he suddenly became deadly serious.

625
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 He said, "Well, of course, the moon is mine, your holiness."

626
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 He said, "It's Canon Law."

627
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 I mean, it's a dubious...

628
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Apparently, the current Bishop of Orlando

629
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 is a guy called Bishop John Noonan,

630
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 who does not consider himself the Bishop of the Moon.

631
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Well, that's what his press secretary says,

632
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 and I want to know if she's run it by him.

633
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 When she says, "I'm sure he doesn't consider himself,"

634
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 I bet he read that news story and went, "Fuck off, mate."

635
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Yeah.

636
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Why do you think I took the job?

637
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 When they had that first discussion,

638
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 there was this guy, Borders, who said that he was the Bishop.

639
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 There was Cardinal Cuck,

640
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 who was the military ordinariate at the Air Force Base.

641
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 So he was, like, the priest at the Air Force Base,

642
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 and he said that he should.

643
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 And then there was the Archbishop of Miami,

644
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 who was Coleman Carroll,

645
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 and he said that he should be the Bishop of the Moon

646
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 because the moon is always over Miami.

647
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Oh.

648
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Yes.

649
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 What the fuck is he talking about? No, it's not.

650
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Sorry.

651
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 This is just...

652
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 It's just a priest banter.

653
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Oh, no!

654
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 But what I...

655
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 But I don't get it.

656
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 I don't get it. It's not always going to Miami.

657
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 No, but it's probably a phrase, Andy.

658
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 I think you're taking it too seriously.

659
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 It's not a phrase. No, I'm with Andy because I googled this.

660
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 I was like, "This must be an in-joke of Miami thing.

661
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 "The moon's always over Miami." No, no.

662
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 What he's saying is, "Oh, yeah, when we look up at night,

663
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 "the moon's always there."

664
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Has he ever spoken to anyone who doesn't live in Miami?

665
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Yeah. That's the joke.

666
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 I see. No, I see. That is a good joke.

667
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 It's priest banter, Andy.

668
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 I don't think I was cut out for the priesthood.

669
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 I just... I wouldn't have fit in.

670
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 It's the actual largest Catholic diocese on Earth,

671
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 would you say?

672
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Can you define diocese quickly?

673
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Okay, yeah, it's the area that's looked after by a bishop.

674
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Okay.

675
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 So, for instance, there will be a diocese around Perth,

676
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 perhaps, and it might involve quite a lot of Western Australians.

677
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 They don't need them all over the little villages.

678
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Something non-very broadly inhabited.

679
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 So, Mongolia would be a good...

680
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Yeah, that's a good guess.

681
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 It's quite close, actually.

682
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 It is in Erkutsk in Russia.

683
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 And interestingly, if Erkutsk, this Catholic area,

684
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 decided to secede from Russia,

685
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 so it's not part of Russia anymore.

686
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Good luck, guys.

687
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 I think they take quite a debut of that.

688
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Well, they're busy on the other front, so...

689
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Okay.

690
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 If the people of Erkutsk, the Catholics of Erkutsk,

691
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 which, admittedly, is only 0.4% of the area,

692
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 but if they decide to secede,

693
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Russia won't be the biggest country anymore.

694
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Do you know what would be the biggest country?

695
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 The current and second biggest.

696
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Canada.

697
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Canada, Canada, Canada.

698
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 No, not Canada.

699
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 It would be the newly seceded area of Erkutsk.

700
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 No.

701
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Because it's more than half of Russia.

702
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 No.

703
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Is that diocese?

704
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Yeah.

705
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Oh, they've got to do it.

706
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 It would be so funny.

707
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Now you're liking the Bishop jokes.

708
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Yeah, yeah.

709
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Maybe I would have been good.

710
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 You know the whole thing about moon ownership?

711
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Uh-huh.

712
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Okay.

713
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 So it's like sometimes you can buy a plot of the moon.

714
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 So all of those things are fake, basically.

715
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 There's a load of jostling at the moment,

716
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 because everyone's kind of agreed

717
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 that no one actually owns interplanetary bodies.

718
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 But at the moment, the USA, for example,

719
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 is trying to set up a thing called Coordinated Lunar Time

720
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 as a kind of proto-colonisation,

721
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 like if you control the time,

722
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 it's sort of an acknowledgement that it's kind of yours.

723
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Oh, okay.

724
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 But really, no one owns it.

725
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 And all those things where you buy an acre of the moon

726
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 are all madey-uppy.

727
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 So Robert Coles was a guy in 1955

728
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 who sold off huge chunks of the moon.

729
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 The Interplanetary Development Corporation

730
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 sold it off for a dollar an acre.

731
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Pretty cheap, if real, which it wasn't.

732
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 But you got the...

733
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 It was quite good this, though,

734
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 because you got the mineral rights

735
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 to anything under your acre of moon.

736
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 You also got beach and fishing rights

737
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 in the Sea of Tranquility.

738
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 See what you did there?

739
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Right.

740
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And you got the right to participate

741
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 in all winter sports on the lunar Alps.

742
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Cool.

743
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Cool.

744
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 I think that was fun.

745
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Apollo 11 is when this bishop

746
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 was claiming ownership of the moon, right?

747
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Yeah.

748
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 A lot of the Apollo astronauts

749
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 were surprisingly religious.

750
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 James Irwin, who was Apollo 15,

751
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 he was a literal creationist.

752
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 He went up to the moon to prove

753
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 that God created the Earth in seven days.

754
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And there was a moment when he was up there

755
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 when a thing happened where

756
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 a decision needed to be made,

757
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 and he thought, "I could message NASA

758
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 and say, 'How do I fix this thing?'

759
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Or I could just ask God."

760
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 And so he asked God,

761
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 and God said, "Oh, it's the blue wire."

762
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Or whatever.

763
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And he did what God said.

764
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 What?

765
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 And it worked.

766
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 Yeah.

767
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 So this was on the moon,

768
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 an isolated man with one other human.

769
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 So God basically told him

770
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 the thing that he got told in his training.

771
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 That's one way of looking at it, absolutely.

772
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 To be fair, the reception to God

773
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 is much better when you're on the moon, isn't it?

774
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Yes.

775
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 You're way closer.

776
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 There's no conflict.

777
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Exactly.

778
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 But so when he came back to Earth,

779
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 he set up a religious group,

780
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 and his first expedition post-going to the moon

781
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 was going to Mount Ararat to look for Noah's Ark.

782
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Did he find it?

783
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 He thinks that he did find a few bits of...

784
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Because you think it would be obvious

785
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 when you did find Noah's Ark, wouldn't you?

786
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 You'd think so, but it's broken up now.

787
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 It's not giant Ark.

788
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 I think we would have spotted it.

789
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Yeah, with all the animals,

790
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 or like a pair of animals looking out of each window.

791
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 They'd be dead now.

792
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 But check this out.

793
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 There's this one fascinating story

794
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 when he was up Mount Ararat looking for it.

795
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 So he was climbing, and he got really tired.

796
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 So he decided, okay, today abandon the trek,

797
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 head back to where our base is,

798
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 and let's recuperate and go tomorrow.

799
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 So while he was walking down on his own,

800
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 he took a pause and he kneeled down

801
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 to put on some crampons onto his boots,

802
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 and he was struck suddenly from behind

803
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 by a giant falling rock,

804
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 and it just knocked him down the hill.

805
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 He knocked out five teeth.

806
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 He had deep cuts to his eyes and his nose.

807
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 He sprained his neck and he messed up his ribs.

808
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 So he just camped there for the night.

809
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Unfortunately, once he had got his sleeping bag

810
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 out of his bag and got into it,

811
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 he zipped himself up,

812
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 and once he was asleep,

813
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 he slipped down the mountain like a sled

814
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 and hurt himself all over again

815
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 when he bashed into multiple boulders.

816
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 So he woke up, lowered down, and it was on a slide.

817
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 And God is like, "This was for bothering me

818
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 while you were on the moon."

819
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 So he climbed back up in his sleeping bag,

820
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 and just before he got to the top,

821
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 like a worm, like he went back up,

822
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 and then he slid back down again and crashed.

823
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 What, for fun, sorry?

824
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 'Cause he was like, "That was a nice green one."

825
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Every time he went and got near to the bit that was flat,

826
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 he slid back down.

827
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 It happened three or four times.

828
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 - You got to climb out of the sleeping bag, mate.

829
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 How dumb is this guy? - Yeah.

830
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 He eventually passed out, and he woke up,

831
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 and he was connected to his pillow

832
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 because there was so much blood that had solidified on it.

833
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Yeah, he should have died on Mount Ararat.

834
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 It's the most, like, Mr Bean adventure

835
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 amongst this search.

836
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 But he was a creationist on the moon.

837
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Any idiot can be an astronaut.

838
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 That's what we've learned here.

839
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 I do think it's interesting,

840
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 'cause he must have had a conception of where heaven is

841
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 and where God lives, and, like, where do you think heaven is?

842
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 - Up. - It's up.

843
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 It's somewhere vague, right?

844
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 - Opposite of hell. - It's in a parallel universe.

845
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 It's opposite of hell, so I think we often think of it

846
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 as somewhere a bit different dimensionally.

847
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 But until people like Galileo,

848
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Christians thought there were three heavens.

849
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 The first heaven was bird heaven.

850
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 That's where the birds live. - Oh.

851
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 That's where they're flying around.

852
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 The second heaven is star heaven. - Oh, sorry.

853
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 But does that mean that all the birds are already in heaven?

854
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 They've been very, very good.

855
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 Exciting new theory, yes.

856
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 So bird heaven, and then above that, do you say star heaven?

857
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Star heaven. And above that is Empyrean heaven,

858
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 and that's where God lives, and that's where you'll go.

859
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And if you asked a medieval person,

860
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 where would you go when you die, they were very clear.

861
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 They look up where the birds are, they're like,

862
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 and then above that, if I kept going up in a ladder,

863
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 there's stars, and if I kept going up, there's where I'll die.

864
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 And it's such a weird way of conceiving of it, right?

865
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 So when Galileo and Co saw planets and worked out

866
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 the different things, went around different things,

867
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 that really fucked it up more than we can imagine.

868
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 So just for clarity, were the birds higher than birds actually flew?

869
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 No, they just thought heaven was low.

870
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 They didn't think birds were high, they thought heaven was low.

871
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 But if you climbed a tree, you didn't get into bird heaven.

872
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 You couldn't just say, like, I'm just going to cut my losses,

873
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 I'm going to stay in bird heaven. I know I'm in bird heaven.

874
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 And what about emus? Are they just been really bad?

875
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Yeah, yeah.

876
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Well, the devil's bird, obviously.

877
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 Oh, yeah.

878
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 What I'm trying to say is, where is the living birds?

879
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Are they flying next to the ghost, dead birds?

880
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 Oh, yeah.

881
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 No, no, no, no, all the dead things are in the top heaven.

882
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 Just where the birds are, we're like,

883
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 well, that's the first layer of heaven.

884
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 OK, so it's beyond West Africa.

885
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Just where the bird heaven, as in it's where birds go after they die.

886
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 It's named after the people who live there.

887
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 I got confused about that.

888
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 But that was like, people did hold on to that theory for quite a long time.

889
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 And when the hot air ballooning was invented,

890
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 there was a group called the Muggletonians,

891
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 and they wanted it to be banned,

892
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 because they thought people who hot air ballooned would bump into heaven.

893
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 It's cheating.

894
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 They refused to accept the laws of gravity.

895
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 But your mate should have done that.

896
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 And they believed that God takes no notice of everyday events on Earth

897
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 and will never intervene in anything.

898
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 I mean, checked out so far. Yeah.

899
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 But that meant that there was no point doing any kind of worship,

900
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 because God clearly isn't listening.

901
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 So let's just not go to church.

902
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 And let's just balloon.

903
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Well, no, no, you're not allowed to do that.

904
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Because that's cheating.

905
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Yeah, exactly.

906
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 You might be in heaven, everyone you met in heaven,

907
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 you'd have to say, are you a good guy or just a balloonist?

908
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 Because God wasn't listening and you weren't worshiping,

909
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 you would have meetings instead and you'd just go to the pub and chat.

910
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Sounds nice, doesn't it?

911
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 Describing the modern day.

912
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 Modern secular society, yeah.

913
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 We were talking about a very big Catholic space,

914
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 the big diocese.

915
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 I thought I'd try and find a very small Catholic space.

916
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 Great thinking.

917
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Thank you.

918
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 So I don't think we've ever talked about priest holes.

919
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 So 16th century, a lot of persecution on both sides.

920
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 So be fair, a bad time to be anybody, the 16th century.

921
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Anyway, but when Catholicism was illegal in England,

922
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 if you were caught with a priest, they would be taken away and tortured

923
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 and executed and you might be as well.

924
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 So lots of houses had these priest holes where you just hide your own priest.

925
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 And there's a place in England called Hindlip Hall,

926
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 which has 12 separate priest holes.

927
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Some priest holes had their own priest holes.

928
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Were you hiding a priest from the other priest?

929
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 It's where you're our only priest.

930
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 It was basically a bluff.

931
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 If they come in and they find your priest hole,

932
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 they're like, "You've got a priest hole."

933
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And you'd be like, "Yeah, but there's no priest in it."

934
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 Then they leave and you open up the second hole.

935
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 You wouldn't put the shitter priest in the second hole.

936
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 You might put the shitter priest in the outer hole.

937
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 I don't think, "Well, if we lose one priest, that's fine."

938
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 You got it.

939
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 That's it for this household.

940
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 Bye-bye.

941
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 The guy who built these holes,

942
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 he was a Jesuit brother called Nicholas Owen.

943
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 He spent 20 years creating the chambers in various houses,

944
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 hidden walls, hidden compartments, everything.

945
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 He was caught and tortured for it.

946
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 He is now the patron saint of illusionists.

947
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Oh.

948
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 How good is that?

949
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 That's great.

950
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 It's time to move on to our final fact of the show,

951
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 and that is my fact.

952
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 My fact this week is that the Oscar-winning movie,

953
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 The Summer of '42,

954
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 is the only movie to be based on a novel

955
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 that was written after the movie was made.

956
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 What?

957
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 What?

958
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Explain.

959
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 I'm not a traveller, everybody.

960
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 That's what I'm talking about.

961
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 No, so this was a big movie in its day.

962
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 It was called Summer of '42,

963
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 and there was a writer called Herman Rorscher

964
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 who wrote the movie.

965
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 The movie went into production.

966
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 It was being made.

967
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 And then, as often happens,

968
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 novelizations of the movie are written.

969
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 So Herman Rorscher wrote his own novelization

970
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 of the screenplay.

971
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 They released it prior to the movie coming out,

972
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 but it became such a massive hit as a book

973
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 that everyone started going,

974
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 "Oh, my God, they're making a movie of this book,"

975
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 even though the book was of the movie.

976
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 And then the people within Hollywood went,

977
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 "Well, let's roll with that."

978
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 So the movie was billed as based on the book,

979
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 Summer of '42 by Herman Rorscher.

980
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 And so it was very confusing

981
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 because it got nominated for a bunch of Oscars.

982
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 It won an Oscar.

983
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 It was not nominated for best adapted screenplay.

984
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 It was just outright screenplay

985
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 because they knew inside.

986
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 Yeah, so it's one example where the popularity

987
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 of the second product was so big that it clipped.

988
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 The only example.

989
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 Let's not pretend we get all conjured.

990
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 Yeah, maybe, you're right.

991
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 Pretty amazing.

992
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 Was it 1942?

993
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 When was it?

994
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 No, the Summer of '42.

995
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 This was a 1970s movie, in the '70s.

996
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 Yeah, I feel like just to interrupt,

997
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 I feel like Andy might have another example.

998
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Do you?

999
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 Step in.

1000
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 It's a kind of example of things getting incredibly tangled

1001
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 with the novel-to-movie thing.

1002
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 So Bram Stoker's Dracula was turned into a novel

1003
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 after the film came out.

1004
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 What?

1005
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 What's it?

1006
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Yeah, with eight pages of color photos.

1007
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 Oh, that's a good idea.

1008
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 They said, "Let's do a book of the film of the book."

1009
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 Got it.

1010
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 Do you know what I mean?

1011
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 Yeah, yeah.

1012
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 Great expectations.

1013
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 That was novelized again.

1014
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Like, it's a novel.

1015
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 I don't know.

1016
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 I found it weird.

1017
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 Dumanji, I love this.

1018
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Dumanji was based on a book, right?

1019
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 By Chris Van Alsberg.

1020
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 That was turned into a screen story,

1021
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 which was turned into a screen play,

1022
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 which was turned into a film,

1023
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 which was then novelized into a novel.

1024
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 So it started as a book.

1025
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 It went through the entire sausage machine

1026
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 and ended up being a different book.

1027
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 I want to ask you to repeat that,

1028
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 but I will just...

1029
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 I'll re-listen when the edit comes out.

1030
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 I'm not even following it.

1031
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 Mark of confidence.

1032
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 I don't want to listen now, but...

1033
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 There was one...

1034
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 So Robert Sheckley, a writer,

1035
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 wrote a book called "The Tenth Victim"

1036
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 in 1965.

1037
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 And that was a novelization.

1038
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 And I think novelizations were slightly more respected than...

1039
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 Because they were newer, basically.

1040
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 So people didn't know that they were all going to be shit.

1041
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 So it was a novelization of an Italian film,

1042
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 by the same name, called "The Tenth Victim",

1043
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 but the film was based on another book by Sheckley,

1044
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 called "The Seventh Victim".

1045
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 OK.

1046
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 And I don't know more about that, actually.

1047
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 There is a movie that was based on a poster.

1048
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 As in, the poster came first, and then the movie came out.

1049
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 Can we guess it?

1050
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 This poster has done so well.

1051
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Yes, I think you can guess it, actually.

1052
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 Oh, my God! The scream.

1053
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Oh, my God! Dan!

1054
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 I said "Oh, my God" first, which is the equivalent of buzzing in.

1055
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 Sorry.

1056
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 And I believe the first person to say,

1057
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 "Oh, my God" was Anna Tyshinski.

1058
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Uh, is it scream?

1059
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 No.

1060
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 For fuck's sake, Dan, what a stupid Tyshinski!

1061
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 [LAUGHTER]

1062
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 I reckon the audience might get it.

1063
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 It's a very iconic poster.

1064
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 A work of art.

1065
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 Star Wars, no.

1066
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 Snake's on a train, no.

1067
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 Shrek, Shrek 3, though.

1068
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 Shrek's based on a book, actually.

1069
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 Is it?

1070
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 Yeah.

1071
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 Jaws?

1072
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 No, the answer is "The Usual Suspects".

1073
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Oh!

1074
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 And apparently, a reporter at the Sundance Film Festival

1075
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 asked the guy, McQuarrie, who was making it,

1076
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 he said, "What's your next movie?"

1077
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 And he had this idea of these people lined up,

1078
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 and he said, "Oh, I guess it's about a bunch of criminals

1079
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 who met at a police line-up or something."

1080
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 Right.

1081
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 And then, because he had the idea of the image first,

1082
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 and then he thought,

1083
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 "Well, how are we going to turn this into a movie?"

1084
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 Yeah, right.

1085
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 Oh, cool.

1086
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 I've never heard of this example I'm going to mention.

1087
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 So, when we just said to the audience name,

1088
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 someone said, "Star Wars" out there, right?

1089
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 Okay, so, when a new hope came out,

1090
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 there was so much money that was behind that first movie,

1091
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 and they were hoping that George Lucas

1092
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 was going to write the second movie,

1093
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 which became "Empire Strike Back", right?

1094
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 So, the novelization of a new hope was written in 1976

1095
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 by a guy called Alan Dean Foster,

1096
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 and he was contracted to do two books,

1097
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 in case the first movie bombed

1098
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 and they couldn't produce George Lucas' next movie.

1099
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 So, Alan Dean Foster, the novelization guy,

1100
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 write a sequel using all the props that we used in the first movie

1101
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 so that we can make your novelization

1102
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 instead of George Lucas' idea for "Empire Strike Back".

1103
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 Wait, I don't understand.

1104
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 What, in case George Lucas' didn't work?

1105
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 Because they could save the money,

1106
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 because they already have the props.

1107
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 Exactly.

1108
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 So, if it didn't work, if that first movie didn't work,

1109
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 we were going to get a second movie

1110
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 called "Splinter of the Mind's Eye",

1111
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 and it was published before "Empire Strike Back" came out,

1112
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 and it has a completely different plot.

1113
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 It's based on a jungle planet.

1114
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 Han Solo and Chewbacca are not in it,

1115
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 because Harrison Ford hadn't signed up for the second movie yet,

1116
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 so they didn't want to include him.

1117
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 But no one had told Alan Dean Foster at this point

1118
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 that Leia and Luke were brother and sister.

1119
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 Oh, no.

1120
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 Spoilers down, sorry.

1121
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 Sorry.

1122
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 So, the whole book is sexual tension between brother and sister.

1123
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 I've got some extracts.

1124
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 Luke felt the warmth of the body next to him,

1125
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 framed in the light from above.

1126
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 The princess looked more radiant than ever.

1127
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 Leia, he began, "I" and then pulls out,

1128
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 but not pulls out in that respect.

1129
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 Damn.

1130
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 Oh, for sure.

1131
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 Come on.

1132
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 The princess grew aware of how tightly she was clinging to him.

1133
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 The proximity engendered a wash of confused emotion.

1134
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 It would be proper to disengage,

1135
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 to move away a little proper,

1136
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 but not nearly so satisfying.

1137
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 And then "Empire Strike Back" came out,

1138
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 and Alan Dean Foster was like, "What the fuck, George?"

1139
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 "I've written an incest novel."

1140
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 He is amazing, Alan Dean Foster.

1141
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 But with Star Wars, they refused to show him what anything looked like.

1142
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 They refused to even tell him what anything was really.

1143
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 So, he had to write the character Jabba the Hutt,

1144
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 without knowing whether he was a human or a massive slug.

1145
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 And so, he just fudges it in the text.

1146
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 And this happened with, like, he did the novel of the film Alien,

1147
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 and again, they refused to send him any pictures of the alien,

1148
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 because they were keeping it under wraps.

1149
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 So, he just had to kind of guess.

1150
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 Jabba the Hutt is just a combination of a human and a massive slug, right?

1151
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 Oh, Anna.

1152
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 No, he's a massive slug.

1153
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 Oh, right, but with a human face.

1154
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 No, he doesn't have a cute face.

1155
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 He doesn't have a slug's face, I'll say that.

1156
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 Maybe I know some weird-looking people.

1157
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 Oh, OK, sorry, he's just a slug, got it.

1158
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 He's not a slug, he's a sort of space.

1159
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 He's like a space slug.

1160
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 But he has done absolutely everything, Alan Dean Foster.

1161
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 He's done Star Trek, he's done Transformers, Terminator.

1162
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 His first job was for an Italian Lady Tarzan movie, right?

1163
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:11,040
 Which was in Italian no subtitles available so he had to completely like guess what was happening

1164
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:25,280
 But he did exactly what your guy did James he put based it on some production paintings

1165
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,440
 Oh, yeah turned that into the novel and when the book came out somewhere from Disney said we love this book

1166
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,680
 Can we turn it into a film and he said no, it's a film already. It's an Italian lady Tarzan for a

1167
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,560
 I didn't know that Star Wars left the EU. Sorry

1168
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:44,480
 This is actually this is like being within the bubble. So every single listener to this podcast will know this except me until yesterday

1169
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,520
 But the EU of course is

1170
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,120
 The expanded universe, which I didn't know that that was

1171
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:59,280
 What are you talking about? You know the expanded universe of any film is the it's when you do a video game or you do a novel

1172
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,040
 It's the expanded non-canon movie, but it's still canon

1173
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,200
 So oh like the spin-off novels and all that other shit

1174
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,960
 And the phrase expanded universe was invented for Star Wars

1175
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:18,080
 And it left the EU in 2012 and I just think it's very interesting that Star Wars is now divided into sort of two different quantum realities

1176
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,960
 Because what do you mean it left the EU? Well, I mean that

1177
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:28,560
 George Lucas made three more films. Yes, they are mostly about trade negotiations actually. So it's kind of perfect that this is the

1178
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,440
 Boris Johnson

1179
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,720
 I'm a giant slug. What are you talking about?

1180
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,600
 We're the human face

1181
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:44,720
 And it was incredibly controversial among Star Wars fans because

1182
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,880
 People had been told when the first three Star Wars films came out that the only subsequent films would be prequels

1183
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,360
 Which they were right the next three were prequels

1184
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:59,200
 So everyone who was writing in the expanded universe novels and comic books and stuff like that were writing sequels

1185
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,800
 Stuff that happens after the first three films then of course

1186
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,560
 Disney took over 2012 and released the next three which correct me if I'm wrong are sequels, right?

1187
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:13,600
 They happen the events happen after so that completely fucked with the Star Wars universe

1188
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:19,360
 And so they split into two universes now. They've left the EU in 2011 the distributor of the film drive

1189
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,880
 You know the film drive. Yeah, Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling, right?

1190
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,840
 It was sued by a woman from michigan called Sarah Deming for saying it didn't contain enough driving

1191
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,800
 [Laughter]

1192
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:37,920
 He's saying it bore very little similarity to a chase or race action film having very little driving in the motion picture

1193
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,000
 Is he in the car the whole time? He's in the car a lot of the time, but it's more in the first half

1194
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,600
 The second half is a bit more depressing and a bit less driving based. Oh, I sort of got pretty good

1195
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:51,360
 How much did she sue for? Oh, probably some standard american amount like five zillion dollars. Anyway, I don't think she won

1196
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,120
 It was unsuccessful, but you can sue based on trailers, can't you?

1197
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,160
 Can you? There was that film yesterday, which was a Richard Curtis film about one of the Beatles never existed

1198
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,640
 But only one guy remembered them. Yeah, that was sued by a couple of fans

1199
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,080
 Um

1200
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:11,840
 Because the trailer had featured Anna de Amas who's a famous actress and then she wasn't in the final film

1201
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:19,040
 And they had paid $3.99 each to watch this film on amazon prime. So naturally they sued for five million dollars

1202
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,680
 Wow

1203
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,480
 I think she is in the final film. Well, I think she's

1204
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,800
 I think she's in on the chat show bit drastically cut because she wasn't much bigger part of it

1205
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,160
 Because she was basically cut from the final film. It's like she never existed

1206
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,280
 And these two losers are the only people who remember her which is the plot of the film. Oh my god. Yes

1207
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:48,640
 That is it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening Perth. You were awesome

1208
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,040
 We will be back again

1209
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,360
 And until then tune in next week for another episode. We'll see you then. Goodbye

1210
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,360
 Bye

1211
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,360
 You

1212
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,360
 You

1213
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,360
 You

1214
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,940
 (upbeat music)
