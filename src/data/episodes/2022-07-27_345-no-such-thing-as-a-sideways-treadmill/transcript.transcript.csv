00:00:10,00:00:22,"Hello and welcome to a special Halloween edition of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:22,00:00:27,a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:27,00:00:28,My name is Dan-
00:00:28,00:00:31,">> Uh-oh, yeah, she's excellent."
00:00:31,00:00:33,>> I felt like it needed that.
00:00:33,00:00:33,>> Needed what?
00:00:33,00:00:34,I didn't hear anything.
00:00:34,00:00:36,>> [LAUGH]
00:00:36,00:00:38,">> Yeah, no, actually me neither, sorry."
00:00:38,00:00:40,>> [LAUGH]
00:00:40,00:00:41,>> My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:41,00:00:46,"I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski, and Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:00:46,00:00:48,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four"
00:00:48,00:00:53,"favorite facts from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:53,00:00:57,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:00:57,00:01:00,"My fact this week is that in the 1930s,"
00:01:00,00:01:05,the ghost of a swearing mongoose led the BBC to revise its working conditions.
00:01:05,00:01:08,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:08,00:01:13,">> This is quite a story, so Seldin, right."
00:01:13,00:01:18,"So there was this guy called Rex Lambert, and he worked at the BBC."
00:01:18,00:01:21,"He was the editor of the BBC magazine, The Listener."
00:01:21,00:01:26,And he got interested in a story of a talking mongoose who lived at that time
00:01:26,00:01:28,on the Isle of Man.
00:01:28,00:01:32,"So he went to the Isle of Man, investigated this talking mongoose,"
00:01:32,00:01:34,"and wrote, kind of published a book about it."
00:01:34,00:01:40,"Anyway, he had a rival, a career rival who sat on the board of the BFI with him,"
00:01:40,00:01:44,"which he was also on, who decided to use this to bring him down."
00:01:44,00:01:48,"So accused Rex of being a crazy, crazy man, because he believed in this talking"
00:01:48,00:01:49,mongoose.
00:01:49,00:01:54,"And essentially, Rex sued this other guy for slander, and he won."
00:01:54,00:01:58,And that whole case kind of drew into sharp relief the fact that the BBC wasn't
00:01:58,00:02:01,"treating its employees very well, because the BBC was a little bit unlawed,"
00:02:01,00:02:03,"Reeth were a little bit like, yeah, this Rex guy, you're right,"
00:02:03,00:02:05,he does sound like a bit of a loon.
00:02:05,00:02:08,"And so after that, then the government got involved and was like, look, BBC,"
00:02:08,00:02:11,"you've got to start treating your staff better, even if they do believe in"
00:02:11,00:02:14,talking mongoose and sort your act out.
00:02:14,00:02:16,"And they did, they changed their rules and policies."
00:02:16,00:02:20,">> I feel a bit sorry for Rex Lambert, because whenever you look him up on"
00:02:20,00:02:24,"the internet, all you can find is one that he believed in talking mongooses."
00:02:24,00:02:28,"And two that he once said in his magazine, The Listener,"
00:02:28,00:02:31,television won't matter in your lifetime or mine.
00:02:31,00:02:32,>> Yeah.
00:02:32,00:02:34,>> That's the only two things he's remembered for.
00:02:34,00:02:37,">> Well, but he did die two weeks after saying that, and he was speaking to"
00:02:37,00:02:40,"the world's oldest man at the time, so actually."
00:02:40,00:02:43,">> And then the batteries had gone in that guy's remote, haven't they?"
00:02:43,00:02:46,>> Yeah.
00:02:46,00:02:50,">> Hey, we're being a bit rude here, this mongoose has a name, Anna."
00:02:50,00:02:54,">> Sorry, yeah, the mongoose has a name, it's called Jeff."
00:02:54,00:02:57,"Jeff, the talking mongoose, spelled G-E-F."
00:02:57,00:03:01,>> I've read that he also may not have completely been a mongoose.
00:03:01,00:03:05,"I mean, for one thing, he was a ghost, so the ghosts have a species."
00:03:05,00:03:10,"And secondly, he was also described as a man weasel, which is even spookier, really."
00:03:10,00:03:13,>> He kind of sometimes claimed to be a mongoose.
00:03:13,00:03:16,He sometimes claimed to be an extra clever mongoose.
00:03:16,00:03:19,And then sometimes he claimed to be part of the fifth dimension.
00:03:19,00:03:23,"And then sometimes claimed to be the eighth wonder of the world, so, you know."
00:03:23,00:03:27,">> Yeah, he used to say, I'm a freak, I have hands and I have feet."
00:03:27,00:03:31,"And if you saw me, you'd faint, you'd be petrified, mummified, turned into stone or"
00:03:31,00:03:33,"a pillar of salt, that was kind of like his catchphrase."
00:03:33,00:03:34,>> He sounds like a rapper.
00:03:34,00:03:37,">> Yeah, why are you talking like he was M&M?"
00:03:37,00:03:40,">> To be honest, the bit where you'd be petrified, mummified, it sounds like it's"
00:03:40,00:03:46,"going to end with, why it might be grease lightning, that's where I was heading with that."
00:03:46,00:03:50,">> Yeah, he had a bit of an identity crisis, Jeff, he'd changed from one moment to the next."
00:03:50,00:03:54,">> We should probably mention that he, we're just going to talk about Jeff presumably,"
00:03:54,00:03:56,rather than PBC working conditions.
00:03:56,00:04:00,"He was a mongoose who appeared first to be in the Isle of Man in 1931, I think,"
00:04:00,00:04:03,in the house of a guy called James Irving and his family.
00:04:03,00:04:05,And first he was described as a yellow and
00:04:05,00:04:09,"brown rat-like animal with a long, bushy tail."
00:04:09,00:04:11,And he was a bit of a sensation.
00:04:11,00:04:14,He became quite famous throughout the country for a while.
00:04:14,00:04:17,>> Did he ever appear to anyone outside the house of James Irving?
00:04:17,00:04:19,">> Some people heard him, certainly."
00:04:19,00:04:24,Their good friend heard him sort of talking outside the porch.
00:04:24,00:04:28,"Although coincidentally, it happened that their daughter, Vori,"
00:04:28,00:04:32,was known to be a skilled ventriloquist and also was very good at impersonating animals.
00:04:32,00:04:34,>> Was she drinking a glass of water at the time?
00:04:34,00:04:37,Because that sets the deal on it.
00:04:37,00:04:39,>> He did used to go to the market with them.
00:04:39,00:04:42,>> He got the bus into town.
00:04:42,00:04:44,>> Really? I didn't hear the bus.
00:04:44,00:04:46,>> Brought back gossip about the neighbours.
00:04:46,00:04:47,">> Yeah, really?"
00:04:47,00:04:51,>> He sometimes used to live underneath the floorboards of the bus company
00:04:51,00:04:53,so that he could listen to what the bus drivers were saying.
00:04:53,00:04:54,">> Oh, wow."
00:04:54,00:04:55,>> Did he?
00:04:55,00:04:57,">> Wait, is this true or are you guys just making this up now?"
00:04:57,00:04:59,">> So, right, basically all of this is false, right?"
00:04:59,00:05:05,"Is this, this is kind of, this is a ghost that was claimed by this family"
00:05:05,00:05:07,and became famous for a little while.
00:05:07,00:05:10,But we are all four of us on the side of it not existing?
00:05:10,00:05:12,">> Seriously guys, I go away for one week."
00:05:12,00:05:13,You have Rhys Darby on.
00:05:13,00:05:16,"When I come back, all of you are paid up members of Spook Club."
00:05:17,00:05:20,">> I mean, his story has holes in it, doesn't it?"
00:05:20,00:05:24,He claims that he was born in Delhi in 1852.
00:05:24,00:05:27,So that he was 80 years at the time when he first appeared.
00:05:27,00:05:30,No backstory of how he made it to the Isle of Man.
00:05:30,00:05:32,No big trip sort of revealed in all his tours.
00:05:32,00:05:36,">> Oh, I thought that it was that the neighbours had brought in some mongooses"
00:05:36,00:05:41,from outside of the Isle of Man to kind of chase after Berman.
00:05:41,00:05:42,>> And Jeff was one.
00:05:42,00:05:43,">> And Jeff was one of them, yeah."
00:05:43,00:05:45,">> Jeff, the classic Delhi name."
00:05:45,00:05:50,">> Well, it's G-E-F, isn't it?"
00:05:50,00:05:51,He spelled it himself.
00:05:51,00:05:53,"When they asked him, ""What's your name?"""
00:05:53,00:05:55,"They originally called him Jack and they said,"
00:05:55,00:05:56,"""Okay, what's your name?"""
00:05:56,00:05:58,"And he said, ""Oh, it's Jeff, G-E-F."""
00:05:58,00:06:00,So he gave the name himself.
00:06:00,00:06:01,>> He did.
00:06:01,00:06:05,Although he wasn't very good at speaking any Indian language.
00:06:05,00:06:08,So they talked about him like he was a great linguist.
00:06:08,00:06:09,He was fluent in English
00:06:09,00:06:12,and he did seem to pick up other languages very quickly as well.
00:06:12,00:06:15,"But he only knew sort of, I think he knew the word Hindu"
00:06:15,00:06:17,and he knew sort of one or two other words
00:06:17,00:06:18,that everyone would have known at the time.
00:06:18,00:06:19,>> It's not enough to get by.
00:06:19,00:06:21,It's not enough to get by an Indian.
00:06:21,00:06:23,">> He didn't know how to say bottle of beer, for instance."
00:06:23,00:06:25,That was one that he really struggled with.
00:06:25,00:06:27,[laughter]
00:06:27,00:06:30,">> When this was investigated more fully,"
00:06:30,00:06:34,the hairs of the ghost mongoose were found out to be the hairs of a dog
00:06:34,00:06:38,"and the imprints of Jeff's paws had been made with a stick, it turned out."
00:06:38,00:06:39,"So, yeah."
00:06:39,00:06:43,">> But they did, this is how not seriously people were taking it,"
00:06:43,00:06:45,but how much it caught on in the news.
00:06:45,00:06:47,I think it was just silly news season
00:06:47,00:06:48,"because they sent them to the British Museum, didn't they?"
00:06:48,00:06:51,And the British Museum analysed the footprints.
00:06:51,00:06:53,">> Well, it's the 1930s, wasn't it?"
00:06:53,00:06:54,>> Yeah.
00:06:54,00:06:57,">> It feels like it was a bit of a whole silly season, the 1930s."
00:06:57,00:06:58,Apart from the Great Depression and the...
00:06:58,00:06:59,>> Rise of fascism.
00:06:59,00:07:02,">> Yeah, apart from that, there was a chance"
00:07:02,00:07:04,to have a bit of a breather after the First World War.
00:07:04,00:07:05,>> Yeah.
00:07:06,00:07:12,">> When the reporter from the Daily Dispatch went over to see this supposed mongoose,"
00:07:12,00:07:15,"again, didn't see it but heard it talking,"
00:07:15,00:07:20,"apparently the mongoose gave him a tip for the Grand National, which is quite good."
00:07:20,00:07:25,"On another occasion, he sang three verses of the Manx National Anthem,"
00:07:25,00:07:30,"then two verses of the Spanish National Anthem,"
00:07:30,00:07:33,followed by one verse of the Welsh National Anthem.
00:07:33,00:07:35,">> Well, they're all very well known in India,"
00:07:35,00:07:37,so that must be where he picked those up.
00:07:37,00:07:38,>> It's so weird.
00:07:38,00:07:41,">> I think in an attempt to inject a bit of realism into it,"
00:07:41,00:07:43,"at one point, James Irving said,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,"""Yeah, he is very good at languages,"
00:07:45,00:07:48,"and he actually can speak fluent Flemish,"
00:07:48,00:07:50,"but he's not infallible because he thinks it's German."""
00:07:50,00:07:53,"So, Jeff spoke Flemish, but believing it was German."
00:07:53,00:07:56,">> So, this Lambert guy who went over,"
00:07:56,00:07:59,"the person he took over with him to investigate was Harry Price,"
00:07:59,00:08:05,"who is one of the great ghost hunters of the sort of that boom of ghost hunting,"
00:08:05,00:08:08,"like Hans Holzer, who Ghostbusters was based on."
00:08:08,00:08:11,"They were the first people who went to all these locations,"
00:08:11,00:08:15,"wrote these big books, and he had his ghost hunting kit with him,"
00:08:15,00:08:17,because there used to be goggles that they would wear
00:08:17,00:08:19,that they could claim would help you to see spirits.
00:08:19,00:08:22,Arthur Conan Doyle famously owed a pair as well.
00:08:22,00:08:23,He used to go ghost hunting.
00:08:23,00:08:24,>> Of course he did.
00:08:24,00:08:28,"Every single time we talk about anything dubious that anyone ever believed in,"
00:08:28,00:08:30,is we are the Conan Doyle's in there somewhere.
00:08:30,00:08:31,He's just getting involved.
00:08:31,00:08:34,"He's like, ""Oh, it's something that's definitely not true."
00:08:34,00:08:36,"Yeah, I'll stick my ear in. It's great."""
00:08:36,00:08:37,>> That's true.
00:08:37,00:08:40,"But so, he would have cameras that the idea would be is,"
00:08:40,00:08:43,the camera would have trigger weights and a trigger thermograph on it.
00:08:43,00:08:46,"So, if the temperature suddenly changed drastically in a room,"
00:08:46,00:08:48,it would trigger the camera to take a photo.
00:08:48,00:08:51,"And he used to have sort of matches with him,"
00:08:51,00:08:54,"and the matches were not only to help him see in the dark,"
00:08:54,00:08:58,but they were also to entice a ghost to respond
00:08:58,00:09:00,if the ghost used to be a smoker.
00:09:00,00:09:04,"So, he'd pull out the matches and think that maybe the ghost would be like,"
00:09:04,00:09:05,"""Ooh, thank you, a light. Yes, please."""
00:09:05,00:09:06,>> That's so funny.
00:09:06,00:09:09,">> Well, just a cigarette suddenly appears floating in the air."
00:09:09,00:09:10,>> Yeah.
00:09:10,00:09:12,>> Floats towards your match.
00:09:12,00:09:15,">> Hey, have you guys heard of the Ichneumon?"
00:09:15,00:09:16,>> The wasp.
00:09:16,00:09:16,>> No.
00:09:16,00:09:19,">> No, so there is the wasp,"
00:09:19,00:09:22,but there's a mythological mongoose known as the Ichneumon.
00:09:22,00:09:23,">> Oh, cool."
00:09:23,00:09:26,>> And it used to exist back in the day.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"So, this is another sort of fabled mongoose,"
00:09:28,00:09:30,but it used to slay dragons.
00:09:30,00:09:32,"That was the belief of how, yeah."
00:09:32,00:09:34,"So, this is not a gigantic mongoose."
00:09:34,00:09:37,This was a regular size mongoose/weasel.
00:09:37,00:09:39,There's debate about what this fake thing was.
00:09:39,00:09:43,"So, what it used to do is that it used to cover itself in mud,"
00:09:43,00:09:48,"and then it used to enter the nostrils of the dragon,"
00:09:48,00:09:50,"and then it would burrow out through the dragon,"
00:09:50,00:09:52,"and that's how it would kill,"
00:09:52,00:09:53,how it would slay the dragons.
00:09:53,00:09:57,"And in Egypt, the Ichneumon was, I think, seen as a real thing."
00:09:57,00:10:00,"So, there was a sort of weasel/mongoose-type animal"
00:10:00,00:10:03,that used to chase rats and so on.
00:10:03,00:10:05,And you can read about it in history.
00:10:05,00:10:07,"So, Pliny the Elder wrote about it."
00:10:07,00:10:09,Leonardo da Vinci wrote about it.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"And I found, in the 18th century,"
00:10:11,00:10:13,an English poet called Christopher Smart wrote about it
00:10:13,00:10:16,in his poem called Jubilate Agno.
00:10:16,00:10:18,"He mentions the Ichneumon,"
00:10:18,00:10:21,but the Ichneumon's killed by a cat.
00:10:21,00:10:23,And the name of that cat is Jeff.
00:10:23,00:10:29,"Well, that was a long way round to an extremely"
00:10:29,00:10:31,"dubious piece of coincidence, wasn't it?"
00:10:31,00:10:33,This whole fact has been dubious.
00:10:33,00:10:35,"It really gives me a pause to thought, that kind of stuff."
00:10:35,00:10:39,"Come on, I think that's a beautiful coincidence."
00:10:39,00:10:42,"There have been two spooky mongoose, one called Jeff,"
00:10:42,00:10:44,"and one, the thing that called it, was called Jeff."
00:10:44,00:10:46,There's some reincarnation happening there.
00:10:46,00:10:47,"Killed, yeah."
00:10:47,00:10:48,"Called Jeffrey, as well."
00:10:48,00:10:50,"Jeffrey, yeah, Jeffrey."
00:10:50,00:10:52,"I've given him a nickname, yeah."
00:10:52,00:10:54,With a J or with a G.
00:10:54,00:10:58,"With a J, but without an E at the end."
00:10:58,00:11:01,"So, there's a lot of weird anomalies going on in their names."
00:11:01,00:11:03,J-E-O-F-F-R-Y.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"Okay, but wait a minute."
00:11:05,00:11:09,"That's a bit like Joffrey, who was in Game of Thrones."
00:11:09,00:11:10,And what do they have in Game of Thrones?
00:11:10,00:11:12,But dragons.
00:11:12,00:11:12,Mongooses.
00:11:12,00:11:14,Oh boy.
00:11:14,00:11:17,There's been a lot of thought in history
00:11:17,00:11:20,that mongooses can kind of attack and kill
00:11:20,00:11:20,other things.
00:11:20,00:11:22,"They go after snakes, for instance."
00:11:22,00:11:25,"And in real life, that does happen,"
00:11:25,00:11:27,"that mongooses and snakes attack each other,"
00:11:27,00:11:28,especially cobras.
00:11:28,00:11:32,And the mongooses are highly resistant to cobra venom.
00:11:32,00:11:34,"And often, if you put a mongoose and a cobra"
00:11:34,00:11:37,"against each other, then the mongoose will come out on top."
00:11:37,00:11:40,"So, people use the mongoose as kind of protection"
00:11:40,00:11:41,against cobras.
00:11:41,00:11:44,"And knowing this, there's a really popular Indian beer"
00:11:44,00:11:45,called Cobra beer.
00:11:45,00:11:49,"And there was a rival who brought out a new beer,"
00:11:49,00:11:51,"and they called it mongoose, because they wanted to beat"
00:11:51,00:11:53,the cobra.
00:11:53,00:11:55,"And so, whenever I have the choice between a cobra beer"
00:11:55,00:11:57,"or a mongoose beer in an Indian restaurant,"
00:11:57,00:11:58,"I always choose the mongoose one,"
00:11:58,00:12:00,because that's the one that beats the cobra.
00:12:00,00:12:01,And I think I'm the only person in the world
00:12:01,00:12:03,that that marketing has ever worked on.
00:12:03,00:12:07,"Hang on, isn't there also a kingfisher beer?"
00:12:07,00:12:08,"Yes, there is."
00:12:08,00:12:10,Where does that fit into the rock-paper-scissors world
00:12:10,00:12:12,of the cobra and the mongoose?
00:12:12,00:12:13,Kingfisher is for James's wife.
00:12:13,00:12:15,"He's sitting there going, ""Look, I'll just get a kingfisher,"
00:12:15,00:12:17,"and I'm sure about that lecture that my husband just gave you."""
00:12:18,00:12:21,"The Royal Navy used to have, you know, they used to have ships,"
00:12:21,00:12:24,cats on ships to catch rats and things.
00:12:24,00:12:27,"Lots of ships had ships mongooses,"
00:12:27,00:12:32,which were very effective at catching rats and cockroaches.
00:12:32,00:12:33,And that was a thing.
00:12:33,00:12:34,"But what we've learned from Dan, presumably,"
00:12:34,00:12:36,"is that you don't want to have a ship's cat and a ship's mongoose,"
00:12:36,00:12:38,because the cat will just eat the mongoose.
00:12:38,00:12:39,"You've got to be very careful there, right?"
00:12:39,00:12:40,Did we learn that?
00:12:40,00:12:43,"Well, wasn't it Jeff the cat who killed the mongoose?"
00:12:43,00:12:44,Yes.
00:12:45,00:12:48,"Sorry, it's all right, Andy. I drifted off halfway through that story as well."
00:12:48,00:12:54,There's going to be a quiz at the end of this section
00:12:54,00:12:56,for which facts were fake and which facts were real.
00:12:56,00:12:58,It is quite hard to keep up.
00:12:58,00:13:01,"But on real mongooses still, just for a moment,"
00:13:01,00:13:02,"they are quite vicious, aren't they?"
00:13:02,00:13:05,And they can kill each other.
00:13:05,00:13:08,"And for that reason, they all give birth in synchrony,"
00:13:08,00:13:10,"because if they didn't give birth on the same day,"
00:13:10,00:13:11,then their offspring would be killed.
00:13:11,00:13:13,So the only way you can stop other mothers
00:13:13,00:13:15,from killing your children
00:13:15,00:13:17,is if they don't know whose children are whose.
00:13:17,00:13:18,And the only way you can guarantee that
00:13:18,00:13:20,is if all the children appear at once.
00:13:20,00:13:21,That's so stressful.
00:13:21,00:13:24,"So as a kid, as a mongoose kid, you have to call everyone mum."
00:13:24,00:13:26,So they think that you're their child.
00:13:26,00:13:28,That's useful if you're in school
00:13:28,00:13:30,and you accidentally call your teacher mum.
00:13:30,00:13:34,Like some people I've heard have done in the past.
00:13:34,00:13:37,It was twice. It was literally just twice.
00:13:37,00:13:42,"And you say, ""No, no, I did it so that people didn't eat me."""
00:13:43,00:13:45,"Oh, I wish I were a mongoose."
00:13:45,00:13:47,"Just one more thing about mongoose,"
00:13:47,00:13:50,specifically their anuses are quite cool.
00:13:50,00:13:55,So they have anal glands from which they plant their scent.
00:13:55,00:13:58,And one of their tricks is to do a handstand scent.
00:13:58,00:14:01,"And so they'll mark their scent to mark their territory,"
00:14:01,00:14:03,or sometimes they'll mark scent on a potential mate
00:14:03,00:14:06,"to warn off other mates, to warn off rivals."
00:14:06,00:14:08,"And the handstand scent, what they do is what it sounds like,"
00:14:08,00:14:10,"they flip over upside down onto their hands,"
00:14:10,00:14:13,"so they can get their anus up as high as possible,"
00:14:13,00:14:16,"and then mark their scent as high up as possible,"
00:14:16,00:14:19,because that means that a rival can tell that you're quite tall.
00:14:19,00:14:23,So a rival will then smell your scent on the person they want to mate with
00:14:23,00:14:26,"and be like, ""Wow, you've managed to reach her head with your anus."
00:14:26,00:14:29,You must be really tall. I'm not going to get involved here.
00:14:29,00:14:31,"I don't know if I can take that kind of bite."""
00:14:31,00:14:35,"And then if he walks past a tree and smells the scent,"
00:14:35,00:14:41,"does he think that this is a mongoose with an anus where my head is,"
00:14:41,00:14:43,and so he must be like 10 times bigger than me?
00:14:43,00:14:44,Is that the idea of it?
00:14:44,00:14:48,It's as if no other mongoose knows about headstands.
00:14:48,00:14:50,It's like one mongoose has worked this out.
00:14:50,00:14:56,"I think maybe they all know about headstands,"
00:14:56,00:14:59,but the taller person is still going to get it higher up on a headstand.
00:14:59,00:15:01,"So if you're short, maybe you wouldn't do the headstand thing,"
00:15:01,00:15:03,because that's going to advertise that you're short.
00:15:03,00:15:08,Is it like giving your wife a basketball to carry around?
00:15:08,00:15:09,"And everyone who sees her will think,"
00:15:09,00:15:11,"""Oh, she must be going out with a really tall guy."""
00:15:11,00:15:13,"It's exactly like that, yeah."
00:15:13,00:15:16,But the idea is that all of us give our partners a basketball.
00:15:16,00:15:20,The only advantage is to the first person who does it.
00:15:20,00:15:23,"So James, cut this bit out, because I'm going to start doing that."
00:15:23,00:15:28,I'm going to get my wife to walk around with a pole vault pole.
00:15:30,00:15:34,"And people will think, ""Wow, she has to pole vault just to kiss him and be funny."""
00:15:34,00:15:39,I'm going to stick to the Janus secretion.
00:15:39,00:15:48,I just have one more haunting thing.
00:15:48,00:15:53,"There is a sweet shop in Great Yarmouth, which is explicitly not haunted."
00:15:53,00:15:56,"It seems to be the only sweet shop in the UK,"
00:15:56,00:16:00,"which goes out of its way to say, ""This is not haunted. There are no ghosts here."""
00:16:01,00:16:02,"""Is that the lady who does protest too much?"""
00:16:02,00:16:09,"It's owned by a man called Nigel Parrot, who is a very devout Christian."
00:16:09,00:16:12,"And he put the sign in his window a few years ago saying,"
00:16:12,00:16:17,"""To all my wonderful customers, this shop is definitely not haunted,"
00:16:17,00:16:20,"even though the town ghost walks appear to think it is."""
00:16:20,00:16:24,"But it gets more interesting, this sign, because he goes on,"
00:16:24,00:16:27,"""All demonic paraphernalia has been destroyed."""
00:16:27,00:16:29,"So he thinks, ""What was going on in this sweet shop?"""
00:16:29,00:16:32,And then he gets into the details.
00:16:32,00:16:36,"He says, ""Jesus Christ died, so we could be free from all other spirits and negativity."
00:16:36,00:16:41,"He is alive today, and his is the only spirit in this place."""
00:16:41,00:16:42,So apparently there is a spirit in there.
00:16:42,00:16:44,"Yeah, he's haunted by Jesus."
00:16:44,00:16:46,That's cool.
00:16:46,00:16:48,"And the BBC interviewed him, and he said,"
00:16:48,00:16:52,"""This place might have, at some time in the past, been haunted,"
00:16:52,00:16:58,"but if Jesus is alive and with me, then this shop is no longer haunted."""
00:16:58,00:16:58,Wow.
00:16:58,00:17:01,Did you see the BBC followed that up with some research?
00:17:01,00:17:04,"They looked into this Nigel character, and it turns out he died in 1673."
00:17:04,00:17:15,"Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:17:15,00:17:20,"My fact this week is that famous occultist, Alistair Crowley,"
00:17:20,00:17:24,"used to make a curry so hot that he only served it on glaciers,"
00:17:24,00:17:28,so the diners could use the snow to cool their mouth down afterwards.
00:17:28,00:17:30,Wow.
00:17:30,00:17:33,Isn't that amazing?
00:17:33,00:17:37,"Yeah, but I mean, this is not like he would invite you for dinner,"
00:17:37,00:17:42,"and then you'd get a location delivered to you, which was in a different land."
00:17:42,00:17:44,"Like he was mountaineering, wasn't he?"
00:17:44,00:17:45,He was mountaineering.
00:17:45,00:17:46,He would make this curry.
00:17:46,00:17:51,"They had no kingfisher or mongoose or cobra to wash it down with,"
00:17:51,00:17:54,"and it was so hot that people would run outside,"
00:17:54,00:17:57,and they would kind of stuff snow into their mouths.
00:17:57,00:18:02,"And in his autobiography, The Confessions of Alistair Crowley,"
00:18:02,00:18:05,"he said that some people said he should make it in London,"
00:18:05,00:18:07,but he said he would refuse to do it
00:18:07,00:18:12,because there's no glacier there or glacier there to help people.
00:18:12,00:18:13,So that's a thing.
00:18:13,00:18:15,"It's a real chicken or egg, isn't it?"
00:18:15,00:18:18,"Like, did he go to the glacier because he wanted to make the curry,"
00:18:18,00:18:21,or did he make the curry because he found himself on this glacier?
00:18:21,00:18:22,We'll probably never know.
00:18:22,00:18:25,"We'll probably never know, and probably it was just he happened to be on the glacier."
00:18:25,00:18:28,"He happened to make some curry, and that's it."
00:18:28,00:18:32,"But yeah, he wasn't a cultist, but before he became a cultist,"
00:18:32,00:18:35,"he was really a mountaineer, Alistair Crowley."
00:18:35,00:18:40,"He was known as the wickedest man in the world by the British press,"
00:18:40,00:18:42,because of various things that he did.
00:18:42,00:18:45,"At one stage, he set up an Abbey in Sicily,"
00:18:45,00:18:48,and lots of crazy stuff was happening there
00:18:48,00:18:51,to do with sex and pornography and drugs and all that kind of stuff.
00:18:51,00:18:54,"And he got kicked out of Italy by Mussolini,"
00:18:54,00:18:56,"and that made the news,"
00:18:56,00:18:58,and people started calling him the wickedest man in the world.
00:18:58,00:19:02,"But he was basically kind of a devil-worshipper,"
00:19:02,00:19:07,"Satanist, a cultist kind of guy who was just famous for doing crazy stuff."
00:19:07,00:19:10,"It does feel like the wickedest man in the world,"
00:19:10,00:19:13,"Bar, was much lower, again, pre-Hitler."
00:19:13,00:19:15,It feels like he sneaked in and got the nickname
00:19:15,00:19:17,at a time when the currency was a little bit weaker.
00:19:17,00:19:18,You're right.
00:19:18,00:19:21,"Mind you, if Mussolini's calling you a bad guy,"
00:19:21,00:19:22,then you do have to be concerned.
00:19:22,00:19:23,That's true.
00:19:23,00:19:24,"Yeah, that's true."
00:19:24,00:19:24,Yeah.
00:19:24,00:19:26,The signs were there even in his mountaineering career.
00:19:26,00:19:30,So he attempted the second highest mountain in the world
00:19:30,00:19:32,"and the third highest, didn't he?"
00:19:32,00:19:33,I think he failed at both.
00:19:33,00:19:38,"But he tried K2 in 1902, and then Kanchenjunga in 1905,"
00:19:38,00:19:40,which is the third highest mountain in the world.
00:19:40,00:19:43,And he went up there with a group who didn't get along with him
00:19:43,00:19:47,after a while and tried to depose him as their group leader.
00:19:47,00:19:51,"And then there was a big fight, and a few of his co-walkers said"
00:19:51,00:19:54,they were going to turn back and go back down the mountain.
00:19:54,00:19:55,"And so he went to bed in his tent,"
00:19:55,00:19:57,"and he heard them going back down the mountain,"
00:19:57,00:19:59,and they caused an avalanche.
00:19:59,00:20:02,And there was lots of screaming and shouting and cries for help.
00:20:02,00:20:04,And he heard all of this.
00:20:04,00:20:05,Four of them were killed.
00:20:05,00:20:06,He just sat in his tent.
00:20:06,00:20:09,And what he did was he sat in his tent listening to the screams
00:20:09,00:20:11,while everyone else in his party went to help them.
00:20:11,00:20:15,And he wrote a letter to a local paper about how he has no sympathy
00:20:15,00:20:17,for people who get involved in mountain accidents
00:20:17,00:20:19,because they should be more responsible.
00:20:19,00:20:23,"Yeah, and there was a thing about that being because he was really wicked."
00:20:23,00:20:26,"But on the other hand, it kind of felt like he was just being really stubborn"
00:20:26,00:20:28,in that case because they'd had that argument.
00:20:28,00:20:30,"And they said, right, we're going back down."
00:20:30,00:20:31,"He's like, no, look, there's going to be an avalanche."
00:20:31,00:20:33,I can see there's going to be an avalanche.
00:20:33,00:20:37,"So whatever you do, maybe go down tomorrow, but just don't go down now."
00:20:37,00:20:39,And they went down and they got stuck in the avalanche.
00:20:39,00:20:43,"And you can almost imagine him in his tent going, see, told them."
00:20:43,00:20:44,Told them that was going to happen.
00:20:44,00:20:46,"I think he was going, more curry for me."
00:20:46,00:20:51,If you have a row and you hear someone falling down the stairs
00:20:51,00:20:55,"immediately afterwards, that's a result for you."
00:20:55,00:20:58,That's the universe telling you you're right about the argument in a way.
00:20:58,00:21:01,"Well, good to know who's the Alistair Curly of this podcast."
00:21:02,00:21:04,But there was a huge storm about it afterwards.
00:21:04,00:21:07,There was a massive stuff in the press about it.
00:21:07,00:21:09,And that's kind of when he gave up mountaineering.
00:21:09,00:21:11,That was after that Catch and Chunger incident.
00:21:11,00:21:15,"And K2, I believe it was K2, he never reached the top of,"
00:21:15,00:21:17,"not because they couldn't make it up there,"
00:21:17,00:21:19,but because of differences within the team.
00:21:19,00:21:21,"Again, he fell out with the team."
00:21:21,00:21:24,"He pulled a revolver on one of the members and the guy,"
00:21:24,00:21:27,"he pulled the gun at Guy Knowles was his name, kicked him in the groin."
00:21:27,00:21:30,It will cause some tension in a group when you pull a revolver on somebody.
00:21:31,00:21:34,"But I actually, one of the things I love about Catch and Chunger,"
00:21:34,00:21:37,the third highest mountain is that no one's ever got to the top of it.
00:21:37,00:21:42,And lots of people have got to 10 meters below the top.
00:21:42,00:21:45,"And this is because local tradition has it that is,"
00:21:45,00:21:48,so it's in the Himalayas and local tradition has it that spirits live at the top
00:21:48,00:21:49,and you can't disturb them.
00:21:49,00:21:50,"And so everyone who's ever climbed it,"
00:21:50,00:21:52,"every mountaineering expedition that's been up there,"
00:21:52,00:21:54,"which is a couple of hundred people, I think,"
00:21:54,00:21:58,"out of respect for the spirit at the top, they stopped just beneath it."
00:21:58,00:21:59,That's very respectful.
00:21:59,00:21:59,It is.
00:21:59,00:22:02,But you can't imagine that Crowley would have done that.
00:22:02,00:22:03,He probably would have.
00:22:03,00:22:06,He would have got to the top and done like a Macarena on top
00:22:06,00:22:07,"or a little jig or something, wouldn't he?"
00:22:07,00:22:10,"Yeah, he would have spoken to the spirit."
00:22:10,00:22:12,"If Crowley had known about the Chillingham cattle,"
00:22:12,00:22:15,"he would have been up there and touching them all over,"
00:22:15,00:22:16,like nobody's business.
00:22:16,00:22:19,And that is an episode pullback to a hundred episodes ago.
00:22:19,00:22:24,"That was, I think it's more like 300 episodes ago."
00:22:24,00:22:26,That's amazing.
00:22:26,00:22:28,These are some cows who live in a field that James wants to touch.
00:22:28,00:22:31,"Anyway, oh, I see what you're trying to do here is deflect."
00:22:31,00:22:33,Who's the Crowley of the group?
00:22:33,00:22:33,Can you?
00:22:33,00:22:34,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:22:34,00:22:34,Yeah.
00:22:34,00:22:40,"One thing he climbed, which I think is more impressive than K2,"
00:22:40,00:22:41,is beachy head.
00:22:41,00:22:44,He climbed the cliffs at beachy head from the bottom to the top.
00:22:44,00:22:46,But he was a massive boaster about the things he did.
00:22:46,00:22:50,"He wrote, ""The general opinion was that no one had ever climbed it."
00:22:50,00:22:53,"There was, however, a legend that it had once been done."
00:22:53,00:22:58,"I settled the point by walking up, smoking a pipe with my dog,"
00:22:58,00:23:03,"and then he put in brackets, I had no woman available, in nine and a half minutes."""
00:23:03,00:23:07,"I mean, I was at beachy head a couple of weeks ago,"
00:23:07,00:23:09,and I'd struggled to climb it.
00:23:09,00:23:10,And so would my dog.
00:23:10,00:23:11,How did he get the dog to get up?
00:23:11,00:23:12,I don't know.
00:23:12,00:23:14,"He might have had a dog, Papoose."
00:23:14,00:23:17,There is an argument that a lot of the stuff in his autobiography
00:23:17,00:23:19,might have been a bit medioppy.
00:23:19,00:23:20,"Yeah, that's true."
00:23:20,00:23:24,"Might have been a bit talkingy, mongoosey, perhaps."
00:23:24,00:23:27,He claimed that it was his idea for Church Hill
00:23:27,00:23:28,to give the V-Sign.
00:23:28,00:23:32,"He said, according to some people like Rabelay"
00:23:32,00:23:36,"and some earlier writers, the V-Sign was a good way of fighting"
00:23:36,00:23:42,"against the swastika, according to kind of ancient Eastern rituals."
00:23:42,00:23:44,So he claimed that.
00:23:44,00:23:46,He also claimed that it was down to him
00:23:46,00:23:50,that Stanford Bridge football ground was aligned in the way that it's aligned.
00:23:50,00:23:53,And that he gave Chelsea Football Club its team colors of blue.
00:23:53,00:23:54,That was all down to him.
00:23:54,00:23:55,That's what he claimed.
00:23:55,00:23:55,Wow.
00:23:55,00:23:56,Wow.
00:23:56,00:24:00,"Well, once you've defeated the Nazis, what are you going to do next?"
00:24:00,00:24:02,I guess pick the team colors for a premiership team.
00:24:02,00:24:06,"This sounds like obviously bullshit that he was claiming all these things,"
00:24:06,00:24:09,"but he was quite an influential character back in the day,"
00:24:09,00:24:11,particularly with Counterculture America.
00:24:11,00:24:13,So Aldous Huxley was a big fan of his.
00:24:13,00:24:19,He very much set up a lot of ideas that got carried forward about free thinking.
00:24:19,00:24:22,"His religion that he started, which is Thelema,"
00:24:22,00:24:27,"was an idea that you do stuff for you rather than you do it on behalf of the community,"
00:24:27,00:24:32,which suddenly was this new idea that hadn't really been explored too much in the past.
00:24:32,00:24:35,"There's a great story about how he set up Thelema,"
00:24:35,00:24:40,which was it was his wife who claimed that he was going to be dictated this message
00:24:40,00:24:43,by a guardian angel called Iwas.
00:24:43,00:24:46,And she she said that he's got all these messages for you.
00:24:46,00:24:48,And he didn't believe it.
00:24:48,00:24:54,So he took her to a museum in Cairo to say you've got to show me who Horace is.
00:24:54,00:24:58,"And she didn't know when they got there, they passed a huge Horace statue."
00:24:58,00:25:00,"And he went, OK, so this is nonsense."
00:25:00,00:25:02,"She doesn't know, but she kept walking on."
00:25:02,00:25:06,"And she found this thing at the end, which Horace appeared on."
00:25:06,00:25:08,"And she went, that's the guy there."
00:25:08,00:25:10,"And he went, oh my God, that's Horace."
00:25:10,00:25:13,And he looked up the catalog number of this particular piece.
00:25:13,00:25:16,And the number was 666 in the catalog.
00:25:16,00:25:20,And so he thought this is a sign the synchronicity of this means that she's right.
00:25:20,00:25:24,"And then he went into a room for three days and he was dictated to by this guardian angel,"
00:25:24,00:25:30,"a book, which is still in publication today and is the basis of his whole religion, Thelema."
00:25:30,00:25:33,"Well, his wife was called Louise, wasn't she?"
00:25:33,00:25:37,And the book was called Thelema and Louise.
00:25:37,00:25:40,"And it got adapted, didn't it?"
00:25:40,00:25:42,His wife was called Rose.
00:25:43,00:25:48,And the sad thing is that basically within a year of her doing all of this stuff with him
00:25:48,00:25:53,"and kind of coming up with this religion, he'd dumped her and he'd found this other lady called"
00:25:53,00:25:54,Leila Waddell.
00:25:54,00:26:00,"And Leila Waddell was a violinist, apparently not a particularly good one, but an OK violinist."
00:26:00,00:26:05,"And he decided that he was going to form a band like a girl group like Little Mix,"
00:26:05,00:26:08,"but she was going to be the main person, this violinist."
00:26:08,00:26:10,They were called the ragged ragtime girls.
00:26:10,00:26:12,And apparently they were amazing.
00:26:12,00:26:16,They played in London and they absolutely pulled the house down.
00:26:16,00:26:17,Is it called pulled the house down?
00:26:17,00:26:18,Is that what you say?
00:26:18,00:26:19,Brought the house down.
00:26:19,00:26:20,They didn't pull the house down.
00:26:20,00:26:22,They brought the house down and everyone loved them.
00:26:22,00:26:25,And it looked like they were going to go on a massive tour around Europe.
00:26:25,00:26:31,"But instead, Crowley decided that he was going to go on a tour of some random parts of Russia"
00:26:31,00:26:31,instead.
00:26:31,00:26:35,"So they could have sold out every single theatre in the UK, for instance."
00:26:35,00:26:39,But he decided he was going to go to Russia and they were going to tour there instead.
00:26:39,00:26:42,And they went there and they were quite successful in Russia.
00:26:42,00:26:44,"But the reason that they went there, we think,"
00:26:44,00:26:48,is because he might have been a spy for the British government.
00:26:48,00:26:55,"And at that time, Rasputin was kind of getting his claws into the Cesarevich in Russia."
00:26:55,00:26:59,And maybe he was there to kind of look after and see what was going on with Rasputin.
00:26:59,00:27:05,And that's why this quite good girl group never made it because they had to go to Russia
00:27:05,00:27:06,with him on this trip.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"A tragedy, a great loss to music."
00:27:10,00:27:13,Crowley used to live on the banks of the Loch Ness.
00:27:13,00:27:17,And often tried to summon the Loch Ness Monster up at certain points.
00:27:17,00:27:23,But that's where he did all of his biggest achievements in the early days of spreading
00:27:23,00:27:27,the magic that he was claiming he could do.
00:27:27,00:27:32,So he was trying to summon up demons and battle them in order to make the world a better place.
00:27:32,00:27:35,"You wouldn't summon them to battle them, just send them away, surely?"
00:27:35,00:27:37,"Well, you need to battle them to make sure they don't come back."
00:27:37,00:27:39,"Yeah, it's like Buffy the Vampire Slayer."
00:27:39,00:27:41,She does not summon demons.
00:27:41,00:27:43,"Well, someone does, definitely."
00:27:43,00:27:44,"Someone does, yeah."
00:27:44,00:27:51,That house on the... Is it Bullskin House?
00:27:51,00:27:53,"Bullskine, Bullskin."
00:27:53,00:27:55,Isn't that what they make notebooks out of?
00:27:55,00:27:56,That's Moleskine.
00:27:56,00:28:01,That has burned down twice in five years.
00:28:01,00:28:06,I know. And then the owners started selling the rubble.
00:28:07,00:28:09,"Dan, you're interested in buying..."
00:28:09,00:28:11,I'd be so keen on buying the rubble.
00:28:11,00:28:15,You can get a whole bag of it for just 50 quid.
00:28:15,00:28:16,You're kidding.
00:28:16,00:28:16,No.
00:28:16,00:28:17,Are you serious?
00:28:17,00:28:20,"I don't know if it's still being sold, but you better get on it."
00:28:20,00:28:21,Don't come on.
00:28:21,00:28:25,Dan's wife and children have to put up with so many of his dodgy purchases.
00:28:25,00:28:26,What are you doing at this?
00:28:26,00:28:27,I wouldn't be allowed.
00:28:27,00:28:30,I've genuinely been told by Fenella I'm not allowed to bring Alistair Crowley's book
00:28:30,00:28:31,"into the house, she thinks."
00:28:31,00:28:31,Really?
00:28:31,00:28:35,"Yeah, because she's scared that it has powers with it."
00:28:35,00:28:39,"And also we're in lockdown, so we'd be around the spirits a lot."
00:28:39,00:28:43,"I've got quite a few of his books here, and I don't think we've had any problems here so far."
00:28:43,00:28:48,I don't think spirits have much respect for government guidelines about Covid safety.
00:28:48,00:28:50,"I think if they want to go out, they're going to go out."
00:28:50,00:28:51,They're not going to be trapped there with you.
00:28:51,00:28:54,But it's interesting.
00:28:54,00:28:56,"I mean, it's a historical house, not just if you're a Crowley fan,"
00:28:56,00:28:58,but if you're a music fan.
00:28:58,00:29:01,Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page bought that house many years ago.
00:29:01,00:29:08,And he was very obsessed with Alistair Crowley as a lot of Zeppelin fans will know.
00:29:08,00:29:11,"He's very much into black magic, but he didn't really ever live there."
00:29:11,00:29:16,"He lent it to a guy called Malcolm Dent, who looked after it and had his kids there and so on."
00:29:16,00:29:20,"And he claims that there were a lot of spooky happenings while he was living there,"
00:29:20,00:29:25,that his wife was sort of attacked by a big beast outside.
00:29:31,00:29:38,"Just one other prominent Thelomite who is quite surprising was Jack Parsons,"
00:29:38,00:29:40,who was another leading Thelomite who Crowley installed.
00:29:40,00:29:42,"And he was the father of the US space program,"
00:29:42,00:29:46,which is kind of concerning actually when you reflect on it.
00:29:46,00:29:48,So he's a rocket scientist in the 30s.
00:29:48,00:29:52,He invented things like jet engines and jet fuel needed for space flight.
00:29:52,00:29:56,And he also believed in a lot of this occult stuff.
00:29:56,00:29:59,Wasn't he the one who Elron Hubbard kind of got in with his life
00:29:59,00:30:03,and started living with him and his wife and then just ran off with his wife or something.
00:30:03,00:30:05,Ran off with his wife. That's right. Yes.
00:30:05,00:30:11,"Yeah, he did. I think he ended up having a foursome with his wife and a 17-year-old girl"
00:30:11,00:30:15,who then married Elron Hubbard and they founded Scientology.
00:30:15,00:30:18,And Parsons went on to try and conjure up a new lover
00:30:18,00:30:20,when she abandoned him for Elron Hubbard.
00:30:20,00:30:25,And he did that by masturbating onto magical tablets to the background sound of...
00:30:26,00:30:27,"This is Nicholas Parsons, did you say?"
00:30:27,00:30:34,This is the person who went on to found America's space programs.
00:30:34,00:30:35,So...
00:30:35,00:30:38,"You're not allowed hesitation, deviation or masturbation."
00:30:38,00:30:49,"Okay, it's time for fact number three."
00:30:49,00:30:50,And that is my fact.
00:30:50,00:30:53,My fact this week is that Japan's Yakuza have been told
00:30:53,00:30:55,they are no longer allowed to join in trick-or-treating.
00:30:55,00:31:00,The Yakuza is Japan's mafia for anyone who doesn't know that.
00:31:00,00:31:03,And they're a big syndicate of lots of different little groups.
00:31:03,00:31:06,This is one particular group that has been told this year
00:31:06,00:31:11,that no more trick-or-treating allowed even though everyone loves it
00:31:11,00:31:13,when the Yakuza do trick-or-treating.
00:31:13,00:31:15,It's quite funny.
00:31:15,00:31:17,They've done this in the past for many years.
00:31:17,00:31:20,It started when some kids accidentally came up to their offices
00:31:20,00:31:24,and they knocked on the door and a very startled Yakuza member
00:31:24,00:31:27,didn't know what to do and sort of fanned them off with money.
00:31:27,00:31:29,"And then they suddenly realized,"
00:31:29,00:31:32,"""Hang on, if we can get kids to come and get candy off us,"
00:31:32,00:31:33,"they might see us as good people."""
00:31:33,00:31:35,And that's really good for recruitment
00:31:35,00:31:38,because the Yakuza have a very big problem with recruitment.
00:31:38,00:31:40,A lot of their members are mid-fifties now
00:31:40,00:31:42,and they have trouble bringing in the young-ins.
00:31:42,00:31:44,I don't think it's great for your PR
00:31:44,00:31:45,if you wanted to come across as a good guy
00:31:45,00:31:49,to as an elderly gentleman start luring children to you with sweets.
00:31:49,00:31:52,[laughter]
00:31:52,00:31:55,So they're not trick-or-treating.
00:31:55,00:31:58,They're sort of being the recipients of trick-or-treating.
00:31:58,00:32:01,They invite children and they put up decorations
00:32:01,00:32:02,and they put up inflatable ghosts
00:32:02,00:32:04,and they tell people to take pictures.
00:32:04,00:32:07,"I mean, the last few times they've done it,"
00:32:07,00:32:10,about 800 parents and children have shown up.
00:32:10,00:32:13,"So it's quite, it is really popular."
00:32:13,00:32:14,The security was impeccable.
00:32:14,00:32:18,They get a lot of really good reviews.
00:32:18,00:32:20,"Yes, one local woman said,"
00:32:20,00:32:21,"""Not only were the decorations great"
00:32:21,00:32:23,"and the gift bags full of tasty stuff,"
00:32:23,00:32:25,there were two big lines for cotton candy
00:32:25,00:32:27,"and the gangsters were super nice."""
00:32:27,00:32:28,So they're...
00:32:28,00:32:29,Right.
00:32:29,00:32:32,Shame about the massive bloodbath in the living room.
00:32:32,00:32:35,"But once little Danny got over that, we had a great time."
00:32:35,00:32:40,They do have a lot of social outreach missions in the Yakuza.
00:32:40,00:32:44,"So this year, when the coronavirus thing was just beginning,"
00:32:45,00:32:49,"they offered to disinfect the Diamond Princess cruise ship,"
00:32:49,00:32:51,which had been impounded in Yokohama.
00:32:51,00:32:54,"And they said, ""Yeah, we'll do it. We're gangsters."
00:32:54,00:32:56,"We're meant to be doing the difficult, tricky jobs"
00:32:56,00:32:58,"that no one else is doing."""
00:32:58,00:33:00,"They gave out masks, they gave out toilet paper."
00:33:00,00:33:04,So they have a lot of soft power that they're using.
00:33:04,00:33:04,"Yeah, they do."
00:33:04,00:33:08,"They are, we should say, sort of not necessarily good guys."
00:33:08,00:33:10,Not necessarily.
00:33:10,00:33:13,Just because I read a piece in The Guardian
00:33:13,00:33:15,about how they are really struggling.
00:33:15,00:33:18,"And it did feel a bit like, ""God, this poor organization"
00:33:18,00:33:20,"is really on its last legs here."""
00:33:20,00:33:21,"But they do do some weird stuff,"
00:33:21,00:33:23,one of which is often sort of killing people.
00:33:23,00:33:28,Another is the habit they have of cutting off their fingers.
00:33:28,00:33:31,"So that's the probably most well-known Yakuza tradition,"
00:33:31,00:33:33,is that if you're a member of the Yakuza
00:33:33,00:33:37,"and you do something wrong, you have to cut off your finger."
00:33:37,00:33:40,"And apparently, one of the ways you can now tell"
00:33:40,00:33:42,that they are losing their membership
00:33:42,00:33:45,is that prosthetics makers are doing really well.
00:33:45,00:33:46,So there are a couple of interviews.
00:33:46,00:33:50,There was one with someone called Shintaro Hayashi in 2013
00:33:50,00:33:52,who said he's noticed he's getting loads more calls from people
00:33:52,00:33:55,who want prosthetic pinky fingers.
00:33:55,00:33:57,And that's because people have chopped off their pinkies
00:33:57,00:33:59,because they're in the Yakuza.
00:33:59,00:34:01,"Then they've decided, ""I think I might go for another job."""
00:34:01,00:34:04,And it looks bad if you don't know little finger.
00:34:04,00:34:05,And so they go for the fake finger.
00:34:05,00:34:08,That's a sign.
00:34:08,00:34:10,"And apparently, a lot of the gangsters who are higher up,"
00:34:10,00:34:13,"they have different fingers for different seasons,"
00:34:13,00:34:14,a finger to match every occasion.
00:34:14,00:34:16,So they go for a tanned finger.
00:34:16,00:34:17,"Oh, I see."
00:34:17,00:34:20,Not a kind of a pumpkin spice finger for autumn.
00:34:20,00:34:23,I was thinking like a finger that can
00:34:23,00:34:25,"hook apples off trees for the autumn, maybe."
00:34:25,00:34:26,That's so good.
00:34:26,00:34:27,Lovely.
00:34:27,00:34:31,A really long one that's like a ski pole for winter.
00:34:31,00:34:31,Brilliant.
00:34:31,00:34:32,Nice.
00:34:32,00:34:34,But it gets really tense a little bit.
00:34:34,00:34:35,A nice Christmas finger.
00:34:35,00:34:36,"Yeah, that'd be nice."
00:34:36,00:34:38,Who wouldn't like a Christmas finger?
00:34:39,00:34:40,"In spring, you could call it a springer."
00:34:40,00:34:41,Stunning.
00:34:41,00:34:42,Brilliant.
00:34:42,00:34:43,Lovely.
00:34:43,00:34:44,"I don't know what you'd have on your spring finger,"
00:34:44,00:34:48,but maybe a sort of spike so you could plant seeds in the ground.
00:34:48,00:34:50,"Ah, great idea."
00:34:50,00:34:52,I think the spike is suddenly bad for PR again.
00:34:52,00:34:56,"If you impale everyone you shake hands with,"
00:34:56,00:34:58,"yeah, maybe you're not going to get that job."
00:34:58,00:35:04,"So when the prosthetic makers are giving them new fingers,"
00:35:04,00:35:08,"I wonder if there might also be a thing about tattoo removal,"
00:35:08,00:35:12,"because they're quite famous for their tattoos, aren't they, Yakuza?"
00:35:12,00:35:16,"There was a book that came out last year called I Give You My Life,"
00:35:16,00:35:20,"which was photographs of the wives of Yakuza members,"
00:35:20,00:35:24,"because actually it's kind of interesting the way that the women are in this society,"
00:35:24,00:35:27,"because they're not considered members of the Yakuza,"
00:35:27,00:35:33,"but they are not in the way that you might think of like mafia wives and stuff,"
00:35:33,00:35:35,"kind of clueless of everything that's happening,"
00:35:35,00:35:36,especially the wives of the top level people.
00:35:36,00:35:38,They kind of know everything that's going on.
00:35:39,00:35:43,"And their tattoos kind of tell you a lot about their history and stuff like that,"
00:35:43,00:35:44,which I found really interesting.
00:35:44,00:35:48,"But I looked into the history of the tattoos in Japan,"
00:35:48,00:35:51,"and it goes all the way back to the 5th century,"
00:35:51,00:35:55,"and the Japanese government used tattoos to punish their criminals,"
00:35:55,00:35:57,and that's why the Yakuza's are so tattooed now.
00:35:57,00:35:59,It kind of goes all the way back to that.
00:35:59,00:36:03,"And if you ever did anything bad, you would get a line across your forehead,"
00:36:03,00:36:06,"and then the second one, they would put an arch over the line,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,"and the third one, they would put one extra kind of line,"
00:36:08,00:36:11,"and that did the symbol, the kanji for dog,"
00:36:11,00:36:13,"and it would like, you would have the word."
00:36:13,00:36:15,"It's like almost like if you did a crime here,"
00:36:15,00:36:17,"and the first time they put a D on your forehead,"
00:36:17,00:36:19,"second time an O, and the last time they put a G,"
00:36:19,00:36:20,and that would eventually...
00:36:20,00:36:24,"You could have said put a D, then an I, then a C, then an H."
00:36:24,00:36:28,"It's kind of the same, isn't it?"
00:36:28,00:36:30,It's like playing hangman on someone's face.
00:36:30,00:36:31,That's what I was thinking.
00:36:31,00:36:34,It'd be great if that's what they drew with hangman symbols.
00:36:34,00:36:36,"And then if they complete the thing, they hang you, right?"
00:36:36,00:36:36,"Oh, wow."
00:36:36,00:36:37,Yeah.
00:36:37,00:36:38,Wow.
00:36:38,00:36:40,"Oh, that's very punitive, but that is, wow."
00:36:40,00:36:40,Yeah.
00:36:40,00:36:41,Yeah.
00:36:41,00:36:42,"It takes a lot of goes to get there,"
00:36:42,00:36:44,"but there's always that debate, you know,"
00:36:44,00:36:47,do you draw the extra beam between the first and the horizontal?
00:36:47,00:36:49,Do you give the guy arms?
00:36:49,00:36:51,"You could say, I'm going to give you one extra cross beam,"
00:36:51,00:36:53,"because, you know, you've shown repentance."
00:36:53,00:36:54,Yeah.
00:36:54,00:36:56,It's like if the last detail on that drawing
00:36:56,00:36:58,"was to draw the fingers on the person,"
00:36:58,00:36:59,but you'd already lost seven of them.
00:37:03,00:37:06,So Japan only started doing trick or treating
00:37:06,00:37:09,and Halloween generally in 1997.
00:37:09,00:37:13,And this was as a result of Disneyland in Tokyo.
00:37:13,00:37:16,And they had their first ever Disney happy Halloween event.
00:37:16,00:37:17,And everyone loved it.
00:37:17,00:37:18,And it was sort of come here and experience
00:37:18,00:37:20,this Western thing that they do.
00:37:20,00:37:22,So everyone started doing it
00:37:22,00:37:23,and it's spread to different amusement parks.
00:37:23,00:37:25,So Universal Studios started doing it
00:37:25,00:37:29,and they had their Hollywood Halloween got bigger and bigger.
00:37:29,00:37:31,And so it's a proper thing there now.
00:37:31,00:37:32,And they have one extra element to it
00:37:32,00:37:34,"that none of us, as far as I know, do,"
00:37:34,00:37:37,which is they have a post Halloween cleanup
00:37:37,00:37:38,"on November the 1st,"
00:37:38,00:37:42,"where everyone goes back out into the streets the next day,"
00:37:42,00:37:43,"still in costume,"
00:37:43,00:37:45,and they clean up all the rubble and debris
00:37:45,00:37:47,from the night's partying that went on.
00:37:47,00:37:48,That would be so useful.
00:37:48,00:37:51,Like people could clean the feces off my front door
00:37:51,00:37:52,that get there every Halloween.
00:37:52,00:37:56,That's not just Halloween as it did.
00:37:56,00:37:59,"No, but at least it gets cleaned once again."
00:38:00,00:38:06,[Music]
00:38:06,00:38:09,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:38:09,00:38:11,And that is Andy.
00:38:11,00:38:15,My fact is that ghost crabs use teeth in their stomachs
00:38:15,00:38:16,to growl at their enemies.
00:38:16,00:38:23,So are these ghost crabs or real crabs called ghost crabs?
00:38:23,00:38:24,"These are not ghost crabs called Jeff,"
00:38:24,00:38:27,who live in the Isle of Manor Sea.
00:38:27,00:38:28,"Yeah, exactly."
00:38:28,00:38:30,So the ghost crab is a real thing.
00:38:30,00:38:36,"It's sort of small and pale and looks a bit ghostly,"
00:38:36,00:38:38,hence the kind of common name for it.
00:38:38,00:38:41,"It lives in the Atlantic beaches of the USA,"
00:38:41,00:38:41,that kind of place.
00:38:41,00:38:44,The Guardian says they're named for their sandpale bodies
00:38:44,00:38:46,and nocturnal antics.
00:38:46,00:38:50,"So I guess, yeah, active at night as well, also ghostly."
00:38:50,00:38:55,And the scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography
00:38:55,00:38:57,were looking at them because they noticed
00:38:57,00:38:59,"they could hear the crabs making a noise,"
00:38:59,00:39:03,but the crabs weren't doing anything to make a noise as it were.
00:39:03,00:39:07,"Almost like they were doing ventriloquism,"
00:39:07,00:39:10,like Bairie from the Isle of Manor.
00:39:10,00:39:11,Exactly.
00:39:11,00:39:12,It was exactly like that.
00:39:12,00:39:15,"And so they thought, well, this is curious,"
00:39:15,00:39:16,we're going to investigate.
00:39:16,00:39:18,"This is a scientist called Jennifer R.A. Taylor,"
00:39:18,00:39:20,who led this research.
00:39:20,00:39:21,And they tried a couple of things.
00:39:21,00:39:23,"They put an endoscope into the crab's mouth,"
00:39:23,00:39:27,"a tiny endoscope, and it immediately just bit it"
00:39:27,00:39:28,"and crushed it, obviously."
00:39:28,00:39:34,"So then they used a thing called laser doppler vibrometry,"
00:39:34,00:39:37,"and they bounced a laser off a crab, basically,"
00:39:37,00:39:39,and various different bits of its interior.
00:39:39,00:39:42,And they found out that it has this feature inside it
00:39:42,00:39:43,"called a gastric mill,"
00:39:43,00:39:46,which is something it uses to grind up food internally.
00:39:46,00:39:48,It's got a kind of extra mincing layer inside it.
00:39:48,00:39:49,Yeah.
00:39:49,00:39:53,And when they provoked a crab by presenting it with a hand
00:39:53,00:39:55,"or a model of another crab or whatever,"
00:39:55,00:39:59,it would make this growling noise just by rubbing together
00:39:59,00:40:01,its internal teeth in its stomach.
00:40:01,00:40:01,So cool.
00:40:01,00:40:03,So it can do it on command.
00:40:03,00:40:04,Yeah.
00:40:04,00:40:06,"Have you listened to the video of them growling, Andy?"
00:40:06,00:40:07,Yeah.
00:40:07,00:40:08,"Yeah, because it's not, we should say,"
00:40:08,00:40:12,it's not like a kind of like a dog growl.
00:40:12,00:40:16,"It's quite a high pitch, like a kind of noise."
00:40:16,00:40:18,"Yeah, can we hear exactly what it sounds like, Dan?"
00:40:18,00:40:20,Can you do a good impression?
00:40:20,00:40:21,It was like...
00:40:24,00:40:27,"But if you're a rival crab, that is a pair of..."
00:40:27,00:40:27,Yeah.
00:40:27,00:40:30,You don't want to mess with me?
00:40:30,00:40:33,"Yeah, terrifying."
00:40:33,00:40:34,"Terrifying growl, yeah."
00:40:34,00:40:36,"Yeah, but they..."
00:40:36,00:40:37,That's so cool.
00:40:37,00:40:38,It's a massive...
00:40:38,00:40:40,"Like, I have a macerated toilet downstairs in my house,"
00:40:40,00:40:42,which is when you have a...
00:40:42,00:40:44,"Yeah, no, but I just..."
00:40:44,00:40:45,"Like, that's what I relate that to."
00:40:45,00:40:46,It's...
00:40:46,00:40:47,Is that the noise it makes?
00:40:47,00:40:48,"Yeah, it's..."
00:40:48,00:40:49,"Look out, mate."
00:40:49,00:40:50,"Oh, no, not again."
00:40:50,00:40:52,"Oh, Dan!"
00:40:52,00:40:54,"What's your diet, mate?"
00:40:54,00:40:54,What's going on?
00:40:54,00:40:58,What's a macerated toilet?
00:40:58,00:41:03,"It sort of grinds it all up in a tank behind it, right?"
00:41:03,00:41:04,We've got one of my parents house as well.
00:41:04,00:41:06,It's incredibly annoying because it does make
00:41:06,00:41:08,"that rumbling, growling sound throughout the night."
00:41:08,00:41:09,It growls.
00:41:09,00:41:11,"Yeah, it growls as you flush the toilets."
00:41:11,00:41:12,"Yeah, and it's..."
00:41:12,00:41:14,"You should just install a big, old ghost crab and shit in its mouth."
00:41:14,00:41:16,God!
00:41:16,00:41:18,Jesus.
00:41:18,00:41:21,"Well, use nature."
00:41:21,00:41:22,Use what it gave us.
00:41:23,00:41:24,"And the idea is, I believe,"
00:41:24,00:41:28,"just to get back to the ghost crab in real life,"
00:41:28,00:41:33,"is if you're fighting, if you're a ghost crab,"
00:41:33,00:41:35,but you want to tell someone to fuck off at the same time
00:41:35,00:41:37,"and you don't have a voice box,"
00:41:37,00:41:39,"you can't, like, click your claws"
00:41:39,00:41:41,because you're using your claws to fight with.
00:41:41,00:41:43,"But if you do it with your stomach,"
00:41:43,00:41:45,then it frees up your hands to do some fighting.
00:41:45,00:41:46,Exactly.
00:41:46,00:41:49,"It's hands-free technology, but for crabs, it's amazing."
00:41:49,00:41:52,But what if you're fighting and also eating?
00:41:52,00:41:53,What have you got then?
00:41:53,00:41:55,Don't think you've got yourself to blame.
00:41:55,00:41:58,That's a good point.
00:41:58,00:42:00,Don't eat and fight.
00:42:00,00:42:04,"They're very fast, aren't they, these crabs?"
00:42:04,00:42:07,"They are known to be the fastest crustaceans that we have,"
00:42:07,00:42:10,and they can reach up to 3.4 miles a second.
00:42:10,00:42:16,"Per second, sorry."
00:42:16,00:42:17,"Miles per second, yeah."
00:42:17,00:42:18,Miles per second.
00:42:18,00:42:20,"Well, that is, that's always the fastest thing known to man."
00:42:22,00:42:25,"Sorry, I think you've missed the end on your..."
00:42:25,00:42:28,"Anna, don't say 3.4 miles per second."
00:42:28,00:42:31,"I think if someone's about to shit in your mouth,"
00:42:31,00:42:32,you'd go away that fast as well.
00:42:32,00:42:35,"Sorry, okay, got it."
00:42:35,00:42:36,That is incredible.
00:42:36,00:42:38,So they can go off to the Atlantic in an hour or so.
00:42:38,00:42:43,"It's amazing they're not more widespread, yeah, yeah."
00:42:43,00:42:44,They're the fastest crustaceans.
00:42:44,00:42:46,That's why they called the ghosts.
00:42:46,00:42:48,"You say it's there, you turn around to tell someone,"
00:42:48,00:42:50,and it's not there anymore.
00:42:51,00:42:52,"So, sorry, how fast can they go?"
00:42:52,00:42:53,Can we stop?
00:42:53,00:42:57,They can run up to 10 miles per hour is what I read.
00:42:57,00:43:01,"Or three meters per second, in fact."
00:43:01,00:43:06,That sounds more legitimate than what I said before.
00:43:06,00:43:10,"It is still fast, but now it sounds really crap,"
00:43:10,00:43:12,given how fast everyone thought they were going.
00:43:12,00:43:16,One reason we know how they're so fast
00:43:16,00:43:19,is that they did put ghost crabs on a treadmill.
00:43:20,00:43:21,Did they?
00:43:21,00:43:26,"Which, as we all know, they've put all animals on a treadmill."
00:43:26,00:43:29,"But I can say, and I did look really hard for this,"
00:43:29,00:43:32,I've never found a study which put a mongoose on a treadmill.
00:43:32,00:43:35,So that should have been my fact here.
00:43:35,00:43:40,"But yeah, there was a study in 1990 by W.J. Van Aert in South Africa"
00:43:40,00:43:42,where he put ghost crabs on a treadmill
00:43:42,00:43:45,and found that they could run for two hours before getting tired.
00:43:45,00:43:47,"Whoa, that's amazing."
00:43:47,00:43:48,"Did he, I have a question."
00:43:48,00:43:50,Did he put them on the treadmill?
00:43:50,00:43:51,Did he put the treadmill sideways?
00:43:51,00:43:56,"Well, no, it doesn't really matter which direction the treadmill is."
00:43:56,00:43:57,Of course it does.
00:43:57,00:43:58,But you would put the crab on the sideways.
00:43:58,00:44:00,"Yeah, yeah, but you would just put the crab on the sideways."
00:44:00,00:44:03,"You wouldn't change the direction of your treadmill, would you?"
00:44:03,00:44:05,That's just a matter of perspective.
00:44:05,00:44:07,"If you wanted to do sideways running in a gym,"
00:44:07,00:44:09,"you wouldn't have to go to the person at the desk and say,"
00:44:09,00:44:11,"""Sorry, can you turn this treadmill around"
00:44:11,00:44:13,"because I have to do some sideways running."""
00:44:13,00:44:15,I'm banned from all the gyms in South London
00:44:15,00:44:17,for dragging the equipment around.
00:44:17,00:44:23,I'm surprised they work on treadmills
00:44:23,00:44:26,because don't they run in a weird way where they sprint really fast
00:44:26,00:44:28,and then they stop and then they sprint and then they stop.
00:44:28,00:44:32,And I think they think that's about that lactic acid builds up.
00:44:32,00:44:34,"If you sprint, as we remember from biology,"
00:44:34,00:44:35,"and to get rid of that waste product,"
00:44:35,00:44:38,you stop and then your body disposes of it.
00:44:38,00:44:39,"So I would have thought on a treadmill,"
00:44:39,00:44:40,they're going to go flying off the back.
00:44:40,00:44:42,You're also moving sideways.
00:44:42,00:44:46,That's the problem is that you go from side to side across the treadmill.
00:44:46,00:44:48,"They're like that, ""Okay, go video."""
00:44:48,00:44:54,"No, the thing which they do with stopping occasionally,"
00:44:54,00:44:57,that is when they're being pursued by a predator.
00:44:57,00:44:57,They use that trick.
00:44:57,00:45:00,Not when they're generally at the gym.
00:45:00,00:45:03,I think clearing...
00:45:03,00:45:05,"As in, do we know how they're clearing lactic acid"
00:45:05,00:45:07,or does it just naturally dissipate if they stop for a bit?
00:45:07,00:45:08,I think that's it.
00:45:08,00:45:09,"Yeah, same with us."
00:45:09,00:45:10,"As soon as you stop,"
00:45:10,00:45:12,"then you'd repay your oxygen debt or whatever, don't you?"
00:45:12,00:45:13,"Wow, it's amazing."
00:45:13,00:45:15,Anything can catch them really at the speeds
00:45:15,00:45:16,we know they can go now.
00:45:16,00:45:21,I didn't even know treadmills could go that fast.
00:45:21,00:45:26,Have you guys just on crabs in general?
00:45:26,00:45:29,Have you heard of mitten crabs?
00:45:29,00:45:30,These are a huge problem.
00:45:30,00:45:33,"Kind of hard to remember them, but I don't know."
00:45:33,00:45:34,"Yeah, so this is the thing."
00:45:34,00:45:36,They're also called the Shanghai Hairy Crab.
00:45:36,00:45:39,"And basically, they look like they're wearing mittens."
00:45:39,00:45:43,They've got these huge hairy claws at their front.
00:45:43,00:45:46,And they are a traditional food in China.
00:45:46,00:45:47,"They get eaten a lot,"
00:45:47,00:45:49,but they're also unbelievably successful around the world.
00:45:49,00:45:52,They're in the world's top 100 most invasive species.
00:45:52,00:45:53,They're so popular in China.
00:45:53,00:45:57,They're vending machines sometimes with live crabs inside them
00:45:57,00:45:58,that you can...
00:45:58,00:45:58,Wow.
00:45:58,00:45:59,"I know, you can just buy."
00:45:59,00:46:04,China even has a museum shaped like a giant hairy crab.
00:46:04,00:46:10,I'm trying to sort of imagine how a crab works in a vending machine
00:46:10,00:46:11,because do they have to hang from those bits
00:46:11,00:46:12,that the chocolate bars hang from?
00:46:13,00:46:14,Just sounds.
00:46:14,00:46:15,I think they're wrapped.
00:46:15,00:46:16,I think they're wrapped up.
00:46:16,00:46:17,That's how you transport them traditionally
00:46:17,00:46:18,is you bind their claws up and things.
00:46:18,00:46:20,"I think it's like the chocolate bar thing, isn't it?"
00:46:20,00:46:23,But you have to turn the entire vending machine
00:46:23,00:46:26,around 90 degrees so that they can come out sideways.
00:46:26,00:46:31,You'd be so annoyed if your crab was...
00:46:31,00:46:33,If you just stuck out a claw and got hanging off the edge.
00:46:33,00:46:35,And then you did that again and again and again.
00:46:35,00:46:37,And every crab did a little crab conga.
00:46:37,00:46:39,"It would be good to have, you know,"
00:46:39,00:46:42,those claw machines that kind of pick up things
00:46:42,00:46:44,to have one of those picking up crabs.
00:46:44,00:46:45,Yes.
00:46:45,00:46:47,Because they'd think it was sort of giant crab god
00:46:47,00:46:50,coming to pick them up and take them up to crab heaven.
00:46:50,00:46:53,What a good way to go.
00:46:53,00:46:57,And I have some more spooky crabs you can have.
00:46:57,00:47:01,"Yeti crabs, vampire crabs, zombie crabs, cannibal crabs,"
00:47:01,00:47:05,"or wizard crabs, which do you fancy."
00:47:05,00:47:06,"Oh, wizard crab please."
00:47:06,00:47:07,"Wizard crab, yeah."
00:47:07,00:47:11,"Okay, so this is a crab that has the Latin name"
00:47:11,00:47:13,Harry Plax Severus.
00:47:13,00:47:15,"Okay, it's quite a nice story actually."
00:47:15,00:47:18,"So it's, you would think that that was named"
00:47:18,00:47:20,"after Harry Potter, right?"
00:47:20,00:47:23,Because you've got Severus name and you've got Harry Potter.
00:47:23,00:47:25,But actually they were discovered
00:47:25,00:47:28,"by a guy called Harry Conley, hence the Harry."
00:47:28,00:47:31,And the word Severus comes from the Latin for rigorous
00:47:31,00:47:35,because he was an amateur collector of crabs.
00:47:35,00:47:38,And he spent his whole life really rigorously kind of going
00:47:38,00:47:41,through these kind of piles of rubble looking for crabs.
00:47:41,00:47:44,"They, he found it and it was only found to be a new"
00:47:44,00:47:46,"species 20 years after he died, but they named it after him."
00:47:46,00:47:51,And the person who named it did admit that they did
00:47:51,00:47:53,very much like Harry Potter.
00:47:53,00:47:54,And there was a double meaning.
00:47:54,00:47:58,But at the same time it was named after this Harry
00:47:58,00:48:00,and the Severus meaning rigorous.
00:48:00,00:48:00,So that's great.
00:48:00,00:48:02,"And then are they, are they called wizard crabs"
00:48:02,00:48:03,because of the Harry Potter thing?
00:48:03,00:48:06,Or was this guy actually called wizard junior?
00:48:06,00:48:07,He was a Satanist.
00:48:07,00:48:09,"He, he was a black magician."
00:48:09,00:48:10,I'll be honest.
00:48:10,00:48:13,That was my calling them wizard crabs.
00:48:13,00:48:17,"Oh, they're not called wizard crabs."
00:48:17,00:48:19,"They're kind of wizardy crabs, aren't they?"
00:48:19,00:48:21,Because they're kind of like Harry Potter.
00:48:21,00:48:21,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:48:21,00:48:22,"Definitely, definitely."
00:48:22,00:48:24,"If they don't have a common name yet,"
00:48:24,00:48:25,you can give them a common name.
00:48:25,00:48:28,"Well, I didn't realize that we, we had that kind of power."
00:48:28,00:48:29,I think we do.
00:48:29,00:48:29,Very exciting.
00:48:29,00:48:30,I think we can try it out.
00:48:30,00:48:33,"We could push them, push the envelope."
00:48:33,00:48:35,So do any of these crabs have the actual common name
00:48:35,00:48:35,that you've given them?
00:48:35,00:48:37,"Or were you, or are you just bluffing us"
00:48:37,00:48:39,with your zombie crabs and your vampire crabs?
00:48:39,00:48:42,Yeti crabs and vampire crabs are real.
00:48:42,00:48:42,Okay.
00:48:42,00:48:45,Zombie crabs are crabs that are turned into zombies
00:48:45,00:48:47,and cannibal crabs are crabs that eat other crabs.
00:48:47,00:48:50,What do you mean crabs are turned into zombies?
00:48:50,00:48:50,Yeah.
00:48:50,00:48:55,"So there is a barnacle called loxothilacus panopaii,"
00:48:55,00:48:57,otherwise known as loxo.
00:48:57,00:49:01,And they will find a recently malted female crab
00:49:01,00:49:04,and they'll go into her undercarriage
00:49:04,00:49:07,and lay their eggs in there.
00:49:07,00:49:08,And they'll turn them into a zombie.
00:49:08,00:49:12,So all they'll do is look after these baby barnacles.
00:49:12,00:49:15,And the worst thing is that if there's two
00:49:15,00:49:17,"of these crabs in a couple,"
00:49:17,00:49:20,they'll take the male and also infect the male
00:49:20,00:49:21,and change his anatomy.
00:49:21,00:49:25,So he looks a bit like a female and acts like a female.
00:49:25,00:49:26,"And the male and the female,"
00:49:26,00:49:29,"both of whom now look and act like females,"
00:49:29,00:49:32,all just look after these baby barnacles
00:49:32,00:49:33,because they're like zombies.
00:49:33,00:49:34,That's all they can do.
00:49:34,00:49:37,And they just sit there while these baby barnacles
00:49:37,00:49:39,are just eating off them and being born off them.
00:49:39,00:49:40,You love her.
00:49:40,00:49:41,Yeah.
00:49:41,00:49:42,"So the crab is,"
00:49:42,00:49:43,"oh yeah, the crab is the zombie, I guess,"
00:49:43,00:49:46,and the barnacle is the guy in charge.
00:49:46,00:49:46,Is the--
00:49:46,00:49:47,It's the wizard.
00:49:47,00:49:51,I can only think of the word wizard now.
00:49:51,00:49:53,The only feasible capillary I have.
00:49:53,00:49:56,The barnacle is like the zombie plague
00:49:56,00:49:58,that turns everything into zombies.
00:49:58,00:49:59,"Yeah, got it."
00:50:00,00:50:02,Yeti crabs are quite cool.
00:50:02,00:50:04,They were only discovered in 2005
00:50:04,00:50:05,and they really are called yeti crabs.
00:50:05,00:50:10,And they farm their own food on their arms.
00:50:10,00:50:12,"So they're really cute, actually."
00:50:12,00:50:14,They look like a cuddly toy
00:50:14,00:50:17,"because they've got these really hairy, shaggy arms."
00:50:17,00:50:19,A bit like the crab that Andy was describing earlier.
00:50:19,00:50:22,And huge colonies of bacteria live there in their heads
00:50:22,00:50:25,"because it's such a nice, wet, hairy environment to live in."
00:50:25,00:50:27,And then they just spend their days eating the bacteria.
00:50:27,00:50:30,"It's quite nice, although probably not"
00:50:30,00:50:35,if you met a human who kind of farmed bacteria on their arms
00:50:35,00:50:36,and they lived off eating that.
00:50:36,00:50:37,Probably you wouldn't--
00:50:37,00:50:39,Nice wouldn't be the adjective.
00:50:39,00:50:39,No.
00:50:39,00:50:40,It's really--
00:50:40,00:50:42,What student hasn't licked their armpits
00:50:42,00:50:44,for sustenance on a particularly low day?
00:50:44,00:50:46,Come on.
00:50:46,00:50:50,So vampire crabs are kind of--
00:50:50,00:50:52,They're quite beautiful crabs.
00:50:52,00:50:54,They've got glowing eyes.
00:50:54,00:50:56,They're really lots of amazing colors.
00:50:56,00:50:59,"They're often quite dark purple, a bit kind of draculary."
00:50:59,00:51:03,And they've become quite popular pets quite recently.
00:51:03,00:51:05,And the thing is that you can't really breed crabs
00:51:05,00:51:06,because they're all cannibals.
00:51:06,00:51:08,"Like I said, they kind of eat each other."
00:51:08,00:51:11,And so the only way to get these vampire crabs
00:51:11,00:51:13,is to go and find them at source.
00:51:13,00:51:16,"So there's people in Southeast Asia who will go down,"
00:51:16,00:51:18,"search for these crabs, and they'll bring them back"
00:51:18,00:51:20,and then sell them onto dealers.
00:51:20,00:51:23,"Now, a lot of them are very interesting colors"
00:51:23,00:51:24,that are really good for pets.
00:51:24,00:51:28,And if you know where to find a particularly nice purpley one
00:51:28,00:51:29,"with bright green eyes,"
00:51:29,00:51:31,"then you're not going to tell anyone else where that is,"
00:51:31,00:51:34,"right, because you want to have your stash."
00:51:34,00:51:36,And so people have been doing that.
00:51:36,00:51:39,And they found that some of the species
00:51:39,00:51:41,that are quite popular for pet owners
00:51:41,00:51:43,are actually brand new species
00:51:43,00:51:45,that have never been described ever before.
00:51:45,00:51:47,And they can't find out where they're from
00:51:47,00:51:49,because the dealers won't tell them where they found them.
00:51:49,00:51:51,Right.
00:51:51,00:51:51,That's them.
00:51:51,00:51:52,Very cool.
00:51:52,00:51:54,I'm out of spooky.
00:51:55,00:51:59,I've got the orangutan crab.
00:51:59,00:51:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:51:59,00:52:02,"Which, if a crab was going to a Halloween party,"
00:52:02,00:52:04,might dress up as an orangutan.
00:52:04,00:52:05,"Like, that's the only connection I could make,"
00:52:05,00:52:06,"really, the Halloween thing."
00:52:06,00:52:09,But it's really beautiful to look at.
00:52:09,00:52:10,It looks like an orangutan.
00:52:10,00:52:14,It's ginger red-brown hair all over.
00:52:14,00:52:18,And the hair catches the debris of animals coming by.
00:52:18,00:52:20,So it traps itself in its hair.
00:52:20,00:52:24,So it can just eat the food that's stuck in its arms and so on.
00:52:24,00:52:25,Nice.
00:52:25,00:52:26,"But it's good for camouflage as well, I think,"
00:52:26,00:52:29,because doesn't it sort of suck up debris as it goes?
00:52:29,00:52:30,So you can't see it.
00:52:30,00:52:32,"Actually, speaking of camouflage,"
00:52:32,00:52:34,"the ghost crabs that we're talking about at the start,"
00:52:34,00:52:37,"they are kind of, some of them are quite sandy-colored"
00:52:37,00:52:40,"in a light sand, as in dry sand."
00:52:40,00:52:43,"And some of them are quite sandy-colored in a dark sand,"
00:52:43,00:52:44,which is like wet sand.
00:52:44,00:52:47,"And what they do is they know what color they are,"
00:52:47,00:52:49,"and they'll run to the area,"
00:52:49,00:52:51,which is most like whatever their color is.
00:52:51,00:52:53,Just desperate to match.
00:52:53,00:52:55,"But they can, I think, change, can't they?"
00:52:55,00:52:57,But it's not as quick as a chameleon.
00:52:57,00:52:59,"So I think they lifted up the light-colored ones,"
00:52:59,00:53:02,"living in light sand, plopped them in dark sand,"
00:53:02,00:53:03,and they can camouflage themselves
00:53:03,00:53:05,"and turn themselves the color of the dark sand,"
00:53:05,00:53:06,but it takes about a month.
00:53:06,00:53:08,"So for that month, they're sitting there on the dark sand,"
00:53:08,00:53:09,really flashing like a beacon.
00:53:09,00:53:12,"And then eventually, if they survive that,"
00:53:12,00:53:13,they've turned the right color.
00:53:13,00:53:17,"And it's shore crabs, they can camouflage themselves too,"
00:53:17,00:53:19,"but when noisy ships sail nearby,"
00:53:19,00:53:21,it takes them way longer to change.
00:53:21,00:53:22,They can't do it as quickly.
00:53:22,00:53:23,"Oh, really? Really?"
00:53:23,00:53:26,"And this is a problem, because if they're not changing color,"
00:53:26,00:53:27,then they're much likelier to be preyed on.
00:53:27,00:53:29,And it's basically because they're stressed.
00:53:29,00:53:31,"They're stressed by the noise of the sea,"
00:53:31,00:53:32,and that takes energy.
00:53:32,00:53:34,Is that a bit like those of us who can't really work to music?
00:53:34,00:53:37,It's more life and death than not being able to work to music.
00:53:37,00:53:38,"But yeah, if you like."
00:53:38,00:53:40,"My job is my life, actually."
00:53:40,00:53:45,But then some of us work better to music.
00:53:45,00:53:48,I work better having a load of crazy J-pop going in my ears
00:53:48,00:53:49,when I'm working.
00:53:49,00:53:51,So are there some kind of...
00:53:51,00:53:54,Are there some crabs that just love ships going fast?
00:53:54,00:53:55,I don't think so.
00:53:55,00:53:56,"And they're just like, ""Oh, yeah, nice one."
00:53:56,00:53:58,I can get everything done.
00:53:58,00:54:00,"I can collect a load of crustaceans today."""
00:54:00,00:54:04,And usually it's better for exercise.
00:54:04,00:54:06,"So any time a crab's on a treadmill,"
00:54:06,00:54:08,"you know, it's probably better to appreciate the music."
00:54:08,00:54:12,"Okay, that's it."
00:54:12,00:54:13,That is all of our facts.
