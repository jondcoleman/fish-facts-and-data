00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:22,520
 Hello and welcome to a special Halloween edition of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,720
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,520
 My name is Dan-

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,720
 >> Uh-oh, yeah, she's excellent.

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,200
 >> I felt like it needed that.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,720
 >> Needed what?

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,480
 I didn't hear anything.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,560
 >> [LAUGH]

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,400
 >> Yeah, no, actually me neither, sorry.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,320
 >> [LAUGH]

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,480
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,360
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski, and Andrew Hunter Murray.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,840
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,840
 favorite facts from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,200
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,480
 My fact this week is that in the 1930s,

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,640
 the ghost of a swearing mongoose led the BBC to revise its working conditions.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,520
 >> [LAUGH]

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,320
 >> This is quite a story, so Seldin, right.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,240
 So there was this guy called Rex Lambert, and he worked at the BBC.

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,000
 He was the editor of the BBC magazine, The Listener.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,880
 And he got interested in a story of a talking mongoose who lived at that time

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,920
 on the Isle of Man.

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,320
 So he went to the Isle of Man, investigated this talking mongoose,

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,960
 and wrote, kind of published a book about it.

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,440
 Anyway, he had a rival, a career rival who sat on the board of the BFI with him,

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,080
 which he was also on, who decided to use this to bring him down.

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,960
 So accused Rex of being a crazy, crazy man, because he believed in this talking

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
 mongoose.

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,840
 And essentially, Rex sued this other guy for slander, and he won.

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,920
 And that whole case kind of drew into sharp relief the fact that the BBC wasn't

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,440
 treating its employees very well, because the BBC was a little bit unlawed,

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,560
 Reeth were a little bit like, yeah, this Rex guy, you're right,

35
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,160
 he does sound like a bit of a loon.

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,920
 And so after that, then the government got involved and was like, look, BBC,

37
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,560
 you've got to start treating your staff better, even if they do believe in

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,560
 talking mongoose and sort your act out.

39
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,960
 And they did, they changed their rules and policies.

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,480
 >> I feel a bit sorry for Rex Lambert, because whenever you look him up on

41
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,280
 the internet, all you can find is one that he believed in talking mongooses.

42
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,560
 And two that he once said in his magazine, The Listener,

43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,920
 television won't matter in your lifetime or mine.

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,720
 >> Yeah.

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
 >> That's the only two things he's remembered for.

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,760
 >> Well, but he did die two weeks after saying that, and he was speaking to

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,600
 the world's oldest man at the time, so actually.

48
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,640
 >> And then the batteries had gone in that guy's remote, haven't they?

49
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,080
 >> Yeah.

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,760
 >> Hey, we're being a bit rude here, this mongoose has a name, Anna.

51
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,240
 >> Sorry, yeah, the mongoose has a name, it's called Jeff.

52
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,920
 Jeff, the talking mongoose, spelled G-E-F.

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,200
 >> I've read that he also may not have completely been a mongoose.

54
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,080
 I mean, for one thing, he was a ghost, so the ghosts have a species.

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,520
 And secondly, he was also described as a man weasel, which is even spookier, really.

56
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,080
 >> He kind of sometimes claimed to be a mongoose.

57
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,120
 He sometimes claimed to be an extra clever mongoose.

58
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,680
 And then sometimes he claimed to be part of the fifth dimension.

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,240
 And then sometimes claimed to be the eighth wonder of the world, so, you know.

60
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,280
 >> Yeah, he used to say, I'm a freak, I have hands and I have feet.

61
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,120
 And if you saw me, you'd faint, you'd be petrified, mummified, turned into stone or

62
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,240
 a pillar of salt, that was kind of like his catchphrase.

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,400
 >> He sounds like a rapper.

64
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
 >> Yeah, why are you talking like he was M&M?

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,840
 >> To be honest, the bit where you'd be petrified, mummified, it sounds like it's

66
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,440
 going to end with, why it might be grease lightning, that's where I was heading with that.

67
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,680
 >> Yeah, he had a bit of an identity crisis, Jeff, he'd changed from one moment to the next.

68
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,360
 >> We should probably mention that he, we're just going to talk about Jeff presumably,

69
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,560
 rather than PBC working conditions.

70
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,320
 He was a mongoose who appeared first to be in the Isle of Man in 1931, I think,

71
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,240
 in the house of a guy called James Irving and his family.

72
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,920
 And first he was described as a yellow and

73
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,200
 brown rat-like animal with a long, bushy tail.

74
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,000
 And he was a bit of a sensation.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,280
 He became quite famous throughout the country for a while.

76
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,640
 >> Did he ever appear to anyone outside the house of James Irving?

77
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,440
 >> Some people heard him, certainly.

78
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,880
 Their good friend heard him sort of talking outside the porch.

79
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,320
 Although coincidentally, it happened that their daughter, Vori,

80
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,880
 was known to be a skilled ventriloquist and also was very good at impersonating animals.

81
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,720
 >> Was she drinking a glass of water at the time?

82
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,360
 Because that sets the deal on it.

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,680
 >> He did used to go to the market with them.

84
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,080
 >> He got the bus into town.

85
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,000
 >> Really? I didn't hear the bus.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,560
 >> Brought back gossip about the neighbours.

87
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,600
 >> Yeah, really?

88
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,200
 >> He sometimes used to live underneath the floorboards of the bus company

89
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,360
 so that he could listen to what the bus drivers were saying.

90
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,400
 >> Oh, wow.

91
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,360
 >> Did he?

92
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,280
 >> Wait, is this true or are you guys just making this up now?

93
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,760
 >> So, right, basically all of this is false, right?

94
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,920
 Is this, this is kind of, this is a ghost that was claimed by this family

95
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,440
 and became famous for a little while.

96
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,400
 But we are all four of us on the side of it not existing?

97
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
 >> Seriously guys, I go away for one week.

98
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,120
 You have Rhys Darby on.

99
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,400
 When I come back, all of you are paid up members of Spook Club.

100
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,400
 >> I mean, his story has holes in it, doesn't it?

101
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,000
 He claims that he was born in Delhi in 1852.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,040
 So that he was 80 years at the time when he first appeared.

103
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,080
 No backstory of how he made it to the Isle of Man.

104
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,560
 No big trip sort of revealed in all his tours.

105
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,800
 >> Oh, I thought that it was that the neighbours had brought in some mongooses

106
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,200
 from outside of the Isle of Man to kind of chase after Berman.

107
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,080
 >> And Jeff was one.

108
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,760
 >> And Jeff was one of them, yeah.

109
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,360
 >> Jeff, the classic Delhi name.

110
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,000
 >> Well, it's G-E-F, isn't it?

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,840
 He spelled it himself.

112
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,120
 When they asked him, "What's your name?"

113
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,440
 They originally called him Jack and they said,

114
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,320
 "Okay, what's your name?"

115
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,480
 And he said, "Oh, it's Jeff, G-E-F."

116
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,560
 So he gave the name himself.

117
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,120
 >> He did.

118
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,600
 Although he wasn't very good at speaking any Indian language.

119
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,640
 So they talked about him like he was a great linguist.

120
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,920
 He was fluent in English

121
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,560
 and he did seem to pick up other languages very quickly as well.

122
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,600
 But he only knew sort of, I think he knew the word Hindu

123
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,840
 and he knew sort of one or two other words

124
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,880
 that everyone would have known at the time.

125
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,840
 >> It's not enough to get by.

126
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,200
 It's not enough to get by an Indian.

127
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,680
 >> He didn't know how to say bottle of beer, for instance.

128
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
 That was one that he really struggled with.

129
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,520
 [laughter]

130
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,160
 >> When this was investigated more fully,

131
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,720
 the hairs of the ghost mongoose were found out to be the hairs of a dog

132
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,800
 and the imprints of Jeff's paws had been made with a stick, it turned out.

133
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,680
 So, yeah.

134
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,680
 >> But they did, this is how not seriously people were taking it,

135
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,440
 but how much it caught on in the news.

136
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,040
 I think it was just silly news season

137
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,880
 because they sent them to the British Museum, didn't they?

138
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,440
 And the British Museum analysed the footprints.

139
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,760
 >> Well, it's the 1930s, wasn't it?

140
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,080
 >> Yeah.

141
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,120
 >> It feels like it was a bit of a whole silly season, the 1930s.

142
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
 Apart from the Great Depression and the...

143
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,840
 >> Rise of fascism.

144
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,160
 >> Yeah, apart from that, there was a chance

145
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,400
 to have a bit of a breather after the First World War.

146
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,520
 >> Yeah.

147
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,800
 >> When the reporter from the Daily Dispatch went over to see this supposed mongoose,

148
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,200
 again, didn't see it but heard it talking,

149
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,240
 apparently the mongoose gave him a tip for the Grand National, which is quite good.

150
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,440
 On another occasion, he sang three verses of the Manx National Anthem,

151
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,560
 then two verses of the Spanish National Anthem,

152
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,200
 followed by one verse of the Welsh National Anthem.

153
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,440
 >> Well, they're all very well known in India,

154
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,040
 so that must be where he picked those up.

155
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,240
 >> It's so weird.

156
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,280
 >> I think in an attempt to inject a bit of realism into it,

157
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,120
 at one point, James Irving said,

158
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,040
 "Yeah, he is very good at languages,

159
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,000
 and he actually can speak fluent Flemish,

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,480
 but he's not infallible because he thinks it's German."

161
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,920
 So, Jeff spoke Flemish, but believing it was German.

162
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,480
 >> So, this Lambert guy who went over,

163
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,680
 the person he took over with him to investigate was Harry Price,

164
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,920
 who is one of the great ghost hunters of the sort of that boom of ghost hunting,

165
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,560
 like Hans Holzer, who Ghostbusters was based on.

166
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,200
 They were the first people who went to all these locations,

167
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,520
 wrote these big books, and he had his ghost hunting kit with him,

168
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,760
 because there used to be goggles that they would wear

169
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,920
 that they could claim would help you to see spirits.

170
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,560
 Arthur Conan Doyle famously owed a pair as well.

171
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,760
 He used to go ghost hunting.

172
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,640
 >> Of course he did.

173
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,240
 Every single time we talk about anything dubious that anyone ever believed in,

174
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,480
 is we are the Conan Doyle's in there somewhere.

175
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,920
 He's just getting involved.

176
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,080
 He's like, "Oh, it's something that's definitely not true.

177
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,000
 Yeah, I'll stick my ear in. It's great."

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,600
 >> That's true.

179
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,160
 But so, he would have cameras that the idea would be is,

180
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,520
 the camera would have trigger weights and a trigger thermograph on it.

181
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,880
 So, if the temperature suddenly changed drastically in a room,

182
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
 it would trigger the camera to take a photo.

183
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,440
 And he used to have sort of matches with him,

184
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,720
 and the matches were not only to help him see in the dark,

185
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,400
 but they were also to entice a ghost to respond

186
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
 if the ghost used to be a smoker.

187
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,000
 So, he'd pull out the matches and think that maybe the ghost would be like,

188
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,920
 "Ooh, thank you, a light. Yes, please."

189
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,960
 >> That's so funny.

190
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,600
 >> Well, just a cigarette suddenly appears floating in the air.

191
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,080
 >> Yeah.

192
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,240
 >> Floats towards your match.

193
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,680
 >> Hey, have you guys heard of the Ichneumon?

194
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,160
 >> The wasp.

195
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,400
 >> No.

196
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,040
 >> No, so there is the wasp,

197
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,960
 but there's a mythological mongoose known as the Ichneumon.

198
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,680
 >> Oh, cool.

199
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,160
 >> And it used to exist back in the day.

200
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,720
 So, this is another sort of fabled mongoose,

201
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,240
 but it used to slay dragons.

202
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,800
 That was the belief of how, yeah.

203
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,720
 So, this is not a gigantic mongoose.

204
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,280
 This was a regular size mongoose/weasel.

205
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,840
 There's debate about what this fake thing was.

206
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,840
 So, what it used to do is that it used to cover itself in mud,

207
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,480
 and then it used to enter the nostrils of the dragon,

208
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
 and then it would burrow out through the dragon,

209
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,000
 and that's how it would kill,

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,920
 how it would slay the dragons.

211
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,600
 And in Egypt, the Ichneumon was, I think, seen as a real thing.

212
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,880
 So, there was a sort of weasel/mongoose-type animal

213
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,120
 that used to chase rats and so on.

214
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,600
 And you can read about it in history.

215
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,360
 So, Pliny the Elder wrote about it.

216
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,680
 Leonardo da Vinci wrote about it.

217
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,280
 And I found, in the 18th century,

218
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,600
 an English poet called Christopher Smart wrote about it

219
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,480
 in his poem called Jubilate Agno.

220
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,080
 He mentions the Ichneumon,

221
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,040
 but the Ichneumon's killed by a cat.

222
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,120
 And the name of that cat is Jeff.

223
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,360
 Well, that was a long way round to an extremely

224
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
 dubious piece of coincidence, wasn't it?

225
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,280
 This whole fact has been dubious.

226
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,760
 It really gives me a pause to thought, that kind of stuff.

227
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,040
 Come on, I think that's a beautiful coincidence.

228
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,640
 There have been two spooky mongoose, one called Jeff,

229
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,960
 and one, the thing that called it, was called Jeff.

230
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,640
 There's some reincarnation happening there.

231
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,440
 Killed, yeah.

232
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,960
 Called Jeffrey, as well.

233
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,560
 Jeffrey, yeah, Jeffrey.

234
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,480
 I've given him a nickname, yeah.

235
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,160
 With a J or with a G.

236
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,080
 With a J, but without an E at the end.

237
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,520
 So, there's a lot of weird anomalies going on in their names.

238
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,440
 J-E-O-F-F-R-Y.

239
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,920
 Okay, but wait a minute.

240
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,280
 That's a bit like Joffrey, who was in Game of Thrones.

241
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,720
 And what do they have in Game of Thrones?

242
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,000
 But dragons.

243
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,640
 Mongooses.

244
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,000
 Oh boy.

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,280
 There's been a lot of thought in history

246
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,320
 that mongooses can kind of attack and kill

247
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,880
 other things.

248
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
 They go after snakes, for instance.

249
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,280
 And in real life, that does happen,

250
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,120
 that mongooses and snakes attack each other,

251
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,480
 especially cobras.

252
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,160
 And the mongooses are highly resistant to cobra venom.

253
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,240
 And often, if you put a mongoose and a cobra

254
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,120
 against each other, then the mongoose will come out on top.

255
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,080
 So, people use the mongoose as kind of protection

256
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,520
 against cobras.

257
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,080
 And knowing this, there's a really popular Indian beer

258
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,200
 called Cobra beer.

259
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,040
 And there was a rival who brought out a new beer,

260
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,600
 and they called it mongoose, because they wanted to beat

261
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,040
 the cobra.

262
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,600
 And so, whenever I have the choice between a cobra beer

263
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,440
 or a mongoose beer in an Indian restaurant,

264
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,720
 I always choose the mongoose one,

265
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,400
 because that's the one that beats the cobra.

266
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,920
 And I think I'm the only person in the world

267
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,360
 that that marketing has ever worked on.

268
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,760
 Hang on, isn't there also a kingfisher beer?

269
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,400
 Yes, there is.

270
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,800
 Where does that fit into the rock-paper-scissors world

271
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,240
 of the cobra and the mongoose?

272
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,600
 Kingfisher is for James's wife.

273
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,440
 He's sitting there going, "Look, I'll just get a kingfisher,

274
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,680
 and I'm sure about that lecture that my husband just gave you."

275
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,120
 The Royal Navy used to have, you know, they used to have ships,

276
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,880
 cats on ships to catch rats and things.

277
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,760
 Lots of ships had ships mongooses,

278
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,400
 which were very effective at catching rats and cockroaches.

279
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,440
 And that was a thing.

280
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,960
 But what we've learned from Dan, presumably,

281
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,880
 is that you don't want to have a ship's cat and a ship's mongoose,

282
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,640
 because the cat will just eat the mongoose.

283
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,920
 You've got to be very careful there, right?

284
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,720
 Did we learn that?

285
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,760
 Well, wasn't it Jeff the cat who killed the mongoose?

286
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,000
 Yes.

287
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,880
 Sorry, it's all right, Andy. I drifted off halfway through that story as well.

288
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,000
 There's going to be a quiz at the end of this section

289
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,240
 for which facts were fake and which facts were real.

290
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,000
 It is quite hard to keep up.

291
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,040
 But on real mongooses still, just for a moment,

292
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,880
 they are quite vicious, aren't they?

293
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,120
 And they can kill each other.

294
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,160
 And for that reason, they all give birth in synchrony,

295
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,240
 because if they didn't give birth on the same day,

296
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,840
 then their offspring would be killed.

297
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,680
 So the only way you can stop other mothers

298
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,200
 from killing your children

299
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,520
 is if they don't know whose children are whose.

300
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,960
 And the only way you can guarantee that

301
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,480
 is if all the children appear at once.

302
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,440
 That's so stressful.

303
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,400
 So as a kid, as a mongoose kid, you have to call everyone mum.

304
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,880
 So they think that you're their child.

305
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
 That's useful if you're in school

306
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,640
 and you accidentally call your teacher mum.

307
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,720
 Like some people I've heard have done in the past.

308
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,200
 It was twice. It was literally just twice.

309
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,400
 And you say, "No, no, I did it so that people didn't eat me."

310
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,520
 Oh, I wish I were a mongoose.

311
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,760
 Just one more thing about mongoose,

312
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,720
 specifically their anuses are quite cool.

313
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,200
 So they have anal glands from which they plant their scent.

314
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,640
 And one of their tricks is to do a handstand scent.

315
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,280
 And so they'll mark their scent to mark their territory,

316
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,440
 or sometimes they'll mark scent on a potential mate

317
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,400
 to warn off other mates, to warn off rivals.

318
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,480
 And the handstand scent, what they do is what it sounds like,

319
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,800
 they flip over upside down onto their hands,

320
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,600
 so they can get their anus up as high as possible,

321
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,160
 and then mark their scent as high up as possible,

322
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,280
 because that means that a rival can tell that you're quite tall.

323
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,200
 So a rival will then smell your scent on the person they want to mate with

324
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,560
 and be like, "Wow, you've managed to reach her head with your anus.

325
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,840
 You must be really tall. I'm not going to get involved here.

326
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,680
 I don't know if I can take that kind of bite."

327
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,280
 And then if he walks past a tree and smells the scent,

328
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,520
 does he think that this is a mongoose with an anus where my head is,

329
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,680
 and so he must be like 10 times bigger than me?

330
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,640
 Is that the idea of it?

331
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,720
 It's as if no other mongoose knows about headstands.

332
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,320
 It's like one mongoose has worked this out.

333
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,640
 I think maybe they all know about headstands,

334
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,520
 but the taller person is still going to get it higher up on a headstand.

335
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,360
 So if you're short, maybe you wouldn't do the headstand thing,

336
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,280
 because that's going to advertise that you're short.

337
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,320
 Is it like giving your wife a basketball to carry around?

338
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,520
 And everyone who sees her will think,

339
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,600
 "Oh, she must be going out with a really tall guy."

340
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,360
 It's exactly like that, yeah.

341
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,880
 But the idea is that all of us give our partners a basketball.

342
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,720
 The only advantage is to the first person who does it.

343
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,840
 So James, cut this bit out, because I'm going to start doing that.

344
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,800
 I'm going to get my wife to walk around with a pole vault pole.

345
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,720
 And people will think, "Wow, she has to pole vault just to kiss him and be funny."

346
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,760
 I'm going to stick to the Janus secretion.

347
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:48,480
 I just have one more haunting thing.

348
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,520
 There is a sweet shop in Great Yarmouth, which is explicitly not haunted.

349
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,240
 It seems to be the only sweet shop in the UK,

350
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,080
 which goes out of its way to say, "This is not haunted. There are no ghosts here."

351
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,800
 "Is that the lady who does protest too much?"

352
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,600
 It's owned by a man called Nigel Parrot, who is a very devout Christian.

353
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,960
 And he put the sign in his window a few years ago saying,

354
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,440
 "To all my wonderful customers, this shop is definitely not haunted,

355
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,000
 even though the town ghost walks appear to think it is."

356
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,240
 But it gets more interesting, this sign, because he goes on,

357
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,440
 "All demonic paraphernalia has been destroyed."

358
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
 So he thinks, "What was going on in this sweet shop?"

359
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,320
 And then he gets into the details.

360
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,960
 He says, "Jesus Christ died, so we could be free from all other spirits and negativity.

361
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,120
 He is alive today, and his is the only spirit in this place."

362
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,800
 So apparently there is a spirit in there.

363
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,480
 Yeah, he's haunted by Jesus.

364
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,240
 That's cool.

365
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,320
 And the BBC interviewed him, and he said,

366
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,480
 "This place might have, at some time in the past, been haunted,

367
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,080
 but if Jesus is alive and with me, then this shop is no longer haunted."

368
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,640
 Wow.

369
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,360
 Did you see the BBC followed that up with some research?

370
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,640
 They looked into this Nigel character, and it turns out he died in 1673.

371
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:15,920
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is James.

372
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,080
 My fact this week is that famous occultist, Alistair Crowley,

373
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,880
 used to make a curry so hot that he only served it on glaciers,

374
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,880
 so the diners could use the snow to cool their mouth down afterwards.

375
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,720
 Wow.

376
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,600
 Isn't that amazing?

377
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,520
 Yeah, but I mean, this is not like he would invite you for dinner,

378
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,240
 and then you'd get a location delivered to you, which was in a different land.

379
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,000
 Like he was mountaineering, wasn't he?

380
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,520
 He was mountaineering.

381
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,960
 He would make this curry.

382
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,920
 They had no kingfisher or mongoose or cobra to wash it down with,

383
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,800
 and it was so hot that people would run outside,

384
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,440
 and they would kind of stuff snow into their mouths.

385
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,160
 And in his autobiography, The Confessions of Alistair Crowley,

386
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,680
 he said that some people said he should make it in London,

387
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,440
 but he said he would refuse to do it

388
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,320
 because there's no glacier there or glacier there to help people.

389
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,520
 So that's a thing.

390
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,680
 It's a real chicken or egg, isn't it?

391
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,320
 Like, did he go to the glacier because he wanted to make the curry,

392
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,200
 or did he make the curry because he found himself on this glacier?

393
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,160
 We'll probably never know.

394
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,840
 We'll probably never know, and probably it was just he happened to be on the glacier.

395
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,720
 He happened to make some curry, and that's it.

396
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,320
 But yeah, he wasn't a cultist, but before he became a cultist,

397
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,120
 he was really a mountaineer, Alistair Crowley.

398
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,000
 He was known as the wickedest man in the world by the British press,

399
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,960
 because of various things that he did.

400
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,760
 At one stage, he set up an Abbey in Sicily,

401
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,000
 and lots of crazy stuff was happening there

402
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,200
 to do with sex and pornography and drugs and all that kind of stuff.

403
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,960
 And he got kicked out of Italy by Mussolini,

404
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,080
 and that made the news,

405
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,560
 and people started calling him the wickedest man in the world.

406
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,320
 But he was basically kind of a devil-worshipper,

407
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,280
 Satanist, a cultist kind of guy who was just famous for doing crazy stuff.

408
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,000
 It does feel like the wickedest man in the world,

409
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,440
 Bar, was much lower, again, pre-Hitler.

410
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,680
 It feels like he sneaked in and got the nickname

411
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,840
 at a time when the currency was a little bit weaker.

412
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,640
 You're right.

413
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,280
 Mind you, if Mussolini's calling you a bad guy,

414
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,560
 then you do have to be concerned.

415
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,280
 That's true.

416
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,000
 Yeah, that's true.

417
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,480
 Yeah.

418
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
 The signs were there even in his mountaineering career.

419
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,800
 So he attempted the second highest mountain in the world

420
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,320
 and the third highest, didn't he?

421
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,760
 I think he failed at both.

422
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,400
 But he tried K2 in 1902, and then Kanchenjunga in 1905,

423
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
 which is the third highest mountain in the world.

424
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,520
 And he went up there with a group who didn't get along with him

425
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,280
 after a while and tried to depose him as their group leader.

426
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,520
 And then there was a big fight, and a few of his co-walkers said

427
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,160
 they were going to turn back and go back down the mountain.

428
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,680
 And so he went to bed in his tent,

429
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,600
 and he heard them going back down the mountain,

430
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,280
 and they caused an avalanche.

431
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,640
 And there was lots of screaming and shouting and cries for help.

432
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,160
 And he heard all of this.

433
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,440
 Four of them were killed.

434
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,800
 He just sat in his tent.

435
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,360
 And what he did was he sat in his tent listening to the screams

436
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,680
 while everyone else in his party went to help them.

437
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,600
 And he wrote a letter to a local paper about how he has no sympathy

438
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,440
 for people who get involved in mountain accidents

439
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,200
 because they should be more responsible.

440
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,280
 Yeah, and there was a thing about that being because he was really wicked.

441
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,480
 But on the other hand, it kind of felt like he was just being really stubborn

442
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,800
 in that case because they'd had that argument.

443
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,160
 And they said, right, we're going back down.

444
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,920
 He's like, no, look, there's going to be an avalanche.

445
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,280
 I can see there's going to be an avalanche.

446
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,360
 So whatever you do, maybe go down tomorrow, but just don't go down now.

447
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,760
 And they went down and they got stuck in the avalanche.

448
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,280
 And you can almost imagine him in his tent going, see, told them.

449
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,640
 Told them that was going to happen.

450
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,480
 I think he was going, more curry for me.

451
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,840
 If you have a row and you hear someone falling down the stairs

452
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,040
 immediately afterwards, that's a result for you.

453
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,000
 That's the universe telling you you're right about the argument in a way.

454
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,200
 Well, good to know who's the Alistair Curly of this podcast.

455
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,880
 But there was a huge storm about it afterwards.

456
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,040
 There was a massive stuff in the press about it.

457
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,360
 And that's kind of when he gave up mountaineering.

458
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,920
 That was after that Catch and Chunger incident.

459
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,280
 And K2, I believe it was K2, he never reached the top of,

460
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,600
 not because they couldn't make it up there,

461
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,280
 but because of differences within the team.

462
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,200
 Again, he fell out with the team.

463
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,080
 He pulled a revolver on one of the members and the guy,

464
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,920
 he pulled the gun at Guy Knowles was his name, kicked him in the groin.

465
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,880
 It will cause some tension in a group when you pull a revolver on somebody.

466
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,480
 But I actually, one of the things I love about Catch and Chunger,

467
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,600
 the third highest mountain is that no one's ever got to the top of it.

468
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,000
 And lots of people have got to 10 meters below the top.

469
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,520
 And this is because local tradition has it that is,

470
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,400
 so it's in the Himalayas and local tradition has it that spirits live at the top

471
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,600
 and you can't disturb them.

472
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,960
 And so everyone who's ever climbed it,

473
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,720
 every mountaineering expedition that's been up there,

474
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
 which is a couple of hundred people, I think,

475
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,080
 out of respect for the spirit at the top, they stopped just beneath it.

476
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,040
 That's very respectful.

477
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,440
 It is.

478
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,400
 But you can't imagine that Crowley would have done that.

479
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,440
 He probably would have.

480
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
 He would have got to the top and done like a Macarena on top

481
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,760
 or a little jig or something, wouldn't he?

482
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,560
 Yeah, he would have spoken to the spirit.

483
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,800
 If Crowley had known about the Chillingham cattle,

484
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,200
 he would have been up there and touching them all over,

485
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,240
 like nobody's business.

486
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,200
 And that is an episode pullback to a hundred episodes ago.

487
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,000
 That was, I think it's more like 300 episodes ago.

488
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,240
 That's amazing.

489
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,560
 These are some cows who live in a field that James wants to touch.

490
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,920
 Anyway, oh, I see what you're trying to do here is deflect.

491
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,280
 Who's the Crowley of the group?

492
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,760
 Can you?

493
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,720
 Yeah, absolutely.

494
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:34,960
 Yeah.

495
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,640
 One thing he climbed, which I think is more impressive than K2,

496
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,520
 is beachy head.

497
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,480
 He climbed the cliffs at beachy head from the bottom to the top.

498
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,720
 But he was a massive boaster about the things he did.

499
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,880
 He wrote, "The general opinion was that no one had ever climbed it.

500
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,360
 There was, however, a legend that it had once been done.

501
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,000
 I settled the point by walking up, smoking a pipe with my dog,

502
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,200
 and then he put in brackets, I had no woman available, in nine and a half minutes."

503
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,520
 I mean, I was at beachy head a couple of weeks ago,

504
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,200
 and I'd struggled to climb it.

505
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,400
 And so would my dog.

506
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,600
 How did he get the dog to get up?

507
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,480
 I don't know.

508
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,080
 He might have had a dog, Papoose.

509
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,680
 There is an argument that a lot of the stuff in his autobiography

510
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,440
 might have been a bit medioppy.

511
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,240
 Yeah, that's true.

512
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,720
 Might have been a bit talkingy, mongoosey, perhaps.

513
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,200
 He claimed that it was his idea for Church Hill

514
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,240
 to give the V-Sign.

515
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,400
 He said, according to some people like Rabelay

516
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,560
 and some earlier writers, the V-Sign was a good way of fighting

517
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:42,480
 against the swastika, according to kind of ancient Eastern rituals.

518
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,240
 So he claimed that.

519
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,480
 He also claimed that it was down to him

520
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,320
 that Stanford Bridge football ground was aligned in the way that it's aligned.

521
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,440
 And that he gave Chelsea Football Club its team colors of blue.

522
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,480
 That was all down to him.

523
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,360
 That's what he claimed.

524
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,920
 Wow.

525
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,560
 Wow.

526
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,160
 Well, once you've defeated the Nazis, what are you going to do next?

527
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,880
 I guess pick the team colors for a premiership team.

528
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,880
 This sounds like obviously bullshit that he was claiming all these things,

529
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,360
 but he was quite an influential character back in the day,

530
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,280
 particularly with Counterculture America.

531
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,760
 So Aldous Huxley was a big fan of his.

532
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,920
 He very much set up a lot of ideas that got carried forward about free thinking.

533
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,880
 His religion that he started, which is Thelema,

534
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,840
 was an idea that you do stuff for you rather than you do it on behalf of the community,

535
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,160
 which suddenly was this new idea that hadn't really been explored too much in the past.

536
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,520
 There's a great story about how he set up Thelema,

537
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,640
 which was it was his wife who claimed that he was going to be dictated this message

538
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,440
 by a guardian angel called Iwas.

539
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,960
 And she she said that he's got all these messages for you.

540
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,080
 And he didn't believe it.

541
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,480
 So he took her to a museum in Cairo to say you've got to show me who Horace is.

542
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,080
 And she didn't know when they got there, they passed a huge Horace statue.

543
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,160
 And he went, OK, so this is nonsense.

544
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,480
 She doesn't know, but she kept walking on.

545
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,320
 And she found this thing at the end, which Horace appeared on.

546
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,080
 And she went, that's the guy there.

547
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,160
 And he went, oh my God, that's Horace.

548
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,200
 And he looked up the catalog number of this particular piece.

549
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,160
 And the number was 666 in the catalog.

550
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,320
 And so he thought this is a sign the synchronicity of this means that she's right.

551
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,800
 And then he went into a room for three days and he was dictated to by this guardian angel,

552
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,080
 a book, which is still in publication today and is the basis of his whole religion, Thelema.

553
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,280
 Well, his wife was called Louise, wasn't she?

554
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,280
 And the book was called Thelema and Louise.

555
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,720
 And it got adapted, didn't it?

556
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,000
 His wife was called Rose.

557
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,640
 And the sad thing is that basically within a year of her doing all of this stuff with him

558
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,600
 and kind of coming up with this religion, he'd dumped her and he'd found this other lady called

559
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,480
 Leila Waddell.

560
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,800
 And Leila Waddell was a violinist, apparently not a particularly good one, but an OK violinist.

561
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,280
 And he decided that he was going to form a band like a girl group like Little Mix,

562
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,560
 but she was going to be the main person, this violinist.

563
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,880
 They were called the ragged ragtime girls.

564
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,720
 And apparently they were amazing.

565
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,080
 They played in London and they absolutely pulled the house down.

566
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,280
 Is it called pulled the house down?

567
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,080
 Is that what you say?

568
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,520
 Brought the house down.

569
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,400
 They didn't pull the house down.

570
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,800
 They brought the house down and everyone loved them.

571
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,520
 And it looked like they were going to go on a massive tour around Europe.

572
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,360
 But instead, Crowley decided that he was going to go on a tour of some random parts of Russia

573
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,840
 instead.

574
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,680
 So they could have sold out every single theatre in the UK, for instance.

575
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,280
 But he decided he was going to go to Russia and they were going to tour there instead.

576
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,400
 And they went there and they were quite successful in Russia.

577
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,800
 But the reason that they went there, we think,

578
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,480
 is because he might have been a spy for the British government.

579
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,840
 And at that time, Rasputin was kind of getting his claws into the Cesarevich in Russia.

580
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,920
 And maybe he was there to kind of look after and see what was going on with Rasputin.

581
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,280
 And that's why this quite good girl group never made it because they had to go to Russia

582
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,640
 with him on this trip.

583
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,000
 A tragedy, a great loss to music.

584
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,440
 Crowley used to live on the banks of the Loch Ness.

585
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,920
 And often tried to summon the Loch Ness Monster up at certain points.

586
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:23,520
 But that's where he did all of his biggest achievements in the early days of spreading

587
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,040
 the magic that he was claiming he could do.

588
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,480
 So he was trying to summon up demons and battle them in order to make the world a better place.

589
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,680
 You wouldn't summon them to battle them, just send them away, surely?

590
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,760
 Well, you need to battle them to make sure they don't come back.

591
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,520
 Yeah, it's like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

592
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,840
 She does not summon demons.

593
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,440
 Well, someone does, definitely.

594
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,400
 Someone does, yeah.

595
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:51,600
 That house on the... Is it Bullskin House?

596
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,520
 Bullskine, Bullskin.

597
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
 Isn't that what they make notebooks out of?

598
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,480
 That's Moleskine.

599
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,920
 That has burned down twice in five years.

600
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,560
 I know. And then the owners started selling the rubble.

601
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,440
 Dan, you're interested in buying...

602
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,280
 I'd be so keen on buying the rubble.

603
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,040
 You can get a whole bag of it for just 50 quid.

604
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,000
 You're kidding.

605
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,240
 No.

606
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,520
 Are you serious?

607
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,160
 I don't know if it's still being sold, but you better get on it.

608
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,840
 Don't come on.

609
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,360
 Dan's wife and children have to put up with so many of his dodgy purchases.

610
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,480
 What are you doing at this?

611
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,120
 I wouldn't be allowed.

612
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,080
 I've genuinely been told by Fenella I'm not allowed to bring Alistair Crowley's book

613
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,280
 into the house, she thinks.

614
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,600
 Really?

615
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,280
 Yeah, because she's scared that it has powers with it.

616
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,440
 And also we're in lockdown, so we'd be around the spirits a lot.

617
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,280
 I've got quite a few of his books here, and I don't think we've had any problems here so far.

618
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,800
 I don't think spirits have much respect for government guidelines about Covid safety.

619
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,480
 I think if they want to go out, they're going to go out.

620
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,840
 They're not going to be trapped there with you.

621
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,000
 But it's interesting.

622
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,880
 I mean, it's a historical house, not just if you're a Crowley fan,

623
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,640
 but if you're a music fan.

624
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,840
 Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page bought that house many years ago.

625
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,080
 And he was very obsessed with Alistair Crowley as a lot of Zeppelin fans will know.

626
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,920
 He's very much into black magic, but he didn't really ever live there.

627
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,800
 He lent it to a guy called Malcolm Dent, who looked after it and had his kids there and so on.

628
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,400
 And he claims that there were a lot of spooky happenings while he was living there,

629
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,680
 that his wife was sort of attacked by a big beast outside.

630
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:38,080
 Just one other prominent Thelomite who is quite surprising was Jack Parsons,

631
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,560
 who was another leading Thelomite who Crowley installed.

632
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,640
 And he was the father of the US space program,

633
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,240
 which is kind of concerning actually when you reflect on it.

634
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
 So he's a rocket scientist in the 30s.

635
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,560
 He invented things like jet engines and jet fuel needed for space flight.

636
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,000
 And he also believed in a lot of this occult stuff.

637
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,600
 Wasn't he the one who Elron Hubbard kind of got in with his life

638
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,200
 and started living with him and his wife and then just ran off with his wife or something.

639
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,120
 Ran off with his wife. That's right. Yes.

640
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,520
 Yeah, he did. I think he ended up having a foursome with his wife and a 17-year-old girl

641
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,040
 who then married Elron Hubbard and they founded Scientology.

642
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,880
 And Parsons went on to try and conjure up a new lover

643
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,800
 when she abandoned him for Elron Hubbard.

644
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,040
 And he did that by masturbating onto magical tablets to the background sound of...

645
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,840
 This is Nicholas Parsons, did you say?

646
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,480
 This is the person who went on to found America's space programs.

647
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,040
 So...

648
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,080
 You're not allowed hesitation, deviation or masturbation.

649
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:49,040
 Okay, it's time for fact number three.

650
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,240
 And that is my fact.

651
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,280
 My fact this week is that Japan's Yakuza have been told

652
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,840
 they are no longer allowed to join in trick-or-treating.

653
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,560
 The Yakuza is Japan's mafia for anyone who doesn't know that.

654
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,840
 And they're a big syndicate of lots of different little groups.

655
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,880
 This is one particular group that has been told this year

656
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,120
 that no more trick-or-treating allowed even though everyone loves it

657
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,440
 when the Yakuza do trick-or-treating.

658
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,440
 It's quite funny.

659
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,200
 They've done this in the past for many years.

660
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,640
 It started when some kids accidentally came up to their offices

661
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,800
 and they knocked on the door and a very startled Yakuza member

662
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,760
 didn't know what to do and sort of fanned them off with money.

663
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,440
 And then they suddenly realized,

664
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,480
 "Hang on, if we can get kids to come and get candy off us,

665
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,760
 they might see us as good people."

666
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,680
 And that's really good for recruitment

667
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,480
 because the Yakuza have a very big problem with recruitment.

668
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,320
 A lot of their members are mid-fifties now

669
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,560
 and they have trouble bringing in the young-ins.

670
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,080
 I don't think it's great for your PR

671
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,840
 if you wanted to come across as a good guy

672
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,920
 to as an elderly gentleman start luring children to you with sweets.

673
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,880
 [laughter]

674
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,440
 So they're not trick-or-treating.

675
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,480
 They're sort of being the recipients of trick-or-treating.

676
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,040
 They invite children and they put up decorations

677
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,880
 and they put up inflatable ghosts

678
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,640
 and they tell people to take pictures.

679
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,760
 I mean, the last few times they've done it,

680
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,320
 about 800 parents and children have shown up.

681
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,120
 So it's quite, it is really popular.

682
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,880
 The security was impeccable.

683
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,240
 They get a lot of really good reviews.

684
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,000
 Yes, one local woman said,

685
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,600
 "Not only were the decorations great

686
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,760
 and the gift bags full of tasty stuff,

687
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,600
 there were two big lines for cotton candy

688
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,440
 and the gangsters were super nice."

689
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,800
 So they're...

690
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,040
 Right.

691
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,400
 Shame about the massive bloodbath in the living room.

692
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,360
 But once little Danny got over that, we had a great time.

693
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,080
 They do have a lot of social outreach missions in the Yakuza.

694
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,560
 So this year, when the coronavirus thing was just beginning,

695
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,200
 they offered to disinfect the Diamond Princess cruise ship,

696
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,920
 which had been impounded in Yokohama.

697
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,640
 And they said, "Yeah, we'll do it. We're gangsters.

698
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,800
 We're meant to be doing the difficult, tricky jobs

699
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,000
 that no one else is doing."

700
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,640
 They gave out masks, they gave out toilet paper.

701
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,080
 So they have a lot of soft power that they're using.

702
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,640
 Yeah, they do.

703
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,880
 They are, we should say, sort of not necessarily good guys.

704
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,480
 Not necessarily.

705
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,280
 Just because I read a piece in The Guardian

706
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,120
 about how they are really struggling.

707
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,240
 And it did feel a bit like, "God, this poor organization

708
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,080
 is really on its last legs here."

709
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,760
 But they do do some weird stuff,

710
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,840
 one of which is often sort of killing people.

711
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,080
 Another is the habit they have of cutting off their fingers.

712
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,760
 So that's the probably most well-known Yakuza tradition,

713
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,520
 is that if you're a member of the Yakuza

714
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,440
 and you do something wrong, you have to cut off your finger.

715
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,320
 And apparently, one of the ways you can now tell

716
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,000
 that they are losing their membership

717
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,360
 is that prosthetics makers are doing really well.

718
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,720
 So there are a couple of interviews.

719
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,240
 There was one with someone called Shintaro Hayashi in 2013

720
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,880
 who said he's noticed he's getting loads more calls from people

721
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,200
 who want prosthetic pinky fingers.

722
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,760
 And that's because people have chopped off their pinkies

723
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
 because they're in the Yakuza.

724
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,600
 Then they've decided, "I think I might go for another job."

725
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,080
 And it looks bad if you don't know little finger.

726
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,680
 And so they go for the fake finger.

727
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,160
 That's a sign.

728
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,480
 And apparently, a lot of the gangsters who are higher up,

729
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,040
 they have different fingers for different seasons,

730
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,480
 a finger to match every occasion.

731
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,080
 So they go for a tanned finger.

732
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,440
 Oh, I see.

733
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,720
 Not a kind of a pumpkin spice finger for autumn.

734
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,200
 I was thinking like a finger that can

735
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,680
 hook apples off trees for the autumn, maybe.

736
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,720
 That's so good.

737
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,680
 Lovely.

738
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,520
 A really long one that's like a ski pole for winter.

739
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:31,920
 Brilliant.

740
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,560
 Nice.

741
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,160
 But it gets really tense a little bit.

742
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,440
 A nice Christmas finger.

743
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,960
 Yeah, that'd be nice.

744
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,400
 Who wouldn't like a Christmas finger?

745
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,640
 In spring, you could call it a springer.

746
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,840
 Stunning.

747
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,320
 Brilliant.

748
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,040
 Lovely.

749
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,880
 I don't know what you'd have on your spring finger,

750
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,560
 but maybe a sort of spike so you could plant seeds in the ground.

751
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,560
 Ah, great idea.

752
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,880
 I think the spike is suddenly bad for PR again.

753
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,880
 If you impale everyone you shake hands with,

754
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,720
 yeah, maybe you're not going to get that job.

755
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,960
 So when the prosthetic makers are giving them new fingers,

756
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,880
 I wonder if there might also be a thing about tattoo removal,

757
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,000
 because they're quite famous for their tattoos, aren't they, Yakuza?

758
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,560
 There was a book that came out last year called I Give You My Life,

759
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,320
 which was photographs of the wives of Yakuza members,

760
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,960
 because actually it's kind of interesting the way that the women are in this society,

761
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,360
 because they're not considered members of the Yakuza,

762
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:33,520
 but they are not in the way that you might think of like mafia wives and stuff,

763
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,200
 kind of clueless of everything that's happening,

764
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,960
 especially the wives of the top level people.

765
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,560
 They kind of know everything that's going on.

766
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,280
 And their tattoos kind of tell you a lot about their history and stuff like that,

767
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,960
 which I found really interesting.

768
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,800
 But I looked into the history of the tattoos in Japan,

769
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,200
 and it goes all the way back to the 5th century,

770
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,200
 and the Japanese government used tattoos to punish their criminals,

771
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,520
 and that's why the Yakuza's are so tattooed now.

772
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,360
 It kind of goes all the way back to that.

773
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,120
 And if you ever did anything bad, you would get a line across your forehead,

774
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,160
 and then the second one, they would put an arch over the line,

775
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,720
 and the third one, they would put one extra kind of line,

776
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,680
 and that did the symbol, the kanji for dog,

777
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,200
 and it would like, you would have the word.

778
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,120
 It's like almost like if you did a crime here,

779
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,360
 and the first time they put a D on your forehead,

780
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,680
 second time an O, and the last time they put a G,

781
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,880
 and that would eventually...

782
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,640
 You could have said put a D, then an I, then a C, then an H.

783
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,160
 It's kind of the same, isn't it?

784
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,480
 It's like playing hangman on someone's face.

785
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,440
 That's what I was thinking.

786
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,080
 It'd be great if that's what they drew with hangman symbols.

787
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,480
 And then if they complete the thing, they hang you, right?

788
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,960
 Oh, wow.

789
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,520
 Yeah.

790
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,080
 Wow.

791
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,320
 Oh, that's very punitive, but that is, wow.

792
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,720
 Yeah.

793
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,360
 Yeah.

794
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,880
 It takes a lot of goes to get there,

795
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
 but there's always that debate, you know,

796
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,520
 do you draw the extra beam between the first and the horizontal?

797
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,200
 Do you give the guy arms?

798
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,280
 You could say, I'm going to give you one extra cross beam,

799
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,600
 because, you know, you've shown repentance.

800
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,400
 Yeah.

801
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,560
 It's like if the last detail on that drawing

802
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,080
 was to draw the fingers on the person,

803
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,440
 but you'd already lost seven of them.

804
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,880
 So Japan only started doing trick or treating

805
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,600
 and Halloween generally in 1997.

806
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,040
 And this was as a result of Disneyland in Tokyo.

807
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,000
 And they had their first ever Disney happy Halloween event.

808
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,280
 And everyone loved it.

809
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,960
 And it was sort of come here and experience

810
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,560
 this Western thing that they do.

811
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,000
 So everyone started doing it

812
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,760
 and it's spread to different amusement parks.

813
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,840
 So Universal Studios started doing it

814
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,040
 and they had their Hollywood Halloween got bigger and bigger.

815
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,040
 And so it's a proper thing there now.

816
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,960
 And they have one extra element to it

817
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,720
 that none of us, as far as I know, do,

818
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,520
 which is they have a post Halloween cleanup

819
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,880
 on November the 1st,

820
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,080
 where everyone goes back out into the streets the next day,

821
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,440
 still in costume,

822
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,680
 and they clean up all the rubble and debris

823
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,280
 from the night's partying that went on.

824
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,640
 That would be so useful.

825
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,280
 Like people could clean the feces off my front door

826
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,880
 that get there every Halloween.

827
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,800
 That's not just Halloween as it did.

828
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,520
 No, but at least it gets cleaned once again.

829
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,400
 [Music]

830
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,200
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

831
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,360
 And that is Andy.

832
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,440
 My fact is that ghost crabs use teeth in their stomachs

833
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,880
 to growl at their enemies.

834
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:23,040
 So are these ghost crabs or real crabs called ghost crabs?

835
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,880
 These are not ghost crabs called Jeff,

836
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,360
 who live in the Isle of Manor Sea.

837
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,640
 Yeah, exactly.

838
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,960
 So the ghost crab is a real thing.

839
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,320
 It's sort of small and pale and looks a bit ghostly,

840
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,400
 hence the kind of common name for it.

841
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,040
 It lives in the Atlantic beaches of the USA,

842
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,680
 that kind of place.

843
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,800
 The Guardian says they're named for their sandpale bodies

844
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,320
 and nocturnal antics.

845
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,560
 So I guess, yeah, active at night as well, also ghostly.

846
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,040
 And the scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography

847
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,520
 were looking at them because they noticed

848
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,120
 they could hear the crabs making a noise,

849
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,360
 but the crabs weren't doing anything to make a noise as it were.

850
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,600
 Almost like they were doing ventriloquism,

851
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,480
 like Bairie from the Isle of Manor.

852
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,280
 Exactly.

853
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,640
 It was exactly like that.

854
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,360
 And so they thought, well, this is curious,

855
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,640
 we're going to investigate.

856
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,800
 This is a scientist called Jennifer R.A. Taylor,

857
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,160
 who led this research.

858
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,840
 And they tried a couple of things.

859
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,840
 They put an endoscope into the crab's mouth,

860
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,280
 a tiny endoscope, and it immediately just bit it

861
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,720
 and crushed it, obviously.

862
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,160
 So then they used a thing called laser doppler vibrometry,

863
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,360
 and they bounced a laser off a crab, basically,

864
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,120
 and various different bits of its interior.

865
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,240
 And they found out that it has this feature inside it

866
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,600
 called a gastric mill,

867
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,160
 which is something it uses to grind up food internally.

868
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,480
 It's got a kind of extra mincing layer inside it.

869
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,600
 Yeah.

870
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,280
 And when they provoked a crab by presenting it with a hand

871
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
 or a model of another crab or whatever,

872
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,040
 it would make this growling noise just by rubbing together

873
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,280
 its internal teeth in its stomach.

874
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,760
 So cool.

875
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,200
 So it can do it on command.

876
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,240
 Yeah.

877
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,800
 Have you listened to the video of them growling, Andy?

878
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,360
 Yeah.

879
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,880
 Yeah, because it's not, we should say,

880
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,560
 it's not like a kind of like a dog growl.

881
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,160
 It's quite a high pitch, like a kind of noise.

882
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,800
 Yeah, can we hear exactly what it sounds like, Dan?

883
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,320
 Can you do a good impression?

884
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,360
 It was like...

885
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,360
 But if you're a rival crab, that is a pair of...

886
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,600
 Yeah.

887
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,560
 You don't want to mess with me?

888
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,280
 Yeah, terrifying.

889
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,800
 Terrifying growl, yeah.

890
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,880
 Yeah, but they...

891
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,440
 That's so cool.

892
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,080
 It's a massive...

893
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,560
 Like, I have a macerated toilet downstairs in my house,

894
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,720
 which is when you have a...

895
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,160
 Yeah, no, but I just...

896
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,760
 Like, that's what I relate that to.

897
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,240
 It's...

898
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,360
 Is that the noise it makes?

899
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,800
 Yeah, it's...

900
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,840
 Look out, mate.

901
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,880
 Oh, no, not again.

902
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,320
 Oh, Dan!

903
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,240
 What's your diet, mate?

904
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,960
 What's going on?

905
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,960
 What's a macerated toilet?

906
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,520
 It sort of grinds it all up in a tank behind it, right?

907
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,720
 We've got one of my parents house as well.

908
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,320
 It's incredibly annoying because it does make

909
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,480
 that rumbling, growling sound throughout the night.

910
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,120
 It growls.

911
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,520
 Yeah, it growls as you flush the toilets.

912
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,480
 Yeah, and it's...

913
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,960
 You should just install a big, old ghost crab and shit in its mouth.

914
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
 God!

915
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,480
 Jesus.

916
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,360
 Well, use nature.

917
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,240
 Use what it gave us.

918
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,960
 And the idea is, I believe,

919
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,400
 just to get back to the ghost crab in real life,

920
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,120
 is if you're fighting, if you're a ghost crab,

921
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,920
 but you want to tell someone to fuck off at the same time

922
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,440
 and you don't have a voice box,

923
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,520
 you can't, like, click your claws

924
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,200
 because you're using your claws to fight with.

925
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,360
 But if you do it with your stomach,

926
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,760
 then it frees up your hands to do some fighting.

927
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,320
 Exactly.

928
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,920
 It's hands-free technology, but for crabs, it's amazing.

929
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,480
 But what if you're fighting and also eating?

930
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,520
 What have you got then?

931
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,680
 Don't think you've got yourself to blame.

932
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,400
 That's a good point.

933
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,400
 Don't eat and fight.

934
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,480
 They're very fast, aren't they, these crabs?

935
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,920
 They are known to be the fastest crustaceans that we have,

936
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,720
 and they can reach up to 3.4 miles a second.

937
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,400
 Per second, sorry.

938
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,440
 Miles per second, yeah.

939
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,080
 Miles per second.

940
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,960
 Well, that is, that's always the fastest thing known to man.

941
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,520
 Sorry, I think you've missed the end on your...

942
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,240
 Anna, don't say 3.4 miles per second.

943
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,360
 I think if someone's about to shit in your mouth,

944
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,800
 you'd go away that fast as well.

945
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,440
 Sorry, okay, got it.

946
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,720
 That is incredible.

947
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,880
 So they can go off to the Atlantic in an hour or so.

948
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,440
 It's amazing they're not more widespread, yeah, yeah.

949
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,880
 They're the fastest crustaceans.

950
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,320
 That's why they called the ghosts.

951
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,960
 You say it's there, you turn around to tell someone,

952
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,000
 and it's not there anymore.

953
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,640
 So, sorry, how fast can they go?

954
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,360
 Can we stop?

955
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,920
 They can run up to 10 miles per hour is what I read.

956
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,360
 Or three meters per second, in fact.

957
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:06,560
 That sounds more legitimate than what I said before.

958
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,480
 It is still fast, but now it sounds really crap,

959
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,640
 given how fast everyone thought they were going.

960
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,560
 One reason we know how they're so fast

961
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,760
 is that they did put ghost crabs on a treadmill.

962
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,200
 Did they?

963
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,160
 Which, as we all know, they've put all animals on a treadmill.

964
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,360
 But I can say, and I did look really hard for this,

965
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,160
 I've never found a study which put a mongoose on a treadmill.

966
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,360
 So that should have been my fact here.

967
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,480
 But yeah, there was a study in 1990 by W.J. Van Aert in South Africa

968
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,720
 where he put ghost crabs on a treadmill

969
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,440
 and found that they could run for two hours before getting tired.

970
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,360
 Whoa, that's amazing.

971
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,560
 Did he, I have a question.

972
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,000
 Did he put them on the treadmill?

973
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,280
 Did he put the treadmill sideways?

974
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,400
 Well, no, it doesn't really matter which direction the treadmill is.

975
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,040
 Of course it does.

976
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,800
 But you would put the crab on the sideways.

977
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,880
 Yeah, yeah, but you would just put the crab on the sideways.

978
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,520
 You wouldn't change the direction of your treadmill, would you?

979
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,040
 That's just a matter of perspective.

980
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,360
 If you wanted to do sideways running in a gym,

981
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,440
 you wouldn't have to go to the person at the desk and say,

982
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,600
 "Sorry, can you turn this treadmill around

983
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,840
 because I have to do some sideways running."

984
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,840
 I'm banned from all the gyms in South London

985
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,600
 for dragging the equipment around.

986
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:23,040
 I'm surprised they work on treadmills

987
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,560
 because don't they run in a weird way where they sprint really fast

988
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,960
 and then they stop and then they sprint and then they stop.

989
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,400
 And I think they think that's about that lactic acid builds up.

990
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,320
 If you sprint, as we remember from biology,

991
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,920
 and to get rid of that waste product,

992
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,160
 you stop and then your body disposes of it.

993
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,600
 So I would have thought on a treadmill,

994
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,880
 they're going to go flying off the back.

995
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,320
 You're also moving sideways.

996
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,240
 That's the problem is that you go from side to side across the treadmill.

997
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,560
 They're like that, "Okay, go video."

998
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:54,480
 No, the thing which they do with stopping occasionally,

999
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,040
 that is when they're being pursued by a predator.

1000
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,840
 They use that trick.

1001
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,480
 Not when they're generally at the gym.

1002
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,840
 I think clearing...

1003
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,680
 As in, do we know how they're clearing lactic acid

1004
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,840
 or does it just naturally dissipate if they stop for a bit?

1005
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,560
 I think that's it.

1006
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,520
 Yeah, same with us.

1007
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,240
 As soon as you stop,

1008
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,720
 then you'd repay your oxygen debt or whatever, don't you?

1009
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,760
 Wow, it's amazing.

1010
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,520
 Anything can catch them really at the speeds

1011
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,720
 we know they can go now.

1012
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:21,200
 I didn't even know treadmills could go that fast.

1013
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,240
 Have you guys just on crabs in general?

1014
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,120
 Have you heard of mitten crabs?

1015
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,240
 These are a huge problem.

1016
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,440
 Kind of hard to remember them, but I don't know.

1017
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,720
 Yeah, so this is the thing.

1018
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,640
 They're also called the Shanghai Hairy Crab.

1019
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,600
 And basically, they look like they're wearing mittens.

1020
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,600
 They've got these huge hairy claws at their front.

1021
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,400
 And they are a traditional food in China.

1022
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,360
 They get eaten a lot,

1023
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,600
 but they're also unbelievably successful around the world.

1024
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,720
 They're in the world's top 100 most invasive species.

1025
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,760
 They're so popular in China.

1026
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,040
 They're vending machines sometimes with live crabs inside them

1027
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,320
 that you can...

1028
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:58,880
 Wow.

1029
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,920
 I know, you can just buy.

1030
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,000
 China even has a museum shaped like a giant hairy crab.

1031
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 I'm trying to sort of imagine how a crab works in a vending machine

1032
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,440
 because do they have to hang from those bits

1033
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,720
 that the chocolate bars hang from?

1034
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,560
 Just sounds.

1035
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,360
 I think they're wrapped.

1036
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,240
 I think they're wrapped up.

1037
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,600
 That's how you transport them traditionally

1038
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,960
 is you bind their claws up and things.

1039
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,960
 I think it's like the chocolate bar thing, isn't it?

1040
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,280
 But you have to turn the entire vending machine

1041
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,080
 around 90 degrees so that they can come out sideways.

1042
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:31,760
 You'd be so annoyed if your crab was...

1043
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,760
 If you just stuck out a claw and got hanging off the edge.

1044
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,760
 And then you did that again and again and again.

1045
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,840
 And every crab did a little crab conga.

1046
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,840
 It would be good to have, you know,

1047
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,960
 those claw machines that kind of pick up things

1048
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,800
 to have one of those picking up crabs.

1049
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,200
 Yes.

1050
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,920
 Because they'd think it was sort of giant crab god

1051
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,560
 coming to pick them up and take them up to crab heaven.

1052
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,760
 What a good way to go.

1053
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,280
 And I have some more spooky crabs you can have.

1054
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,280
 Yeti crabs, vampire crabs, zombie crabs, cannibal crabs,

1055
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,200
 or wizard crabs, which do you fancy.

1056
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,400
 Oh, wizard crab please.

1057
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,440
 Wizard crab, yeah.

1058
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,680
 Okay, so this is a crab that has the Latin name

1059
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,280
 Harry Plax Severus.

1060
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,760
 Okay, it's quite a nice story actually.

1061
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,400
 So it's, you would think that that was named

1062
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,240
 after Harry Potter, right?

1063
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,200
 Because you've got Severus name and you've got Harry Potter.

1064
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,040
 But actually they were discovered

1065
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,320
 by a guy called Harry Conley, hence the Harry.

1066
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,760
 And the word Severus comes from the Latin for rigorous

1067
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,440
 because he was an amateur collector of crabs.

1068
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,560
 And he spent his whole life really rigorously kind of going

1069
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,600
 through these kind of piles of rubble looking for crabs.

1070
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,000
 They, he found it and it was only found to be a new

1071
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,880
 species 20 years after he died, but they named it after him.

1072
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,680
 And the person who named it did admit that they did

1073
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,280
 very much like Harry Potter.

1074
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,560
 And there was a double meaning.

1075
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:58,720
 But at the same time it was named after this Harry

1076
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,240
 and the Severus meaning rigorous.

1077
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:00,880
 So that's great.

1078
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,560
 And then are they, are they called wizard crabs

1079
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,680
 because of the Harry Potter thing?

1080
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,800
 Or was this guy actually called wizard junior?

1081
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,760
 He was a Satanist.

1082
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,600
 He, he was a black magician.

1083
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,400
 I'll be honest.

1084
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,920
 That was my calling them wizard crabs.

1085
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,200
 Oh, they're not called wizard crabs.

1086
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,040
 They're kind of wizardy crabs, aren't they?

1087
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,040
 Because they're kind of like Harry Potter.

1088
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,680
 Yeah, absolutely.

1089
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,960
 Definitely, definitely.

1090
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,320
 If they don't have a common name yet,

1091
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,600
 you can give them a common name.

1092
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,400
 Well, I didn't realize that we, we had that kind of power.

1093
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,040
 I think we do.

1094
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:29,840
 Very exciting.

1095
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,960
 I think we can try it out.

1096
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,040
 We could push them, push the envelope.

1097
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,120
 So do any of these crabs have the actual common name

1098
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,760
 that you've given them?

1099
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,120
 Or were you, or are you just bluffing us

1100
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,360
 with your zombie crabs and your vampire crabs?

1101
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,160
 Yeti crabs and vampire crabs are real.

1102
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:42,480
 Okay.

1103
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,680
 Zombie crabs are crabs that are turned into zombies

1104
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,920
 and cannibal crabs are crabs that eat other crabs.

1105
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,240
 What do you mean crabs are turned into zombies?

1106
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:50,400
 Yeah.

1107
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,120
 So there is a barnacle called loxothilacus panopaii,

1108
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,600
 otherwise known as loxo.

1109
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,280
 And they will find a recently malted female crab

1110
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,480
 and they'll go into her undercarriage

1111
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,040
 and lay their eggs in there.

1112
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,880
 And they'll turn them into a zombie.

1113
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,960
 So all they'll do is look after these baby barnacles.

1114
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,200
 And the worst thing is that if there's two

1115
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,280
 of these crabs in a couple,

1116
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,320
 they'll take the male and also infect the male

1117
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,920
 and change his anatomy.

1118
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,360
 So he looks a bit like a female and acts like a female.

1119
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,880
 And the male and the female,

1120
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,760
 both of whom now look and act like females,

1121
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,480
 all just look after these baby barnacles

1122
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,520
 because they're like zombies.

1123
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,880
 That's all they can do.

1124
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,360
 And they just sit there while these baby barnacles

1125
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,760
 are just eating off them and being born off them.

1126
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,880
 You love her.

1127
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,520
 Yeah.

1128
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,320
 So the crab is,

1129
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,760
 oh yeah, the crab is the zombie, I guess,

1130
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,080
 and the barnacle is the guy in charge.

1131
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:46,560
 Is the--

1132
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,520
 It's the wizard.

1133
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,040
 I can only think of the word wizard now.

1134
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,440
 The only feasible capillary I have.

1135
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,480
 The barnacle is like the zombie plague

1136
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,400
 that turns everything into zombies.

1137
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,280
 Yeah, got it.

1138
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,400
 Yeti crabs are quite cool.

1139
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,240
 They were only discovered in 2005

1140
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,920
 and they really are called yeti crabs.

1141
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,240
 And they farm their own food on their arms.

1142
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,640
 So they're really cute, actually.

1143
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,400
 They look like a cuddly toy

1144
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,120
 because they've got these really hairy, shaggy arms.

1145
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,360
 A bit like the crab that Andy was describing earlier.

1146
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,160
 And huge colonies of bacteria live there in their heads

1147
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,120
 because it's such a nice, wet, hairy environment to live in.

1148
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,760
 And then they just spend their days eating the bacteria.

1149
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,320
 It's quite nice, although probably not

1150
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:35,120
 if you met a human who kind of farmed bacteria on their arms

1151
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,480
 and they lived off eating that.

1152
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,680
 Probably you wouldn't--

1153
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,120
 Nice wouldn't be the adjective.

1154
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:39,680
 No.

1155
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,560
 It's really--

1156
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,640
 What student hasn't licked their armpits

1157
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,880
 for sustenance on a particularly low day?

1158
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,560
 Come on.

1159
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,960
 So vampire crabs are kind of--

1160
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,640
 They're quite beautiful crabs.

1161
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,000
 They've got glowing eyes.

1162
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,160
 They're really lots of amazing colors.

1163
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,360
 They're often quite dark purple, a bit kind of draculary.

1164
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,040
 And they've become quite popular pets quite recently.

1165
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,600
 And the thing is that you can't really breed crabs

1166
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,560
 because they're all cannibals.

1167
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,480
 Like I said, they kind of eat each other.

1168
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,920
 And so the only way to get these vampire crabs

1169
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,920
 is to go and find them at source.

1170
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,640
 So there's people in Southeast Asia who will go down,

1171
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,960
 search for these crabs, and they'll bring them back

1172
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,640
 and then sell them onto dealers.

1173
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,280
 Now, a lot of them are very interesting colors

1174
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,720
 that are really good for pets.

1175
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,080
 And if you know where to find a particularly nice purpley one

1176
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,600
 with bright green eyes,

1177
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,840
 then you're not going to tell anyone else where that is,

1178
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,000
 right, because you want to have your stash.

1179
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 And so people have been doing that.

1180
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,120
 And they found that some of the species

1181
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,840
 that are quite popular for pet owners

1182
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,360
 are actually brand new species

1183
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,520
 that have never been described ever before.

1184
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,520
 And they can't find out where they're from

1185
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,840
 because the dealers won't tell them where they found them.

1186
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,280
 Right.

1187
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:51,920
 That's them.

1188
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,560
 Very cool.

1189
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,320
 I'm out of spooky.

1190
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,120
 I've got the orangutan crab.

1191
00:51:59,120 --> 00:51:59,840
 Oh, yeah.

1192
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,480
 Which, if a crab was going to a Halloween party,

1193
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,160
 might dress up as an orangutan.

1194
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,680
 Like, that's the only connection I could make,

1195
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,880
 really, the Halloween thing.

1196
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,680
 But it's really beautiful to look at.

1197
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,960
 It looks like an orangutan.

1198
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,240
 It's ginger red-brown hair all over.

1199
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,880
 And the hair catches the debris of animals coming by.

1200
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,560
 So it traps itself in its hair.

1201
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,080
 So it can just eat the food that's stuck in its arms and so on.

1202
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,040
 Nice.

1203
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,640
 But it's good for camouflage as well, I think,

1204
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,600
 because doesn't it sort of suck up debris as it goes?

1205
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,560
 So you can't see it.

1206
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,160
 Actually, speaking of camouflage,

1207
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,560
 the ghost crabs that we're talking about at the start,

1208
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,520
 they are kind of, some of them are quite sandy-colored

1209
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,560
 in a light sand, as in dry sand.

1210
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,040
 And some of them are quite sandy-colored in a dark sand,

1211
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,400
 which is like wet sand.

1212
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,520
 And what they do is they know what color they are,

1213
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,200
 and they'll run to the area,

1214
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,200
 which is most like whatever their color is.

1215
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,280
 Just desperate to match.

1216
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,360
 But they can, I think, change, can't they?

1217
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,360
 But it's not as quick as a chameleon.

1218
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,520
 So I think they lifted up the light-colored ones,

1219
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,160
 living in light sand, plopped them in dark sand,

1220
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,840
 and they can camouflage themselves

1221
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,200
 and turn themselves the color of the dark sand,

1222
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,480
 but it takes about a month.

1223
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,400
 So for that month, they're sitting there on the dark sand,

1224
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,760
 really flashing like a beacon.

1225
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,320
 And then eventually, if they survive that,

1226
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,360
 they've turned the right color.

1227
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,040
 And it's shore crabs, they can camouflage themselves too,

1228
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,280
 but when noisy ships sail nearby,

1229
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,760
 it takes them way longer to change.

1230
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,880
 They can't do it as quickly.

1231
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,920
 Oh, really? Really?

1232
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,240
 And this is a problem, because if they're not changing color,

1233
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,920
 then they're much likelier to be preyed on.

1234
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,680
 And it's basically because they're stressed.

1235
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,520
 They're stressed by the noise of the sea,

1236
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,240
 and that takes energy.

1237
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,080
 Is that a bit like those of us who can't really work to music?

1238
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,440
 It's more life and death than not being able to work to music.

1239
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,560
 But yeah, if you like.

1240
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,640
 My job is my life, actually.

1241
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,600
 But then some of us work better to music.

1242
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,320
 I work better having a load of crazy J-pop going in my ears

1243
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,040
 when I'm working.

1244
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,040
 So are there some kind of...

1245
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,720
 Are there some crabs that just love ships going fast?

1246
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,040
 I don't think so.

1247
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,880
 And they're just like, "Oh, yeah, nice one.

1248
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,000
 I can get everything done.

1249
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,560
 I can collect a load of crustaceans today."

1250
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:04,560
 And usually it's better for exercise.

1251
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,160
 So any time a crab's on a treadmill,

1252
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,480
 you know, it's probably better to appreciate the music.

1253
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,880
 Okay, that's it.

1254
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,920
 That is all of our facts.

1255
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,360
