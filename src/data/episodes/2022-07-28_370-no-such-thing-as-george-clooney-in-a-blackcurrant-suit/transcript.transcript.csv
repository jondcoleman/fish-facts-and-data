00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Six Things as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:07,"Well, what can I tell you about this week's show?"
00:00:07,00:00:11,Dan Schreiber is having a very well-earned little breather.
00:00:11,00:00:13,"He'll be back next week, don't you worry."
00:00:13,00:00:20,"And Dan is such a behemoth of a podcaster that in his place we have not just one, but two people."
00:00:20,00:00:25,"Now, the first person that we'll be replacing Dan is Athena Cablenu."
00:00:25,00:00:28,"Now, she is an amazing comedian, a really good friend of ours."
00:00:28,00:00:32,You might remember her from our 20-hour comic relief special.
00:00:32,00:00:35,She was part of the Guilty Feminist team in that.
00:00:35,00:00:39,"And actually, when we were on the Guilty Feminist, she was part of that show."
00:00:39,00:00:44,"She also has a BBC Radio 4 show called Athena's Cancel Culture,"
00:00:44,00:00:46,which is out right now on Radio 4.
00:00:46,00:00:49,You can find that on the internet as well.
00:00:49,00:00:54,"And she has a podcast called Keeping Athena Company, which is absolutely fantastic."
00:00:54,00:00:56,I can't recommend that highly enough.
00:00:56,00:00:58,It's such a brilliant podcast.
00:00:58,00:01:00,"Oh, I did say there was a second person."
00:01:00,00:01:07,"The second person is Athena's son, who you might hear in the background from time to time,"
00:01:07,00:01:11,really kind of coming in at the exact moments that you would want him to.
00:01:11,00:01:14,"So it's almost like we've soundscaped this episode,"
00:01:14,00:01:17,but I promise you it isn't soundscaped.
00:01:17,00:01:20,It was a tiny little human who was in the background of the show.
00:01:20,00:01:21,I really hope you enjoyed it.
00:01:21,00:01:23,We had such fun making it.
00:01:23,00:01:24,We love Athena.
00:01:24,00:01:28,And I suppose all that's left to say is on with the podcast.
00:01:28,00:01:47,"Hello and welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:01:47,00:01:53,a weekly podcast coming to you from four secret locations somewhere on Earth.
00:01:54,00:01:56,And specifically in London.
00:01:56,00:02:00,"My name is Anna Tyszynski, and I am here today with James Harkin and Johanna Murray"
00:02:00,00:02:04,"and our very special, exciting guest, Athena Koblenu."
00:02:04,00:02:07,"And once again, we've gathered around the microphones"
00:02:07,00:02:09,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:02:09,00:02:13,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:13,00:02:16,"And starting with you, Athena, what's your facts?"
00:02:16,00:02:18,So this is my fact.
00:02:18,00:02:22,The 100 folds of a chef's hat represent the 100 ways
00:02:22,00:02:25,"in which you can cook an egg, right?"
00:02:25,00:02:30,"Does that mean, Athena, if you can only cook an egg like one way,"
00:02:30,00:02:34,"for instance, then you can only have one fold or get a beret."
00:02:34,00:02:36,Yeah. Chef Beret.
00:02:36,00:02:41,"I was going to say you get a little cone, but that's not a good kind of hat to wear."
00:02:41,00:02:44,Big white cone on your head.
00:02:44,00:02:46,That's not a good hat at all.
00:02:46,00:02:48,"I mean, I always thought I was an amazing cook."
00:02:48,00:02:50,"I'm like, you know, you see my Instagram, there's lots of food on there."
00:02:50,00:02:53,"But when I read that fact, I was like, I can't cook at all."
00:02:53,00:02:55,I know three ways. That's it.
00:02:55,00:02:58,"Come on, mate. Even I know more than three ways to cook an egg."
00:02:58,00:02:59,What's your three?
00:02:59,00:03:03,"Scrambled, omelette, fry."
00:03:03,00:03:04,"Oh, boil. I know four ways."
00:03:04,00:03:06,"Oh, I'm still short."
00:03:06,00:03:08,Not tried puching any time.
00:03:08,00:03:10,"Oh, God. Yes. OK."
00:03:10,00:03:12,Fine. Five.
00:03:12,00:03:14,"It's still, we're a long way off."
00:03:14,00:03:16,We're five percent of the way there.
00:03:16,00:03:18,And the rest of this section is just going to be us brainstorming
00:03:18,00:03:20,other possible ways.
00:03:20,00:03:22,"Now, I will say, have you guys ever coddled an egg?"
00:03:22,00:03:23,No.
00:03:23,00:03:25,Coddling an egg is lovely.
00:03:25,00:03:28,"It sounds like sort of taking it to bed with you, like a teddy."
00:03:28,00:03:31,"I think you sort of, you put it in, is it like you give it a bath?"
00:03:31,00:03:32,You put it in a little glass
00:03:32,00:03:35,ramekin and then you give it a bath and that slowly cooks within that.
00:03:35,00:03:37,And you mix it with spices and they that's very nice.
00:03:37,00:03:39,"Anyway, six. That's like a bain-marie."
00:03:39,00:03:41,"Yeah, seven."
00:03:41,00:03:42,I think you can bake an egg.
00:03:42,00:03:45,I once saw someone bake an egg.
00:03:45,00:03:47,They put the egg in an oven and I thought.
00:03:47,00:03:48,I've baked an egg before.
00:03:48,00:03:49,"Have you, in an oven?"
00:03:49,00:03:53,"Yeah, like, like hollowed out a pepper"
00:03:53,00:03:55,and then broken egg in it and just baked it.
00:03:55,00:03:58,"Oh, but I've seen that someone put the shell."
00:03:58,00:03:58,You can do this.
00:03:58,00:04:01,"You can just put the whole egg in the oven and bake it, which just"
00:04:01,00:04:04,"which just for me feels like, like you don't really want the egg."
00:04:04,00:04:08,So you're trying to wait as long as possible before you have to eat it.
00:04:08,00:04:11,"Well, do you know something that takes even longer than your boiled oven egg?"
00:04:11,00:04:14,You can do it in the dishwasher as well.
00:04:14,00:04:15,Very nice.
00:04:15,00:04:16,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:16,00:04:20,"Wrap it up or, in fact, leave it in the shell and then just set the dishwasher running."
00:04:20,00:04:24,And another longer way of doing it is the 100 year egg.
00:04:24,00:04:28,Very long cycle in the dish.
00:04:28,00:04:30,Sometimes it's called the thousand year egg.
00:04:30,00:04:34,And sometimes it's just called a really disgusting egg because I've had this egg.
00:04:34,00:04:39,I had it in Singapore and it's kind of what they do is they put it in clay
00:04:39,00:04:43,and salt and they leave it for a few weeks and it kind of turns
00:04:43,00:04:46,"dark black and really, really sulfurous."
00:04:46,00:04:50,"And sometimes they call it horse urine egg because it tastes a bit like horse urine,"
00:04:50,00:04:54,"apparently. Yeah, this is one way of eating eggs."
00:04:54,00:04:55,There is.
00:04:55,00:04:57,"Yeah, they've got a recipe for that in my Chinese cookbook."
00:04:57,00:04:59,I think it looks unappetizing.
00:04:59,00:05:00,It's disgusting.
00:05:00,00:05:02,It's really it looks like.
00:05:02,00:05:04,I think they came out of this because somebody dropped an egg somewhere
00:05:04,00:05:07,"and they found it five weeks later and they're like, wait, it's not what not."
00:05:07,00:05:09,"And they said, well, we'll make it a recipe."
00:05:09,00:05:11,And then no one puts me in prison for being disgusting.
00:05:11,00:05:13,And that's how that works.
00:05:13,00:05:15,"Finally, we hadn't dropped it in this puddle of horse piss."
00:05:15,00:05:18,If life gives you horse piss.
00:05:18,00:05:21,"Well, that is the story."
00:05:21,00:05:25,"It was like a Chinese guy who had like dropped some eggs,"
00:05:25,00:05:31,stuck eggs in a muddy puddle of water and they had a load of calcium in the water.
00:05:31,00:05:34,"And then he pulled them out and he thought, well, I might as well try them."
00:05:34,00:05:36,"You know, I might as well try them."
00:05:36,00:05:37,"And he's like, these are delicious."
00:05:37,00:05:39,I need to come up with a way of making them.
00:05:39,00:05:43,That is my approach to eating pretty much every encrusted
00:05:43,00:05:44,ancient bit of food on the back of the fridge.
00:05:44,00:05:48,I might as well just have most of it and see if I die.
00:05:48,00:05:49,"Do you know, this is great because when you've got a toddler,"
00:05:49,00:05:52,"you find food everywhere, you know."
00:05:52,00:05:54,So now I'm just going to give it a banana that's at the back of the couch
00:05:54,00:05:56,"because it's just cuisine, isn't it?"
00:05:56,00:05:57,It's just a new recipe.
00:05:57,00:05:59,Exactly. It's a delicacy.
00:05:59,00:06:03,"I have a slightly exciting advance on the hundred bleeds in the chef's hat,"
00:06:03,00:06:07,which is this is from a book called The Culinary Guide from 1903.
00:06:07,00:06:09,"And it's by Georges Escoffier, who was a very famous."
00:06:09,00:06:14,"He was an early celebrity chef, not the earliest, but he turned the century."
00:06:14,00:06:19,"Anyway, his book lists two hundred and two ways to prepare eggs, excluding omelettes."
00:06:19,00:06:22,And omelettes is another eighty two.
00:06:22,00:06:25,"And he also says that if you use the basic recipe for omelette norvegienne,"
00:06:25,00:06:29,it is it is possible to produce an almost infinite number of variations
00:06:29,00:06:30,of this type of omelette.
00:06:30,00:06:32,"Then he says in brackets, omelette surprise."
00:06:32,00:06:35,"So well, yeah, sounds gross."
00:06:36,00:06:41,"Do you know where the word comes from? Oh, gosh, I'd assume from the word for egg."
00:06:41,00:06:45,Does it come from the does it come from the sound of meditation?
00:06:45,00:06:46,Yes. And that's shut up.
00:06:46,00:06:52,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It isn't. It isn't."
00:06:52,00:06:53,It both isn't that.
00:06:53,00:06:55,And I think I've just lost hearing in one of my ears.
00:06:55,00:07:03,It comes from the same word as you get amulet omelette amulet.
00:07:03,00:07:05,And also where you get laminate.
00:07:05,00:07:09,"So it means something that's something that's flat, basically."
00:07:09,00:07:11,An old French word for something that's flat.
00:07:11,00:07:12,And that's where we get it from.
00:07:12,00:07:15,"You know, apparently we've been boiling eggs wrong."
00:07:15,00:07:20,According to according to we we've been boiling eggs.
00:07:20,00:07:22,"Oh, this whole time we've been boiling them wrong."
00:07:22,00:07:23,I love these headlines.
00:07:23,00:07:25,"I once tried to search for all the things, all that you've been"
00:07:25,00:07:28,something wrong your whole life and I love it.
00:07:28,00:07:31,"Yeah, I want to say it's always like you've been tying your shoes wrong"
00:07:31,00:07:34,the whole life and then you look at it and some guy on the Internet
00:07:34,00:07:37,has come up with a ridiculously stupid way of tying his shoes.
00:07:37,00:07:40,Although you shouldn't say that because we actually did a fact
00:07:40,00:07:42,about three years ago about how we have actually been tying your shoes
00:07:42,00:07:43,wrong your whole life.
00:07:43,00:07:44,"Oh, was that us then?"
00:07:44,00:07:47,That was us on the internet.
00:07:47,00:07:50,"Yeah, we've been boiling eggs wrong and doing everything else wrong."
00:07:50,00:07:51,But I tried to do it the right way.
00:07:51,00:07:56,"So this is according to MFK Fisher, who I think was this like amazing"
00:07:56,00:08:00,"food writer in the 20th century, and she was very, very influential."
00:08:00,00:08:03,And she said the key to boiling eggs is you shouldn't boil them.
00:08:03,00:08:06,And because that cooks it unevenly.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"So if you boil it really hard, you drop it straight into boiling water."
00:08:08,00:08:11,It cooks the white really fast.
00:08:11,00:08:14,And by the time the yolk inside is cooked and the white is massively
00:08:14,00:08:15,overcooked and it's all rubbery.
00:08:15,00:08:20,"So I tried her way, which is you put it in cold water and then you let"
00:08:20,00:08:24,"the cold water boil and as soon as it hits the boil, you take it off."
00:08:24,00:08:25,"Oh, yeah, was it good?"
00:08:25,00:08:30,"Well, it was the most frustrating 45 minutes of my life."
00:08:31,00:08:33,You should have put it in your oven.
00:08:33,00:08:39,"It was, it was 45 minutes because it basically super glues the shell to the white."
00:08:39,00:08:42,"So, you know, normally if you appeal a hard boiled egg, then obviously"
00:08:42,00:08:47,the shell comes off and this it doesn't shock the white away from the shell
00:08:47,00:08:48,when you drop it in boiling water.
00:08:48,00:08:51,"And so it took, I mean, I'm not kidding."
00:08:51,00:08:52,It took 45 minutes to peel the shell off.
00:08:52,00:08:54,"I lost most of the white along the way, don't do it."
00:08:54,00:08:57,"MFK Fisher was pretty amazing, wasn't she?"
00:08:57,00:09:02,She was the one who W. H. Odin said was the greatest writer of any style
00:09:02,00:09:03,in the whole of America.
00:09:03,00:09:07,She was a food writer and she was the one who also said the perfect way
00:09:07,00:09:10,to make a sandwich was to sit on it.
00:09:10,00:09:13,So you make your sandwich and then you have to sit on it for half an hour
00:09:13,00:09:17,just to kind of warm it up and squash it and then it's going to be a perfect sandwich.
00:09:17,00:09:21,You're going to get a lot of customers returning their sandwiches to the kitchen.
00:09:21,00:09:23,That's why I was fired from my job at prep.
00:09:25,00:09:29,"Just on on eggs and sort of how they're laid,"
00:09:29,00:09:33,you know when you've got an egg and you've boiled it and you peel it.
00:09:33,00:09:37,"And you know, there's that gap between the white and the shell."
00:09:37,00:09:39,There's like a little air pocket.
00:09:39,00:09:41,Yeah. Do you know what that is?
00:09:41,00:09:44,"It's I don't know what it is, but I know it makes it really easy to peel them."
00:09:44,00:09:46,"That's my. Yeah, it's really handy."
00:09:46,00:09:49,"If you find that and you crack the egg there, you can peel your eggs really easily."
00:09:49,00:09:52,Top tip. That's what it's for.
00:09:52,00:09:53,That's that's evolution for you.
00:09:53,00:09:56,It's evolved to help us peel up all day.
00:09:56,00:10:00,"No, it's a it's a little air hole for the chick."
00:10:00,00:10:05,"So in case the egg is fertilised, the chick will be inside and then it needs"
00:10:05,00:10:09,to practice breathing to inflate its lungs before it cracks out.
00:10:09,00:10:12,"So the way it does that about a day before it cracks out of the shell,"
00:10:12,00:10:17,it pecks its beak into that little air hole and uses it like a snorkeler mask
00:10:17,00:10:19,and just practices breathing every day.
00:10:19,00:10:23,I take a step closer to veganism and I know.
00:10:23,00:10:25,"I mean, how adorable is that?"
00:10:25,00:10:27,And we're here making omelettes out of it.
00:10:27,00:10:29,"Yeah, it makes beautiful."
00:10:29,00:10:32,"So I'm probably going to upset you now because I've eaten ballot,"
00:10:32,00:10:40,which is a Vietnamese thing where the the egg has a semi fertilised chick
00:10:40,00:10:42,inside the egg when they cook it.
00:10:42,00:10:46,"I must admit, when I tried it, I couldn't."
00:10:46,00:10:49,I could only eat the bit of egg around the.
00:10:49,00:10:51,I'll just I'll just eat around.
00:10:51,00:10:59,It's like it's a real delicacy in Vietnam
00:10:59,00:11:03,and sometimes used as a way of getting over your hangover as well.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"I mean, you can't criticise it, can you?"
00:11:05,00:11:08,"If you eat eggs, then there's no it's not really that much different."
00:11:08,00:11:09,But how do you time that?
00:11:09,00:11:12,Do you get like an ultrasonic scanner?
00:11:12,00:11:14,You give it like an egg ultrasound.
00:11:14,00:11:15,"Then you go, right, it's three weeks."
00:11:15,00:11:16,It's good to go.
00:11:16,00:11:18,"Oh, no."
00:11:18,00:11:19,"Oh, I don't know if I can."
00:11:19,00:11:22,"There's something about the idea of it, so obviously, you know."
00:11:22,00:11:27,"Well, if we're anthropomorphising eggs and we are now all eggs in America"
00:11:27,00:11:30,have had a little shampoo before they go into the shops.
00:11:30,00:11:33,"Yeah, it's so weird."
00:11:33,00:11:36,"So they love in America, they love to wash their eggs."
00:11:36,00:11:39,But that creates a problem because they have this natural bloom on them.
00:11:39,00:11:42,"They have this sort of bacterial layer, which we can't see."
00:11:42,00:11:44,But it's a rather it keeps bacteria out.
00:11:44,00:11:46,It's a way of kind of protecting it.
00:11:46,00:11:48,"So, you know, if the egg gets a bit of poo on it or whatever,"
00:11:48,00:11:50,"as it's being laid, it's fine."
00:11:50,00:11:51,It doesn't matter.
00:11:51,00:11:53,"And so in America, they love to give them a little shampoo."
00:11:53,00:11:56,But then the problem is you shampoo them
00:11:56,00:11:58,and then there are the high odds of bacterial invasion.
00:11:58,00:12:01,So then they have to refrigerate them and spray them with oil as a nightmare.
00:12:01,00:12:03,So we don't do that in Europe.
00:12:03,00:12:07,It is illegal to wash an egg before you sell it to people.
00:12:07,00:12:09,Wow. Yeah.
00:12:09,00:12:13,"I always think if you kind of get an egg and there's a little feather on there,"
00:12:13,00:12:17,I always think that's a very probably a fresh egg from a chicken
00:12:17,00:12:18,who had a very good life or something.
00:12:18,00:12:22,But I reckon there's probably a person in a factory just putting feathers in the egg.
00:12:22,00:12:25,"And the poo, yeah, but it's a bone."
00:12:25,00:12:27,"Because if you get a bit of chicken poo, you think, oh,"
00:12:27,00:12:29,that's literally just come out of its arse.
00:12:29,00:12:33,"I wasn't even had time to lose the poo, but you're right."
00:12:33,00:12:37,I bet someone's just taping it on because they do that with yolks.
00:12:37,00:12:40,What colour yolks do you guys want?
00:12:40,00:12:43,"Like orangey, do you crack your egg into the pan?"
00:12:43,00:12:47,Yeah. I want a bright yellow yolk.
00:12:47,00:12:50,"Like literally like the sun, but like really deep rich yellow."
00:12:50,00:12:53,Yeah. Rich. I go with that.
00:12:53,00:12:55,"I want one that's more like Donald Trump's skin colour,"
00:12:55,00:12:58,"like really deep, dark orange."
00:12:58,00:12:59,You want to go orange?
00:12:59,00:13:01,"Well, people do seem to prefer orange."
00:13:01,00:13:04,And it's because they think the chicken's like healthier.
00:13:04,00:13:07,"So, yeah, if it's like really rich yellow or deep orange,"
00:13:07,00:13:10,they're like that shows that it's had a better diet.
00:13:10,00:13:13,And so producers have realised that people prefer that.
00:13:13,00:13:15,And so they just feed them died food.
00:13:16,00:13:20,"So whenever you get an egg and it has a rich orange yolk,"
00:13:20,00:13:22,it does not taste better and it is not more nutritious.
00:13:22,00:13:25,It is probably in like 99% of cases.
00:13:25,00:13:28,It's that the farmer has basically put
00:13:28,00:13:30,usually an additive or some dye in their food.
00:13:30,00:13:33,"Sometimes if you're going organic, apparently they'll feed them"
00:13:33,00:13:37,"marigold petals or red petals to help the carotenoids, you know,"
00:13:37,00:13:41,the stuff that dyes carrots and stuff orange to help them get into the egg.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"I think that is a good sign, though."
00:13:43,00:13:46,If my farmer is willing to pick marigold petals
00:13:46,00:13:49,"in order to feed them to the chicken, it's going right."
00:13:49,00:13:53,Throwing the petals around so that the chickens have a really romantic evening.
00:13:53,00:13:58,You're right. Valentine's Day in the in the heart is a huge deal.
00:13:58,00:14:03,"Very quickly on the hat itself, the 100 cleats hat."
00:14:03,00:14:07,"Yeah. And so invented by Marie Antoine Karem,"
00:14:07,00:14:12,"who was probably the predecessor to a scoffier who Andy mentioned earlier on,"
00:14:12,00:14:15,"probably maybe the first celebrity chef, I would say."
00:14:15,00:14:17,I'm not sure. I can't think of anyone earlier.
00:14:17,00:14:21,But he had these big hats because he wanted to have authority.
00:14:21,00:14:26,And he thought the bigger and more erect your hat is the more people take you seriously.
00:14:26,00:14:29,"And so the better a chef you were, the taller it was supposed to be."
00:14:29,00:14:31,And his was 18 inches in height.
00:14:31,00:14:36,"Yeah. I mean, this is the man's like invention, clearly."
00:14:36,00:14:39,"This is like, how can I make people respect me 18 inches? That's respect."
00:14:39,00:14:42,"Yeah, I kind of think it was a bit of that."
00:14:42,00:14:45,"Alexis Sawyer, who was around the same time, he was the chef of the reform club."
00:14:45,00:14:50,He wore a big black velvet beret with a huge tassel.
00:14:50,00:14:54,And the whole point of that was he was too important to cook with it.
00:14:54,00:14:55,He was like the head chef.
00:14:55,00:14:58,"Everyone else, the sous chef and stuff, did all the work."
00:14:58,00:15:00,He was the big head chef.
00:15:00,00:15:03,"And if he wore a hat that was too impractical to do any work,"
00:15:03,00:15:05,it showed that he was really important.
00:15:05,00:15:07,That's brilliant. That's so clever.
00:15:07,00:15:10,"So, yeah, it's just too difficult for him to cook."
00:15:10,00:15:11,"Therefore, he's the boss."
00:15:11,00:15:13,"Pretty much. You should try it in the office, Andy."
00:15:13,00:15:17,Come into the office wearing sort of mittens and a balaclava.
00:15:17,00:15:20,"And sunglasses, so I can't see any words in front of me."
00:15:20,00:15:22,And gaffer tape your mouth.
00:15:22,00:15:24,This is sounding better and better.
00:15:24,00:15:33,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:15:33,00:15:35,And that is James Harkin.
00:15:35,00:15:40,"OK, my fact this week is that when men are played the sound of a baby crying,"
00:15:40,00:15:43,"if they're told it's a boy, they'll think it's in more pain"
00:15:43,00:15:46,than if they're told it's a girl.
00:15:46,00:15:47,Wow.
00:15:47,00:15:52,"So what men think male babies are macho, is that?"
00:15:52,00:15:55,"Yes, you've kind of got there, Andy, almost."
00:15:55,00:15:59,"So this is a new study by researchers at the University of Sussex,"
00:15:59,00:16:04,the University of Leon Santetien and Hunter College City University in New York.
00:16:04,00:16:08,"And what they did was they played a load of cries to men and women,"
00:16:08,00:16:12,"their parents, actually, and they asked them whether they thought"
00:16:12,00:16:17,"the child was in pain or happy or sad or how much pain it was in, etc., etc."
00:16:17,00:16:22,"And the thing is that before puberty, the voices of boys and girls,"
00:16:22,00:16:24,"and especially babies, the cries of boys and girls are the same."
00:16:24,00:16:26,There's no difference in pitch.
00:16:26,00:16:32,"But people, especially men, think that the male baby will have a deeper cry."
00:16:32,00:16:36,"And so when they hear the cry, if it's high pitch, they think it's in more pain."
00:16:36,00:16:39,"And because they expect the male baby to have a deeper cry,"
00:16:39,00:16:43,normally they think that the difference means that it's in more pain.
00:16:43,00:16:46,"I think that's really funny that it's like, what's wrong with this child?"
00:16:46,00:16:49,And they expect to like bury white to come out of its mouth.
00:16:49,00:16:52,"And it's a high pitch, high pitch squeal."
00:16:52,00:16:54,"It's like, oh, my gosh, no, it's a baby."
00:16:54,00:16:55,There's nothing wrong with your child.
00:16:55,00:16:57,That's where it's the beard. Where's his beard?
00:16:57,00:17:01,"And yeah, it is quite funny."
00:17:01,00:17:05,The thing that the researchers say is it could have implications
00:17:05,00:17:09,"for the welfare of children, because it means that if a female child is crying,"
00:17:09,00:17:13,you might give it less attention than if a male child is crying.
00:17:13,00:17:15,"Oh, this is why we have man flu then, clearly,"
00:17:15,00:17:18,because boys are so used to being given attention they don't need.
00:17:18,00:17:20,"Or, you know, then they grow out to be like, oh, got a little cough."
00:17:20,00:17:22,"Oh, it's the flu. It's the flu."
00:17:22,00:17:25,"Whereas girls are like, yeah, girls are going to work with like headless"
00:17:25,00:17:29,because that's fine. It's just a scratch.
00:17:29,00:17:31,"Oh, my God, I think you might be hit on something there."
00:17:31,00:17:32,"That feels right, doesn't it?"
00:17:32,00:17:35,"Yeah, I thought it was that male parents say, you know,"
00:17:35,00:17:37,"they'll they'll listen to the crying and they'll think,"
00:17:37,00:17:40,"well, my baby boy wouldn't be making a fuss unless it was something really serious."
00:17:40,00:17:42,It wouldn't be disturbing me.
00:17:42,00:17:43,"Well, that might be true as well,"
00:17:43,00:17:46,but this study was specifically about the pitch of the cells.
00:17:46,00:17:50,"Well, so we just have to start complaining in a deeper voice"
00:17:50,00:17:52,in order to have people take notice of us.
00:17:52,00:17:56,"No, you have to complain in a much, much, much higher voice"
00:17:56,00:17:59,to make up for the fact that you have a higher voice already.
00:17:59,00:18:03,"Oh, sorry. Yeah, we have all we have to speak in deeper voices all the time."
00:18:03,00:18:05,And then the contrast to our high complain.
00:18:05,00:18:08,Don't go too high because then it will just be dogs that care.
00:18:08,00:18:13,Dogs are pretty comforting. I think that might work for me.
00:18:13,00:18:17,"It's with the response to babies crying, right, that you get."
00:18:17,00:18:22,"Well, I'm always told that once you become a mother, I guess, specifically,"
00:18:22,00:18:25,you have a very instinctive response to babies crying.
00:18:25,00:18:27,So I hear babies crying and I think that's a really horrible noise.
00:18:27,00:18:32,"And I think, actually, there was a study on the noises people find most grating"
00:18:32,00:18:35,and babies crying was the worst.
00:18:35,00:18:38,"But like, is there a difference?"
00:18:38,00:18:41,"Do you find there was a difference once you had children, Athena,"
00:18:41,00:18:44,where like you hear a baby crying and like a bit of you dies?
00:18:44,00:18:45,Yes. Or does it sound lovely?
00:18:45,00:18:47,Does it suddenly sound wonderful?
00:18:47,00:18:48,There's only one difference.
00:18:48,00:18:50,"And that is when you hear the baby cry, you lactate."
00:18:50,00:18:52,That's the only difference really.
00:18:52,00:18:54,It never gets more or less annoying.
00:18:54,00:18:55,It just you just start leaking.
00:18:57,00:19:00,"But yeah, there's definitely I think it's I mean, I would speculate"
00:19:00,00:19:01,"it's evolution, isn't it?"
00:19:01,00:19:05,Because when it's what's really funny is babies have unique cries.
00:19:05,00:19:07,They all do. But sometimes you go out in public and there'll be a baby
00:19:07,00:19:10,that sounds like your baby and that baby will make you lactate
00:19:10,00:19:13,because it will just have a similar pitch or a sound.
00:19:13,00:19:16,"Right. And I'll be like, oh, that sounds like that sounds like one of my kids."
00:19:16,00:19:19,"And then it's, oh, dearie me, here we go again."
00:19:19,00:19:21,I forgot my pads.
00:19:21,00:19:26,"Sorry, I can only apologise to any listeners who can hear the baby"
00:19:26,00:19:29,in the background and have spontaneously started lactating.
00:19:29,00:19:33,"Lactation is so weird, though."
00:19:33,00:19:35,So there's tons of stuff I didn't know.
00:19:35,00:19:38,Like people can lactate when they're not mothers.
00:19:38,00:19:41,"And this is really, really important in loads of societies."
00:19:41,00:19:43,And it seems to be quite under-researched.
00:19:43,00:19:47,So they're like hunter-gatherer societies where there's a lot more
00:19:47,00:19:49,"aloe parenting, where it's parenting in groups."
00:19:49,00:19:52,So there's not even really one specific caregiver.
00:19:52,00:19:56,Your baby will be cared for by maybe 12 different people.
00:19:56,00:19:58,And grandmothers will be able to lactate.
00:19:58,00:20:02,"So they'll, and it's just by like having the nipples stimulated very often."
00:20:02,00:20:05,"Women who have had a baby before at some point,"
00:20:05,00:20:09,they'll just lactate again so they can nurse their infants
00:20:09,00:20:11,or your friend who's had a baby wants to nurse the infant.
00:20:11,00:20:15,"Interesting. And the idea is that if you live in like a society,"
00:20:15,00:20:18,then it's useful for more than one person to be able to do that.
00:20:18,00:20:19,Right. Is that the idea?
00:20:19,00:20:23,"Yeah, I think it's a little bit of survival, wasn't as guaranteed."
00:20:23,00:20:26,"So if your mum dies, then you can just latch on to someone else."
00:20:26,00:20:29,"But also, I guess it's just a different way cultures develop."
00:20:29,00:20:32,"Like the Aka people who are in Central Africa,"
00:20:32,00:20:33,I don't think we've talked about them before.
00:20:33,00:20:37,They're the ones who have fathers who spend as much time with the babies
00:20:37,00:20:40,"as the mothers, and they're totally interchangeable, their roles."
00:20:40,00:20:43,And they're always holding their kids.
00:20:43,00:20:46,So they're in contact with kids up to the age of one and a half
00:20:46,00:20:50,for like 97 percent of the time they're either touching or holding.
00:20:50,00:20:54,"And the fathers, when they're doing it, which will be about 50 percent of the time,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,they will let the babies suckle on their nipples.
00:20:56,00:20:59,"So when the baby needs comforting, it just suckles on its father's teats."
00:20:59,00:21:03,At least there's a use for male nipples because they have no other function.
00:21:03,00:21:05,So exactly. That makes that makes a lot of sense.
00:21:05,00:21:08,"There's a great fact about breastfeeding, which I found out first with the first baby."
00:21:08,00:21:12,"If you do it continuously, it's a form of natural contraception."
00:21:12,00:21:16,You know that I didn't know that because you can't the idea.
00:21:16,00:21:19,You don't want to conceive children one after the other really quickly.
00:21:19,00:21:21,That's quite bad if you're like a woman and you've gone through pregnancy.
00:21:21,00:21:24,"You want to kind of wait, give it, give yourself a bit of time."
00:21:24,00:21:27,"You know what I mean? And the lactation helps you do that, which I didn't know."
00:21:27,00:21:29,That's really interesting.
00:21:29,00:21:31,It's smart. I feel like it's not guaranteed.
00:21:31,00:21:34,"No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't bank on it."
00:21:34,00:21:38,I'd give yourself a safety net if I was used to anyone listening.
00:21:38,00:21:40,Like get yourself an insurance policy.
00:21:40,00:21:44,"However, when I had my first, I didn't have a period for like a year."
00:21:44,00:21:46,"Like, yeah, it was brilliant."
00:21:46,00:21:48,"I was like, I'm going to breastfeed forever."
00:21:49,00:21:53,"You know, it's kind of in the child's interest then to carry on breastfeeding"
00:21:53,00:21:57,because then there aren't any more children to kind of like use up the.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"Oh, yeah, resources. Yeah. Yeah."
00:21:59,00:22:01,You don't want any bastard siblings.
00:22:01,00:22:03,That's why they want to keep latched on.
00:22:03,00:22:08,"So, Athena, you were saying that you can really tell the difference"
00:22:08,00:22:10,between the cries of your baby and someone else's baby.
00:22:10,00:22:16,This is interesting because lots of animals and even lots of mammals
00:22:16,00:22:19,can't tell the difference between their young and other animals.
00:22:19,00:22:22,So this was an experiment by someone called Susan Lingle
00:22:22,00:22:26,"where she played a deer through a speaker,"
00:22:26,00:22:31,"the noise of other mammals' babies crying and, you know, making a noise."
00:22:31,00:22:34,And the deer cannot tell the difference.
00:22:34,00:22:38,"So they will react very strongly to a baby deer, but also to a baby bat,"
00:22:38,00:22:41,"a baby marmot, a baby eland."
00:22:41,00:22:44,"It will just run. It's like, oh, no, there's a young mammal in trouble."
00:22:44,00:22:48,"And this might be because, I mean, the reason is because mammals"
00:22:48,00:22:51,have the same larynx or really similar larynxes until puberty.
00:22:51,00:22:54,And then the difference between all the species kicks in.
00:22:54,00:22:57,"But before puberty, basically, it's like spread betting."
00:22:57,00:23:00,"You know, you parents need to respond to a cry"
00:23:00,00:23:03,which might be their child just in case it's their child in danger.
00:23:03,00:23:08,"And so if it turns out to be a baby marmot, then, you know, well, such is life."
00:23:08,00:23:12,And it's useful for the child because then you might get some if you're in trouble.
00:23:12,00:23:15,"You might, you know, you might be a dear Bambi sort of getting in trouble"
00:23:15,00:23:17,because there's some people coming trying to shoot you.
00:23:17,00:23:20,And then a friendly bat might come along to save you.
00:23:20,00:23:22,"Well, you'd hope for a bear."
00:23:22,00:23:24,"You'd be like, oh, man, I hope the bear would come."
00:23:24,00:23:27,That would be really useful.
00:23:27,00:23:31,"But this does imply that if, you know, you're walking past a certain fox cub"
00:23:31,00:23:33,"or something, Athena, then you might start lactating."
00:23:33,00:23:37,I would have thought that certain mammals could induce lactation
00:23:37,00:23:39,"in the same way that certain babies could, right?"
00:23:39,00:23:40,I hadn't considered that.
00:23:40,00:23:43,The neighbours have just got a new puppy.
00:23:43,00:23:44,You're in trouble.
00:23:44,00:23:45,So stock up on pads.
00:23:45,00:23:49,"I'll have to go outside and I'll just say, get your dog out here for a second."
00:23:49,00:23:51,Let's do an experiment.
00:23:51,00:23:53,Let's see how that works.
00:23:53,00:23:54,Babble is a weird thing.
00:23:54,00:23:56,"Baby's babble, right?"
00:23:56,00:23:59,"And that it kind of starts to imitate language, I guess."
00:23:59,00:24:03,And I think people can tell if babies are babbling in their own language.
00:24:03,00:24:07,"So if I heard a five month old making nonsense noises,"
00:24:07,00:24:12,I should be able to tell whether it's an English speaker or a non-English speaker.
00:24:12,00:24:15,"Because, again, they imitate the quality of the tone,"
00:24:15,00:24:19,the timbre of the voice in which they're speaking.
00:24:19,00:24:22,But it's really interesting because babies of deaf parents who speak sign language
00:24:22,00:24:24,babble in sign language.
00:24:24,00:24:26,So whereas that you'll have like a five month old baby
00:24:26,00:24:29,"who doesn't know any sign language, has never seen sign language."
00:24:29,00:24:32,"They'll just randomly clench their fists and like, play their hands out."
00:24:32,00:24:34,Sign language babies will kind of babble.
00:24:34,00:24:37,"So they'll make signs a little bit like words,"
00:24:37,00:24:39,but that don't specifically mean anything yet.
00:24:39,00:24:42,"But with like quite deliberate, like they're practicing trying to learn it."
00:24:42,00:24:46,But baby sign is a thing that you can teach your babies how to sign.
00:24:46,00:24:47,Right.
00:24:47,00:24:50,"Like from about six months onwards, you can get them to tell you when they're hungry."
00:24:50,00:24:53,You can get them to tell you when they need to go toilet.
00:24:53,00:24:56,"It takes like time and effort, but this is a true story."
00:24:56,00:24:58,"And I keep, I didn't do it with my first song, it's going to be bothered."
00:24:58,00:25:01,"But this one now, I was like, right,"
00:25:01,00:25:03,we're having such a hard time putting train in the first one.
00:25:03,00:25:05,"I'm like, right, we're learning sign."
00:25:05,00:25:06,I'm doing it.
00:25:06,00:25:10,"I'm investing 20 minutes a day in just, just tell me when you need to toilet."
00:25:10,00:25:12,That's all that's the only thing I want.
00:25:12,00:25:14,"That's the only thing you need to say, isn't it?"
00:25:14,00:25:16,"Everything else is fine, but it's distinctive as well."
00:25:16,00:25:17,So they're babies.
00:25:17,00:25:20,"A lot of the time it's, you just have to learn what they're doing instinctively."
00:25:20,00:25:23,"So apparently they, if a baby brings their fingers to their mouth, really easy one."
00:25:23,00:25:24,I'm hungry.
00:25:24,00:25:26,"And there's another one which means I need a poo, which I've forgotten."
00:25:26,00:25:27,But it can be done.
00:25:27,00:25:31,I've been told I've been told I'm going to interview you in six months time.
00:25:31,00:25:35,You'll be interviewing the baby.
00:25:35,00:25:37,How about that?
00:25:37,00:25:41,"That is, I think you mentioned an email, Athena, and I've read this thing as well"
00:25:41,00:25:43,about potty training babies.
00:25:43,00:25:47,"And I actually forgot to go back to it, but there are definitely people who don't"
00:25:47,00:25:49,believe in nappies at all.
00:25:49,00:25:53,And there's a way of potty training babies where you just kind of let them poo
00:25:53,00:25:55,whenever they want to.
00:25:55,00:25:57,And you learn when it looks like they're going to poo.
00:25:57,00:26:01,"And then you run them to the loo and you never have to use a nappy, which sounds great."
00:26:01,00:26:03,And there's a bunch of New York mothers who kind of do that.
00:26:03,00:26:06,"And they say for the first month or two, you do get some poo on your carpet."
00:26:06,00:26:09,Sounds like a lot of jeopardy.
00:26:09,00:26:10,Yes.
00:26:10,00:26:12,But then you sort of train the babies to give you a sign when they're going to go
00:26:12,00:26:16,"to the loo, like you say, there'll be a sort of sign they use, whether they point"
00:26:16,00:26:18,"at their bum, I don't know, do a little fart."
00:26:18,00:26:20,And then it's like you've got to run them to a toilet.
00:26:20,00:26:22,"You have, yeah, laminate floors."
00:26:22,00:26:24,That's what I'd say for that one.
00:26:24,00:26:26,That's the real key.
00:26:26,00:26:29,"If you haven't got laminate, I'd probably just get some pampers."
00:26:29,00:26:30,But nappies are really wasteful.
00:26:30,00:26:34,"Like, I think a baby goes through, you know, in, well, first of all, in the 80s,"
00:26:34,00:26:37,babies used to put your train around 18 months.
00:26:37,00:26:40,"Because at that point, because people used to use terry towels and things like that."
00:26:40,00:26:42,And terry towels get wet.
00:26:42,00:26:44,"So babies are like, oh, this is horrible."
00:26:44,00:26:46,"And they're like, you know what, let me get me on a toilet."
00:26:46,00:26:47,This is disgusting.
00:26:47,00:26:48,And they're also harder to crawl in.
00:26:48,00:26:50,"So they're not as mobile, so uncomfortable."
00:26:50,00:26:53,But now we use kind of these nappies that are really comfortable.
00:26:53,00:26:54,So I understand they're comfortable.
00:26:54,00:26:55,They're really dry.
00:26:55,00:26:57,"They make, they allow babies to be mobile."
00:26:57,00:27:00,The average age for training now is about between two and three.
00:27:00,00:27:03,So you're saying they've been indulged?
00:27:03,00:27:05,"Well, yeah, absolutely."
00:27:05,00:27:09,"Well, indulge, obviously, to make more money for companies that make nappies."
00:27:09,00:27:10,"But that's incredible, right?"
00:27:10,00:27:14,Like babies that used to train at 18 months now train at three years.
00:27:14,00:27:15,That's the supervillain plotline.
00:27:15,00:27:18,Do you want a company that's investing in making nappies so good
00:27:18,00:27:20,that people never take them off?
00:27:20,00:27:21,"I know, that's what I was thinking."
00:27:21,00:27:25,There's new smart nappies that have just been invented by pampers.
00:27:25,00:27:26,They're called Lumi.
00:27:26,00:27:30,"And I reckon once these are in, you're literally until you're in your early 20s,"
00:27:30,00:27:32,you're going to be wearing those.
00:27:32,00:27:34,"Is this where they text you, James?"
00:27:34,00:27:35,"Well, they tell you, yeah."
00:27:35,00:27:39,"They tell you they text the parents saying, I have checked myself."
00:27:39,00:27:43,"If I'm so far from my baby that I need to be texted,"
00:27:43,00:27:45,"that means someone, someone else's job."
00:27:45,00:27:48,I've paid the sitter to deal with that.
00:27:48,00:27:50,What is it to me for?
00:27:50,00:27:53,"You should just text the nearest phone, shouldn't it, to the baby?"
00:27:53,00:27:55,Yeah.
00:27:55,00:27:58,"But then everyone, of course, because it's a smart thing,"
00:27:58,00:28:02,everyone's worried about hackers and that someone might hack possible.
00:28:02,00:28:06,What possible data can the hackers get that's going to help them on this?
00:28:06,00:28:09,Unless they're working for Big Pampa and maybe.
00:28:09,00:28:13,"Well, all it can really do is tell you how often this individual child"
00:28:13,00:28:15,shits themselves or pisses themselves.
00:28:15,00:28:18,But the idea could be that it might be attached to your phone
00:28:18,00:28:22,"and then using your phone, they might be able to get your bank details, maybe."
00:28:22,00:28:25,I feel it feels like a stretch.
00:28:25,00:28:27,"It feels like if I was a hacker,"
00:28:27,00:28:30,this wouldn't be the first thing I would hack in order to get to the purse strings.
00:28:30,00:28:31,"You know, yeah."
00:28:31,00:28:34,Getting bank details to a baby's bottom doesn't feel round about way.
00:28:34,00:28:42,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:28:42,00:28:44,And that is my fact.
00:28:44,00:28:47,My fact this week is that traditional Ethiopian households
00:28:47,00:28:52,can spend up to nine hours a day on coffee ceremonies.
00:28:52,00:28:54,Wow. Now I know what you're thinking.
00:28:54,00:28:58,"Come on, no, no. That's what I'm thinking."
00:28:58,00:29:01,They wouldn't get anything done.
00:29:01,00:29:06,"So I should specify, I asked far too many people about this."
00:29:06,00:29:08,I actually ended up interviewing four separate people
00:29:08,00:29:11,who have lived in Ethiopia or Ethiopian.
00:29:11,00:29:14,And basically coffee ceremonies are a massive part of life in Ethiopia.
00:29:14,00:29:17,And they can last up to three hours.
00:29:17,00:29:20,So the first hour is roasting the coffee
00:29:20,00:29:22,and then you kind of grind it and make it.
00:29:22,00:29:26,"And then it's all about sitting around, having a chat, debating politics."
00:29:26,00:29:27,What have you.
00:29:27,00:29:29,And so you'll do that.
00:29:29,00:29:32,"And then particularly in rural places, you might do it three times a day."
00:29:32,00:29:35,"So breakfast, lunch and dinner time."
00:29:35,00:29:39,"Now, you probably aren't doing it three times a day every day for three hours"
00:29:39,00:29:41,because you wouldn't be able to hold down a job.
00:29:41,00:29:45,"No, maybe they have like a Nespresso machine for day to day stuff."
00:29:45,00:29:49,"And then for the special occasions, they do the three hour thing."
00:29:49,00:29:50,No. Yeah. Yeah.
00:29:50,00:29:53,"Maybe it's a lockdown thing, you know, it's a lockdown."
00:29:53,00:29:56,You might as well spend nine hours a day.
00:29:56,00:29:57,"Yeah, you're right. It's a good idea."
00:29:57,00:29:59,How how do we fill our time?
00:29:59,00:30:01,Let's drag this out for a while.
00:30:01,00:30:04,The queues at Starbucks in Ethiopia must be absolutely enormous.
00:30:04,00:30:09,Can you imagine if there's one person in front of you that's two days away?
00:30:09,00:30:11,"And after all that time, they still get your name wrong."
00:30:11,00:30:14,Three hours. Come on.
00:30:14,00:30:16,"I suppose one guy who runs this place called Kaffa Coffee,"
00:30:16,00:30:19,which is actually this really nice Ethiopian coffee.
00:30:20,00:30:22,Would like Van in Dulston.
00:30:22,00:30:23,"Anyway, he was great."
00:30:23,00:30:27,So he was I was asking him about it and holding up the queue behind me.
00:30:27,00:30:31,"And he was saying that actually how it would work where he was from anyway,"
00:30:31,00:30:35,is that you'd be in your village and you would hear the first person
00:30:35,00:30:38,to get up and start roasting the beans because it makes a really loud noise.
00:30:38,00:30:39,"You've got a very, very hot pan."
00:30:39,00:30:42,"And when the beans crash onto it, they really crackle at first."
00:30:42,00:30:46,"And once you hear that person, you're like, OK, someone else is doing the coffee today."
00:30:46,00:30:50,I don't have to. And you're bringing your leftovers from the night before from the meal.
00:30:50,00:30:54,If you've got some bread left over and you'll sort of swap that for some coffee
00:30:54,00:30:56,and hang out doing that.
00:30:56,00:30:58,So that makes more sense.
00:30:58,00:31:00,Like it's not every single household is doing that many times a day.
00:31:00,00:31:04,"Well, Kaffa actually is the name of the region, isn't it?"
00:31:04,00:31:08,"In Ethiopia, where coffee originated, I think."
00:31:08,00:31:12,"And actually, it's where we and almost every country in the world"
00:31:12,00:31:14,"gets the word for coffee is from this place, Kaffa."
00:31:15,00:31:17,Wow. Makes sense.
00:31:17,00:31:20,"We have said before, just in case there's a pedant out there that coffee originated"
00:31:20,00:31:24,in Yemen and there is some hot debate between those two countries about it.
00:31:24,00:31:26,"And I think you can engage with that, if you want."
00:31:26,00:31:30,"What I think and, you know, I don't want to get into a conflict"
00:31:30,00:31:34,"with the Yemenis or the Ethiopians, but I think the coffee plants"
00:31:34,00:31:38,"was really found in Ethiopia, but then modern day coffee."
00:31:38,00:31:42,"Actually, not even modern day coffee, but, you know, early modern coffee"
00:31:42,00:31:44,came from Yemen to drink.
00:31:44,00:31:45,That sounds right.
00:31:45,00:31:48,"Well, it sounds like you're determined to not pick a side in this conflict."
00:31:48,00:31:53,Quite cool in this coffee ceremony as well.
00:31:53,00:31:55,The traditional ceremony has three rounds.
00:31:55,00:31:58,And the first round is where you get your strongest cup
00:31:58,00:32:00,and then you re pour the water.
00:32:00,00:32:02,So it's a weaker cup for the second round.
00:32:02,00:32:04,And then the weakest is the last round.
00:32:04,00:32:07,And they're called Abol Tona and Bereka.
00:32:07,00:32:11,"And that is, according to their legend, the name of the three goats"
00:32:11,00:32:14,"who invented coffee, according to Ethiopian legend."
00:32:14,00:32:17,"Again, I did ask this guy and he was like, yeah, yeah, the goats."
00:32:17,00:32:18,They're the names of the goats.
00:32:18,00:32:21,"And the idea is that like over a thousand years ago,"
00:32:21,00:32:25,a goat herder saw his goats acting all jumpy and twitchy and weird.
00:32:25,00:32:28,And then he saw that they'd eaten these cherries sitting next to them.
00:32:28,00:32:30,And they were the coffee cherries.
00:32:30,00:32:31,And so he brought them to some monks.
00:32:31,00:32:33,"See, this is just like the eggs."
00:32:33,00:32:36,It's just like the thousand year egg being discovered completely by mistake.
00:32:36,00:32:39,No one is ever willing to admit I grew a plant
00:32:39,00:32:42,and I experimented with hundreds of ways of cooking it.
00:32:42,00:32:43,And this is the one I discovered.
00:32:43,00:32:45,It's my work that's done this.
00:32:45,00:32:47,It's always always a magic plant
00:32:47,00:32:48,and the goats happen to be sprightly.
00:32:48,00:32:51,What makes me laugh about that story is that he saw his goats for dancing.
00:32:51,00:32:54,"He was like, I want what they're having."
00:32:54,00:33:00,"I wouldn't go near it personally myself, but thank goodness that person did."
00:33:00,00:33:01,Exactly.
00:33:01,00:33:05,The mind of a great inventor always wants to mimic the dancing goat.
00:33:05,00:33:08,Have you guys heard of the women's petition against coffee?
00:33:09,00:33:15,This was a pamphlet that was published in England in 1674.
00:33:15,00:33:18,And it was at a time when coffee was quite controversial
00:33:18,00:33:23,"because coffee houses, as I think Anna said, they allow discussion of all sorts."
00:33:23,00:33:25,Politics is one thing.
00:33:25,00:33:28,"So, you know, you might be discussing politics"
00:33:28,00:33:31,and you might decide that you don't like the king very much or whatever.
00:33:31,00:33:32,So political discussion was dangerous.
00:33:32,00:33:36,"And anyway, this women's petition against coffee was published in 1674,"
00:33:37,00:33:38,which claimed all sorts of stuff.
00:33:38,00:33:42,It said coffee makes a man as unfruitful as the deserts
00:33:42,00:33:44,whence that unhappy berry is said to be brought.
00:33:44,00:33:47,So it sort of damages men's fertility.
00:33:47,00:33:49,Or that when a woman approaches the nuptial bed
00:33:49,00:33:52,"expecting a man that should answer the vigor of her flames,"
00:33:52,00:33:57,she why should she only meet a bed full of bones and hug a meagre useless corpse?
00:33:57,00:33:59,Strong stuff about coffee.
00:33:59,00:34:03,But I know the weird thing is it probably wasn't by women.
00:34:04,00:34:07,"It's written in a way which implies that it's written by a man,"
00:34:07,00:34:10,"sort of ventriloquizing women, like, oh, it makes men so gossipy."
00:34:10,00:34:13,They're more gossipy than us women who are writing this petition.
00:34:13,00:34:15,It's in that kind of vein.
00:34:15,00:34:20,"And also, was it in the petition, the thing about meeting an old skeleton corpse in bed?"
00:34:20,00:34:21,That was in the petition.
00:34:21,00:34:24,"Yeah. See, that doesn't sound like a woman to me."
00:34:24,00:34:29,It's like a relief if what you're meeting is sort of skeletal mess.
00:34:29,00:34:31,He doesn't want to do anything.
00:34:31,00:34:32,That sounded very much a man.
00:34:32,00:34:34,"And also, coffee is supposed to make you live longer."
00:34:34,00:34:35,So you're less likely to meet a skeleton.
00:34:35,00:34:37,He'll be full of life.
00:34:37,00:34:40,And these are all these are all arguments against the women's petition.
00:34:40,00:34:43,"I also thought if you drank lots of coffee, you turned into George Clooney."
00:34:43,00:34:45,Is that not that's what TV's taught me?
00:34:45,00:34:47,"Yeah, that's right. Keep drinking it, James."
00:34:47,00:34:49,Keep going.
00:34:49,00:34:51,You're nearly there.
00:34:51,00:34:54,"Is that right? I'm doing nine hours a day, so I shouldn't be right now."
00:34:54,00:34:57,"That or Anthony Head, do you remember his old adverts?"
00:34:57,00:34:59,"Oh, yeah, of course."
00:34:59,00:35:01,"Anthony Head, is he the guy from Buffy?"
00:35:01,00:35:02,Yeah.
00:35:02,00:35:07,"Yeah, but he's the guy from the Nescafé sexy couple flirting adverts, really."
00:35:07,00:35:08,"Yeah, that does ring a bell."
00:35:08,00:35:12,"He was quite an anxious character in Buffy, so a bad person to advertise coffee."
00:35:12,00:35:15,Whereas George Clooney is much more chill.
00:35:15,00:35:17,"That's true, but why do you think he was anxious, Anna?"
00:35:17,00:35:18,"Is that delicious Nescafé, isn't it?"
00:35:18,00:35:20,He was off his head on Nescafé all the time.
00:35:20,00:35:23,"Yeah, that's what it was, all withdrawing."
00:35:23,00:35:27,"So coffee withdrawal is a thing, which I don't drink enough coffee."
00:35:27,00:35:30,"I don't think to get serious withdrawal, but you've quit before, Andy, haven't you?"
00:35:31,00:35:32,I've quit. I'm currently quit.
00:35:32,00:35:33,You're currently quit.
00:35:33,00:35:35,You seem like you've got the shakes.
00:35:35,00:35:36,You've been very old.
00:35:36,00:35:37,Is that is that why?
00:35:37,00:35:40,"Have you ever been you've never been properly on it, though?"
00:35:40,00:35:41,Have you or have you?
00:35:41,00:35:41,"No, I was."
00:35:41,00:35:42,I was for years and years.
00:35:42,00:35:43,I just drinking several a day.
00:35:43,00:35:46,"And then when you stop, you just have a headache for two weeks."
00:35:46,00:35:48,And then and then that's that.
00:35:48,00:35:49,"Yeah, I can vouch for that."
00:35:49,00:35:50,I quit drinking coffee.
00:35:50,00:35:52,That it's very inconsistently advice.
00:35:52,00:35:54,Some people say you can't you can have coffee when you're pregnant.
00:35:54,00:35:55,Some people can say you can't.
00:35:55,00:35:57,But I just quit anyway.
00:35:57,00:35:58,I thought I'd quit and then my teeth has not been yellow.
00:35:59,00:36:01,Because that would be the advantage and I got a headache.
00:36:01,00:36:05,"Yeah, you feel well when you stop drinking that as much caffeine as you used to."
00:36:05,00:36:07,Absolutely.
00:36:07,00:36:11,Did you feel less awake or less alert or less focused or anything?
00:36:11,00:36:15,"Yeah, but that's what we do to the fact I was growing up human, you know?"
00:36:15,00:36:19,"Like, to be honest, I started drinking coffee again recently."
00:36:19,00:36:22,And I think it's all a bit of mythology video.
00:36:22,00:36:24,I don't think it makes you any more alert or awake.
00:36:24,00:36:28,I just think you just get a bit attached to the kind of your brain
00:36:28,00:36:30,"getting a bit wired, you know?"
00:36:30,00:36:33,"But I'm not I'm not more productive when I'm like, I'm not more productive"
00:36:33,00:36:35,when I'm shaking like a leaf.
00:36:35,00:36:37,"If anything, I'm less productive."
00:36:37,00:36:39,"Well, some people, it does seem to work for some people."
00:36:39,00:36:40,I kind of agree.
00:36:40,00:36:44,It makes me twitchy and endlessly Google weird health symptoms wrong with me
00:36:44,00:36:45,rather than do actual work.
00:36:45,00:36:49,"But Michael Pollan, who's the brilliant food writer"
00:36:49,00:36:51,"who wrote a book called Caffeine, which is an audio book, actually."
00:36:51,00:36:56,He is a huge coffee fan and he quit while writing the book
00:36:57,00:37:00,"and it almost ruined the actual book, which I like a book on caffeine"
00:37:00,00:37:02,was almost destroyed by caffeine withdrawal.
00:37:02,00:37:07,But he basically said that he felt like he wasn't in writing in his first language anymore.
00:37:07,00:37:11,Everything was so like words didn't hang together properly.
00:37:11,00:37:13,There was this fog between him and reality.
00:37:13,00:37:16,He lost all confidence and he thought this whole book is a completely stupid idea.
00:37:16,00:37:18,I'm going to stop writing it.
00:37:18,00:37:20,"I mean, that is a symptom of writing a book."
00:37:20,00:37:26,I think he might be blaming the coffee so that he can plug his book about coffee.
00:37:26,00:37:28,"Yeah, that literally sounds like imposter syndrome."
00:37:28,00:37:34,"You old cynics, I felt sorry for him."
00:37:34,00:37:35,"No, I didn't."
00:37:35,00:37:38,"But he did tell me why coffee apparently does keep you awake,"
00:37:38,00:37:40,"which again, I've always thought it sends me to sleep."
00:37:40,00:37:46,"But I didn't know that it was that we basically have a neurotransmitter,"
00:37:46,00:37:49,"like a chemical which sends your body a signal, which is called adenosine,"
00:37:49,00:37:51,which is what tells you to go to sleep.
00:37:51,00:37:54,"So it slots into a little receptor in your body,"
00:37:54,00:37:56,which is just the right size for it.
00:37:56,00:37:57,And tells you to go to sleep.
00:37:57,00:38:01,"And caffeine, the chemical, is exactly the right shape to fit into that receptor."
00:38:01,00:38:06,"So when you drink caffeine, it slips into there ahead of the sleep chemical."
00:38:06,00:38:08,And so it stops the sleep chemical getting in.
00:38:08,00:38:11,So it just doesn't tell your body to go to sleep.
00:38:11,00:38:12,That's really clever.
00:38:12,00:38:14,"Yeah, it's so cool, isn't it?"
00:38:14,00:38:15,I didn't know that.
00:38:15,00:38:16,"Do you think, OK, here's a question for you."
00:38:16,00:38:19,Do you think you can flush out caffeine by drinking decaf?
00:38:19,00:38:22,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:38:22,00:38:24,"Well, you can't. You're all right in your assumption."
00:38:25,00:38:27,Is that a thing?
00:38:27,00:38:31,What? I was just checking.
00:38:31,00:38:34,"I read this online and I thought, well, that seems very obvious and basic to me."
00:38:34,00:38:38,But I was hoping one of you would fall into my incredibly obvious trap.
00:38:38,00:38:39,"Wait, let me tell you. Well done."
00:38:39,00:38:42,"Did you ask, like, so somebody would drink a cup of like caffeinated coffee"
00:38:42,00:38:45,and then drink a decaf and think that balances it out?
00:38:45,00:38:48,"That's like having a gin and tonic and then having a Coke and being like,"
00:38:48,00:38:49,I'm fine to drive.
00:38:50,00:38:55,"No, no, don't worry. I've had 15 Cokes."
00:38:55,00:38:58,They make a lot of coffee.
00:38:58,00:39:01,"They grow a lot of coffee in Mastnik, the island."
00:39:01,00:39:04,And the story of how they did that is really interesting.
00:39:04,00:39:07,There was a naval officer called Gabrielle DeCleur.
00:39:07,00:39:10,"And he decided, why is that funny?"
00:39:10,00:39:12,It's a funny name.
00:39:12,00:39:15,It just sounded like you'd seen a long name when you'd given up on it.
00:39:15,00:39:20,Maybe I was doing like some French babbling or something.
00:39:21,00:39:23,Gabrielle DeCleur.
00:39:23,00:39:28,And he decided that he was going to take a plant from Paris
00:39:28,00:39:30,because they had some in the Royal Gardens there.
00:39:30,00:39:34,And he was going to take it down to Martinique and grow some coffee
00:39:34,00:39:35,plantations down there.
00:39:35,00:39:38,But the king didn't really want to give him any of his coffee plants
00:39:38,00:39:40,because they were really valuable.
00:39:40,00:39:46,So he kind of sneaked in and stole a little seedling from the Royal Garden.
00:39:46,00:39:48,"And then he decided to go to Martinique,"
00:39:48,00:39:50,"which is a long, long way away from Paris."
00:39:50,00:39:55,"First of all, he was caught in a storm and then they got attacked by pirates."
00:39:55,00:40:00,And all the time he's got this tiny little coffee plant that he's looking after.
00:40:00,00:40:03,There was a spy from the Netherlands who went after him
00:40:03,00:40:04,and tried to kill his seedling.
00:40:04,00:40:07,Just one seedling he had.
00:40:07,00:40:09,"One little seedling, one little plant."
00:40:09,00:40:10,That's so funny.
00:40:10,00:40:13,"And this little plant, like the spy, came and tried to kill him."
00:40:13,00:40:16,"They, because he was at sea for a long time, they didn't have much rations."
00:40:16,00:40:20,And so he took his tiny bit of water that he was allowed to drink
00:40:20,00:40:24,and he would share it with his seedling to keep it alive.
00:40:24,00:40:27,And then he got it to Martinique and planted it.
00:40:27,00:40:30,"And 50 years later, there were 80 million coffee trees on Martinique."
00:40:30,00:40:32,I can't even look after my yucca.
00:40:32,00:40:35,And even after a coffee plant on a boat.
00:40:35,00:40:36,Good for him. Good for him.
00:40:36,00:40:41,I think that has the makings of a great film where it's one man and his seedling.
00:40:41,00:40:43,"And, you know, he's on the boat"
00:40:43,00:40:45,and all the other sailors are looking hungrily at the seedling.
00:40:45,00:40:48,And they look at it and turns it into a big leg of ham before them or whatever.
00:40:48,00:40:53,I can't believe you didn't even bring a spare.
00:40:53,00:40:54,Take two.
00:40:54,00:40:58,"I can't believe that Andy, when he becomes a film director,"
00:40:58,00:41:02,his kind of film will have people looking at things
00:41:02,00:41:04,and then turning into massive hams.
00:41:04,00:41:07,"It's strongly based on the cut, the Looney Tunes."
00:41:07,00:41:12,I can't see you getting many Oscar nominations for that kind of movie.
00:41:12,00:41:13,We'll see. We'll see.
00:41:13,00:41:17,When the best ham category is launched thanks to my extensive lobbying campaign
00:41:17,00:41:20,"and the winner for 10 years, the road, John Ham."
00:41:20,00:41:25,One more thing.
00:41:25,00:41:30,The coffee filter was invented by a woman called Melita Benz.
00:41:30,00:41:34,"And she, according to her son, you'll love this, Andy,"
00:41:34,00:41:36,because I know you love your origin stories.
00:41:36,00:41:39,She's trying to come up with a way of making coffee.
00:41:39,00:41:41,And she just got really frustrated
00:41:41,00:41:44,and ripped out a page of her son's notebook from school
00:41:44,00:41:46,and stuck it in an old tin pot.
00:41:46,00:41:48,And it just happened to make this perfect coffee.
00:41:48,00:41:50,"And she decided that, go on."
00:41:50,00:41:54,I I like that story because it's an innovator
00:41:54,00:41:57,"thinking of looking at her environment, coming up with a thing and adapting it."
00:41:57,00:42:00,"If it if it was going with the classic format, it would be"
00:42:00,00:42:02,she was trying to pour her coffee.
00:42:02,00:42:04,"And unfortunately, her son dropped his notebook"
00:42:04,00:42:08,and a leaf was torn out and landed on top of the cup.
00:42:08,00:42:10,"And when she poured it, it caught all the ground."
00:42:10,00:42:11,"You go, oh, my God."
00:42:11,00:42:14,So I've applauded Melissa Benz for this.
00:42:14,00:42:15,"OK, fair enough."
00:42:15,00:42:19,"Well, during World War Two, the company stopped making any filters"
00:42:19,00:42:21,and started making supplies for the Nazis.
00:42:21,00:42:24,"Oh, OK."
00:42:24,00:42:27,"When I said I applauded Melita Benz, I'd like to I'd like to clarify."
00:42:27,00:42:28,What for a point?
00:42:28,00:42:31,"Well, you don't applaud her, Andy, because after the war,"
00:42:31,00:42:36,she started a program that compensated victims of a Nazi's forced labor policy.
00:42:36,00:42:39,"All right. When I said I didn't approve of her, I'd like to clarify."
00:42:40,00:42:41,Again.
00:42:41,00:42:46,Coffee was officially blessed in the 17th century by the Catholic Church
00:42:46,00:42:50,because the Pope liked it and you could do that.
00:42:50,00:42:53,So it was kind of thought as an evil drink.
00:42:53,00:42:58,It started in in Africa or in Yemen somewhere and they all drink it around there.
00:42:58,00:43:02,Then it got up into the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula.
00:43:02,00:43:03,Everyone's drinking it.
00:43:03,00:43:07,"So then it came over to Catholic Europe and everyone went, well,"
00:43:07,00:43:08,it's the drink of the infidel.
00:43:08,00:43:14,"And then Pope Clement VIII tasted some and thought, right, I love this."
00:43:14,00:43:16,What am I going to do?
00:43:16,00:43:18,Because everyone's saying this is the invention of Satan.
00:43:18,00:43:21,"It's awful. So he said, look, it's so delicious."
00:43:21,00:43:23,It would be awful to just let the infidels have use of it.
00:43:23,00:43:28,Let's trick Satan and bless it so we turn it into a Christian drink.
00:43:28,00:43:29,And he did.
00:43:29,00:43:32,And that's why you go to heaven if you drink coffee.
00:43:32,00:43:35,But that's really interesting.
00:43:35,00:43:38,"Something I realised, I didn't really realise this is how popular coffee is."
00:43:38,00:43:42,There's only one thing that's drunk more regularly than coffee and that's water.
00:43:42,00:43:44,It's literally the second most popular drink in the world.
00:43:44,00:43:45,Wow.
00:43:45,00:43:48,Which is incredible because it doesn't taste that nice.
00:43:48,00:43:49,I thought it might be Ribena or.
00:43:49,00:43:54,"But it's the second which means that humans,"
00:43:54,00:43:57,we're doing something wrong in life for us to be needed so much caffeine in our life.
00:43:57,00:44:01,"Like we need to introduce siestas all around the world, basically."
00:44:01,00:44:02,This is this is what we need.
00:44:02,00:44:04,"You're right, because it doesn't taste nice."
00:44:04,00:44:05,Whatever anyone's claiming.
00:44:05,00:44:08,We are just doing it in order to keep ourselves awake.
00:44:08,00:44:10,Let's just start sleeping more.
00:44:10,00:44:12,The idea of a Ribena based society.
00:44:12,00:44:18,I think it's less sexy if Anthony Head from Buffy is knocking on his neighbour's door at night
00:44:18,00:44:19,saying have you got any Bina?
00:44:19,00:44:22,"But he would be dressed like a massive Ribena berry, wouldn't he?"
00:44:22,00:44:25,Why is that not sexy?
00:44:25,00:44:27,His little arm sticking out.
00:44:27,00:44:33,"I don't know, George Clooney and that's still sexy."
00:44:33,00:44:34,I think we could all agree.
00:44:34,00:44:45,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the week and that is Andy."
00:44:45,00:44:49,"My fact is that the 18th century grammarian, Alexander the Corrector,"
00:44:49,00:44:54,carried a sponge wherever he went just in case he spotted any offensive graffiti.
00:44:54,00:44:57,He sounds great.
00:44:57,00:44:58,He's my hero.
00:45:00,00:45:02,He was a Scottish author.
00:45:02,00:45:06,"His name was Alexander Crudden, C-I-U-D-E-N."
00:45:06,00:45:08,"He was an author, proofreader and..."
00:45:08,00:45:12,"You could see why he sort of changed his mnemonic to the Corrector, can't you?"
00:45:12,00:45:14,"Yeah, he was a bookseller."
00:45:14,00:45:15,He was a stationer.
00:45:15,00:45:20,"He was eccentric, definitely."
00:45:20,00:45:24,"He was famous for having written a concordance to the Bible,"
00:45:24,00:45:26,which is an index of the Bible.
00:45:26,00:45:28,We'll get on to that later.
00:45:28,00:45:29,But also he carried...
00:45:29,00:45:30,Let's get on to it now.
00:45:30,00:45:31,"Yeah, come on, OK."
00:45:31,00:45:34,He wrote an index to the Bible.
00:45:34,00:45:36,He wrote a verbal index of the Bible.
00:45:36,00:45:38,"So he took every single word of the King James Bible,"
00:45:38,00:45:43,"apart from ""the"" and ""of"" and really sort of nuts and bolts ones."
00:45:43,00:45:47,"Every single other word, you know, ""shoe"" or ""ham"" or whatever, he made an index."
00:45:47,00:45:50,"""Ham"" is a good one because the son of Noah was called Ham."
00:45:50,00:45:53,"Son of Noah, I knew you were going to bring it up."
00:45:53,00:45:56,"I don't know if ""ham"" and ""ham"" would have different entries in the Corrector."
00:45:56,00:45:57,I suspect a word.
00:45:57,00:45:58,He knew what he was doing.
00:45:59,00:46:01,"Yeah, it's three times as long as the actual Bible."
00:46:01,00:46:05,And it just tells you which words appear where in the Bible.
00:46:05,00:46:07,That's like only the really hardcore fans read that one.
00:46:07,00:46:11,"It's like people who've read the Silmarillion over Lord of the Rings, isn't it?"
00:46:11,00:46:13,"Oh, you might have read the Bible, but..."
00:46:13,00:46:14,Have you read it in alphabetical order?
00:46:14,00:46:18,Such a weird thing to do.
00:46:18,00:46:20,"It took him 12 years, didn't it?"
00:46:20,00:46:21,Unsurprising.
00:46:21,00:46:25,"And it was like all of the word ""all"", for instance, he recorded."
00:46:25,00:46:29,So he included some pretty relevant words in there.
00:46:29,00:46:31,"But the thing is, the Bibles are ready index."
00:46:31,00:46:33,"It's like Proverbs, Mark, John, Luke."
00:46:33,00:46:35,Like it's already in sections.
00:46:35,00:46:37,"Yeah, it's in chapters, you're right."
00:46:37,00:46:41,"You know, you're making the classic mistake of confusing contents and index."
00:46:41,00:46:44,"And Alejandro, the Corrector, would be turning in his grave right now."
00:46:44,00:46:45,You'd be corrected.
00:46:45,00:46:46,Dan wouldn't have done that.
00:46:46,00:46:47,Dan wouldn't.
00:46:47,00:46:51,It's taken this long for us to feel his loss.
00:46:51,00:46:55,"Yeah, he was weird."
00:46:55,00:46:57,So he didn't like grammar mistakes either.
00:46:57,00:47:01,He didn't like grammar mistakes and he didn't like offensive graffiti.
00:47:01,00:47:05,And he had his own very idiosyncratic interpretation of what offensive was.
00:47:05,00:47:10,"So he didn't like the number 45, which at the time, lots of people were writing..."
00:47:10,00:47:11,"That was the main one, wasn't it?"
00:47:11,00:47:14,The number 45 was the main thing that he hated the most.
00:47:14,00:47:16,"He only liked LPs, didn't he?"
00:47:16,00:47:17,He didn't like...
00:47:17,00:47:19,Maybe he predicted...
00:47:19,00:47:21,Did he predict Donald Trump's presidency and hated that?
00:47:21,00:47:22,That's exactly it.
00:47:22,00:47:23,He hated that.
00:47:23,00:47:25,It's nothing to do with that.
00:47:25,00:47:29,"It's because of John Wilkes, the radical."
00:47:29,00:47:33,"John Wilkes was a radical author at the time and he had written a work attacking the monarchy,"
00:47:33,00:47:39,"which had been published in issue number 45 of a magazine called The North Britain, which"
00:47:39,00:47:42,"published, you know, exciting political content."
00:47:42,00:47:45,So 45 became a bit of a rallying cry for anti-monarchists at the time.
00:47:45,00:47:49,People would write 45 on walls and doors and floors and things like that.
00:47:49,00:47:53,"But if Alexander the Corrector spotted it with his sponge, he'd get rid of it immediately."
00:47:53,00:47:57,"What do you think he would do if, like, just your house number was number 45?"
00:47:57,00:48:00,I don't know.
00:48:00,00:48:02,And you've got 45 when you've really been.
00:48:02,00:48:03,Yeah.
00:48:03,00:48:07,"And just not even looking at it and he keeps coming round and, like, taking it off."
00:48:07,00:48:08,"Like, ""No!"""
00:48:08,00:48:09,That's a good point.
00:48:09,00:48:10,That's a good point.
00:48:10,00:48:16,"Also, the Jacobite raising was 1745, which was another reason why they used this name."
00:48:16,00:48:17,Yeah.
00:48:17,00:48:18,That's why he did it in that issue.
00:48:18,00:48:19,He waited.
00:48:19,00:48:23,"He printed 44 issues of this pointless magazine, so he'd get to 45 and make an"
00:48:23,00:48:25,obscure reference.
00:48:25,00:48:27,He was an Iliest.
00:48:27,00:48:29,Do you guys know what an Iliest is?
00:48:29,00:48:30,Oh.
00:48:30,00:48:31,No.
00:48:31,00:48:32,You want to guess?
00:48:32,00:48:34,"Oh, did he like the Iliad?"
00:48:34,00:48:35,I would guess that.
00:48:35,00:48:36,Yeah.
00:48:36,00:48:37,That's a good guess.
00:48:37,00:48:38,Did he like Ili Coffee?
00:48:38,00:48:39,"That's a coffee brand, yes."
00:48:39,00:48:40,Yeah.
00:48:40,00:48:42,That's actually closer because that's the correct spelling.
00:48:42,00:48:46,"So you're definitely getting warmer, but still quite cold, so I'm going to tell you."
00:48:46,00:48:49,An Iliest is someone who always refers to themselves in the third person.
00:48:49,00:48:53,"So it's like, ""Ile"", it from Lassen, I-Double-L-E."
00:48:53,00:48:54,Okay.
00:48:54,00:48:55,I hate him.
00:48:55,00:48:56,Yeah.
00:48:56,00:48:58,"I just, I just, you've said it all."
00:48:58,00:49:01,"He's a grammar police, which, you know, he'd be good on Twitter."
00:49:01,00:49:02,Yeah.
00:49:02,00:49:05,"He keeps getting my really bins nicked, and he speaks in third person."
00:49:05,00:49:06,I can't stand the man.
00:49:06,00:49:07,Yeah.
00:49:07,00:49:08,He's not likable.
00:49:08,00:49:09,"He wasn't popular at the time either, to be fair."
00:49:09,00:49:14,"You're matching the opinion of him then because he was, he was institutionalised"
00:49:14,00:49:18,"several times, and there's lots of debate over whether, you know, was he really ill,"
00:49:18,00:49:23,"or Henson being put in an institution, or was he being put there by his enemies?"
00:49:23,00:49:28,"And there's a biographer called Julia Kay, who argues that he was put away not because"
00:49:28,00:49:29,he was ill.
00:49:29,00:49:34,"And I mean, he sounds pretty eccentric, sounds pretty out there, but on one occasion, he"
00:49:34,00:49:39,"was put away by, I think the brother of a woman he was trying to propose to or trying"
00:49:39,00:49:43,"to marry, but he had discovered that the woman he was trying to propose to was sleeping with"
00:49:43,00:49:47,"her own brother, and he raised a big old stink about this, and then was putting an asylum"
00:49:47,00:49:48,for it.
00:49:48,00:49:49,Yeah.
00:49:49,00:49:53,"So that was the first time, but then later on, he was putting an asylum for unwelcome"
00:49:53,00:49:58,"attentions to a widow, and then another time for attacking a man with a shovel, and then"
00:49:58,00:50:06,"a third time for, he formed an emotional attachment to a woman without even having met her first."
00:50:06,00:50:11,"And he then called himself, instead of Alexander the Corrector, Alexander the Conqueror, and"
00:50:11,00:50:17,"decided that this woman was his predestined partner in life, and tried to get together"
00:50:17,00:50:19,"with her, even though she didn't know who he was."
00:50:19,00:50:20,Okay.
00:50:20,00:50:21,All right.
00:50:21,00:50:22,I mean...
00:50:22,00:50:24,"But that first time, it was just an eccentric thing."
00:50:24,00:50:28,"But there is, like in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, they think that they"
00:50:28,00:50:32,"say that that first time is what kind of threw him over the edge a little bit, and from then"
00:50:32,00:50:33,on...
00:50:33,00:50:34,Yeah.
00:50:34,00:50:40,"Well, he wanted to regulate private madhouses, and supposedly the fact he didn't manage to"
00:50:40,00:50:44,"improve private madhouse regulation made him very depressed, which then meant he was sent"
00:50:44,00:50:45,to bedlam again.
00:50:45,00:50:49,"Although, as James points out, hitting people with a shovel and forming unwelcome attachments"
00:50:49,00:50:50,to women will also do it.
00:50:50,00:50:52,That'll do the trick.
00:50:52,00:50:53,So he was complicated.
00:50:53,00:50:56,"He wasn't an unproblematic fave, is what I'm trying to say."
00:50:56,00:50:57,Fair.
00:50:57,00:50:58,Fair assessment.
00:50:58,00:51:02,"But I'm impressed that in those days, you were able to form attachments to people you"
00:51:02,00:51:05,"hadn't met romantically, pre-internet."
00:51:05,00:51:06,How are you doing that?
00:51:06,00:51:07,I see what you mean.
00:51:07,00:51:12,"It was the daughter of Sir Thomas Abney of Newington, who was the Lord Mayor of London."
00:51:12,00:51:17,"So basically, he'd heard of the Lord Mayor's daughter, possibly seen her in some periodicals,"
00:51:17,00:51:20,and decided that that was his future wife.
00:51:20,00:51:26,"He called her Princess Elizabetha and said that her home was a place called Silesia,"
00:51:26,00:51:27,which he would besiege.
00:51:27,00:51:32,"I have the same thing about Daniel Craig, you know."
00:51:32,00:51:34,So I think that's fine.
00:51:34,00:51:39,Are you planning to besiege Daniel Craig's house?
00:51:39,00:51:41,Because it's probably a public service we're doing.
00:51:41,00:51:42,"No, it's not."
00:51:42,00:51:43,It's our house.
00:51:43,00:51:44,We live together.
00:51:44,00:51:49,"It's been our happy spousal home for a few years now, actually."
00:51:49,00:51:55,"Opens the door, dressed as a massive black currant, trying to make Rhybeena for you."
00:51:55,00:51:58,"Yeah, so that's Alexander."
00:51:58,00:52:03,"So on, I should say he's an Ilias, sorry, just to go a long way back to him referring"
00:52:03,00:52:08,"to himself in the third person, because I wouldn't want you to think badly of him."
00:52:08,00:52:09,I don't know if he did it in speech.
00:52:09,00:52:14,"He just did it in the book he wrote, which I read Decent Portion of, which had the catchy"
00:52:14,00:52:19,"title, ""The Corrector's Earnest Address to the Inhabitants of Great Britain, showing"
00:52:19,00:52:23,that the late earthquakes and the fact we are at war with a powerful nation are allowed
00:52:23,00:52:29,"to call from divine providence for a speedy and thorough reformation,"" actually it actually"
00:52:29,00:52:30,goes on.
00:52:30,00:52:34,"But it was basically saying, ""Look, we've had some earthquakes, we're at war."
00:52:34,00:52:38,"This is clearly because you guys aren't abiding by my grammatical correction."""
00:52:38,00:52:42,"And that whole thing, he refers to a lot of stuff that's happened in his life, but he"
00:52:42,00:52:44,"always calls himself the ""corrector."""
00:52:44,00:52:48,"He would write pamphlets as well, called things like ""Mr Crudham Greatly Injured"""
00:52:48,00:52:53,"or ""The Adventures of Alexander the Corrector,"" which is practically a comic book, writing"
00:52:53,00:52:56,"a pamphlet about yourself and calling it ""The Adventures of."""
00:52:56,00:52:57,It is.
00:52:57,00:52:59,And then I think that was just about how his sister tried to have him sectioned or had
00:52:59,00:53:00,him sectioned.
00:53:00,00:53:03,So it's disappointing if you think you're getting an adventure book and you get an
00:53:03,00:53:05,annoying sibling rivalry.
00:53:05,00:53:07,"Yeah, imagine if the Avengers were like that."
00:53:07,00:53:13,"It was just Iron Man's brother stealing his trainers, like, ""Get your own shoes."""
00:53:13,00:53:19,"Captain America turns up with his sponge, yeah."
00:53:19,00:53:25,"So on graffiti, some stuff on that, I was going through my old files and stuff on graffiti"
00:53:25,00:53:31,and the ancient Roman graffiti seemed to so often be about discouraging public excretion.
00:53:31,00:53:37,"So Roman graffiti includes the phrase, ""Anybody urinating here will incur the wrath of Mars."""
00:53:37,00:53:43,"It's to the one defecating here, ""Beware the curse and shit with comfort and good cheer"
00:53:43,00:53:45,"so long as you don't do it here."""
00:53:45,00:53:46,Wow.
00:53:46,00:53:49,And so it seems like graffiti in those days was doing a public good.
00:53:49,00:53:51,"Yeah, it's like no ball games kind of thing, isn't it?"
00:53:51,00:53:55,It's just trying to stop people from doing bad things around your house.
00:53:55,00:53:56,Exactly.
00:53:56,00:53:57,No turning in this driveway.
00:53:57,00:54:01,That's my favorite one that people put up.
00:54:01,00:54:03,This gate's permanently in use.
00:54:03,00:54:04,Permanently in use.
00:54:04,00:54:06,"If it was permanently in use, I couldn't read the sign."
00:54:06,00:54:08,Get out of here.
00:54:08,00:54:14,I was in a really beautiful place in Cotswold recently going for a walk on my own in a wood
00:54:14,00:54:19,"and there was a massive tree and it was like, and it's Cotswold's, you know, it's like"
00:54:19,00:54:24,David Cameron territory and like Bluebellwood and someone had carved in giant capital letters
00:54:24,00:54:26,"into the tree, Millwall."
00:54:26,00:54:28,"I just thought, ""That is so great."
00:54:28,00:54:32,"I'm so glad Millwall fans are going that far afield to make their stuff."""
00:54:32,00:54:38,"And then it said, ""Get your parliamentary favours here, call Dave on 01."""
00:54:38,00:54:42,"Well, that would still be relevant when this goes out, probably."
00:54:42,00:54:43,Definitely.
00:54:43,00:54:44,It will keep it relevant.
00:54:44,00:54:45,We'll keep it in the news.
00:54:45,00:54:49,"I've seen some celebrity graffiti, which is very exciting."
00:54:49,00:54:51,I saw something that Lord Byron wrote.
00:54:51,00:54:52,Really?
00:54:52,00:54:57,There's a place in Greece called the Temple of Poseidon and he carved his name really
00:54:57,00:55:04,"big and florid into the column of this 4,000-year-old temple, which is pretty disrespectful."
00:55:04,00:55:09,But it's surrounded by other names because it was just the thing you did at the time.
00:55:09,00:55:10,Byron does it.
00:55:10,00:55:11,"It's kind of okay, isn't it?"
00:55:11,00:55:14,"I bet the council got really pissed off with all the other people who did it, but when"
00:55:14,00:55:15,Byron...
00:55:15,00:55:17,"Yeah, he's like the Banksy of the 19th century."
00:55:17,00:55:18,You're right.
00:55:18,00:55:19,You're right.
00:55:19,00:55:20,Yeah.
00:55:20,00:55:25,"That Banksy, he did a load of graffiti just in Waterloo, in that tunnel in Waterloo."
00:55:25,00:55:26,I don't know if you remember.
00:55:26,00:55:28,It's like one of the first things.
00:55:28,00:55:33,And then I went to see it when it happened and then we started filming QI and I saw
00:55:33,00:55:34,it right at the start.
00:55:34,00:55:37,"By the time we finished filming it, it had already been covered, I think, three or four"
00:55:37,00:55:39,times by other people putting graffiti on.
00:55:39,00:55:40,And that was kind of the point.
00:55:40,00:55:46,"He was like, ""This is now a graffiti place and just put whatever you want here."""
00:55:46,00:55:50,"But we've come up with a new way of using hydrogel, which is like this amazing kind"
00:55:50,00:55:51,of substance.
00:55:51,00:55:56,And you put it on the wall and it just sticks to the top covering of paint.
00:55:56,00:56:00,And it can take that off and you can see the graffiti that's underneath that graffiti.
00:56:00,00:56:01,No.
00:56:01,00:56:06,"So, in theory, you could keep going, taking layers and layers and layers off this, I think"
00:56:06,00:56:07,"it's called leaky passage or something, isn't it?"
00:56:07,00:56:08,Leaky tunnel or something.
00:56:08,00:56:09,I think you're right.
00:56:09,00:56:10,Yeah.
00:56:10,00:56:13,And you'll be able to get to the Banksy's again.
00:56:13,00:56:14,That would be awesome.
00:56:14,00:56:15,Cool.
00:56:15,00:56:19,I used to work for Camden Council and Banksy did some graffiti on the side of a shop.
00:56:19,00:56:23,And I used to work in a street team that used to do with waste and street cleaning.
00:56:23,00:56:25,"Obviously, our guys cleaned that off, right?"
00:56:25,00:56:27,And the shop owners tried to sue Camden.
00:56:27,00:56:31,"They were like, ""You got rid of a Banksy, we're going to cover it with glass and like"
00:56:31,00:56:32,"make loads of money."""
00:56:32,00:56:33,I don't know how that's so funny.
00:56:33,00:56:37,I find it really incredible that the point of graffiti is that it sort of lives out
00:56:37,00:56:38,in public.
00:56:38,00:56:40,"But now because it's because of capitalism, people are like, ""No, no, we're going to"
00:56:40,00:56:41,preserve that.
00:56:41,00:56:46,"We're going to get perspex on it and we're going to make it get rich off of it, which"
00:56:46,00:56:47,"is hilarious."""
00:56:47,00:56:50,"I can't believe you were, that's always reported on."
00:56:50,00:56:52,I can't believe you were one of those people who cleaned a Banksy off.
00:56:52,00:56:55,"It always creates this massive controversy, doesn't it?"
00:56:55,00:56:57,"And Banksy's just there in the sidelines, chuckling away."
00:56:57,00:57:01,"But whenever Banksy does anything, Athena goes along with her sponge, doesn't she?"
00:57:01,00:57:02,Yes.
00:57:02,00:57:07,"Well, not just Banksy, everybody."
00:57:07,00:57:13,"Can I correct some, just correct some grammar broadly before we finish?"
00:57:13,00:57:14,Which is...
00:57:14,00:57:15,Whose grammar are you going to correct?
00:57:15,00:57:18,This thing that I'm pointing to here.
00:57:18,00:57:19,Bicep.
00:57:19,00:57:20,What is it?
00:57:20,00:57:21,I'd say bicep.
00:57:21,00:57:22,"Yeah, bicep."
00:57:22,00:57:23,"That's really incorrect, guys."
00:57:23,00:57:24,"Oh, God."
00:57:24,00:57:25,This is not a bicep.
00:57:25,00:57:26,This is a biceps.
00:57:26,00:57:31,"And whenever you hear someone refer to a singular bicep, you can correct them and stick that"
00:57:31,00:57:32,S on the end.
00:57:32,00:57:37,"Biceps literally means two-headed, two-biceps-headed."
00:57:37,00:57:40,"There are always two heads, it's never just unicep."
00:57:40,00:57:41,Wow.
00:57:41,00:57:43,"And it's just because the muscle's got two, like, connecting bits."
00:57:43,00:57:45,"James, you've just been paninode."
00:57:45,00:57:47,I can't believe it.
00:57:47,00:57:48,I...
00:57:48,00:57:49,That was an amazing moment.
00:57:49,00:57:54,"Well, if Anna didn't have such impressive biceps, then maybe I wouldn't have done..."
00:57:54,00:57:57,"Yeah, I drew you off your game with that."
00:57:57,00:58:02,"You said bicep implying that you think they're so small, it only qualifies as one."
00:58:02,00:58:03,Good point.
00:58:03,00:58:04,Yeah.
00:58:04,00:58:05,There's only one on each side.
00:58:05,00:58:09,"So you have to say I pulled my left biceps, as opposed to..."
00:58:09,00:58:10,Exactly.
00:58:10,00:58:11,Hmm.
00:58:11,00:58:12,Even if you pulled your right one.
00:58:12,00:58:13,"No, that's not true."
00:58:13,00:58:15,I just pulled mine guns.
00:58:15,00:58:21,I've won all of that.
00:58:21,00:58:23,"OK, that's all of our facts."
00:58:23,00:58:26,"Thank you so much for listening, everybody."
00:58:26,00:58:27,We will be back again next week.
00:58:27,00:58:30,"If you're lucky, you might get another guest."
00:58:30,00:58:33,"If you're unlucky, you might get Dan Shriver back."
00:58:33,00:58:38,"But until then, you can find these guys on their Twitter accounts, James."
00:58:38,00:58:39,At James Harkin.
00:58:39,00:58:40,Andi.
