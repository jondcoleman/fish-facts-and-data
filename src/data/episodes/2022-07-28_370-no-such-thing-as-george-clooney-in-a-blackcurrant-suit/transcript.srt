00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,440
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Six Things as a fish.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,000
 Well, what can I tell you about this week's show?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,160
 Dan Schreiber is having a very well-earned little breather.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,080
 He'll be back next week, don't you worry.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,720
 And Dan is such a behemoth of a podcaster that in his place we have not just one, but two people.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,080
 Now, the first person that we'll be replacing Dan is Athena Cablenu.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,880
 Now, she is an amazing comedian, a really good friend of ours.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,400
 You might remember her from our 20-hour comic relief special.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,120
 She was part of the Guilty Feminist team in that.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,040
 And actually, when we were on the Guilty Feminist, she was part of that show.

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,440
 She also has a BBC Radio 4 show called Athena's Cancel Culture,

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,800
 which is out right now on Radio 4.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,440
 You can find that on the internet as well.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,680
 And she has a podcast called Keeping Athena Company, which is absolutely fantastic.

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,720
 I can't recommend that highly enough.

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,840
 It's such a brilliant podcast.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,480
 Oh, I did say there was a second person.

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,160
 The second person is Athena's son, who you might hear in the background from time to time,

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,520
 really kind of coming in at the exact moments that you would want him to.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,680
 So it's almost like we've soundscaped this episode,

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,080
 but I promise you it isn't soundscaped.

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,680
 It was a tiny little human who was in the background of the show.

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,840
 I really hope you enjoyed it.

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,040
 We had such fun making it.

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,120
 We love Athena.

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,520
 And I suppose all that's left to say is on with the podcast.

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:47,840
 Hello and welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,920
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four secret locations somewhere on Earth.

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,360
 And specifically in London.

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,840
 My name is Anna Tyszynski, and I am here today with James Harkin and Johanna Murray

31
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,560
 and our very special, exciting guest, Athena Koblenu.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,080
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones

33
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,760
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

34
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,000
 And in no particular order, here we go.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,640
 And starting with you, Athena, what's your facts?

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,000
 So this is my fact.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,440
 The 100 folds of a chef's hat represent the 100 ways

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,760
 in which you can cook an egg, right?

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,800
 Does that mean, Athena, if you can only cook an egg like one way,

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,040
 for instance, then you can only have one fold or get a beret.

41
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,640
 Yeah. Chef Beret.

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,160
 I was going to say you get a little cone, but that's not a good kind of hat to wear.

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,240
 Big white cone on your head.

44
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,000
 That's not a good hat at all.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I mean, I always thought I was an amazing cook.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,800
 I'm like, you know, you see my Instagram, there's lots of food on there.

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,680
 But when I read that fact, I was like, I can't cook at all.

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
 I know three ways. That's it.

49
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,520
 Come on, mate. Even I know more than three ways to cook an egg.

50
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,840
 What's your three?

51
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,320
 Scrambled, omelette, fry.

52
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,960
 Oh, boil. I know four ways.

53
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,240
 Oh, I'm still short.

54
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,320
 Not tried puching any time.

55
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,840
 Oh, God. Yes. OK.

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
 Fine. Five.

57
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,040
 It's still, we're a long way off.

58
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,440
 We're five percent of the way there.

59
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,760
 And the rest of this section is just going to be us brainstorming

60
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,080
 other possible ways.

61
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,920
 Now, I will say, have you guys ever coddled an egg?

62
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,760
 No.

63
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,360
 Coddling an egg is lovely.

64
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,360
 It sounds like sort of taking it to bed with you, like a teddy.

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,520
 I think you sort of, you put it in, is it like you give it a bath?

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,600
 You put it in a little glass

67
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,280
 ramekin and then you give it a bath and that slowly cooks within that.

68
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,400
 And you mix it with spices and they that's very nice.

69
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,840
 Anyway, six. That's like a bain-marie.

70
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
 Yeah, seven.

71
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,760
 I think you can bake an egg.

72
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,440
 I once saw someone bake an egg.

73
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,080
 They put the egg in an oven and I thought.

74
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,920
 I've baked an egg before.

75
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,880
 Have you, in an oven?

76
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,120
 Yeah, like, like hollowed out a pepper

77
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,160
 and then broken egg in it and just baked it.

78
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,160
 Oh, but I've seen that someone put the shell.

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,760
 You can do this.

80
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,560
 You can just put the whole egg in the oven and bake it, which just

81
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,800
 which just for me feels like, like you don't really want the egg.

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,600
 So you're trying to wait as long as possible before you have to eat it.

83
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,960
 Well, do you know something that takes even longer than your boiled oven egg?

84
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,280
 You can do it in the dishwasher as well.

85
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,480
 Very nice.

86
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,640
 Oh, yeah.

87
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,720
 Wrap it up or, in fact, leave it in the shell and then just set the dishwasher running.

88
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,880
 And another longer way of doing it is the 100 year egg.

89
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,480
 Very long cycle in the dish.

90
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,440
 Sometimes it's called the thousand year egg.

91
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,960
 And sometimes it's just called a really disgusting egg because I've had this egg.

92
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,520
 I had it in Singapore and it's kind of what they do is they put it in clay

93
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,160
 and salt and they leave it for a few weeks and it kind of turns

94
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,520
 dark black and really, really sulfurous.

95
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,320
 And sometimes they call it horse urine egg because it tastes a bit like horse urine,

96
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,200
 apparently. Yeah, this is one way of eating eggs.

97
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,000
 There is.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,760
 Yeah, they've got a recipe for that in my Chinese cookbook.

99
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,400
 I think it looks unappetizing.

100
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,520
 It's disgusting.

101
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,240
 It's really it looks like.

102
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,640
 I think they came out of this because somebody dropped an egg somewhere

103
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,680
 and they found it five weeks later and they're like, wait, it's not what not.

104
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,640
 And they said, well, we'll make it a recipe.

105
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
 And then no one puts me in prison for being disgusting.

106
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,000
 And that's how that works.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,240
 Finally, we hadn't dropped it in this puddle of horse piss.

108
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,920
 If life gives you horse piss.

109
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,240
 Well, that is the story.

110
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,720
 It was like a Chinese guy who had like dropped some eggs,

111
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,280
 stuck eggs in a muddy puddle of water and they had a load of calcium in the water.

112
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,760
 And then he pulled them out and he thought, well, I might as well try them.

113
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,680
 You know, I might as well try them.

114
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,920
 And he's like, these are delicious.

115
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,960
 I need to come up with a way of making them.

116
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,040
 That is my approach to eating pretty much every encrusted

117
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,960
 ancient bit of food on the back of the fridge.

118
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,080
 I might as well just have most of it and see if I die.

119
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,760
 Do you know, this is great because when you've got a toddler,

120
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,080
 you find food everywhere, you know.

121
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,920
 So now I'm just going to give it a banana that's at the back of the couch

122
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,200
 because it's just cuisine, isn't it?

123
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,760
 It's just a new recipe.

124
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,800
 Exactly. It's a delicacy.

125
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,440
 I have a slightly exciting advance on the hundred bleeds in the chef's hat,

126
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,360
 which is this is from a book called The Culinary Guide from 1903.

127
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,920
 And it's by Georges Escoffier, who was a very famous.

128
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,320
 He was an early celebrity chef, not the earliest, but he turned the century.

129
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,240
 Anyway, his book lists two hundred and two ways to prepare eggs, excluding omelettes.

130
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,000
 And omelettes is another eighty two.

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,960
 And he also says that if you use the basic recipe for omelette norvegienne,

132
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,560
 it is it is possible to produce an almost infinite number of variations

133
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,640
 of this type of omelette.

134
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,960
 Then he says in brackets, omelette surprise.

135
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,840
 So well, yeah, sounds gross.

136
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,280
 Do you know where the word comes from? Oh, gosh, I'd assume from the word for egg.

137
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,320
 Does it come from the does it come from the sound of meditation?

138
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,880
 Yes. And that's shut up.

139
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,160
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It isn't. It isn't.

140
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,280
 It both isn't that.

141
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,640
 And I think I've just lost hearing in one of my ears.

142
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:03,080
 It comes from the same word as you get amulet omelette amulet.

143
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,600
 And also where you get laminate.

144
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,160
 So it means something that's something that's flat, basically.

145
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,440
 An old French word for something that's flat.

146
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,720
 And that's where we get it from.

147
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,360
 You know, apparently we've been boiling eggs wrong.

148
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,000
 According to according to we we've been boiling eggs.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240
 Oh, this whole time we've been boiling them wrong.

150
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,640
 I love these headlines.

151
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,960
 I once tried to search for all the things, all that you've been

152
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,680
 something wrong your whole life and I love it.

153
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,440
 Yeah, I want to say it's always like you've been tying your shoes wrong

154
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,280
 the whole life and then you look at it and some guy on the Internet

155
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,320
 has come up with a ridiculously stupid way of tying his shoes.

156
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,040
 Although you shouldn't say that because we actually did a fact

157
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,640
 about three years ago about how we have actually been tying your shoes

158
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,560
 wrong your whole life.

159
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,600
 Oh, was that us then?

160
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,320
 That was us on the internet.

161
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,480
 Yeah, we've been boiling eggs wrong and doing everything else wrong.

162
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,920
 But I tried to do it the right way.

163
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,680
 So this is according to MFK Fisher, who I think was this like amazing

164
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,480
 food writer in the 20th century, and she was very, very influential.

165
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,560
 And she said the key to boiling eggs is you shouldn't boil them.

166
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,360
 And because that cooks it unevenly.

167
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,760
 So if you boil it really hard, you drop it straight into boiling water.

168
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,480
 It cooks the white really fast.

169
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,000
 And by the time the yolk inside is cooked and the white is massively

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,480
 overcooked and it's all rubbery.

171
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,760
 So I tried her way, which is you put it in cold water and then you let

172
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,120
 the cold water boil and as soon as it hits the boil, you take it off.

173
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,880
 Oh, yeah, was it good?

174
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,840
 Well, it was the most frustrating 45 minutes of my life.

175
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,280
 You should have put it in your oven.

176
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:39,160
 It was, it was 45 minutes because it basically super glues the shell to the white.

177
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,600
 So, you know, normally if you appeal a hard boiled egg, then obviously

178
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,080
 the shell comes off and this it doesn't shock the white away from the shell

179
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,600
 when you drop it in boiling water.

180
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,000
 And so it took, I mean, I'm not kidding.

181
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
 It took 45 minutes to peel the shell off.

182
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,920
 I lost most of the white along the way, don't do it.

183
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,280
 MFK Fisher was pretty amazing, wasn't she?

184
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,360
 She was the one who W. H. Odin said was the greatest writer of any style

185
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,600
 in the whole of America.

186
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,640
 She was a food writer and she was the one who also said the perfect way

187
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,000
 to make a sandwich was to sit on it.

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,480
 So you make your sandwich and then you have to sit on it for half an hour

189
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,680
 just to kind of warm it up and squash it and then it's going to be a perfect sandwich.

190
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,400
 You're going to get a lot of customers returning their sandwiches to the kitchen.

191
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,520
 That's why I was fired from my job at prep.

192
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,160
 Just on on eggs and sort of how they're laid,

193
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,200
 you know when you've got an egg and you've boiled it and you peel it.

194
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,320
 And you know, there's that gap between the white and the shell.

195
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,000
 There's like a little air pocket.

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Yeah. Do you know what that is?

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,200
 It's I don't know what it is, but I know it makes it really easy to peel them.

198
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,600
 That's my. Yeah, it's really handy.

199
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,400
 If you find that and you crack the egg there, you can peel your eggs really easily.

200
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,240
 Top tip. That's what it's for.

201
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,760
 That's that's evolution for you.

202
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,000
 It's evolved to help us peel up all day.

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,720
 No, it's a it's a little air hole for the chick.

204
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,760
 So in case the egg is fertilised, the chick will be inside and then it needs

205
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,000
 to practice breathing to inflate its lungs before it cracks out.

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,160
 So the way it does that about a day before it cracks out of the shell,

207
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,200
 it pecks its beak into that little air hole and uses it like a snorkeler mask

208
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,800
 and just practices breathing every day.

209
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,360
 I take a step closer to veganism and I know.

210
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,640
 I mean, how adorable is that?

211
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,880
 And we're here making omelettes out of it.

212
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,520
 Yeah, it makes beautiful.

213
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,880
 So I'm probably going to upset you now because I've eaten ballot,

214
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,760
 which is a Vietnamese thing where the the egg has a semi fertilised chick

215
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,600
 inside the egg when they cook it.

216
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,520
 I must admit, when I tried it, I couldn't.

217
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,560
 I could only eat the bit of egg around the.

218
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,320
 I'll just I'll just eat around.

219
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:59,360
 It's like it's a real delicacy in Vietnam

220
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,120
 and sometimes used as a way of getting over your hangover as well.

221
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,560
 I mean, you can't criticise it, can you?

222
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,640
 If you eat eggs, then there's no it's not really that much different.

223
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,880
 But how do you time that?

224
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,760
 Do you get like an ultrasonic scanner?

225
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,320
 You give it like an egg ultrasound.

226
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,920
 Then you go, right, it's three weeks.

227
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,680
 It's good to go.

228
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
 Oh, no.

229
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
 Oh, I don't know if I can.

230
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,560
 There's something about the idea of it, so obviously, you know.

231
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,720
 Well, if we're anthropomorphising eggs and we are now all eggs in America

232
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,440
 have had a little shampoo before they go into the shops.

233
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,240
 Yeah, it's so weird.

234
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,080
 So they love in America, they love to wash their eggs.

235
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,760
 But that creates a problem because they have this natural bloom on them.

236
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,880
 They have this sort of bacterial layer, which we can't see.

237
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,840
 But it's a rather it keeps bacteria out.

238
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,480
 It's a way of kind of protecting it.

239
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,880
 So, you know, if the egg gets a bit of poo on it or whatever,

240
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,080
 as it's being laid, it's fine.

241
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
 It doesn't matter.

242
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,720
 And so in America, they love to give them a little shampoo.

243
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,520
 But then the problem is you shampoo them

244
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,640
 and then there are the high odds of bacterial invasion.

245
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,480
 So then they have to refrigerate them and spray them with oil as a nightmare.

246
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,800
 So we don't do that in Europe.

247
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,760
 It is illegal to wash an egg before you sell it to people.

248
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,680
 Wow. Yeah.

249
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,680
 I always think if you kind of get an egg and there's a little feather on there,

250
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,160
 I always think that's a very probably a fresh egg from a chicken

251
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,720
 who had a very good life or something.

252
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,160
 But I reckon there's probably a person in a factory just putting feathers in the egg.

253
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,800
 And the poo, yeah, but it's a bone.

254
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,600
 Because if you get a bit of chicken poo, you think, oh,

255
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
 that's literally just come out of its arse.

256
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,080
 I wasn't even had time to lose the poo, but you're right.

257
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,800
 I bet someone's just taping it on because they do that with yolks.

258
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,000
 What colour yolks do you guys want?

259
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,400
 Like orangey, do you crack your egg into the pan?

260
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,000
 Yeah. I want a bright yellow yolk.

261
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,480
 Like literally like the sun, but like really deep rich yellow.

262
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,120
 Yeah. Rich. I go with that.

263
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,960
 I want one that's more like Donald Trump's skin colour,

264
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,200
 like really deep, dark orange.

265
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,560
 You want to go orange?

266
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,520
 Well, people do seem to prefer orange.

267
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,920
 And it's because they think the chicken's like healthier.

268
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,520
 So, yeah, if it's like really rich yellow or deep orange,

269
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,360
 they're like that shows that it's had a better diet.

270
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,720
 And so producers have realised that people prefer that.

271
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,960
 And so they just feed them died food.

272
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,160
 So whenever you get an egg and it has a rich orange yolk,

273
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,880
 it does not taste better and it is not more nutritious.

274
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,680
 It is probably in like 99% of cases.

275
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,040
 It's that the farmer has basically put

276
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,640
 usually an additive or some dye in their food.

277
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,280
 Sometimes if you're going organic, apparently they'll feed them

278
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,800
 marigold petals or red petals to help the carotenoids, you know,

279
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,400
 the stuff that dyes carrots and stuff orange to help them get into the egg.

280
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,080
 I think that is a good sign, though.

281
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,520
 If my farmer is willing to pick marigold petals

282
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,200
 in order to feed them to the chicken, it's going right.

283
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,840
 Throwing the petals around so that the chickens have a really romantic evening.

284
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,400
 You're right. Valentine's Day in the in the heart is a huge deal.

285
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,840
 Very quickly on the hat itself, the 100 cleats hat.

286
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,240
 Yeah. And so invented by Marie Antoine Karem,

287
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,120
 who was probably the predecessor to a scoffier who Andy mentioned earlier on,

288
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,520
 probably maybe the first celebrity chef, I would say.

289
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,800
 I'm not sure. I can't think of anyone earlier.

290
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,120
 But he had these big hats because he wanted to have authority.

291
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,120
 And he thought the bigger and more erect your hat is the more people take you seriously.

292
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,280
 And so the better a chef you were, the taller it was supposed to be.

293
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,400
 And his was 18 inches in height.

294
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,320
 Yeah. I mean, this is the man's like invention, clearly.

295
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,760
 This is like, how can I make people respect me 18 inches? That's respect.

296
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,200
 Yeah, I kind of think it was a bit of that.

297
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,800
 Alexis Sawyer, who was around the same time, he was the chef of the reform club.

298
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,120
 He wore a big black velvet beret with a huge tassel.

299
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,920
 And the whole point of that was he was too important to cook with it.

300
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
 He was like the head chef.

301
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,400
 Everyone else, the sous chef and stuff, did all the work.

302
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,520
 He was the big head chef.

303
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,520
 And if he wore a hat that was too impractical to do any work,

304
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,560
 it showed that he was really important.

305
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,840
 That's brilliant. That's so clever.

306
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,600
 So, yeah, it's just too difficult for him to cook.

307
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,960
 Therefore, he's the boss.

308
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,880
 Pretty much. You should try it in the office, Andy.

309
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,880
 Come into the office wearing sort of mittens and a balaclava.

310
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,640
 And sunglasses, so I can't see any words in front of me.

311
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,480
 And gaffer tape your mouth.

312
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,960
 This is sounding better and better.

313
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:33,960
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

314
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,760
 And that is James Harkin.

315
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,560
 OK, my fact this week is that when men are played the sound of a baby crying,

316
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,800
 if they're told it's a boy, they'll think it's in more pain

317
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,200
 than if they're told it's a girl.

318
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
 Wow.

319
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,360
 So what men think male babies are macho, is that?

320
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,880
 Yes, you've kind of got there, Andy, almost.

321
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,880
 So this is a new study by researchers at the University of Sussex,

322
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,200
 the University of Leon Santetien and Hunter College City University in New York.

323
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,560
 And what they did was they played a load of cries to men and women,

324
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,640
 their parents, actually, and they asked them whether they thought

325
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,520
 the child was in pain or happy or sad or how much pain it was in, etc., etc.

326
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,120
 And the thing is that before puberty, the voices of boys and girls,

327
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,880
 and especially babies, the cries of boys and girls are the same.

328
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,600
 There's no difference in pitch.

329
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,200
 But people, especially men, think that the male baby will have a deeper cry.

330
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,400
 And so when they hear the cry, if it's high pitch, they think it's in more pain.

331
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,880
 And because they expect the male baby to have a deeper cry,

332
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,000
 normally they think that the difference means that it's in more pain.

333
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,520
 I think that's really funny that it's like, what's wrong with this child?

334
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,200
 And they expect to like bury white to come out of its mouth.

335
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,000
 And it's a high pitch, high pitch squeal.

336
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,480
 It's like, oh, my gosh, no, it's a baby.

337
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,800
 There's nothing wrong with your child.

338
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,560
 That's where it's the beard. Where's his beard?

339
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,440
 And yeah, it is quite funny.

340
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,040
 The thing that the researchers say is it could have implications

341
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,840
 for the welfare of children, because it means that if a female child is crying,

342
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,240
 you might give it less attention than if a male child is crying.

343
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,640
 Oh, this is why we have man flu then, clearly,

344
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,560
 because boys are so used to being given attention they don't need.

345
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,840
 Or, you know, then they grow out to be like, oh, got a little cough.

346
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,360
 Oh, it's the flu. It's the flu.

347
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,840
 Whereas girls are like, yeah, girls are going to work with like headless

348
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,000
 because that's fine. It's just a scratch.

349
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,400
 Oh, my God, I think you might be hit on something there.

350
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,600
 That feels right, doesn't it?

351
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,200
 Yeah, I thought it was that male parents say, you know,

352
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,040
 they'll they'll listen to the crying and they'll think,

353
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,440
 well, my baby boy wouldn't be making a fuss unless it was something really serious.

354
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,240
 It wouldn't be disturbing me.

355
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,480
 Well, that might be true as well,

356
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,640
 but this study was specifically about the pitch of the cells.

357
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,880
 Well, so we just have to start complaining in a deeper voice

358
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,960
 in order to have people take notice of us.

359
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,440
 No, you have to complain in a much, much, much higher voice

360
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,360
 to make up for the fact that you have a higher voice already.

361
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,280
 Oh, sorry. Yeah, we have all we have to speak in deeper voices all the time.

362
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,400
 And then the contrast to our high complain.

363
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,120
 Don't go too high because then it will just be dogs that care.

364
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,360
 Dogs are pretty comforting. I think that might work for me.

365
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,960
 It's with the response to babies crying, right, that you get.

366
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,480
 Well, I'm always told that once you become a mother, I guess, specifically,

367
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,400
 you have a very instinctive response to babies crying.

368
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,840
 So I hear babies crying and I think that's a really horrible noise.

369
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,360
 And I think, actually, there was a study on the noises people find most grating

370
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,560
 and babies crying was the worst.

371
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,080
 But like, is there a difference?

372
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,840
 Do you find there was a difference once you had children, Athena,

373
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,080
 where like you hear a baby crying and like a bit of you dies?

374
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,880
 Yes. Or does it sound lovely?

375
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,520
 Does it suddenly sound wonderful?

376
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,440
 There's only one difference.

377
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,640
 And that is when you hear the baby cry, you lactate.

378
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,400
 That's the only difference really.

379
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,280
 It never gets more or less annoying.

380
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,720
 It just you just start leaking.

381
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,480
 But yeah, there's definitely I think it's I mean, I would speculate

382
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,400
 it's evolution, isn't it?

383
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,000
 Because when it's what's really funny is babies have unique cries.

384
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,880
 They all do. But sometimes you go out in public and there'll be a baby

385
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,880
 that sounds like your baby and that baby will make you lactate

386
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,480
 because it will just have a similar pitch or a sound.

387
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,040
 Right. And I'll be like, oh, that sounds like that sounds like one of my kids.

388
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,200
 And then it's, oh, dearie me, here we go again.

389
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,840
 I forgot my pads.

390
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,800
 Sorry, I can only apologise to any listeners who can hear the baby

391
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,360
 in the background and have spontaneously started lactating.

392
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,880
 Lactation is so weird, though.

393
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,840
 So there's tons of stuff I didn't know.

394
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,680
 Like people can lactate when they're not mothers.

395
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,360
 And this is really, really important in loads of societies.

396
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,280
 And it seems to be quite under-researched.

397
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,120
 So they're like hunter-gatherer societies where there's a lot more

398
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,520
 aloe parenting, where it's parenting in groups.

399
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,760
 So there's not even really one specific caregiver.

400
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,360
 Your baby will be cared for by maybe 12 different people.

401
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,960
 And grandmothers will be able to lactate.

402
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,960
 So they'll, and it's just by like having the nipples stimulated very often.

403
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,440
 Women who have had a baby before at some point,

404
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,000
 they'll just lactate again so they can nurse their infants

405
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,640
 or your friend who's had a baby wants to nurse the infant.

406
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,760
 Interesting. And the idea is that if you live in like a society,

407
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,720
 then it's useful for more than one person to be able to do that.

408
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
 Right. Is that the idea?

409
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,440
 Yeah, I think it's a little bit of survival, wasn't as guaranteed.

410
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,400
 So if your mum dies, then you can just latch on to someone else.

411
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,680
 But also, I guess it's just a different way cultures develop.

412
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,640
 Like the Aka people who are in Central Africa,

413
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,760
 I don't think we've talked about them before.

414
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,560
 They're the ones who have fathers who spend as much time with the babies

415
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,600
 as the mothers, and they're totally interchangeable, their roles.

416
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,280
 And they're always holding their kids.

417
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,720
 So they're in contact with kids up to the age of one and a half

418
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,280
 for like 97 percent of the time they're either touching or holding.

419
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,040
 And the fathers, when they're doing it, which will be about 50 percent of the time,

420
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,360
 they will let the babies suckle on their nipples.

421
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,880
 So when the baby needs comforting, it just suckles on its father's teats.

422
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,000
 At least there's a use for male nipples because they have no other function.

423
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,480
 So exactly. That makes that makes a lot of sense.

424
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,680
 There's a great fact about breastfeeding, which I found out first with the first baby.

425
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,520
 If you do it continuously, it's a form of natural contraception.

426
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,560
 You know that I didn't know that because you can't the idea.

427
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,080
 You don't want to conceive children one after the other really quickly.

428
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,960
 That's quite bad if you're like a woman and you've gone through pregnancy.

429
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,520
 You want to kind of wait, give it, give yourself a bit of time.

430
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,760
 You know what I mean? And the lactation helps you do that, which I didn't know.

431
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,080
 That's really interesting.

432
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,520
 It's smart. I feel like it's not guaranteed.

433
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,160
 No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't bank on it.

434
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,160
 I'd give yourself a safety net if I was used to anyone listening.

435
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,520
 Like get yourself an insurance policy.

436
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,600
 However, when I had my first, I didn't have a period for like a year.

437
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,720
 Like, yeah, it was brilliant.

438
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,520
 I was like, I'm going to breastfeed forever.

439
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,360
 You know, it's kind of in the child's interest then to carry on breastfeeding

440
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,320
 because then there aren't any more children to kind of like use up the.

441
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,920
 Oh, yeah, resources. Yeah. Yeah.

442
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,720
 You don't want any bastard siblings.

443
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,440
 That's why they want to keep latched on.

444
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,000
 So, Athena, you were saying that you can really tell the difference

445
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,680
 between the cries of your baby and someone else's baby.

446
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,520
 This is interesting because lots of animals and even lots of mammals

447
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,600
 can't tell the difference between their young and other animals.

448
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,680
 So this was an experiment by someone called Susan Lingle

449
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,760
 where she played a deer through a speaker,

450
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,520
 the noise of other mammals' babies crying and, you know, making a noise.

451
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,680
 And the deer cannot tell the difference.

452
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,920
 So they will react very strongly to a baby deer, but also to a baby bat,

453
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,440
 a baby marmot, a baby eland.

454
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,560
 It will just run. It's like, oh, no, there's a young mammal in trouble.

455
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,840
 And this might be because, I mean, the reason is because mammals

456
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,840
 have the same larynx or really similar larynxes until puberty.

457
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,280
 And then the difference between all the species kicks in.

458
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,880
 But before puberty, basically, it's like spread betting.

459
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,240
 You know, you parents need to respond to a cry

460
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,560
 which might be their child just in case it's their child in danger.

461
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,200
 And so if it turns out to be a baby marmot, then, you know, well, such is life.

462
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,040
 And it's useful for the child because then you might get some if you're in trouble.

463
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,640
 You might, you know, you might be a dear Bambi sort of getting in trouble

464
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,800
 because there's some people coming trying to shoot you.

465
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,520
 And then a friendly bat might come along to save you.

466
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,640
 Well, you'd hope for a bear.

467
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,920
 You'd be like, oh, man, I hope the bear would come.

468
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,080
 That would be really useful.

469
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,280
 But this does imply that if, you know, you're walking past a certain fox cub

470
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,200
 or something, Athena, then you might start lactating.

471
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,160
 I would have thought that certain mammals could induce lactation

472
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,080
 in the same way that certain babies could, right?

473
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,520
 I hadn't considered that.

474
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,400
 The neighbours have just got a new puppy.

475
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,080
 You're in trouble.

476
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,720
 So stock up on pads.

477
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,080
 I'll have to go outside and I'll just say, get your dog out here for a second.

478
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,440
 Let's do an experiment.

479
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,160
 Let's see how that works.

480
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,440
 Babble is a weird thing.

481
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,000
 Baby's babble, right?

482
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,960
 And that it kind of starts to imitate language, I guess.

483
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,080
 And I think people can tell if babies are babbling in their own language.

484
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,480
 So if I heard a five month old making nonsense noises,

485
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,560
 I should be able to tell whether it's an English speaker or a non-English speaker.

486
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,960
 Because, again, they imitate the quality of the tone,

487
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,200
 the timbre of the voice in which they're speaking.

488
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,520
 But it's really interesting because babies of deaf parents who speak sign language

489
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,200
 babble in sign language.

490
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,960
 So whereas that you'll have like a five month old baby

491
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,200
 who doesn't know any sign language, has never seen sign language.

492
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,400
 They'll just randomly clench their fists and like, play their hands out.

493
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,360
 Sign language babies will kind of babble.

494
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,360
 So they'll make signs a little bit like words,

495
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,640
 but that don't specifically mean anything yet.

496
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,800
 But with like quite deliberate, like they're practicing trying to learn it.

497
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,520
 But baby sign is a thing that you can teach your babies how to sign.

498
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,000
 Right.

499
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,920
 Like from about six months onwards, you can get them to tell you when they're hungry.

500
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,680
 You can get them to tell you when they need to go toilet.

501
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,440
 It takes like time and effort, but this is a true story.

502
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,640
 And I keep, I didn't do it with my first song, it's going to be bothered.

503
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,680
 But this one now, I was like, right,

504
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,960
 we're having such a hard time putting train in the first one.

505
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,640
 I'm like, right, we're learning sign.

506
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,400
 I'm doing it.

507
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,920
 I'm investing 20 minutes a day in just, just tell me when you need to toilet.

508
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,360
 That's all that's the only thing I want.

509
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,040
 That's the only thing you need to say, isn't it?

510
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,000
 Everything else is fine, but it's distinctive as well.

511
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,200
 So they're babies.

512
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,200
 A lot of the time it's, you just have to learn what they're doing instinctively.

513
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,520
 So apparently they, if a baby brings their fingers to their mouth, really easy one.

514
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,760
 I'm hungry.

515
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,960
 And there's another one which means I need a poo, which I've forgotten.

516
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,720
 But it can be done.

517
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,200
 I've been told I've been told I'm going to interview you in six months time.

518
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,080
 You'll be interviewing the baby.

519
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,840
 How about that?

520
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,720
 That is, I think you mentioned an email, Athena, and I've read this thing as well

521
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,800
 about potty training babies.

522
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,440
 And I actually forgot to go back to it, but there are definitely people who don't

523
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,200
 believe in nappies at all.

524
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,240
 And there's a way of potty training babies where you just kind of let them poo

525
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,120
 whenever they want to.

526
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,840
 And you learn when it looks like they're going to poo.

527
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,560
 And then you run them to the loo and you never have to use a nappy, which sounds great.

528
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,440
 And there's a bunch of New York mothers who kind of do that.

529
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,880
 And they say for the first month or two, you do get some poo on your carpet.

530
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,040
 Sounds like a lot of jeopardy.

531
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,360
 Yes.

532
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,920
 But then you sort of train the babies to give you a sign when they're going to go

533
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,160
 to the loo, like you say, there'll be a sort of sign they use, whether they point

534
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,360
 at their bum, I don't know, do a little fart.

535
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,880
 And then it's like you've got to run them to a toilet.

536
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,240
 You have, yeah, laminate floors.

537
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,840
 That's what I'd say for that one.

538
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,040
 That's the real key.

539
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,160
 If you haven't got laminate, I'd probably just get some pampers.

540
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,920
 But nappies are really wasteful.

541
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,920
 Like, I think a baby goes through, you know, in, well, first of all, in the 80s,

542
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,400
 babies used to put your train around 18 months.

543
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,720
 Because at that point, because people used to use terry towels and things like that.

544
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,120
 And terry towels get wet.

545
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,280
 So babies are like, oh, this is horrible.

546
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,360
 And they're like, you know what, let me get me on a toilet.

547
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,240
 This is disgusting.

548
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,560
 And they're also harder to crawl in.

549
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,240
 So they're not as mobile, so uncomfortable.

550
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,120
 But now we use kind of these nappies that are really comfortable.

551
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,320
 So I understand they're comfortable.

552
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,440
 They're really dry.

553
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,320
 They make, they allow babies to be mobile.

554
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,440
 The average age for training now is about between two and three.

555
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,000
 So you're saying they've been indulged?

556
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,040
 Well, yeah, absolutely.

557
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,000
 Well, indulge, obviously, to make more money for companies that make nappies.

558
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,080
 But that's incredible, right?

559
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,080
 Like babies that used to train at 18 months now train at three years.

560
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,840
 That's the supervillain plotline.

561
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,800
 Do you want a company that's investing in making nappies so good

562
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,120
 that people never take them off?

563
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,480
 I know, that's what I was thinking.

564
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,280
 There's new smart nappies that have just been invented by pampers.

565
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,400
 They're called Lumi.

566
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,000
 And I reckon once these are in, you're literally until you're in your early 20s,

567
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,120
 you're going to be wearing those.

568
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,040
 Is this where they text you, James?

569
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,720
 Well, they tell you, yeah.

570
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,400
 They tell you they text the parents saying, I have checked myself.

571
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,480
 If I'm so far from my baby that I need to be texted,

572
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,560
 that means someone, someone else's job.

573
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,800
 I've paid the sitter to deal with that.

574
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,040
 What is it to me for?

575
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,400
 You should just text the nearest phone, shouldn't it, to the baby?

576
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,920
 Yeah.

577
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,520
 But then everyone, of course, because it's a smart thing,

578
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,720
 everyone's worried about hackers and that someone might hack possible.

579
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,200
 What possible data can the hackers get that's going to help them on this?

580
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,200
 Unless they're working for Big Pampa and maybe.

581
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,000
 Well, all it can really do is tell you how often this individual child

582
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,520
 shits themselves or pisses themselves.

583
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,760
 But the idea could be that it might be attached to your phone

584
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,800
 and then using your phone, they might be able to get your bank details, maybe.

585
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,360
 I feel it feels like a stretch.

586
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,040
 It feels like if I was a hacker,

587
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,280
 this wouldn't be the first thing I would hack in order to get to the purse strings.

588
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,200
 You know, yeah.

589
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,640
 Getting bank details to a baby's bottom doesn't feel round about way.

590
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:42,600
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

591
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,080
 And that is my fact.

592
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,680
 My fact this week is that traditional Ethiopian households

593
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,080
 can spend up to nine hours a day on coffee ceremonies.

594
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,680
 Wow. Now I know what you're thinking.

595
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,400
 Come on, no, no. That's what I'm thinking.

596
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,440
 They wouldn't get anything done.

597
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,200
 So I should specify, I asked far too many people about this.

598
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,800
 I actually ended up interviewing four separate people

599
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,000
 who have lived in Ethiopia or Ethiopian.

600
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,760
 And basically coffee ceremonies are a massive part of life in Ethiopia.

601
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,720
 And they can last up to three hours.

602
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,400
 So the first hour is roasting the coffee

603
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,560
 and then you kind of grind it and make it.

604
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,480
 And then it's all about sitting around, having a chat, debating politics.

605
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,680
 What have you.

606
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,120
 And so you'll do that.

607
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,800
 And then particularly in rural places, you might do it three times a day.

608
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,240
 So breakfast, lunch and dinner time.

609
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,440
 Now, you probably aren't doing it three times a day every day for three hours

610
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,760
 because you wouldn't be able to hold down a job.

611
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,680
 No, maybe they have like a Nespresso machine for day to day stuff.

612
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,080
 And then for the special occasions, they do the three hour thing.

613
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,480
 No. Yeah. Yeah.

614
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,520
 Maybe it's a lockdown thing, you know, it's a lockdown.

615
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,240
 You might as well spend nine hours a day.

616
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,960
 Yeah, you're right. It's a good idea.

617
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,480
 How how do we fill our time?

618
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,400
 Let's drag this out for a while.

619
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,600
 The queues at Starbucks in Ethiopia must be absolutely enormous.

620
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,000
 Can you imagine if there's one person in front of you that's two days away?

621
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,760
 And after all that time, they still get your name wrong.

622
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,520
 Three hours. Come on.

623
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,800
 I suppose one guy who runs this place called Kaffa Coffee,

624
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,360
 which is actually this really nice Ethiopian coffee.

625
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
 Would like Van in Dulston.

626
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,680
 Anyway, he was great.

627
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,680
 So he was I was asking him about it and holding up the queue behind me.

628
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,040
 And he was saying that actually how it would work where he was from anyway,

629
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,080
 is that you'd be in your village and you would hear the first person

630
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,280
 to get up and start roasting the beans because it makes a really loud noise.

631
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,520
 You've got a very, very hot pan.

632
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,720
 And when the beans crash onto it, they really crackle at first.

633
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,480
 And once you hear that person, you're like, OK, someone else is doing the coffee today.

634
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,400
 I don't have to. And you're bringing your leftovers from the night before from the meal.

635
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,520
 If you've got some bread left over and you'll sort of swap that for some coffee

636
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,880
 and hang out doing that.

637
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,000
 So that makes more sense.

638
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,800
 Like it's not every single household is doing that many times a day.

639
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,600
 Well, Kaffa actually is the name of the region, isn't it?

640
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,320
 In Ethiopia, where coffee originated, I think.

641
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,040
 And actually, it's where we and almost every country in the world

642
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,760
 gets the word for coffee is from this place, Kaffa.

643
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,000
 Wow. Makes sense.

644
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,880
 We have said before, just in case there's a pedant out there that coffee originated

645
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,240
 in Yemen and there is some hot debate between those two countries about it.

646
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,440
 And I think you can engage with that, if you want.

647
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,840
 What I think and, you know, I don't want to get into a conflict

648
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,280
 with the Yemenis or the Ethiopians, but I think the coffee plants

649
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,120
 was really found in Ethiopia, but then modern day coffee.

650
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,040
 Actually, not even modern day coffee, but, you know, early modern coffee

651
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,400
 came from Yemen to drink.

652
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,520
 That sounds right.

653
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,920
 Well, it sounds like you're determined to not pick a side in this conflict.

654
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:53,440
 Quite cool in this coffee ceremony as well.

655
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,520
 The traditional ceremony has three rounds.

656
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,600
 And the first round is where you get your strongest cup

657
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
 and then you re pour the water.

658
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,480
 So it's a weaker cup for the second round.

659
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,320
 And then the weakest is the last round.

660
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,080
 And they're called Abol Tona and Bereka.

661
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,280
 And that is, according to their legend, the name of the three goats

662
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,760
 who invented coffee, according to Ethiopian legend.

663
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,200
 Again, I did ask this guy and he was like, yeah, yeah, the goats.

664
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,960
 They're the names of the goats.

665
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,960
 And the idea is that like over a thousand years ago,

666
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,280
 a goat herder saw his goats acting all jumpy and twitchy and weird.

667
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,880
 And then he saw that they'd eaten these cherries sitting next to them.

668
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,360
 And they were the coffee cherries.

669
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,960
 And so he brought them to some monks.

670
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,880
 See, this is just like the eggs.

671
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,880
 It's just like the thousand year egg being discovered completely by mistake.

672
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,760
 No one is ever willing to admit I grew a plant

673
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,320
 and I experimented with hundreds of ways of cooking it.

674
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,640
 And this is the one I discovered.

675
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,240
 It's my work that's done this.

676
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,000
 It's always always a magic plant

677
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,840
 and the goats happen to be sprightly.

678
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,960
 What makes me laugh about that story is that he saw his goats for dancing.

679
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,040
 He was like, I want what they're having.

680
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:00,320
 I wouldn't go near it personally myself, but thank goodness that person did.

681
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,720
 Exactly.

682
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,120
 The mind of a great inventor always wants to mimic the dancing goat.

683
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,520
 Have you guys heard of the women's petition against coffee?

684
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:15,080
 This was a pamphlet that was published in England in 1674.

685
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,120
 And it was at a time when coffee was quite controversial

686
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:23,960
 because coffee houses, as I think Anna said, they allow discussion of all sorts.

687
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,360
 Politics is one thing.

688
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,480
 So, you know, you might be discussing politics

689
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,040
 and you might decide that you don't like the king very much or whatever.

690
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,600
 So political discussion was dangerous.

691
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,960
 And anyway, this women's petition against coffee was published in 1674,

692
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,760
 which claimed all sorts of stuff.

693
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,160
 It said coffee makes a man as unfruitful as the deserts

694
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,680
 whence that unhappy berry is said to be brought.

695
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,200
 So it sort of damages men's fertility.

696
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,560
 Or that when a woman approaches the nuptial bed

697
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,640
 expecting a man that should answer the vigor of her flames,

698
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,440
 she why should she only meet a bed full of bones and hug a meagre useless corpse?

699
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,240
 Strong stuff about coffee.

700
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,440
 But I know the weird thing is it probably wasn't by women.

701
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,440
 It's written in a way which implies that it's written by a man,

702
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,880
 sort of ventriloquizing women, like, oh, it makes men so gossipy.

703
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,160
 They're more gossipy than us women who are writing this petition.

704
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,960
 It's in that kind of vein.

705
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,520
 And also, was it in the petition, the thing about meeting an old skeleton corpse in bed?

706
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,840
 That was in the petition.

707
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,560
 Yeah. See, that doesn't sound like a woman to me.

708
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,840
 It's like a relief if what you're meeting is sort of skeletal mess.

709
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,000
 He doesn't want to do anything.

710
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,520
 That sounded very much a man.

711
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,320
 And also, coffee is supposed to make you live longer.

712
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,760
 So you're less likely to meet a skeleton.

713
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,200
 He'll be full of life.

714
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,320
 And these are all these are all arguments against the women's petition.

715
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,560
 I also thought if you drank lots of coffee, you turned into George Clooney.

716
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,400
 Is that not that's what TV's taught me?

717
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,720
 Yeah, that's right. Keep drinking it, James.

718
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,400
 Keep going.

719
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,600
 You're nearly there.

720
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,360
 Is that right? I'm doing nine hours a day, so I shouldn't be right now.

721
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,160
 That or Anthony Head, do you remember his old adverts?

722
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,600
 Oh, yeah, of course.

723
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,200
 Anthony Head, is he the guy from Buffy?

724
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,400
 Yeah.

725
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,120
 Yeah, but he's the guy from the Nescafé sexy couple flirting adverts, really.

726
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,960
 Yeah, that does ring a bell.

727
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,600
 He was quite an anxious character in Buffy, so a bad person to advertise coffee.

728
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,560
 Whereas George Clooney is much more chill.

729
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,480
 That's true, but why do you think he was anxious, Anna?

730
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,720
 Is that delicious Nescafé, isn't it?

731
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,640
 He was off his head on Nescafé all the time.

732
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,760
 Yeah, that's what it was, all withdrawing.

733
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,720
 So coffee withdrawal is a thing, which I don't drink enough coffee.

734
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,880
 I don't think to get serious withdrawal, but you've quit before, Andy, haven't you?

735
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,800
 I've quit. I'm currently quit.

736
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,640
 You're currently quit.

737
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,560
 You seem like you've got the shakes.

738
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,760
 You've been very old.

739
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,840
 Is that is that why?

740
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,160
 Have you ever been you've never been properly on it, though?

741
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
 Have you or have you?

742
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,600
 No, I was.

743
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,400
 I was for years and years.

744
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,840
 I just drinking several a day.

745
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,160
 And then when you stop, you just have a headache for two weeks.

746
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,000
 And then and then that's that.

747
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Yeah, I can vouch for that.

748
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,560
 I quit drinking coffee.

749
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,440
 That it's very inconsistently advice.

750
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,560
 Some people say you can't you can have coffee when you're pregnant.

751
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,840
 Some people can say you can't.

752
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,120
 But I just quit anyway.

753
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,920
 I thought I'd quit and then my teeth has not been yellow.

754
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,520
 Because that would be the advantage and I got a headache.

755
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,800
 Yeah, you feel well when you stop drinking that as much caffeine as you used to.

756
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,000
 Absolutely.

757
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,440
 Did you feel less awake or less alert or less focused or anything?

758
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,920
 Yeah, but that's what we do to the fact I was growing up human, you know?

759
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,920
 Like, to be honest, I started drinking coffee again recently.

760
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,320
 And I think it's all a bit of mythology video.

761
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,680
 I don't think it makes you any more alert or awake.

762
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,800
 I just think you just get a bit attached to the kind of your brain

763
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,760
 getting a bit wired, you know?

764
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,400
 But I'm not I'm not more productive when I'm like, I'm not more productive

765
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,600
 when I'm shaking like a leaf.

766
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,400
 If anything, I'm less productive.

767
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,600
 Well, some people, it does seem to work for some people.

768
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,280
 I kind of agree.

769
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,280
 It makes me twitchy and endlessly Google weird health symptoms wrong with me

770
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,920
 rather than do actual work.

771
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,000
 But Michael Pollan, who's the brilliant food writer

772
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,800
 who wrote a book called Caffeine, which is an audio book, actually.

773
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,880
 He is a huge coffee fan and he quit while writing the book

774
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,160
 and it almost ruined the actual book, which I like a book on caffeine

775
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,320
 was almost destroyed by caffeine withdrawal.

776
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,880
 But he basically said that he felt like he wasn't in writing in his first language anymore.

777
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,280
 Everything was so like words didn't hang together properly.

778
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,520
 There was this fog between him and reality.

779
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,760
 He lost all confidence and he thought this whole book is a completely stupid idea.

780
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,000
 I'm going to stop writing it.

781
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,040
 I mean, that is a symptom of writing a book.

782
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:26,360
 I think he might be blaming the coffee so that he can plug his book about coffee.

783
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,840
 Yeah, that literally sounds like imposter syndrome.

784
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:34,200
 You old cynics, I felt sorry for him.

785
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,520
 No, I didn't.

786
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,480
 But he did tell me why coffee apparently does keep you awake,

787
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,400
 which again, I've always thought it sends me to sleep.

788
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,440
 But I didn't know that it was that we basically have a neurotransmitter,

789
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,520
 like a chemical which sends your body a signal, which is called adenosine,

790
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,960
 which is what tells you to go to sleep.

791
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,480
 So it slots into a little receptor in your body,

792
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,520
 which is just the right size for it.

793
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,800
 And tells you to go to sleep.

794
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,800
 And caffeine, the chemical, is exactly the right shape to fit into that receptor.

795
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,920
 So when you drink caffeine, it slips into there ahead of the sleep chemical.

796
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,920
 And so it stops the sleep chemical getting in.

797
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,280
 So it just doesn't tell your body to go to sleep.

798
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,520
 That's really clever.

799
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,320
 Yeah, it's so cool, isn't it?

800
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,240
 I didn't know that.

801
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,760
 Do you think, OK, here's a question for you.

802
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,600
 Do you think you can flush out caffeine by drinking decaf?

803
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,600
 No, no, no, no, no.

804
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,960
 Well, you can't. You're all right in your assumption.

805
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,960
 Is that a thing?

806
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,000
 What? I was just checking.

807
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,200
 I read this online and I thought, well, that seems very obvious and basic to me.

808
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,040
 But I was hoping one of you would fall into my incredibly obvious trap.

809
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,120
 Wait, let me tell you. Well done.

810
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,880
 Did you ask, like, so somebody would drink a cup of like caffeinated coffee

811
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,360
 and then drink a decaf and think that balances it out?

812
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,320
 That's like having a gin and tonic and then having a Coke and being like,

813
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,160
 I'm fine to drive.

814
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,320
 No, no, don't worry. I've had 15 Cokes.

815
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,760
 They make a lot of coffee.

816
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,400
 They grow a lot of coffee in Mastnik, the island.

817
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,320
 And the story of how they did that is really interesting.

818
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,040
 There was a naval officer called Gabrielle DeCleur.

819
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,560
 And he decided, why is that funny?

820
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,760
 It's a funny name.

821
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,680
 It just sounded like you'd seen a long name when you'd given up on it.

822
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,680
 Maybe I was doing like some French babbling or something.

823
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,360
 Gabrielle DeCleur.

824
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:28,320
 And he decided that he was going to take a plant from Paris

825
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,600
 because they had some in the Royal Gardens there.

826
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,000
 And he was going to take it down to Martinique and grow some coffee

827
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,840
 plantations down there.

828
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,800
 But the king didn't really want to give him any of his coffee plants

829
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,240
 because they were really valuable.

830
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,200
 So he kind of sneaked in and stole a little seedling from the Royal Garden.

831
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,760
 And then he decided to go to Martinique,

832
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,880
 which is a long, long way away from Paris.

833
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,640
 First of all, he was caught in a storm and then they got attacked by pirates.

834
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,000
 And all the time he's got this tiny little coffee plant that he's looking after.

835
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,160
 There was a spy from the Netherlands who went after him

836
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,760
 and tried to kill his seedling.

837
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,680
 Just one seedling he had.

838
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,280
 One little seedling, one little plant.

839
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,240
 That's so funny.

840
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,040
 And this little plant, like the spy, came and tried to kill him.

841
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,840
 They, because he was at sea for a long time, they didn't have much rations.

842
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,480
 And so he took his tiny bit of water that he was allowed to drink

843
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,200
 and he would share it with his seedling to keep it alive.

844
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,280
 And then he got it to Martinique and planted it.

845
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,880
 And 50 years later, there were 80 million coffee trees on Martinique.

846
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,760
 I can't even look after my yucca.

847
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,040
 And even after a coffee plant on a boat.

848
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,280
 Good for him. Good for him.

849
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,600
 I think that has the makings of a great film where it's one man and his seedling.

850
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,400
 And, you know, he's on the boat

851
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,800
 and all the other sailors are looking hungrily at the seedling.

852
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,920
 And they look at it and turns it into a big leg of ham before them or whatever.

853
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,760
 I can't believe you didn't even bring a spare.

854
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,800
 Take two.

855
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,600
 I can't believe that Andy, when he becomes a film director,

856
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,520
 his kind of film will have people looking at things

857
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,840
 and then turning into massive hams.

858
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,920
 It's strongly based on the cut, the Looney Tunes.

859
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,400
 I can't see you getting many Oscar nominations for that kind of movie.

860
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,360
 We'll see. We'll see.

861
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,920
 When the best ham category is launched thanks to my extensive lobbying campaign

862
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,720
 and the winner for 10 years, the road, John Ham.

863
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,240
 One more thing.

864
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,000
 The coffee filter was invented by a woman called Melita Benz.

865
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,480
 And she, according to her son, you'll love this, Andy,

866
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,520
 because I know you love your origin stories.

867
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,200
 She's trying to come up with a way of making coffee.

868
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,000
 And she just got really frustrated

869
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,120
 and ripped out a page of her son's notebook from school

870
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,040
 and stuck it in an old tin pot.

871
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,520
 And it just happened to make this perfect coffee.

872
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,800
 And she decided that, go on.

873
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,120
 I I like that story because it's an innovator

874
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,880
 thinking of looking at her environment, coming up with a thing and adapting it.

875
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,560
 If it if it was going with the classic format, it would be

876
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,200
 she was trying to pour her coffee.

877
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,640
 And unfortunately, her son dropped his notebook

878
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,360
 and a leaf was torn out and landed on top of the cup.

879
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,240
 And when she poured it, it caught all the ground.

880
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,480
 You go, oh, my God.

881
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,040
 So I've applauded Melissa Benz for this.

882
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,040
 OK, fair enough.

883
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,440
 Well, during World War Two, the company stopped making any filters

884
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,960
 and started making supplies for the Nazis.

885
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,240
 Oh, OK.

886
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,600
 When I said I applauded Melita Benz, I'd like to I'd like to clarify.

887
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,720
 What for a point?

888
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,840
 Well, you don't applaud her, Andy, because after the war,

889
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,840
 she started a program that compensated victims of a Nazi's forced labor policy.

890
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,920
 All right. When I said I didn't approve of her, I'd like to clarify.

891
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,360
 Again.

892
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,880
 Coffee was officially blessed in the 17th century by the Catholic Church

893
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,840
 because the Pope liked it and you could do that.

894
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,640
 So it was kind of thought as an evil drink.

895
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,680
 It started in in Africa or in Yemen somewhere and they all drink it around there.

896
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,560
 Then it got up into the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula.

897
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,800
 Everyone's drinking it.

898
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,040
 So then it came over to Catholic Europe and everyone went, well,

899
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,400
 it's the drink of the infidel.

900
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,160
 And then Pope Clement VIII tasted some and thought, right, I love this.

901
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,400
 What am I going to do?

902
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,240
 Because everyone's saying this is the invention of Satan.

903
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,200
 It's awful. So he said, look, it's so delicious.

904
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,800
 It would be awful to just let the infidels have use of it.

905
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,240
 Let's trick Satan and bless it so we turn it into a Christian drink.

906
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,800
 And he did.

907
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,080
 And that's why you go to heaven if you drink coffee.

908
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,240
 But that's really interesting.

909
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,800
 Something I realised, I didn't really realise this is how popular coffee is.

910
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,040
 There's only one thing that's drunk more regularly than coffee and that's water.

911
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,480
 It's literally the second most popular drink in the world.

912
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,760
 Wow.

913
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,080
 Which is incredible because it doesn't taste that nice.

914
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,720
 I thought it might be Ribena or.

915
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,200
 But it's the second which means that humans,

916
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,720
 we're doing something wrong in life for us to be needed so much caffeine in our life.

917
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,040
 Like we need to introduce siestas all around the world, basically.

918
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,760
 This is this is what we need.

919
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,400
 You're right, because it doesn't taste nice.

920
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,840
 Whatever anyone's claiming.

921
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,080
 We are just doing it in order to keep ourselves awake.

922
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,520
 Let's just start sleeping more.

923
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,320
 The idea of a Ribena based society.

924
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:18,320
 I think it's less sexy if Anthony Head from Buffy is knocking on his neighbour's door at night

925
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,440
 saying have you got any Bina?

926
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,800
 But he would be dressed like a massive Ribena berry, wouldn't he?

927
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,080
 Why is that not sexy?

928
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,080
 His little arm sticking out.

929
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:33,280
 I don't know, George Clooney and that's still sexy.

930
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,560
 I think we could all agree.

931
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:45,120
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the week and that is Andy.

932
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,640
 My fact is that the 18th century grammarian, Alexander the Corrector,

933
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,040
 carried a sponge wherever he went just in case he spotted any offensive graffiti.

934
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,200
 He sounds great.

935
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,120
 He's my hero.

936
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,200
 He was a Scottish author.

937
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,200
 His name was Alexander Crudden, C-I-U-D-E-N.

938
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,440
 He was an author, proofreader and...

939
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,280
 You could see why he sort of changed his mnemonic to the Corrector, can't you?

940
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,880
 Yeah, he was a bookseller.

941
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,760
 He was a stationer.

942
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,000
 He was eccentric, definitely.

943
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,360
 He was famous for having written a concordance to the Bible,

944
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,080
 which is an index of the Bible.

945
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,120
 We'll get on to that later.

946
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,280
 But also he carried...

947
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,720
 Let's get on to it now.

948
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,720
 Yeah, come on, OK.

949
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,120
 He wrote an index to the Bible.

950
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,280
 He wrote a verbal index of the Bible.

951
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,400
 So he took every single word of the King James Bible,

952
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,520
 apart from "the" and "of" and really sort of nuts and bolts ones.

953
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,920
 Every single other word, you know, "shoe" or "ham" or whatever, he made an index.

954
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,800
 "Ham" is a good one because the son of Noah was called Ham.

955
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,040
 Son of Noah, I knew you were going to bring it up.

956
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,640
 I don't know if "ham" and "ham" would have different entries in the Corrector.

957
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,440
 I suspect a word.

958
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,440
 He knew what he was doing.

959
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,640
 Yeah, it's three times as long as the actual Bible.

960
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,280
 And it just tells you which words appear where in the Bible.

961
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,680
 That's like only the really hardcore fans read that one.

962
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,520
 It's like people who've read the Silmarillion over Lord of the Rings, isn't it?

963
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,320
 Oh, you might have read the Bible, but...

964
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,840
 Have you read it in alphabetical order?

965
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,880
 Such a weird thing to do.

966
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,160
 It took him 12 years, didn't it?

967
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,160
 Unsurprising.

968
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,800
 And it was like all of the word "all", for instance, he recorded.

969
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,480
 So he included some pretty relevant words in there.

970
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,280
 But the thing is, the Bibles are ready index.

971
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,400
 It's like Proverbs, Mark, John, Luke.

972
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,000
 Like it's already in sections.

973
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,640
 Yeah, it's in chapters, you're right.

974
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,480
 You know, you're making the classic mistake of confusing contents and index.

975
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,520
 And Alejandro, the Corrector, would be turning in his grave right now.

976
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,520
 You'd be corrected.

977
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,600
 Dan wouldn't have done that.

978
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,600
 Dan wouldn't.

979
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,320
 It's taken this long for us to feel his loss.

980
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,320
 Yeah, he was weird.

981
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,560
 So he didn't like grammar mistakes either.

982
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,240
 He didn't like grammar mistakes and he didn't like offensive graffiti.

983
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,800
 And he had his own very idiosyncratic interpretation of what offensive was.

984
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,080
 So he didn't like the number 45, which at the time, lots of people were writing...

985
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,440
 That was the main one, wasn't it?

986
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,160
 The number 45 was the main thing that he hated the most.

987
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,280
 He only liked LPs, didn't he?

988
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,280
 He didn't like...

989
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,680
 Maybe he predicted...

990
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,800
 Did he predict Donald Trump's presidency and hated that?

991
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,800
 That's exactly it.

992
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,800
 He hated that.

993
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,160
 It's nothing to do with that.

994
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,000
 It's because of John Wilkes, the radical.

995
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,360
 John Wilkes was a radical author at the time and he had written a work attacking the monarchy,

996
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:39,600
 which had been published in issue number 45 of a magazine called The North Britain, which

997
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,120
 published, you know, exciting political content.

998
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,560
 So 45 became a bit of a rallying cry for anti-monarchists at the time.

999
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,640
 People would write 45 on walls and doors and floors and things like that.

1000
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,640
 But if Alexander the Corrector spotted it with his sponge, he'd get rid of it immediately.

1001
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,280
 What do you think he would do if, like, just your house number was number 45?

1002
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,240
 I don't know.

1003
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,360
 And you've got 45 when you've really been.

1004
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,360
 Yeah.

1005
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,640
 And just not even looking at it and he keeps coming round and, like, taking it off.

1006
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,640
 Like, "No!"

1007
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,640
 That's a good point.

1008
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,640
 That's a good point.

1009
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,520
 Also, the Jacobite raising was 1745, which was another reason why they used this name.

1010
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
 Yeah.

1011
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,720
 That's why he did it in that issue.

1012
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,720
 He waited.

1013
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,480
 He printed 44 issues of this pointless magazine, so he'd get to 45 and make an

1014
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,120
 obscure reference.

1015
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,720
 He was an Iliest.

1016
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,440
 Do you guys know what an Iliest is?

1017
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,440
 Oh.

1018
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,440
 No.

1019
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,440
 You want to guess?

1020
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,160
 Oh, did he like the Iliad?

1021
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,160
 I would guess that.

1022
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,160
 Yeah.

1023
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,160
 That's a good guess.

1024
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,160
 Did he like Ili Coffee?

1025
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,160
 That's a coffee brand, yes.

1026
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,160
 Yeah.

1027
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,600
 That's actually closer because that's the correct spelling.

1028
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,680
 So you're definitely getting warmer, but still quite cold, so I'm going to tell you.

1029
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,680
 An Iliest is someone who always refers to themselves in the third person.

1030
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,080
 So it's like, "Ile", it from Lassen, I-Double-L-E.

1031
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,080
 Okay.

1032
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,080
 I hate him.

1033
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,080
 Yeah.

1034
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,000
 I just, I just, you've said it all.

1035
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,160
 He's a grammar police, which, you know, he'd be good on Twitter.

1036
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,160
 Yeah.

1037
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,280
 He keeps getting my really bins nicked, and he speaks in third person.

1038
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,280
 I can't stand the man.

1039
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,280
 Yeah.

1040
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,280
 He's not likable.

1041
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,800
 He wasn't popular at the time either, to be fair.

1042
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,200
 You're matching the opinion of him then because he was, he was institutionalised

1043
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,760
 several times, and there's lots of debate over whether, you know, was he really ill,

1044
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,320
 or Henson being put in an institution, or was he being put there by his enemies?

1045
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:28,200
 And there's a biographer called Julia Kay, who argues that he was put away not because

1046
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,200
 he was ill.

1047
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,280
 And I mean, he sounds pretty eccentric, sounds pretty out there, but on one occasion, he

1048
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,160
 was put away by, I think the brother of a woman he was trying to propose to or trying

1049
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,760
 to marry, but he had discovered that the woman he was trying to propose to was sleeping with

1050
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,960
 her own brother, and he raised a big old stink about this, and then was putting an asylum

1051
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,960
 for it.

1052
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,960
 Yeah.

1053
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,320
 So that was the first time, but then later on, he was putting an asylum for unwelcome

1054
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:58,080
 attentions to a widow, and then another time for attacking a man with a shovel, and then

1055
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:06,520
 a third time for, he formed an emotional attachment to a woman without even having met her first.

1056
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,680
 And he then called himself, instead of Alexander the Corrector, Alexander the Conqueror, and

1057
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:17,600
 decided that this woman was his predestined partner in life, and tried to get together

1058
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,840
 with her, even though she didn't know who he was.

1059
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,840
 Okay.

1060
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,840
 All right.

1061
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,840
 I mean...

1062
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,800
 But that first time, it was just an eccentric thing.

1063
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,400
 But there is, like in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, they think that they

1064
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,480
 say that that first time is what kind of threw him over the edge a little bit, and from then

1065
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,480
 on...

1066
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,480
 Yeah.

1067
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:40,400
 Well, he wanted to regulate private madhouses, and supposedly the fact he didn't manage to

1068
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,280
 improve private madhouse regulation made him very depressed, which then meant he was sent

1069
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,280
 to bedlam again.

1070
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,040
 Although, as James points out, hitting people with a shovel and forming unwelcome attachments

1071
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,840
 to women will also do it.

1072
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,400
 That'll do the trick.

1073
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,400
 So he was complicated.

1074
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,800
 He wasn't an unproblematic fave, is what I'm trying to say.

1075
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,800
 Fair.

1076
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,800
 Fair assessment.

1077
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,880
 But I'm impressed that in those days, you were able to form attachments to people you

1078
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,760
 hadn't met romantically, pre-internet.

1079
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,760
 How are you doing that?

1080
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,760
 I see what you mean.

1081
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,560
 It was the daughter of Sir Thomas Abney of Newington, who was the Lord Mayor of London.

1082
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:17,960
 So basically, he'd heard of the Lord Mayor's daughter, possibly seen her in some periodicals,

1083
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,840
 and decided that that was his future wife.

1084
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:26,680
 He called her Princess Elizabetha and said that her home was a place called Silesia,

1085
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,960
 which he would besiege.

1086
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,360
 I have the same thing about Daniel Craig, you know.

1087
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,280
 So I think that's fine.

1088
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:39,200
 Are you planning to besiege Daniel Craig's house?

1089
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,160
 Because it's probably a public service we're doing.

1090
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,160
 No, it's not.

1091
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,160
 It's our house.

1092
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,160
 We live together.

1093
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,280
 It's been our happy spousal home for a few years now, actually.

1094
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,480
 Opens the door, dressed as a massive black currant, trying to make Rhybeena for you.

1095
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,880
 Yeah, so that's Alexander.

1096
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,940
 So on, I should say he's an Ilias, sorry, just to go a long way back to him referring

1097
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:08,080
 to himself in the third person, because I wouldn't want you to think badly of him.

1098
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,560
 I don't know if he did it in speech.

1099
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:14,400
 He just did it in the book he wrote, which I read Decent Portion of, which had the catchy

1100
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,080
 title, "The Corrector's Earnest Address to the Inhabitants of Great Britain, showing

1101
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:23,960
 that the late earthquakes and the fact we are at war with a powerful nation are allowed

1102
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:29,120
 to call from divine providence for a speedy and thorough reformation," actually it actually

1103
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,120
 goes on.

1104
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,040
 But it was basically saying, "Look, we've had some earthquakes, we're at war.

1105
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,240
 This is clearly because you guys aren't abiding by my grammatical correction."

1106
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,200
 And that whole thing, he refers to a lot of stuff that's happened in his life, but he

1107
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,160
 always calls himself the "corrector."

1108
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,640
 He would write pamphlets as well, called things like "Mr Crudham Greatly Injured"

1109
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,460
 or "The Adventures of Alexander the Corrector," which is practically a comic book, writing

1110
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,480
 a pamphlet about yourself and calling it "The Adventures of."

1111
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,480
 It is.

1112
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,920
 And then I think that was just about how his sister tried to have him sectioned or had

1113
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,920
 him sectioned.

1114
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,960
 So it's disappointing if you think you're getting an adventure book and you get an

1115
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,200
 annoying sibling rivalry.

1116
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,680
 Yeah, imagine if the Avengers were like that.

1117
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:13,760
 It was just Iron Man's brother stealing his trainers, like, "Get your own shoes."

1118
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:19,200
 Captain America turns up with his sponge, yeah.

1119
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:25,280
 So on graffiti, some stuff on that, I was going through my old files and stuff on graffiti

1120
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:31,240
 and the ancient Roman graffiti seemed to so often be about discouraging public excretion.

1121
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:37,600
 So Roman graffiti includes the phrase, "Anybody urinating here will incur the wrath of Mars."

1122
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:43,720
 It's to the one defecating here, "Beware the curse and shit with comfort and good cheer

1123
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,720
 so long as you don't do it here."

1124
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,720
 Wow.

1125
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,640
 And so it seems like graffiti in those days was doing a public good.

1126
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,960
 Yeah, it's like no ball games kind of thing, isn't it?

1127
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,320
 It's just trying to stop people from doing bad things around your house.

1128
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,320
 Exactly.

1129
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,960
 No turning in this driveway.

1130
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,720
 That's my favorite one that people put up.

1131
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,800
 This gate's permanently in use.

1132
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,800
 Permanently in use.

1133
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,800
 If it was permanently in use, I couldn't read the sign.

1134
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,800
 Get out of here.

1135
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:14,800
 I was in a really beautiful place in Cotswold recently going for a walk on my own in a wood

1136
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,200
 and there was a massive tree and it was like, and it's Cotswold's, you know, it's like

1137
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,800
 David Cameron territory and like Bluebellwood and someone had carved in giant capital letters

1138
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,800
 into the tree, Millwall.

1139
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,840
 I just thought, "That is so great.

1140
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,920
 I'm so glad Millwall fans are going that far afield to make their stuff."

1141
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:38,400
 And then it said, "Get your parliamentary favours here, call Dave on 01."

1142
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,560
 Well, that would still be relevant when this goes out, probably.

1143
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,560
 Definitely.

1144
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,560
 It will keep it relevant.

1145
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,560
 We'll keep it in the news.

1146
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,160
 I've seen some celebrity graffiti, which is very exciting.

1147
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,440
 I saw something that Lord Byron wrote.

1148
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,440
 Really?

1149
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,280
 There's a place in Greece called the Temple of Poseidon and he carved his name really

1150
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:04,960
 big and florid into the column of this 4,000-year-old temple, which is pretty disrespectful.

1151
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,960
 But it's surrounded by other names because it was just the thing you did at the time.

1152
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,960
 Byron does it.

1153
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,960
 It's kind of okay, isn't it?

1154
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,720
 I bet the council got really pissed off with all the other people who did it, but when

1155
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,720
 Byron...

1156
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,760
 Yeah, he's like the Banksy of the 19th century.

1157
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,760
 You're right.

1158
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,760
 You're right.

1159
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,760
 Yeah.

1160
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,760
 That Banksy, he did a load of graffiti just in Waterloo, in that tunnel in Waterloo.

1161
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,760
 I don't know if you remember.

1162
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,880
 It's like one of the first things.

1163
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,640
 And then I went to see it when it happened and then we started filming QI and I saw

1164
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,640
 it right at the start.

1165
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,560
 By the time we finished filming it, it had already been covered, I think, three or four

1166
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,600
 times by other people putting graffiti on.

1167
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,600
 And that was kind of the point.

1168
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:46,040
 He was like, "This is now a graffiti place and just put whatever you want here."

1169
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,920
 But we've come up with a new way of using hydrogel, which is like this amazing kind

1170
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,920
 of substance.

1171
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,080
 And you put it on the wall and it just sticks to the top covering of paint.

1172
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:00,960
 And it can take that off and you can see the graffiti that's underneath that graffiti.

1173
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,960
 No.

1174
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,000
 So, in theory, you could keep going, taking layers and layers and layers off this, I think

1175
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,920
 it's called leaky passage or something, isn't it?

1176
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,920
 Leaky tunnel or something.

1177
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,920
 I think you're right.

1178
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,920
 Yeah.

1179
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,200
 And you'll be able to get to the Banksy's again.

1180
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,200
 That would be awesome.

1181
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,200
 Cool.

1182
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,880
 I used to work for Camden Council and Banksy did some graffiti on the side of a shop.

1183
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,640
 And I used to work in a street team that used to do with waste and street cleaning.

1184
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,720
 Obviously, our guys cleaned that off, right?

1185
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,520
 And the shop owners tried to sue Camden.

1186
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,760
 They were like, "You got rid of a Banksy, we're going to cover it with glass and like

1187
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,760
 make loads of money."

1188
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,760
 I don't know how that's so funny.

1189
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,400
 I find it really incredible that the point of graffiti is that it sort of lives out

1190
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,400
 in public.

1191
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,920
 But now because it's because of capitalism, people are like, "No, no, we're going to

1192
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,920
 preserve that.

1193
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,560
 We're going to get perspex on it and we're going to make it get rich off of it, which

1194
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,560
 is hilarious."

1195
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,120
 I can't believe you were, that's always reported on.

1196
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,720
 I can't believe you were one of those people who cleaned a Banksy off.

1197
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,320
 It always creates this massive controversy, doesn't it?

1198
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,960
 And Banksy's just there in the sidelines, chuckling away.

1199
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,880
 But whenever Banksy does anything, Athena goes along with her sponge, doesn't she?

1200
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,880
 Yes.

1201
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,840
 Well, not just Banksy, everybody.

1202
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:13,080
 Can I correct some, just correct some grammar broadly before we finish?

1203
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,080
 Which is...

1204
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,840
 Whose grammar are you going to correct?

1205
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,360
 This thing that I'm pointing to here.

1206
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,360
 Bicep.

1207
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,360
 What is it?

1208
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,360
 I'd say bicep.

1209
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,360
 Yeah, bicep.

1210
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,360
 That's really incorrect, guys.

1211
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,360
 Oh, God.

1212
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,360
 This is not a bicep.

1213
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,360
 This is a biceps.

1214
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:31,760
 And whenever you hear someone refer to a singular bicep, you can correct them and stick that

1215
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,760
 S on the end.

1216
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,200
 Biceps literally means two-headed, two-biceps-headed.

1217
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,080
 There are always two heads, it's never just unicep.

1218
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,080
 Wow.

1219
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,480
 And it's just because the muscle's got two, like, connecting bits.

1220
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,480
 James, you've just been paninode.

1221
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,800
 I can't believe it.

1222
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,800
 I...

1223
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,800
 That was an amazing moment.

1224
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,320
 Well, if Anna didn't have such impressive biceps, then maybe I wouldn't have done...

1225
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,080
 Yeah, I drew you off your game with that.

1226
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:02,760
 You said bicep implying that you think they're so small, it only qualifies as one.

1227
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,760
 Good point.

1228
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,760
 Yeah.

1229
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,760
 There's only one on each side.

1230
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,360
 So you have to say I pulled my left biceps, as opposed to...

1231
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,360
 Exactly.

1232
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,360
 Hmm.

1233
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,360
 Even if you pulled your right one.

1234
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,600
 No, that's not true.

1235
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,000
 I just pulled mine guns.

1236
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,560
 I've won all of that.

1237
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,400
 OK, that's all of our facts.

1238
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,000
 Thank you so much for listening, everybody.

1239
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,560
 We will be back again next week.

1240
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,080
 If you're lucky, you might get another guest.

1241
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,200
 If you're unlucky, you might get Dan Shriver back.

1242
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,120
 But until then, you can find these guys on their Twitter accounts, James.

1243
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,120
 At James Harkin.

1244
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,120
 Andi.

1245
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,120
 At Andrew Hunter M.

1246
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,120
 Athena.

1247
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,120
 Have you got Twitter?

1248
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,120
 I do.

1249
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,120
 I do.

1250
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,120
 I think they can learn new.

1251
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,920
 And you can contact me by emailing podcast@QI.com.

1252
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,380
 You can also go to our website, no such thing as a fish.com, to listen to all our other

1253
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:59,460
 episodes, pick up a hoodie, or a cap, or a vinyl, whatever bit of merch you like.

1254
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:03,040
 And you can also book tickets to the podcast stop festival show we're going to be doing.

1255
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,680
 So go to QI.com/FishEvents for that.

1256
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,720
 OK, thanks so much for listening, everyone.

1257
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,400
 We'll see you again next week.

1258
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:16,400
 Bye.

1259
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,980
 (upbeat music)
