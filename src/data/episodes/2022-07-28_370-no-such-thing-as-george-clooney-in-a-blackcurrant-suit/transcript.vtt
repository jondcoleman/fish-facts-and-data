00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Six Things as a fish.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.000
 Well, what can I tell you about this week's show?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 Dan Schreiber is having a very well-earned little breather.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.080
 He'll be back next week, don't you worry.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.720
 And Dan is such a behemoth of a podcaster that in his place we have not just one, but two people.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.080
 Now, the first person that we'll be replacing Dan is Athena Cablenu.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.880
 Now, she is an amazing comedian, a really good friend of ours.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.400
 You might remember her from our 20-hour comic relief special.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.120
 She was part of the Guilty Feminist team in that.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.040
 And actually, when we were on the Guilty Feminist, she was part of that show.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.440
 She also has a BBC Radio 4 show called Athena's Cancel Culture,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.800
 which is out right now on Radio 4.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.440
 You can find that on the internet as well.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.680
 And she has a podcast called Keeping Athena Company, which is absolutely fantastic.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.720
 I can't recommend that highly enough.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.840
 It's such a brilliant podcast.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.480
 Oh, I did say there was a second person.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.160
 The second person is Athena's son, who you might hear in the background from time to time,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.520
 really kind of coming in at the exact moments that you would want him to.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.680
 So it's almost like we've soundscaped this episode,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.080
 but I promise you it isn't soundscaped.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.680
 It was a tiny little human who was in the background of the show.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.840
 I really hope you enjoyed it.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.040
 We had such fun making it.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.120
 We love Athena.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.520
 And I suppose all that's left to say is on with the podcast.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:47.840
 Hello and welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.920
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four secret locations somewhere on Earth.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.360
 And specifically in London.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.840
 My name is Anna Tyszynski, and I am here today with James Harkin and Johanna Murray

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.560
 and our very special, exciting guest, Athena Koblenu.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.080
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.760
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.000
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.640
 And starting with you, Athena, what's your facts?

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.000
 So this is my fact.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.440
 The 100 folds of a chef's hat represent the 100 ways

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.760
 in which you can cook an egg, right?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.800
 Does that mean, Athena, if you can only cook an egg like one way,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.040
 for instance, then you can only have one fold or get a beret.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.640
 Yeah. Chef Beret.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.160
 I was going to say you get a little cone, but that's not a good kind of hat to wear.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.240
 Big white cone on your head.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.000
 That's not a good hat at all.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 I mean, I always thought I was an amazing cook.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.800
 I'm like, you know, you see my Instagram, there's lots of food on there.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.680
 But when I read that fact, I was like, I can't cook at all.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.840
 I know three ways. That's it.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.520
 Come on, mate. Even I know more than three ways to cook an egg.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.840
 What's your three?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.320
 Scrambled, omelette, fry.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.960
 Oh, boil. I know four ways.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.240
 Oh, I'm still short.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.320
 Not tried puching any time.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.840
 Oh, God. Yes. OK.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.280
 Fine. Five.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.040
 It's still, we're a long way off.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.440
 We're five percent of the way there.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.760
 And the rest of this section is just going to be us brainstorming

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.080
 other possible ways.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.920
 Now, I will say, have you guys ever coddled an egg?

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.760
 No.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.360
 Coddling an egg is lovely.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.360
 It sounds like sort of taking it to bed with you, like a teddy.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.520
 I think you sort of, you put it in, is it like you give it a bath?

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.600
 You put it in a little glass

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.280
 ramekin and then you give it a bath and that slowly cooks within that.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.400
 And you mix it with spices and they that's very nice.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.840
 Anyway, six. That's like a bain-marie.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.280
 Yeah, seven.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.760
 I think you can bake an egg.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.440
 I once saw someone bake an egg.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.080
 They put the egg in an oven and I thought.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.920
 I've baked an egg before.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.880
 Have you, in an oven?

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.120
 Yeah, like, like hollowed out a pepper

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.160
 and then broken egg in it and just baked it.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.160
 Oh, but I've seen that someone put the shell.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.760
 You can do this.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.560
 You can just put the whole egg in the oven and bake it, which just

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.800
 which just for me feels like, like you don't really want the egg.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.600
 So you're trying to wait as long as possible before you have to eat it.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.960
 Well, do you know something that takes even longer than your boiled oven egg?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.280
 You can do it in the dishwasher as well.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.480
 Very nice.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.720
 Wrap it up or, in fact, leave it in the shell and then just set the dishwasher running.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.880
 And another longer way of doing it is the 100 year egg.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.480
 Very long cycle in the dish.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.440
 Sometimes it's called the thousand year egg.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.960
 And sometimes it's just called a really disgusting egg because I've had this egg.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.520
 I had it in Singapore and it's kind of what they do is they put it in clay

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.160
 and salt and they leave it for a few weeks and it kind of turns

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.520
 dark black and really, really sulfurous.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.320
 And sometimes they call it horse urine egg because it tastes a bit like horse urine,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.200
 apparently. Yeah, this is one way of eating eggs.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.000
 There is.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.760
 Yeah, they've got a recipe for that in my Chinese cookbook.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.400
 I think it looks unappetizing.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.520
 It's disgusting.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.240
 It's really it looks like.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.640
 I think they came out of this because somebody dropped an egg somewhere

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.680
 and they found it five weeks later and they're like, wait, it's not what not.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.640
 And they said, well, we'll make it a recipe.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.640
 And then no one puts me in prison for being disgusting.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.000
 And that's how that works.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.240
 Finally, we hadn't dropped it in this puddle of horse piss.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.920
 If life gives you horse piss.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.240
 Well, that is the story.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.720
 It was like a Chinese guy who had like dropped some eggs,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.280
 stuck eggs in a muddy puddle of water and they had a load of calcium in the water.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.760
 And then he pulled them out and he thought, well, I might as well try them.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.680
 You know, I might as well try them.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.920
 And he's like, these are delicious.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.960
 I need to come up with a way of making them.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.040
 That is my approach to eating pretty much every encrusted

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.960
 ancient bit of food on the back of the fridge.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.080
 I might as well just have most of it and see if I die.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.760
 Do you know, this is great because when you've got a toddler,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.080
 you find food everywhere, you know.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.920
 So now I'm just going to give it a banana that's at the back of the couch

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.200
 because it's just cuisine, isn't it?

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.760
 It's just a new recipe.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.800
 Exactly. It's a delicacy.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.440
 I have a slightly exciting advance on the hundred bleeds in the chef's hat,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.360
 which is this is from a book called The Culinary Guide from 1903.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.920
 And it's by Georges Escoffier, who was a very famous.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.320
 He was an early celebrity chef, not the earliest, but he turned the century.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.240
 Anyway, his book lists two hundred and two ways to prepare eggs, excluding omelettes.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.000
 And omelettes is another eighty two.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.960
 And he also says that if you use the basic recipe for omelette norvegienne,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.560
 it is it is possible to produce an almost infinite number of variations

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.640
 of this type of omelette.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.960
 Then he says in brackets, omelette surprise.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.840
 So well, yeah, sounds gross.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.280
 Do you know where the word comes from? Oh, gosh, I'd assume from the word for egg.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.320
 Does it come from the does it come from the sound of meditation?

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.880
 Yes. And that's shut up.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.160
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It isn't. It isn't.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.280
 It both isn't that.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.640
 And I think I've just lost hearing in one of my ears.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:03.080
 It comes from the same word as you get amulet omelette amulet.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.600
 And also where you get laminate.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.160
 So it means something that's something that's flat, basically.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.440
 An old French word for something that's flat.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.720
 And that's where we get it from.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.360
 You know, apparently we've been boiling eggs wrong.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.000
 According to according to we we've been boiling eggs.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.240
 Oh, this whole time we've been boiling them wrong.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.640
 I love these headlines.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.960
 I once tried to search for all the things, all that you've been

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.680
 something wrong your whole life and I love it.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.440
 Yeah, I want to say it's always like you've been tying your shoes wrong

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.280
 the whole life and then you look at it and some guy on the Internet

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.320
 has come up with a ridiculously stupid way of tying his shoes.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.040
 Although you shouldn't say that because we actually did a fact

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.640
 about three years ago about how we have actually been tying your shoes

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.560
 wrong your whole life.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.600
 Oh, was that us then?

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.320
 That was us on the internet.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.480
 Yeah, we've been boiling eggs wrong and doing everything else wrong.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.920
 But I tried to do it the right way.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.680
 So this is according to MFK Fisher, who I think was this like amazing

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.480
 food writer in the 20th century, and she was very, very influential.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.560
 And she said the key to boiling eggs is you shouldn't boil them.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.360
 And because that cooks it unevenly.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.760
 So if you boil it really hard, you drop it straight into boiling water.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.480
 It cooks the white really fast.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.000
 And by the time the yolk inside is cooked and the white is massively

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.480
 overcooked and it's all rubbery.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.760
 So I tried her way, which is you put it in cold water and then you let

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.120
 the cold water boil and as soon as it hits the boil, you take it off.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.880
 Oh, yeah, was it good?

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.840
 Well, it was the most frustrating 45 minutes of my life.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.280
 You should have put it in your oven.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.160
 It was, it was 45 minutes because it basically super glues the shell to the white.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.600
 So, you know, normally if you appeal a hard boiled egg, then obviously

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.080
 the shell comes off and this it doesn't shock the white away from the shell

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.600
 when you drop it in boiling water.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.000
 And so it took, I mean, I'm not kidding.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.800
 It took 45 minutes to peel the shell off.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.920
 I lost most of the white along the way, don't do it.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.280
 MFK Fisher was pretty amazing, wasn't she?

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.360
 She was the one who W. H. Odin said was the greatest writer of any style

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.600
 in the whole of America.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.640
 She was a food writer and she was the one who also said the perfect way

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.000
 to make a sandwich was to sit on it.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.480
 So you make your sandwich and then you have to sit on it for half an hour

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.680
 just to kind of warm it up and squash it and then it's going to be a perfect sandwich.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.400
 You're going to get a lot of customers returning their sandwiches to the kitchen.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.520
 That's why I was fired from my job at prep.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.160
 Just on on eggs and sort of how they're laid,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.200
 you know when you've got an egg and you've boiled it and you peel it.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.320
 And you know, there's that gap between the white and the shell.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.000
 There's like a little air pocket.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 Yeah. Do you know what that is?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.200
 It's I don't know what it is, but I know it makes it really easy to peel them.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.600
 That's my. Yeah, it's really handy.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.400
 If you find that and you crack the egg there, you can peel your eggs really easily.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.240
 Top tip. That's what it's for.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.760
 That's that's evolution for you.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.000
 It's evolved to help us peel up all day.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.720
 No, it's a it's a little air hole for the chick.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.760
 So in case the egg is fertilised, the chick will be inside and then it needs

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.000
 to practice breathing to inflate its lungs before it cracks out.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.160
 So the way it does that about a day before it cracks out of the shell,

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.200
 it pecks its beak into that little air hole and uses it like a snorkeler mask

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.800
 and just practices breathing every day.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.360
 I take a step closer to veganism and I know.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.640
 I mean, how adorable is that?

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.880
 And we're here making omelettes out of it.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.520
 Yeah, it makes beautiful.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.880
 So I'm probably going to upset you now because I've eaten ballot,

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:40.760
 which is a Vietnamese thing where the the egg has a semi fertilised chick

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.600
 inside the egg when they cook it.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.520
 I must admit, when I tried it, I couldn't.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.560
 I could only eat the bit of egg around the.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.320
 I'll just I'll just eat around.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:59.360
 It's like it's a real delicacy in Vietnam

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.120
 and sometimes used as a way of getting over your hangover as well.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.560
 I mean, you can't criticise it, can you?

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.640
 If you eat eggs, then there's no it's not really that much different.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.880
 But how do you time that?

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.760
 Do you get like an ultrasonic scanner?

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.320
 You give it like an egg ultrasound.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.920
 Then you go, right, it's three weeks.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.680
 It's good to go.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.680
 Oh, no.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.680
 Oh, I don't know if I can.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.560
 There's something about the idea of it, so obviously, you know.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.720
 Well, if we're anthropomorphising eggs and we are now all eggs in America

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.440
 have had a little shampoo before they go into the shops.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.240
 Yeah, it's so weird.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.080
 So they love in America, they love to wash their eggs.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.760
 But that creates a problem because they have this natural bloom on them.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.880
 They have this sort of bacterial layer, which we can't see.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.840
 But it's a rather it keeps bacteria out.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.480
 It's a way of kind of protecting it.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.880
 So, you know, if the egg gets a bit of poo on it or whatever,

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.080
 as it's being laid, it's fine.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.080
 It doesn't matter.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.720
 And so in America, they love to give them a little shampoo.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.520
 But then the problem is you shampoo them

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.640
 and then there are the high odds of bacterial invasion.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.480
 So then they have to refrigerate them and spray them with oil as a nightmare.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.800
 So we don't do that in Europe.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.760
 It is illegal to wash an egg before you sell it to people.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.680
 Wow. Yeah.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.680
 I always think if you kind of get an egg and there's a little feather on there,

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.160
 I always think that's a very probably a fresh egg from a chicken

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.720
 who had a very good life or something.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.160
 But I reckon there's probably a person in a factory just putting feathers in the egg.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.800
 And the poo, yeah, but it's a bone.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.600
 Because if you get a bit of chicken poo, you think, oh,

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.600
 that's literally just come out of its arse.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.080
 I wasn't even had time to lose the poo, but you're right.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.800
 I bet someone's just taping it on because they do that with yolks.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.000
 What colour yolks do you guys want?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.400
 Like orangey, do you crack your egg into the pan?

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.000
 Yeah. I want a bright yellow yolk.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.480
 Like literally like the sun, but like really deep rich yellow.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.120
 Yeah. Rich. I go with that.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.960
 I want one that's more like Donald Trump's skin colour,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.200
 like really deep, dark orange.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.560
 You want to go orange?

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.520
 Well, people do seem to prefer orange.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.920
 And it's because they think the chicken's like healthier.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.520
 So, yeah, if it's like really rich yellow or deep orange,

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.360
 they're like that shows that it's had a better diet.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.720
 And so producers have realised that people prefer that.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.960
 And so they just feed them died food.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.160
 So whenever you get an egg and it has a rich orange yolk,

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.880
 it does not taste better and it is not more nutritious.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.680
 It is probably in like 99% of cases.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.040
 It's that the farmer has basically put

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.640
 usually an additive or some dye in their food.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.280
 Sometimes if you're going organic, apparently they'll feed them

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.800
 marigold petals or red petals to help the carotenoids, you know,

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.400
 the stuff that dyes carrots and stuff orange to help them get into the egg.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.080
 I think that is a good sign, though.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.520
 If my farmer is willing to pick marigold petals

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.200
 in order to feed them to the chicken, it's going right.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.840
 Throwing the petals around so that the chickens have a really romantic evening.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.400
 You're right. Valentine's Day in the in the heart is a huge deal.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.840
 Very quickly on the hat itself, the 100 cleats hat.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.240
 Yeah. And so invented by Marie Antoine Karem,

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.120
 who was probably the predecessor to a scoffier who Andy mentioned earlier on,

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.520
 probably maybe the first celebrity chef, I would say.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.800
 I'm not sure. I can't think of anyone earlier.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.120
 But he had these big hats because he wanted to have authority.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.120
 And he thought the bigger and more erect your hat is the more people take you seriously.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.280
 And so the better a chef you were, the taller it was supposed to be.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.400
 And his was 18 inches in height.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.320
 Yeah. I mean, this is the man's like invention, clearly.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.760
 This is like, how can I make people respect me 18 inches? That's respect.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.200
 Yeah, I kind of think it was a bit of that.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.800
 Alexis Sawyer, who was around the same time, he was the chef of the reform club.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.120
 He wore a big black velvet beret with a huge tassel.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.920
 And the whole point of that was he was too important to cook with it.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.920
 He was like the head chef.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.400
 Everyone else, the sous chef and stuff, did all the work.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.520
 He was the big head chef.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.520
 And if he wore a hat that was too impractical to do any work,

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.560
 it showed that he was really important.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.840
 That's brilliant. That's so clever.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.600
 So, yeah, it's just too difficult for him to cook.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.960
 Therefore, he's the boss.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.880
 Pretty much. You should try it in the office, Andy.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.880
 Come into the office wearing sort of mittens and a balaclava.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.640
 And sunglasses, so I can't see any words in front of me.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.480
 And gaffer tape your mouth.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.960
 This is sounding better and better.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:33.960
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.760
 And that is James Harkin.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.560
 OK, my fact this week is that when men are played the sound of a baby crying,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.800
 if they're told it's a boy, they'll think it's in more pain

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.200
 than if they're told it's a girl.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.200
 Wow.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.360
 So what men think male babies are macho, is that?

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.880
 Yes, you've kind of got there, Andy, almost.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.880
 So this is a new study by researchers at the University of Sussex,

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.200
 the University of Leon Santetien and Hunter College City University in New York.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.560
 And what they did was they played a load of cries to men and women,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.640
 their parents, actually, and they asked them whether they thought

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.520
 the child was in pain or happy or sad or how much pain it was in, etc., etc.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:22.120
 And the thing is that before puberty, the voices of boys and girls,

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.880
 and especially babies, the cries of boys and girls are the same.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.600
 There's no difference in pitch.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:32.200
 But people, especially men, think that the male baby will have a deeper cry.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.400
 And so when they hear the cry, if it's high pitch, they think it's in more pain.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.880
 And because they expect the male baby to have a deeper cry,

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.000
 normally they think that the difference means that it's in more pain.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.520
 I think that's really funny that it's like, what's wrong with this child?

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.200
 And they expect to like bury white to come out of its mouth.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.000
 And it's a high pitch, high pitch squeal.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.480
 It's like, oh, my gosh, no, it's a baby.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.800
 There's nothing wrong with your child.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.560
 That's where it's the beard. Where's his beard?

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.440
 And yeah, it is quite funny.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.040
 The thing that the researchers say is it could have implications

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.840
 for the welfare of children, because it means that if a female child is crying,

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.240
 you might give it less attention than if a male child is crying.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.640
 Oh, this is why we have man flu then, clearly,

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.560
 because boys are so used to being given attention they don't need.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.840
 Or, you know, then they grow out to be like, oh, got a little cough.

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.360
 Oh, it's the flu. It's the flu.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.840
 Whereas girls are like, yeah, girls are going to work with like headless

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.000
 because that's fine. It's just a scratch.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.400
 Oh, my God, I think you might be hit on something there.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.600
 That feels right, doesn't it?

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.200
 Yeah, I thought it was that male parents say, you know,

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.040
 they'll they'll listen to the crying and they'll think,

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.440
 well, my baby boy wouldn't be making a fuss unless it was something really serious.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.240
 It wouldn't be disturbing me.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.480
 Well, that might be true as well,

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.640
 but this study was specifically about the pitch of the cells.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.880
 Well, so we just have to start complaining in a deeper voice

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.960
 in order to have people take notice of us.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.440
 No, you have to complain in a much, much, much higher voice

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.360
 to make up for the fact that you have a higher voice already.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.280
 Oh, sorry. Yeah, we have all we have to speak in deeper voices all the time.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.400
 And then the contrast to our high complain.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.120
 Don't go too high because then it will just be dogs that care.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:13.360
 Dogs are pretty comforting. I think that might work for me.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.960
 It's with the response to babies crying, right, that you get.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.480
 Well, I'm always told that once you become a mother, I guess, specifically,

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.400
 you have a very instinctive response to babies crying.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.840
 So I hear babies crying and I think that's a really horrible noise.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.360
 And I think, actually, there was a study on the noises people find most grating

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.560
 and babies crying was the worst.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.080
 But like, is there a difference?

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.840
 Do you find there was a difference once you had children, Athena,

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.080
 where like you hear a baby crying and like a bit of you dies?

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.880
 Yes. Or does it sound lovely?

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.520
 Does it suddenly sound wonderful?

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.440
 There's only one difference.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.640
 And that is when you hear the baby cry, you lactate.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.400
 That's the only difference really.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.280
 It never gets more or less annoying.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.720
 It just you just start leaking.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.480
 But yeah, there's definitely I think it's I mean, I would speculate

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.400
 it's evolution, isn't it?

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.000
 Because when it's what's really funny is babies have unique cries.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.880
 They all do. But sometimes you go out in public and there'll be a baby

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.880
 that sounds like your baby and that baby will make you lactate

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.480
 because it will just have a similar pitch or a sound.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.040
 Right. And I'll be like, oh, that sounds like that sounds like one of my kids.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.200
 And then it's, oh, dearie me, here we go again.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.840
 I forgot my pads.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.800
 Sorry, I can only apologise to any listeners who can hear the baby

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.360
 in the background and have spontaneously started lactating.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.880
 Lactation is so weird, though.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.840
 So there's tons of stuff I didn't know.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.680
 Like people can lactate when they're not mothers.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.360
 And this is really, really important in loads of societies.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.280
 And it seems to be quite under-researched.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.120
 So they're like hunter-gatherer societies where there's a lot more

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.520
 aloe parenting, where it's parenting in groups.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.760
 So there's not even really one specific caregiver.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.360
 Your baby will be cared for by maybe 12 different people.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.960
 And grandmothers will be able to lactate.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.960
 So they'll, and it's just by like having the nipples stimulated very often.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.440
 Women who have had a baby before at some point,

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.000
 they'll just lactate again so they can nurse their infants

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.640
 or your friend who's had a baby wants to nurse the infant.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.760
 Interesting. And the idea is that if you live in like a society,

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.720
 then it's useful for more than one person to be able to do that.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.720
 Right. Is that the idea?

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.440
 Yeah, I think it's a little bit of survival, wasn't as guaranteed.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.400
 So if your mum dies, then you can just latch on to someone else.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.680
 But also, I guess it's just a different way cultures develop.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.640
 Like the Aka people who are in Central Africa,

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.760
 I don't think we've talked about them before.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.560
 They're the ones who have fathers who spend as much time with the babies

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.600
 as the mothers, and they're totally interchangeable, their roles.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.280
 And they're always holding their kids.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.720
 So they're in contact with kids up to the age of one and a half

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.280
 for like 97 percent of the time they're either touching or holding.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.040
 And the fathers, when they're doing it, which will be about 50 percent of the time,

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.360
 they will let the babies suckle on their nipples.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.880
 So when the baby needs comforting, it just suckles on its father's teats.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.000
 At least there's a use for male nipples because they have no other function.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.480
 So exactly. That makes that makes a lot of sense.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.680
 There's a great fact about breastfeeding, which I found out first with the first baby.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.520
 If you do it continuously, it's a form of natural contraception.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.560
 You know that I didn't know that because you can't the idea.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.080
 You don't want to conceive children one after the other really quickly.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.960
 That's quite bad if you're like a woman and you've gone through pregnancy.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.520
 You want to kind of wait, give it, give yourself a bit of time.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.760
 You know what I mean? And the lactation helps you do that, which I didn't know.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.080
 That's really interesting.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.520
 It's smart. I feel like it's not guaranteed.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.160
 No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't bank on it.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.160
 I'd give yourself a safety net if I was used to anyone listening.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.520
 Like get yourself an insurance policy.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.600
 However, when I had my first, I didn't have a period for like a year.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.720
 Like, yeah, it was brilliant.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.520
 I was like, I'm going to breastfeed forever.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.360
 You know, it's kind of in the child's interest then to carry on breastfeeding

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.320
 because then there aren't any more children to kind of like use up the.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.920
 Oh, yeah, resources. Yeah. Yeah.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.720
 You don't want any bastard siblings.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.440
 That's why they want to keep latched on.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:08.000
 So, Athena, you were saying that you can really tell the difference

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.680
 between the cries of your baby and someone else's baby.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:16.520
 This is interesting because lots of animals and even lots of mammals

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.600
 can't tell the difference between their young and other animals.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.680
 So this was an experiment by someone called Susan Lingle

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.760
 where she played a deer through a speaker,

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.520
 the noise of other mammals' babies crying and, you know, making a noise.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.680
 And the deer cannot tell the difference.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.920
 So they will react very strongly to a baby deer, but also to a baby bat,

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.440
 a baby marmot, a baby eland.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.560
 It will just run. It's like, oh, no, there's a young mammal in trouble.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.840
 And this might be because, I mean, the reason is because mammals

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.840
 have the same larynx or really similar larynxes until puberty.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.280
 And then the difference between all the species kicks in.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.880
 But before puberty, basically, it's like spread betting.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.240
 You know, you parents need to respond to a cry

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.560
 which might be their child just in case it's their child in danger.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.200
 And so if it turns out to be a baby marmot, then, you know, well, such is life.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.040
 And it's useful for the child because then you might get some if you're in trouble.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.640
 You might, you know, you might be a dear Bambi sort of getting in trouble

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.800
 because there's some people coming trying to shoot you.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.520
 And then a friendly bat might come along to save you.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.640
 Well, you'd hope for a bear.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.920
 You'd be like, oh, man, I hope the bear would come.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.080
 That would be really useful.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.280
 But this does imply that if, you know, you're walking past a certain fox cub

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.200
 or something, Athena, then you might start lactating.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.160
 I would have thought that certain mammals could induce lactation

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.080
 in the same way that certain babies could, right?

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.520
 I hadn't considered that.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.400
 The neighbours have just got a new puppy.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.080
 You're in trouble.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.720
 So stock up on pads.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.080
 I'll have to go outside and I'll just say, get your dog out here for a second.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.440
 Let's do an experiment.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.160
 Let's see how that works.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.440
 Babble is a weird thing.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.000
 Baby's babble, right?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.960
 And that it kind of starts to imitate language, I guess.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.080
 And I think people can tell if babies are babbling in their own language.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.480
 So if I heard a five month old making nonsense noises,

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.560
 I should be able to tell whether it's an English speaker or a non-English speaker.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.960
 Because, again, they imitate the quality of the tone,

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.200
 the timbre of the voice in which they're speaking.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.520
 But it's really interesting because babies of deaf parents who speak sign language

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.200
 babble in sign language.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.960
 So whereas that you'll have like a five month old baby

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.200
 who doesn't know any sign language, has never seen sign language.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.400
 They'll just randomly clench their fists and like, play their hands out.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.360
 Sign language babies will kind of babble.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.360
 So they'll make signs a little bit like words,

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.640
 but that don't specifically mean anything yet.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.800
 But with like quite deliberate, like they're practicing trying to learn it.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.520
 But baby sign is a thing that you can teach your babies how to sign.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.000
 Right.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.920
 Like from about six months onwards, you can get them to tell you when they're hungry.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.680
 You can get them to tell you when they need to go toilet.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.440
 It takes like time and effort, but this is a true story.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.640
 And I keep, I didn't do it with my first song, it's going to be bothered.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.680
 But this one now, I was like, right,

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.960
 we're having such a hard time putting train in the first one.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.640
 I'm like, right, we're learning sign.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.400
 I'm doing it.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.920
 I'm investing 20 minutes a day in just, just tell me when you need to toilet.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.360
 That's all that's the only thing I want.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.040
 That's the only thing you need to say, isn't it?

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.000
 Everything else is fine, but it's distinctive as well.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.200
 So they're babies.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.200
 A lot of the time it's, you just have to learn what they're doing instinctively.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.520
 So apparently they, if a baby brings their fingers to their mouth, really easy one.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.760
 I'm hungry.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.960
 And there's another one which means I need a poo, which I've forgotten.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.720
 But it can be done.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.200
 I've been told I've been told I'm going to interview you in six months time.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.080
 You'll be interviewing the baby.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.840
 How about that?

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.720
 That is, I think you mentioned an email, Athena, and I've read this thing as well

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.800
 about potty training babies.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.440
 And I actually forgot to go back to it, but there are definitely people who don't

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.200
 believe in nappies at all.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.240
 And there's a way of potty training babies where you just kind of let them poo

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.120
 whenever they want to.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.840
 And you learn when it looks like they're going to poo.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.560
 And then you run them to the loo and you never have to use a nappy, which sounds great.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.440
 And there's a bunch of New York mothers who kind of do that.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.880
 And they say for the first month or two, you do get some poo on your carpet.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.040
 Sounds like a lot of jeopardy.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.360
 Yes.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.920
 But then you sort of train the babies to give you a sign when they're going to go

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.160
 to the loo, like you say, there'll be a sort of sign they use, whether they point

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.360
 at their bum, I don't know, do a little fart.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.880
 And then it's like you've got to run them to a toilet.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.240
 You have, yeah, laminate floors.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.840
 That's what I'd say for that one.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.040
 That's the real key.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.160
 If you haven't got laminate, I'd probably just get some pampers.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.920
 But nappies are really wasteful.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.920
 Like, I think a baby goes through, you know, in, well, first of all, in the 80s,

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.400
 babies used to put your train around 18 months.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.720
 Because at that point, because people used to use terry towels and things like that.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.120
 And terry towels get wet.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.280
 So babies are like, oh, this is horrible.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.360
 And they're like, you know what, let me get me on a toilet.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.240
 This is disgusting.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.560
 And they're also harder to crawl in.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.240
 So they're not as mobile, so uncomfortable.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.120
 But now we use kind of these nappies that are really comfortable.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.320
 So I understand they're comfortable.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.440
 They're really dry.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.320
 They make, they allow babies to be mobile.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.440
 The average age for training now is about between two and three.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.000
 So you're saying they've been indulged?

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.040
 Well, yeah, absolutely.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.000
 Well, indulge, obviously, to make more money for companies that make nappies.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.080
 But that's incredible, right?

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.080
 Like babies that used to train at 18 months now train at three years.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.840
 That's the supervillain plotline.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.800
 Do you want a company that's investing in making nappies so good

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.120
 that people never take them off?

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.480
 I know, that's what I was thinking.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.280
 There's new smart nappies that have just been invented by pampers.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.400
 They're called Lumi.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.000
 And I reckon once these are in, you're literally until you're in your early 20s,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.120
 you're going to be wearing those.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.040
 Is this where they text you, James?

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.720
 Well, they tell you, yeah.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.400
 They tell you they text the parents saying, I have checked myself.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.480
 If I'm so far from my baby that I need to be texted,

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.560
 that means someone, someone else's job.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.800
 I've paid the sitter to deal with that.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.040
 What is it to me for?

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.400
 You should just text the nearest phone, shouldn't it, to the baby?

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.920
 Yeah.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.520
 But then everyone, of course, because it's a smart thing,

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.720
 everyone's worried about hackers and that someone might hack possible.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.200
 What possible data can the hackers get that's going to help them on this?

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.200
 Unless they're working for Big Pampa and maybe.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.000
 Well, all it can really do is tell you how often this individual child

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.520
 shits themselves or pisses themselves.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.760
 But the idea could be that it might be attached to your phone

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.800
 and then using your phone, they might be able to get your bank details, maybe.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.360
 I feel it feels like a stretch.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.040
 It feels like if I was a hacker,

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.280
 this wouldn't be the first thing I would hack in order to get to the purse strings.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.200
 You know, yeah.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.640
 Getting bank details to a baby's bottom doesn't feel round about way.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:42.600
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.080
 And that is my fact.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.680
 My fact this week is that traditional Ethiopian households

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:52.080
 can spend up to nine hours a day on coffee ceremonies.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.680
 Wow. Now I know what you're thinking.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.400
 Come on, no, no. That's what I'm thinking.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.440
 They wouldn't get anything done.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.200
 So I should specify, I asked far too many people about this.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.800
 I actually ended up interviewing four separate people

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.000
 who have lived in Ethiopia or Ethiopian.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.760
 And basically coffee ceremonies are a massive part of life in Ethiopia.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.720
 And they can last up to three hours.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.400
 So the first hour is roasting the coffee

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.560
 and then you kind of grind it and make it.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.480
 And then it's all about sitting around, having a chat, debating politics.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.680
 What have you.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.120
 And so you'll do that.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.800
 And then particularly in rural places, you might do it three times a day.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.240
 So breakfast, lunch and dinner time.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:39.440
 Now, you probably aren't doing it three times a day every day for three hours

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.760
 because you wouldn't be able to hold down a job.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.680
 No, maybe they have like a Nespresso machine for day to day stuff.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.080
 And then for the special occasions, they do the three hour thing.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.480
 No. Yeah. Yeah.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.520
 Maybe it's a lockdown thing, you know, it's a lockdown.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.240
 You might as well spend nine hours a day.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.960
 Yeah, you're right. It's a good idea.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.480
 How how do we fill our time?

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.400
 Let's drag this out for a while.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.600
 The queues at Starbucks in Ethiopia must be absolutely enormous.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.000
 Can you imagine if there's one person in front of you that's two days away?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.760
 And after all that time, they still get your name wrong.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.520
 Three hours. Come on.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.800
 I suppose one guy who runs this place called Kaffa Coffee,

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.360
 which is actually this really nice Ethiopian coffee.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.360
 Would like Van in Dulston.

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.680
 Anyway, he was great.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.680
 So he was I was asking him about it and holding up the queue behind me.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.040
 And he was saying that actually how it would work where he was from anyway,

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.080
 is that you'd be in your village and you would hear the first person

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.280
 to get up and start roasting the beans because it makes a really loud noise.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.520
 You've got a very, very hot pan.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.720
 And when the beans crash onto it, they really crackle at first.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.480
 And once you hear that person, you're like, OK, someone else is doing the coffee today.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.400
 I don't have to. And you're bringing your leftovers from the night before from the meal.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.520
 If you've got some bread left over and you'll sort of swap that for some coffee

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.880
 and hang out doing that.

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.000
 So that makes more sense.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.800
 Like it's not every single household is doing that many times a day.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.600
 Well, Kaffa actually is the name of the region, isn't it?

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.320
 In Ethiopia, where coffee originated, I think.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.040
 And actually, it's where we and almost every country in the world

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.760
 gets the word for coffee is from this place, Kaffa.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.000
 Wow. Makes sense.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.880
 We have said before, just in case there's a pedant out there that coffee originated

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.240
 in Yemen and there is some hot debate between those two countries about it.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.440
 And I think you can engage with that, if you want.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:30.840
 What I think and, you know, I don't want to get into a conflict

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.280
 with the Yemenis or the Ethiopians, but I think the coffee plants

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:38.120
 was really found in Ethiopia, but then modern day coffee.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:42.040
 Actually, not even modern day coffee, but, you know, early modern coffee

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.400
 came from Yemen to drink.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.520
 That sounds right.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.920
 Well, it sounds like you're determined to not pick a side in this conflict.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.440
 Quite cool in this coffee ceremony as well.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.520
 The traditional ceremony has three rounds.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.600
 And the first round is where you get your strongest cup

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.600
 and then you re pour the water.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.480
 So it's a weaker cup for the second round.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.320
 And then the weakest is the last round.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.080
 And they're called Abol Tona and Bereka.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.280
 And that is, according to their legend, the name of the three goats

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.760
 who invented coffee, according to Ethiopian legend.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.200
 Again, I did ask this guy and he was like, yeah, yeah, the goats.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.960
 They're the names of the goats.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.960
 And the idea is that like over a thousand years ago,

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.280
 a goat herder saw his goats acting all jumpy and twitchy and weird.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.880
 And then he saw that they'd eaten these cherries sitting next to them.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.360
 And they were the coffee cherries.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.960
 And so he brought them to some monks.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.880
 See, this is just like the eggs.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.880
 It's just like the thousand year egg being discovered completely by mistake.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.760
 No one is ever willing to admit I grew a plant

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.320
 and I experimented with hundreds of ways of cooking it.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.640
 And this is the one I discovered.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.240
 It's my work that's done this.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.000
 It's always always a magic plant

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.840
 and the goats happen to be sprightly.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.960
 What makes me laugh about that story is that he saw his goats for dancing.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.040
 He was like, I want what they're having.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:33:00.320
 I wouldn't go near it personally myself, but thank goodness that person did.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.720
 Exactly.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:05.120
 The mind of a great inventor always wants to mimic the dancing goat.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.520
 Have you guys heard of the women's petition against coffee?

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:15.080
 This was a pamphlet that was published in England in 1674.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.120
 And it was at a time when coffee was quite controversial

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:23.960
 because coffee houses, as I think Anna said, they allow discussion of all sorts.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.360
 Politics is one thing.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.480
 So, you know, you might be discussing politics

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.040
 and you might decide that you don't like the king very much or whatever.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.600
 So political discussion was dangerous.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.960
 And anyway, this women's petition against coffee was published in 1674,

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.760
 which claimed all sorts of stuff.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.160
 It said coffee makes a man as unfruitful as the deserts

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.680
 whence that unhappy berry is said to be brought.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.200
 So it sort of damages men's fertility.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.560
 Or that when a woman approaches the nuptial bed

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.640
 expecting a man that should answer the vigor of her flames,

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:57.440
 she why should she only meet a bed full of bones and hug a meagre useless corpse?

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.240
 Strong stuff about coffee.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.440
 But I know the weird thing is it probably wasn't by women.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.440
 It's written in a way which implies that it's written by a man,

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.880
 sort of ventriloquizing women, like, oh, it makes men so gossipy.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.160
 They're more gossipy than us women who are writing this petition.

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.960
 It's in that kind of vein.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:20.520
 And also, was it in the petition, the thing about meeting an old skeleton corpse in bed?

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.840
 That was in the petition.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.560
 Yeah. See, that doesn't sound like a woman to me.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.840
 It's like a relief if what you're meeting is sort of skeletal mess.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.000
 He doesn't want to do anything.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.520
 That sounded very much a man.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.320
 And also, coffee is supposed to make you live longer.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.760
 So you're less likely to meet a skeleton.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.200
 He'll be full of life.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.320
 And these are all these are all arguments against the women's petition.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.560
 I also thought if you drank lots of coffee, you turned into George Clooney.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.400
 Is that not that's what TV's taught me?

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.720
 Yeah, that's right. Keep drinking it, James.

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.400
 Keep going.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.600
 You're nearly there.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.360
 Is that right? I'm doing nine hours a day, so I shouldn't be right now.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.160
 That or Anthony Head, do you remember his old adverts?

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.600
 Oh, yeah, of course.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.200
 Anthony Head, is he the guy from Buffy?

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.400
 Yeah.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:07.120
 Yeah, but he's the guy from the Nescafé sexy couple flirting adverts, really.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.960
 Yeah, that does ring a bell.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.600
 He was quite an anxious character in Buffy, so a bad person to advertise coffee.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.560
 Whereas George Clooney is much more chill.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.480
 That's true, but why do you think he was anxious, Anna?

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.720
 Is that delicious Nescafé, isn't it?

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.640
 He was off his head on Nescafé all the time.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.760
 Yeah, that's what it was, all withdrawing.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.720
 So coffee withdrawal is a thing, which I don't drink enough coffee.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.880
 I don't think to get serious withdrawal, but you've quit before, Andy, haven't you?

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.800
 I've quit. I'm currently quit.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.640
 You're currently quit.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.560
 You seem like you've got the shakes.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.760
 You've been very old.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.840
 Is that is that why?

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.160
 Have you ever been you've never been properly on it, though?

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.160
 Have you or have you?

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:41.600
 No, I was.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.400
 I was for years and years.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.840
 I just drinking several a day.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.160
 And then when you stop, you just have a headache for two weeks.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.000
 And then and then that's that.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 Yeah, I can vouch for that.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.560
 I quit drinking coffee.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.440
 That it's very inconsistently advice.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.560
 Some people say you can't you can have coffee when you're pregnant.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.840
 Some people can say you can't.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.120
 But I just quit anyway.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.920
 I thought I'd quit and then my teeth has not been yellow.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.520
 Because that would be the advantage and I got a headache.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.800
 Yeah, you feel well when you stop drinking that as much caffeine as you used to.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.000
 Absolutely.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.440
 Did you feel less awake or less alert or less focused or anything?

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.920
 Yeah, but that's what we do to the fact I was growing up human, you know?

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.920
 Like, to be honest, I started drinking coffee again recently.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.320
 And I think it's all a bit of mythology video.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.680
 I don't think it makes you any more alert or awake.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.800
 I just think you just get a bit attached to the kind of your brain

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.760
 getting a bit wired, you know?

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.400
 But I'm not I'm not more productive when I'm like, I'm not more productive

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.600
 when I'm shaking like a leaf.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.400
 If anything, I'm less productive.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.600
 Well, some people, it does seem to work for some people.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.280
 I kind of agree.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:44.280
 It makes me twitchy and endlessly Google weird health symptoms wrong with me

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.920
 rather than do actual work.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.000
 But Michael Pollan, who's the brilliant food writer

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.800
 who wrote a book called Caffeine, which is an audio book, actually.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:56.880
 He is a huge coffee fan and he quit while writing the book

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.160
 and it almost ruined the actual book, which I like a book on caffeine

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.320
 was almost destroyed by caffeine withdrawal.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:07.880
 But he basically said that he felt like he wasn't in writing in his first language anymore.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.280
 Everything was so like words didn't hang together properly.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.520
 There was this fog between him and reality.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.760
 He lost all confidence and he thought this whole book is a completely stupid idea.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.000
 I'm going to stop writing it.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.040
 I mean, that is a symptom of writing a book.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:26.360
 I think he might be blaming the coffee so that he can plug his book about coffee.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.840
 Yeah, that literally sounds like imposter syndrome.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:34.200
 You old cynics, I felt sorry for him.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.520
 No, I didn't.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.480
 But he did tell me why coffee apparently does keep you awake,

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.400
 which again, I've always thought it sends me to sleep.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:46.440
 But I didn't know that it was that we basically have a neurotransmitter,

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.520
 like a chemical which sends your body a signal, which is called adenosine,

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.960
 which is what tells you to go to sleep.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.480
 So it slots into a little receptor in your body,

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.520
 which is just the right size for it.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.800
 And tells you to go to sleep.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.800
 And caffeine, the chemical, is exactly the right shape to fit into that receptor.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.920
 So when you drink caffeine, it slips into there ahead of the sleep chemical.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.920
 And so it stops the sleep chemical getting in.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.280
 So it just doesn't tell your body to go to sleep.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.520
 That's really clever.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.320
 Yeah, it's so cool, isn't it?

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.240
 I didn't know that.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.760
 Do you think, OK, here's a question for you.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.600
 Do you think you can flush out caffeine by drinking decaf?

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.600
 No, no, no, no, no.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.960
 Well, you can't. You're all right in your assumption.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.960
 Is that a thing?

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.000
 What? I was just checking.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.200
 I read this online and I thought, well, that seems very obvious and basic to me.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.040
 But I was hoping one of you would fall into my incredibly obvious trap.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.120
 Wait, let me tell you. Well done.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.880
 Did you ask, like, so somebody would drink a cup of like caffeinated coffee

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.360
 and then drink a decaf and think that balances it out?

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.320
 That's like having a gin and tonic and then having a Coke and being like,

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.160
 I'm fine to drive.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:55.320
 No, no, don't worry. I've had 15 Cokes.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.760
 They make a lot of coffee.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.400
 They grow a lot of coffee in Mastnik, the island.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.320
 And the story of how they did that is really interesting.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.040
 There was a naval officer called Gabrielle DeCleur.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.560
 And he decided, why is that funny?

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.760
 It's a funny name.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.680
 It just sounded like you'd seen a long name when you'd given up on it.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:20.680
 Maybe I was doing like some French babbling or something.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.360
 Gabrielle DeCleur.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.320
 And he decided that he was going to take a plant from Paris

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.600
 because they had some in the Royal Gardens there.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.000
 And he was going to take it down to Martinique and grow some coffee

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.840
 plantations down there.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.800
 But the king didn't really want to give him any of his coffee plants

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.240
 because they were really valuable.

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:46.200
 So he kind of sneaked in and stole a little seedling from the Royal Garden.

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.760
 And then he decided to go to Martinique,

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.880
 which is a long, long way away from Paris.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.640
 First of all, he was caught in a storm and then they got attacked by pirates.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:00.000
 And all the time he's got this tiny little coffee plant that he's looking after.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.160
 There was a spy from the Netherlands who went after him

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:04.760
 and tried to kill his seedling.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.680
 Just one seedling he had.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.280
 One little seedling, one little plant.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.240
 That's so funny.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.040
 And this little plant, like the spy, came and tried to kill him.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.840
 They, because he was at sea for a long time, they didn't have much rations.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.480
 And so he took his tiny bit of water that he was allowed to drink

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.200
 and he would share it with his seedling to keep it alive.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.280
 And then he got it to Martinique and planted it.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.880
 And 50 years later, there were 80 million coffee trees on Martinique.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.760
 I can't even look after my yucca.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.040
 And even after a coffee plant on a boat.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.280
 Good for him. Good for him.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:41.600
 I think that has the makings of a great film where it's one man and his seedling.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.400
 And, you know, he's on the boat

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.800
 and all the other sailors are looking hungrily at the seedling.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.920
 And they look at it and turns it into a big leg of ham before them or whatever.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:53.760
 I can't believe you didn't even bring a spare.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.800
 Take two.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.600
 I can't believe that Andy, when he becomes a film director,

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.520
 his kind of film will have people looking at things

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.840
 and then turning into massive hams.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.920
 It's strongly based on the cut, the Looney Tunes.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.400
 I can't see you getting many Oscar nominations for that kind of movie.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.360
 We'll see. We'll see.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:17.920
 When the best ham category is launched thanks to my extensive lobbying campaign

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.720
 and the winner for 10 years, the road, John Ham.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:25.240
 One more thing.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:30.000
 The coffee filter was invented by a woman called Melita Benz.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.480
 And she, according to her son, you'll love this, Andy,

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.520
 because I know you love your origin stories.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.200
 She's trying to come up with a way of making coffee.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.000
 And she just got really frustrated

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.120
 and ripped out a page of her son's notebook from school

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.040
 and stuck it in an old tin pot.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.520
 And it just happened to make this perfect coffee.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.800
 And she decided that, go on.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.120
 I I like that story because it's an innovator

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.880
 thinking of looking at her environment, coming up with a thing and adapting it.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.560
 If it if it was going with the classic format, it would be

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.200
 she was trying to pour her coffee.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.640
 And unfortunately, her son dropped his notebook

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.360
 and a leaf was torn out and landed on top of the cup.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.240
 And when she poured it, it caught all the ground.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.480
 You go, oh, my God.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.040
 So I've applauded Melissa Benz for this.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.040
 OK, fair enough.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:19.440
 Well, during World War Two, the company stopped making any filters

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.960
 and started making supplies for the Nazis.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.240
 Oh, OK.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.600
 When I said I applauded Melita Benz, I'd like to I'd like to clarify.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.720
 What for a point?

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.840
 Well, you don't applaud her, Andy, because after the war,

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:36.840
 she started a program that compensated victims of a Nazi's forced labor policy.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.920
 All right. When I said I didn't approve of her, I'd like to clarify.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.360
 Again.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:46.880
 Coffee was officially blessed in the 17th century by the Catholic Church

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.840
 because the Pope liked it and you could do that.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.640
 So it was kind of thought as an evil drink.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:58.680
 It started in in Africa or in Yemen somewhere and they all drink it around there.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.560
 Then it got up into the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.800
 Everyone's drinking it.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.040
 So then it came over to Catholic Europe and everyone went, well,

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.400
 it's the drink of the infidel.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:14.160
 And then Pope Clement VIII tasted some and thought, right, I love this.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.400
 What am I going to do?

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.240
 Because everyone's saying this is the invention of Satan.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.200
 It's awful. So he said, look, it's so delicious.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.800
 It would be awful to just let the infidels have use of it.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:28.240
 Let's trick Satan and bless it so we turn it into a Christian drink.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.800
 And he did.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.080
 And that's why you go to heaven if you drink coffee.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.240
 But that's really interesting.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.800
 Something I realised, I didn't really realise this is how popular coffee is.

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.040
 There's only one thing that's drunk more regularly than coffee and that's water.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.480
 It's literally the second most popular drink in the world.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.760
 Wow.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.080
 Which is incredible because it doesn't taste that nice.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.720
 I thought it might be Ribena or.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:54.200
 But it's the second which means that humans,

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.720
 we're doing something wrong in life for us to be needed so much caffeine in our life.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.040
 Like we need to introduce siestas all around the world, basically.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.760
 This is this is what we need.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.400
 You're right, because it doesn't taste nice.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.840
 Whatever anyone's claiming.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.080
 We are just doing it in order to keep ourselves awake.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.520
 Let's just start sleeping more.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.320
 The idea of a Ribena based society.

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:18.320
 I think it's less sexy if Anthony Head from Buffy is knocking on his neighbour's door at night

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.440
 saying have you got any Bina?

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.800
 But he would be dressed like a massive Ribena berry, wouldn't he?

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.080
 Why is that not sexy?

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.080
 His little arm sticking out.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:33.280
 I don't know, George Clooney and that's still sexy.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.560
 I think we could all agree.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:45.120
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the week and that is Andy.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:49.640
 My fact is that the 18th century grammarian, Alexander the Corrector,

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:54.040
 carried a sponge wherever he went just in case he spotted any offensive graffiti.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.200
 He sounds great.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.120
 He's my hero.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.200
 He was a Scottish author.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:06.200
 His name was Alexander Crudden, C-I-U-D-E-N.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.440
 He was an author, proofreader and...

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:12.280
 You could see why he sort of changed his mnemonic to the Corrector, can't you?

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.880
 Yeah, he was a bookseller.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.760
 He was a stationer.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.000
 He was eccentric, definitely.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.360
 He was famous for having written a concordance to the Bible,

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.080
 which is an index of the Bible.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.120
 We'll get on to that later.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.280
 But also he carried...

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.720
 Let's get on to it now.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.720
 Yeah, come on, OK.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.120
 He wrote an index to the Bible.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.280
 He wrote a verbal index of the Bible.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.400
 So he took every single word of the King James Bible,

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.520
 apart from "the" and "of" and really sort of nuts and bolts ones.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:47.920
 Every single other word, you know, "shoe" or "ham" or whatever, he made an index.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.800
 "Ham" is a good one because the son of Noah was called Ham.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.040
 Son of Noah, I knew you were going to bring it up.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:56.640
 I don't know if "ham" and "ham" would have different entries in the Corrector.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.440
 I suspect a word.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.440
 He knew what he was doing.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.640
 Yeah, it's three times as long as the actual Bible.

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.280
 And it just tells you which words appear where in the Bible.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.680
 That's like only the really hardcore fans read that one.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.520
 It's like people who've read the Silmarillion over Lord of the Rings, isn't it?

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.320
 Oh, you might have read the Bible, but...

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.840
 Have you read it in alphabetical order?

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.880
 Such a weird thing to do.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.160
 It took him 12 years, didn't it?

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.160
 Unsurprising.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:25.800
 And it was like all of the word "all", for instance, he recorded.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.480
 So he included some pretty relevant words in there.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.280
 But the thing is, the Bibles are ready index.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.400
 It's like Proverbs, Mark, John, Luke.

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.000
 Like it's already in sections.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.640
 Yeah, it's in chapters, you're right.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.480
 You know, you're making the classic mistake of confusing contents and index.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.520
 And Alejandro, the Corrector, would be turning in his grave right now.

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.520
 You'd be corrected.

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.600
 Dan wouldn't have done that.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.600
 Dan wouldn't.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.320
 It's taken this long for us to feel his loss.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:55.320
 Yeah, he was weird.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.560
 So he didn't like grammar mistakes either.

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:01.240
 He didn't like grammar mistakes and he didn't like offensive graffiti.

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:05.800
 And he had his own very idiosyncratic interpretation of what offensive was.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:10.080
 So he didn't like the number 45, which at the time, lots of people were writing...

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.440
 That was the main one, wasn't it?

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.160
 The number 45 was the main thing that he hated the most.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.280
 He only liked LPs, didn't he?

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.280
 He didn't like...

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.680
 Maybe he predicted...

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.800
 Did he predict Donald Trump's presidency and hated that?

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.800
 That's exactly it.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.800
 He hated that.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.160
 It's nothing to do with that.

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:29.000
 It's because of John Wilkes, the radical.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.360
 John Wilkes was a radical author at the time and he had written a work attacking the monarchy,

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:39.600
 which had been published in issue number 45 of a magazine called The North Britain, which

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.120
 published, you know, exciting political content.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.560
 So 45 became a bit of a rallying cry for anti-monarchists at the time.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.640
 People would write 45 on walls and doors and floors and things like that.

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:53.640
 But if Alexander the Corrector spotted it with his sponge, he'd get rid of it immediately.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.280
 What do you think he would do if, like, just your house number was number 45?

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.240
 I don't know.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.360
 And you've got 45 when you've really been.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:03.360
 Yeah.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:07.640
 And just not even looking at it and he keeps coming round and, like, taking it off.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.640
 Like, "No!"

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:09.640
 That's a good point.

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:10.640
 That's a good point.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:16.520
 Also, the Jacobite raising was 1745, which was another reason why they used this name.

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.520
 Yeah.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.720
 That's why he did it in that issue.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.720
 He waited.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.480
 He printed 44 issues of this pointless magazine, so he'd get to 45 and make an

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.120
 obscure reference.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.720
 He was an Iliest.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.440
 Do you guys know what an Iliest is?

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.440
 Oh.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.440
 No.

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.440
 You want to guess?

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.160
 Oh, did he like the Iliad?

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.160
 I would guess that.

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.160
 Yeah.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.160
 That's a good guess.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.160
 Did he like Ili Coffee?

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.160
 That's a coffee brand, yes.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.160
 Yeah.

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.600
 That's actually closer because that's the correct spelling.

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:46.680
 So you're definitely getting warmer, but still quite cold, so I'm going to tell you.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:49.680
 An Iliest is someone who always refers to themselves in the third person.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.080
 So it's like, "Ile", it from Lassen, I-Double-L-E.

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.080
 Okay.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.080
 I hate him.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.080
 Yeah.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.000
 I just, I just, you've said it all.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.160
 He's a grammar police, which, you know, he'd be good on Twitter.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.160
 Yeah.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:05.280
 He keeps getting my really bins nicked, and he speaks in third person.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.280
 I can't stand the man.

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.280
 Yeah.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.280
 He's not likable.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.800
 He wasn't popular at the time either, to be fair.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:14.200
 You're matching the opinion of him then because he was, he was institutionalised

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:18.760
 several times, and there's lots of debate over whether, you know, was he really ill,

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:23.320
 or Henson being put in an institution, or was he being put there by his enemies?

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:28.200
 And there's a biographer called Julia Kay, who argues that he was put away not because

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.200
 he was ill.

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:34.280
 And I mean, he sounds pretty eccentric, sounds pretty out there, but on one occasion, he

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:39.160
 was put away by, I think the brother of a woman he was trying to propose to or trying

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.760
 to marry, but he had discovered that the woman he was trying to propose to was sleeping with

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:47.960
 her own brother, and he raised a big old stink about this, and then was putting an asylum

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:48.960
 for it.

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:49.960
 Yeah.

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.320
 So that was the first time, but then later on, he was putting an asylum for unwelcome

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:58.080
 attentions to a widow, and then another time for attacking a man with a shovel, and then

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:06.520
 a third time for, he formed an emotional attachment to a woman without even having met her first.

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:11.680
 And he then called himself, instead of Alexander the Corrector, Alexander the Conqueror, and

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:17.600
 decided that this woman was his predestined partner in life, and tried to get together

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.840
 with her, even though she didn't know who he was.

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:20.840
 Okay.

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:21.840
 All right.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:22.840
 I mean...

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.800
 But that first time, it was just an eccentric thing.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:28.400
 But there is, like in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, they think that they

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.480
 say that that first time is what kind of threw him over the edge a little bit, and from then

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.480
 on...

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.480
 Yeah.

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:40.400
 Well, he wanted to regulate private madhouses, and supposedly the fact he didn't manage to

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.280
 improve private madhouse regulation made him very depressed, which then meant he was sent

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.280
 to bedlam again.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:49.040
 Although, as James points out, hitting people with a shovel and forming unwelcome attachments

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.840
 to women will also do it.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.400
 That'll do the trick.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.400
 So he was complicated.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.800
 He wasn't an unproblematic fave, is what I'm trying to say.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.800
 Fair.

00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.800
 Fair assessment.

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:02.880
 But I'm impressed that in those days, you were able to form attachments to people you

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.760
 hadn't met romantically, pre-internet.

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.760
 How are you doing that?

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.760
 I see what you mean.

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:12.560
 It was the daughter of Sir Thomas Abney of Newington, who was the Lord Mayor of London.

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:17.960
 So basically, he'd heard of the Lord Mayor's daughter, possibly seen her in some periodicals,

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.840
 and decided that that was his future wife.

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:26.680
 He called her Princess Elizabetha and said that her home was a place called Silesia,

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:27.960
 which he would besiege.

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:32.360
 I have the same thing about Daniel Craig, you know.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.280
 So I think that's fine.

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:39.200
 Are you planning to besiege Daniel Craig's house?

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.160
 Because it's probably a public service we're doing.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.160
 No, it's not.

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.160
 It's our house.

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.160
 We live together.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:49.280
 It's been our happy spousal home for a few years now, actually.

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:55.480
 Opens the door, dressed as a massive black currant, trying to make Rhybeena for you.

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:58.880
 Yeah, so that's Alexander.

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:03.940
 So on, I should say he's an Ilias, sorry, just to go a long way back to him referring

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:08.080
 to himself in the third person, because I wouldn't want you to think badly of him.

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.560
 I don't know if he did it in speech.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:14.400
 He just did it in the book he wrote, which I read Decent Portion of, which had the catchy

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:19.080
 title, "The Corrector's Earnest Address to the Inhabitants of Great Britain, showing

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:23.960
 that the late earthquakes and the fact we are at war with a powerful nation are allowed

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:29.120
 to call from divine providence for a speedy and thorough reformation," actually it actually

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.120
 goes on.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:34.040
 But it was basically saying, "Look, we've had some earthquakes, we're at war.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:38.240
 This is clearly because you guys aren't abiding by my grammatical correction."

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.200
 And that whole thing, he refers to a lot of stuff that's happened in his life, but he

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.160
 always calls himself the "corrector."

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:48.640
 He would write pamphlets as well, called things like "Mr Crudham Greatly Injured"

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:53.460
 or "The Adventures of Alexander the Corrector," which is practically a comic book, writing

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:56.480
 a pamphlet about yourself and calling it "The Adventures of."

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.480
 It is.

00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.920
 And then I think that was just about how his sister tried to have him sectioned or had

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.920
 him sectioned.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.960
 So it's disappointing if you think you're getting an adventure book and you get an

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.200
 annoying sibling rivalry.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.680
 Yeah, imagine if the Avengers were like that.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:13.760
 It was just Iron Man's brother stealing his trainers, like, "Get your own shoes."

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:19.200
 Captain America turns up with his sponge, yeah.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:25.280
 So on graffiti, some stuff on that, I was going through my old files and stuff on graffiti

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:31.240
 and the ancient Roman graffiti seemed to so often be about discouraging public excretion.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:37.600
 So Roman graffiti includes the phrase, "Anybody urinating here will incur the wrath of Mars."

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:43.720
 It's to the one defecating here, "Beware the curse and shit with comfort and good cheer

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.720
 so long as you don't do it here."

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.720
 Wow.

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.640
 And so it seems like graffiti in those days was doing a public good.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.960
 Yeah, it's like no ball games kind of thing, isn't it?

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.320
 It's just trying to stop people from doing bad things around your house.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.320
 Exactly.

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.960
 No turning in this driveway.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:01.720
 That's my favorite one that people put up.

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.800
 This gate's permanently in use.

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:04.800
 Permanently in use.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.800
 If it was permanently in use, I couldn't read the sign.

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.800
 Get out of here.

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:14.800
 I was in a really beautiful place in Cotswold recently going for a walk on my own in a wood

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:19.200
 and there was a massive tree and it was like, and it's Cotswold's, you know, it's like

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:24.800
 David Cameron territory and like Bluebellwood and someone had carved in giant capital letters

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.800
 into the tree, Millwall.

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.840
 I just thought, "That is so great.

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:32.920
 I'm so glad Millwall fans are going that far afield to make their stuff."

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:38.400
 And then it said, "Get your parliamentary favours here, call Dave on 01."

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.560
 Well, that would still be relevant when this goes out, probably.

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.560
 Definitely.

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.560
 It will keep it relevant.

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:45.560
 We'll keep it in the news.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:49.160
 I've seen some celebrity graffiti, which is very exciting.

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.440
 I saw something that Lord Byron wrote.

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.440
 Really?

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:57.280
 There's a place in Greece called the Temple of Poseidon and he carved his name really

00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:04.960
 big and florid into the column of this 4,000-year-old temple, which is pretty disrespectful.

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:09.960
 But it's surrounded by other names because it was just the thing you did at the time.

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:10.960
 Byron does it.

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:11.960
 It's kind of okay, isn't it?

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:14.720
 I bet the council got really pissed off with all the other people who did it, but when

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:15.720
 Byron...

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.760
 Yeah, he's like the Banksy of the 19th century.

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:18.760
 You're right.

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:19.760
 You're right.

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:20.760
 Yeah.

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:25.760
 That Banksy, he did a load of graffiti just in Waterloo, in that tunnel in Waterloo.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.760
 I don't know if you remember.

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.880
 It's like one of the first things.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:33.640
 And then I went to see it when it happened and then we started filming QI and I saw

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:34.640
 it right at the start.

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.560
 By the time we finished filming it, it had already been covered, I think, three or four

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:39.600
 times by other people putting graffiti on.

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:40.600
 And that was kind of the point.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:46.040
 He was like, "This is now a graffiti place and just put whatever you want here."

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:50.920
 But we've come up with a new way of using hydrogel, which is like this amazing kind

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:51.920
 of substance.

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:56.080
 And you put it on the wall and it just sticks to the top covering of paint.

00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:00.960
 And it can take that off and you can see the graffiti that's underneath that graffiti.

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:01.960
 No.

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:06.000
 So, in theory, you could keep going, taking layers and layers and layers off this, I think

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.920
 it's called leaky passage or something, isn't it?

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:08.920
 Leaky tunnel or something.

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:09.920
 I think you're right.

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.920
 Yeah.

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.200
 And you'll be able to get to the Banksy's again.

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.200
 That would be awesome.

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:15.200
 Cool.

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.880
 I used to work for Camden Council and Banksy did some graffiti on the side of a shop.

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:23.640
 And I used to work in a street team that used to do with waste and street cleaning.

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.720
 Obviously, our guys cleaned that off, right?

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:27.520
 And the shop owners tried to sue Camden.

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:31.760
 They were like, "You got rid of a Banksy, we're going to cover it with glass and like

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:32.760
 make loads of money."

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:33.760
 I don't know how that's so funny.

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.400
 I find it really incredible that the point of graffiti is that it sort of lives out

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.400
 in public.

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.920
 But now because it's because of capitalism, people are like, "No, no, we're going to

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.920
 preserve that.

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:46.560
 We're going to get perspex on it and we're going to make it get rich off of it, which

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.560
 is hilarious."

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.120
 I can't believe you were, that's always reported on.

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:52.720
 I can't believe you were one of those people who cleaned a Banksy off.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.320
 It always creates this massive controversy, doesn't it?

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.960
 And Banksy's just there in the sidelines, chuckling away.

00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:01.880
 But whenever Banksy does anything, Athena goes along with her sponge, doesn't she?

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:02.880
 Yes.

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:07.840
 Well, not just Banksy, everybody.

00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:13.080
 Can I correct some, just correct some grammar broadly before we finish?

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.080
 Which is...

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.840
 Whose grammar are you going to correct?

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.360
 This thing that I'm pointing to here.

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.360
 Bicep.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.360
 What is it?

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.360
 I'd say bicep.

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.360
 Yeah, bicep.

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.360
 That's really incorrect, guys.

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:24.360
 Oh, God.

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.360
 This is not a bicep.

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.360
 This is a biceps.

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:31.760
 And whenever you hear someone refer to a singular bicep, you can correct them and stick that

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:32.760
 S on the end.

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:37.200
 Biceps literally means two-headed, two-biceps-headed.

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:40.080
 There are always two heads, it's never just unicep.

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.080
 Wow.

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.480
 And it's just because the muscle's got two, like, connecting bits.

00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:45.480
 James, you've just been paninode.

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:47.800
 I can't believe it.

00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:48.800
 I...

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:49.800
 That was an amazing moment.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:54.320
 Well, if Anna didn't have such impressive biceps, then maybe I wouldn't have done...

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:57.080
 Yeah, I drew you off your game with that.

00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:02.760
 You said bicep implying that you think they're so small, it only qualifies as one.

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:03.760
 Good point.

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:04.760
 Yeah.

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:05.760
 There's only one on each side.

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.360
 So you have to say I pulled my left biceps, as opposed to...

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.360
 Exactly.

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.360
 Hmm.

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.360
 Even if you pulled your right one.

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.600
 No, that's not true.

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.000
 I just pulled mine guns.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:21.560
 I've won all of that.

00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.400
 OK, that's all of our facts.

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.000
 Thank you so much for listening, everybody.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.560
 We will be back again next week.

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.080
 If you're lucky, you might get another guest.

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:33.200
 If you're unlucky, you might get Dan Shriver back.

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:38.120
 But until then, you can find these guys on their Twitter accounts, James.

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:39.120
 At James Harkin.

00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:40.120
 Andi.

00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.120
 At Andrew Hunter M.

00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:42.120
 Athena.

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.120
 Have you got Twitter?

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.120
 I do.

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.120
 I do.

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.120
 I think they can learn new.

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.920
 And you can contact me by emailing podcast@QI.com.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:52.380
 You can also go to our website, no such thing as a fish.com, to listen to all our other

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:59.460
 episodes, pick up a hoodie, or a cap, or a vinyl, whatever bit of merch you like.

00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:03.040
 And you can also book tickets to the podcast stop festival show we're going to be doing.

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.680
 So go to QI.com/FishEvents for that.

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.720
 OK, thanks so much for listening, everyone.

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:09.400
 We'll see you again next week.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:16.400
 Bye.

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.980
 (upbeat music)
