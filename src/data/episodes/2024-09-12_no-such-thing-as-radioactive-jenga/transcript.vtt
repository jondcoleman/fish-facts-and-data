00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.340
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.980
 of No Such Things as a Fish.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.400
 It is our summer audience facts special.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.580
 So we're gonna be going through all of our mail bag

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.720
 to find the best facts that you have sent in.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.140
 Because right now Dan, we're not in the office, are we?

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.000
 - No, we are on the road.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.720
 We are doing our 10 year anniversary tour Thunder Nerds.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.560
 We've already done one in Bristol.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.200
 We're on our way to Dublin to do our next one.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.680
 And man, what amazing gigs.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.880
 - Yeah, it's absolutely incredible.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.440
 It's always amazing to do these shows

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.080
 because there are so many dorky, nerdy, geeky people

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.900
 out there, we absolutely love it.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.200
 We feel like we're in our element.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.320
 And the shows themselves have been so much fun.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.800
 We've been doing quizzes.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.240
 People have been sending in their best facts.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.760
 We've met some incredible people, Dan.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.960
 - Yeah, so we've set up for this tour,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.840
 the Hall of Fame, where we're inducting a new person

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.120
 who's appeared as one of the facts in our show,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.040
 and we get them coming live on stage.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.000
 But James, Anna and Andy don't know who they are.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.520
 I've been bringing them secretly in.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.280
 We have had the descendant of Confucius on stage with us.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.200
 We have had the Asparamancer,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.880
 the person who predicts all of the future political situations

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.640
 using Asparagus, aka Mystic Veg.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.200
 She was there in Bristol.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.080
 We've had the co-writer of Fatberg, The Musical.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.920
 I have very exciting ones lined up for Dublin

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.880
 and for Glasgow, as well as Cardiff, London and Manchester.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.920
 I am so excited for these things.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.040
 It's an amazing night.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.520
 - Have you got anyone for Newcastle?

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.600
 You didn't mention Newcastle?

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.680
 - Oh, I do. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.000
 Newcastle might be the best.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.040
 - Oh, wow. Okay.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.080
 Well, if you are in any of those aforementioned towns,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.240
 then make sure you come to the show.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.760
 There are still tickets available for all of them.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.280
 I think there might be a London show that's sold out,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.560
 but we did put on a new show.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.280
 So the tickets are available and you can get them

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.280
 by going to know6thingsafish.com/live.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.720
 Okay, Dan, we got a flight to get.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.160
 - We do. So let's get onto it.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.440
 You guys get your tickets.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.800
 We'll see you there at the live show.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.200
 Come say hi afterwards when we take photos with everyone.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.120
 It's a great night.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.960
 See you there.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.040
 But for now, enjoy the audience fact show.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:21.920
 - Hello and welcome to No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.000
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI officers in Hoban.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.240
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.040
 I'm here with Dan Shriver, James Arkin and Anna Tajinski.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.280
 with your favorite facts from the last three months.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.440
 That's right. It's our summer audience fact special.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.760
 You've been emailing your facts in to podcast@QI.com.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.440
 We've caught a few of the very best ones

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.520
 and we're going to be serving them back to you today.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.680
 Here we go, starting with James.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.360
 - Okay. Well, the first one that I've got

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.080
 on my big pile of facts is from Glenn Matthews

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.840
 and Glenn writes to rival the Eiffel Tower.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.480
 One suggestion for the Chicago World's Fair

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.840
 was a 200 person bungee.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.160
 - Cool.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.360
 On the same but extremely strong bungee rope.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.680
 - No, no, all different bungee ropes.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.360
 This is from a book called The Devil in the White City

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.840
 by Eric Larson, which Glenn read.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.960
 And he has lots of other amazing things

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.800
 that you could have instead of an Eiffel Tower

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.080
 to celebrate your city.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.000
 In this case, Chicago.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.840
 - Hang on, tourist go every moment of every day

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.080
 to see the Eiffel Tower.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.360
 If you were truly going to rival it,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.200
 you would need 200 bungee jumpers

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.440
 doing that every second of the day.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.280
 - What's wrong with that?

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.560
 - There's nothing wrong with that.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.160
 I just want to, I just want to make sure.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.280
 - You could do it like not every second,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.200
 but you could do it every half an hour, say, right?

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.040
 - Yeah.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.720
 - I remember staying in a hotel in Las Vegas

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.520
 and there was a bungee jump place on the top of the hotel

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.880
 and just you would open your window at the morning.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.720
 And you'd be like, oh, what a beauty.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.880
 And then there'd just be a guy

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.680
 sort of plummeting past your window.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.280
 - If you checked in late at night

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.280
 and you didn't know that was happening.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.440
 Oh my God, someone's, oh no, cancel it.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.640
 No, he's going back up.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.000
 He must have changed his mind.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.440
 Didn't when we stayed in New Zealand

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.440
 on our first fish tour there was,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.200
 the hotel was having a special--

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.640
 - That big tower in Auckland, whatever it's called.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.480
 - Yeah.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.320
 - I don't remember.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.480
 - Yeah, they do bungee off there as well.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.080
 - It's all they do in New Zealand, isn't it?

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.920
 - It's having been.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.920
 People bungee jump all the time, it's everywhere.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.760
 - Yeah.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.160
 - Quite a lot in Australia, but New Zealand,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.720
 it's just New Zealand and Lord of the Rings tourists.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.920
 - This is your weirdest stereotype.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.760
 I've never heard of that.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.680
 - It's not a stereotype.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.360
 In New Zealand, there's a different legal thing

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.120
 and it's to do with the insurance

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.480
 that you get for extreme sports.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.880
 And I think the government might cover some of it,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.240
 which means that it's much easier to set up

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.000
 an extreme sports thing in New Zealand

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.360
 than it is anywhere else in the world.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.200
 - Wow.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.640
 - I see, that's why, I thought we're just into it.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.440
 So it's not a tax break.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.280
 It's not tax deductible.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.440
 - It's not tax breaks so much as you don't,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.880
 it costs you less to do it.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.720
 And it, you're-

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.800
 - How would that work?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.440
 - If you're cost any bungeeing, you don't pay any tax.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.920
 - Yeah, you're sitting with your accountant and they say,

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.920
 "God, you've really gone over the threshold this year,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.040
 but good news, Mrs. Saunders.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.640
 You can do 76 bungee jumps."

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.800
 - Your investments can go down and up and down and up.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.400
 So yeah, what do you think we could have?

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.000
 - Let's say for instance, in London,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 we wanted a new tower to rival the Eiffel Tower.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.720
 They did actually come up with some ideas, didn't they?

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.480
 But what do you think would be a good thing to have?

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.200
 - I guess the London Eye was meant to be that, right?

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.040
 - Kind of.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.720
 Well, actually the London Eye was supposed to be temporary,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.560
 I think.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.400
 - Okay, what about this?

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.240
 The London Ear.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.080
 - Oh yeah.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.920
 - Right?

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.760
 - Oh yes.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.840
 - So, keep going.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.880
 - Well, it's a huge ear.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.120
 Like the London Eye looks like a big eye, sort of.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.320
 And you can, if you go in it,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.720
 you can hear sounds from all over London.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.560
 - Oh, that's nice.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.680
 - So it's not an amazing view.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.360
 It's an amazing sound.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.000
 - And every day, those people from Gladiators

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.880
 uses one of their massive Pugel Sticks to clean it.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.640
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.920
 - Yeah, okay, that's a good idea.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.560
 - Well, you'd want to be able to hear something, right?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.840
 So maybe you need another ear set up over in Paris.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.600
 So it's like one of the, you know, when you go to--

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.560
 - Like a telephone.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.560
 - Kind of like a telephone.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.040
 But in, no, in China, in the summer palace,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.120
 I seem to remember that you would go to either end

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.160
 of the palace and they would have somehow

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.360
 that you would whisper to the ball

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.200
 and you could hear--

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.240
 - Like you have in Playgrounds,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.360
 you often have other endpoints of Playgrounds,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.440
 those things you talk into that never work.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.080
 - There was also one of those at Grand Central Station

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.720
 in New York, Whispering Gallery.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.560
 And also it's--

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.240
 - It's a good intro, yeah.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.240
 - So that's a good idea, thank you.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.360
 - Jenga Tower.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.440
 - Jenga Tower.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.520
 - Everyone plays.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.840
 Every Londoner gets to play

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.280
 and you just have to insert a brick each.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.120
 And then the person who causes it to come out.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.960
 - Oh, no, it's removing the brick.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.800
 - That's not how it works.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.760
 (laughing)

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.840
 - Now that's spoiling every game of Jenga.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.800
 (laughing)

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.560
 - She's bringing bricks.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.680
 We've been playing this game of Jenga for hours,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.840
 but don't understand.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.240
 (laughing)

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.080
 Great, well come on, James.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.520
 - Oh, yes. - What did they propose?

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.360
 - Sorry.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.200
 - Was this Chicago?

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.560
 - This was for the World's Fair in Chicago, yeah.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.360
 So J.B. McComber thought you could get a massive tower,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.320
 which is much bigger than the Eiffel Tower,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.400
 10 times the size of the Eiffel Tower.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.000
 And you would put rails from the top,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.960
 going all the way to New York, Boston,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.360
 and Baltimore, which you can toboggan down to get home.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.640
 It's a great idea.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.400
 - Hang on, you toboggan all the way from Chicago

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.240
 to one of these.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.240
 That's gonna be a long toboggan commute, isn't it?

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.880
 - Well, the gradient is gonna be quite unexciting,

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.720
 I would guess.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.680
 - Yeah, it's a green run.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.040
 - Oh, but it has to be enough.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.760
 It has to be enough that you can toboggan.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.360
 - You know, when you go in a water slide

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.440
 and there's not enough water and there's not enough gradient,

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.720
 you just have to pull yourself along on your butt.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.560
 - Terrifying.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.560
 - Like a dog with worms.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.520
 You have to do that for 400 miles.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.240
 He said in his proposal,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.000
 "As the cost of the tower and its slides

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.600
 "is of secondary importance, I do not mention it here,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.920
 "but will furnish figures upon application."

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.760
 - Beautiful.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.600
 - Yeah.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.440
 - Should I do another fact?

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.480
 - Yeah, yeah, let's have one.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.480
 - This one is from Suleiman Ilias Charrette,

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.000
 and he said that he recently learned

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.200
 that since Biden dropped out of the presidential race,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.640
 this will be the first U.S. election since 1976

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.400
 that doesn't have a Bush, a Clinton,

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.360
 or a Biden on the ticket.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.200
 - Cool.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.440
 - Including vice president.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.440
 - What?

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.600
 - And he said, "I even checked it myself

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.680
 "because I didn't believe it

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.040
 "and then gave us a Wikipedia link,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.680
 "which admittedly I didn't check,

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.760
 "but I thought it would be bullsy to put that link in there

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.480
 "if it didn't prove his point."

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.280
 - Biden's not a great inclusion.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.280
 Biden just is a normal president who--

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.600
 - But he thinks he comes the last three,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.160
 'cause he did vice president for two terms.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.120
 - Oh, it includes VPs.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.440
 - So Bush is the running mate of Reagan.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.800
 - God, that's weird.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.160
 - Do you wanna hear facts about presidential names?

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.680
 'Cause I thought I'd find one myself

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.200
 after having read this.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.720
 Do you know what Grover Cleveland's nickname was?

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.000
 - Rover Cleveland.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.840
 - Yeah?

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.560
 - 'Cause he liked to go for a long walk and--

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.520
 - Oh, yeah, no, it's not that.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.720
 - Drover Cleveland, because he would herd

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.760
 his sheep across America.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.320
 (laughing)

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.200
 - Any more rhymes of Grover you wanna go?

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.480
 - I'm working on it.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.320
 - Should I tell you?

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.320
 - Yes.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.200
 - Well, two, you can have two options.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.640
 One is Big Steve.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.600
 (laughing)

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.760
 - Yep.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.360
 - Isn't that a great nickname for Grover Cleveland?

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.080
 - Big Steve, was Steve even a name then?

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.400
 - Well, believe it or not,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.040
 it was Grover Cleveland's first name

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.800
 because Grover was another nickname that he had.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.640
 - Oh, was it?

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.040
 - He was actually called Stephen.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.000
 - Steve Cleveland.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.240
 - But as in, I'm surprised that Steve,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.240
 of course, Stephen has been a name forever and ever,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.440
 but Steve, you don't get a lot of Steve's popping up

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.680
 in Dickens or in--

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.920
 - Yeah, but he's American,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.560
 and it's a very American name.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.400
 - It is now, but again--

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.840
 - Stephen Fry has this whole thing,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.320
 that his American adventure,

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.640
 he so nearly moved to America when he was a kid,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.520
 and he pictures this whole world where he was Steve Fry,

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.640
 'cause that's the name he would have undoubtedly had.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.760
 It's such a, yeah.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.600
 - I don't know.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.800
 Edith Water and Henry James aren't mentioning many Steve's.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.320
 I don't think, but I don't know.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.480
 - If you're called Steve and you're 150 years old,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.840
 right here.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.640
 - Okay, let's do a few more facts.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.480
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.200
 - Mandarin writes in,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.720
 and she writes in with some nominative determinism.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.560
 - Lovely.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.720
 - Arthur Owen Blessit is a traveling Christian preacher

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.320
 who is known for carrying a cross

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.760
 through every nation in the world.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.600
 - Lovely.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.600
 - Every nation.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.600
 - Every nation.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.440
 - That's very impressive.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.160
 - There's usually all 193 of them.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.480
 - He must have been in Roy when South Sea Darm was founded.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.320
 - Yes, whenever there's a new one,

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.880
 he must be like, oh, for God's sake,

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.200
 picks up his cross.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.480
 - Do we know if he takes a position on places like Taiwan?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.320
 - Or Macau.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.280
 - Or Micronations, yeah.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.360
 - I don't know that.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.200
 - Has he visited all those tiresome former oil rigs

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.000
 off the edge of the British coast?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.320
 - Yeah.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.360
 - All right, some praters said, oh, this is Steve Land.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.240
 All the utopian failed areas.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.600
 - I could just imagine other going to him going,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.560
 so Arthur, bless it.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.920
 Have you been to Germany?

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.240
 And he's like, fuck.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.280
 (all laughing)

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.360
 - Have you been to Blackadder?

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.200
 - Yeah.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.920
 - And we got one more bit of nominative determinism

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.840
 from Nathan Dwyer.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.040
 He said that Scottish poet, Ivor Cutler,

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.840
 kept a set of ivory cutlery in his home.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.120
 (all laughing)

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.840
 - No, it's fair enough.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.920
 - Probably a lot of people did, didn't they?

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.240
 - Yeah, he's also a comedy writer.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.080
 - Exactly.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.920
 - Is he?

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.760
 - Oh.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.600
 - Ivor Cutler, he's a poet, isn't he?

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.440
 - Yeah.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.280
 - Who writes comics.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.120
 - I didn't know anything about Ivor Cutler,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.960
 but he sounds great.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.800
 - He was a friend of the Beatles.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.640
 - Oh, okay.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.480
 - He was in--

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.760
 - Sounds like a euphemism there.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.600
 - Friend of the Beatles.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.440
 - Friend of the Beatles.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.480
 - I don't know what for, but.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.320
 - He was in the magical mystery tour.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.160
 - Oh, okay.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.000
 - Where he played a bus conductor called Buster Blood Vessel,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.640
 which is where the pop star from Bad Manors gets his name.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.480
 - I don't know about that.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.320
 - We've gone down a train

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.800
 that I have not been able to follow.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.040
 - We're actually on a bus right now.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.080
 (all laughing)

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.320
 Do you guys remember when I visited the man

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.400
 with maybe the biggest collection of cutlery

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.600
 in private hands in the world?

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.240
 - Yes, not only that, but this just shows

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.760
 where the hierarchy lay back in those days.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.080
 You visited him 'cause you did the original QI research

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:01.920
 and you picked up all the cutlery,

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.120
 and then once we were done with it,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.360
 I had to schlep there to take it all back to him.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.200
 (all laughing)

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.520
 - I didn't even know that we'd bothered returning it.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.960
 - You wouldn't have, Andy.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.720
 You were on to your next project.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.440
 (all laughing)

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.640
 - That was the 11th series of QI

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.140
 'cause it was the K series.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.480
 - Yes.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.840
 - What series have we on now, 22 or three?

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.120
 So you've been carrying around that grudge

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.440
 for how many years?

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.000
 - I'm so glad I've got it off my chest.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.120
 - The wording, it felt like you've practiced it in the mirror.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.640
 It felt like this has been something

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.920
 you've been ready to get off your chest.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.960
 I'm very excited.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.800
 So you did that.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.080
 You took his cutlery and then you just didn't think

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.760
 he might want this back?

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.480
 - No, I probably said something like,

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.880
 oh, someone sort this out.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.400
 - Some fucking idiot.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.880
 (all laughing)

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.920
 - He would never have said that to a colleague

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.600
 but I'd say, can we get one of the juniors to sort this out?

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.000
 (all laughing)

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.920
 James, give us another fact.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.360
 - So Lowell Bender writes,

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.560
 "If you haven't already covered this,

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.360
 "I'd like you to know that some US banks

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.160
 "have their own zip code."

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.000
 - Ah, nice.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.280
 - That's cool, isn't it?

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.240
 Lots of buildings actually have their own zip codes

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.560
 in America and in fact,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.360
 the shoe floor of Sacs on Fifth Avenue

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.640
 has its own zip code.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.720
 - The one floor of a building.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.760
 - One floor that sells shoes.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.320
 - Ironic because shoes are one item of clothing

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.640
 that rarely has zips.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.920
 (all laughing)

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.840
 - There speaks a woman unacquainted with high fashion.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.680
 - Yep.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.960
 (all laughing)

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.160
 - Auntie and Dad are both wearing their knee-high boots today.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.520
 - So many shoes have zips.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.000
 - I mean, they're not most.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.600
 I think most shoes would have lace.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.720
 - Go into a leather shop and you'll see a lot of zips.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.840
 - Do leather shoes have zips?

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.960
 - High heel, female high heel boots.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.240
 Beetle-like boots.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.080
 - No, you're right.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.120
 It's not as ironic as I let everyone to believe

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.160
 'cause some shoes do have zips.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.440
 What's something that never has zips?

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.880
 Hats, if it was a hat shop, it would be--

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.560
 - Oh, well, well, contrary to that.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.000
 (all laughing)

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.240
 Lifts off his top hat to show a fully zipped trilby.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.720
 Yes, so the zip code of the shoe shop

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.440
 was created as a one-off partnership

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.560
 between Sacs and USPS.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.520
 - I feel very mucky about that.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.360
 - I'm not sure about that.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.800
 It's like when, so sometimes the London Underground Stations

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.680
 will do a humorous collaboration

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.040
 with a big mega-corp company

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.280
 and they'll change the name of the station for the day

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.000
 to Bond James Bond Street.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.840
 - Oh, yeah.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.520
 - Or something, if there's a James Bond film out to play.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.520
 I don't know if they've done that,

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.240
 but I just think it must be really confusing

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.480
 for people who are just trying to get around London

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.440
 if you're a tourist, maybe you're not familiar with it.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.440
 - What do you think you turned up to Bond Street Station,

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.160
 which is on Bond Street?

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.760
 And you see it's called James Bond Street.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.200
 Oh, it must be somewhere else.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.040
 - That's a bad example, that's a bad example.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.080
 - Yeah, I just got back from Turkey, right?

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.880
 And I was at the immigration desk, handed my passport in

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.320
 and the guy behind it, he looked at my passport

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.240
 and he went out and he looked at me and he went,

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.760
 "Mr. Bond."

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.920
 And then he laughed and said,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.480
 "I bet you get that all the time."

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.240
 And I laughed going, "Yeah."

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.240
 And I was going, "I've never had that in my life."

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.720
 And then I realized it's because my middle name is Craig.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.000
 So I am Daniel Craig on my passports.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.840
 - I actually get it quite regularly, I must say.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.200
 - You get James Bond.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.080
 - James Bond because I'm called James.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.360
 Like I've definitely had it at least twice

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.720
 going through immigration in Russia, for instance.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.040
 And I've had it in a few other countries as well.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.120
 - Really? - Yeah, yeah.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.960
 It's really weird.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.760
 - That's so weird, 'cause there are other famous James's.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.520
 - Yeah, but I was carrying a revolver and having sex

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.920
 with a woman and drinking a martini at the time.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.320
 - While we're on Russia and also kind of on trains,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.160
 I read a thing which I wonder if you know

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.920
 the Russian word for train, is it like Vox?

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.760
 How would you spell it?

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.720
 - Vaxal means Vaxal is train station.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.680
 - Yeah, and the story goes a bunch of Russian engineers

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.040
 came over to the UK that went to Vauxhall Tube

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.120
 and they were like, "This is so good,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.120
 "we'll just go back and name everything after it."

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.520
 - It was the Vauxhall Overground Station, I think,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.640
 which was really ornate at the time.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.680
 I don't know if it still has ever been there for four months.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.440
 - I wouldn't, if I had to read for one word

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.680
 to describe Vauxhall, I would not describe it as ornate.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.400
 It's very functional.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.040
 - Really, 'cause almost all train stations

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.800
 are quite beautiful, so Vauxhall hasn't managed

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.120
 to achieve that, but mind you,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.960
 it's probably they're probably going

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.000
 for that Soviet aesthetic, which often isn't ornate.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.320
 - Although, in fairness, Russian train stations

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.960
 are pretty beautiful, generally speaking.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.000
 And the underground especially, the undergrounds

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.080
 tend to be huge bolts with very ornate artwork

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:18.920
 and stuff on them.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.160
 - Oh, Vauxhall Underground is the eighth wonder of the world.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.000
 Oh yeah, it's--

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.120
 - Can I do one more?

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.080
 Robbie Garman writes about mushrooms.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.640
 He's found a phrase on a website,

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.600
 "If it smells spermatozoic, eat it.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.400
 "If not, you'll probably die."

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.680
 - All right, wait.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.840
 I need a reminder of what that smell is.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.680
 - No, no, no, no, I don't think you do.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.360
 - What's the deal?

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.400
 All mushrooms that smell like sperm are safe.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.600
 - No, it's a very specific mushroom called the miller.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.680
 I don't know if anyone's told our colleague Ann Miller

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.040
 about this, but it can look very much

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.600
 like the deadly poisonous fool's funnel.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.760
 And apparently the best way to tell

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.400
 whether your mushroom is a miller

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.160
 or a poisonous fool's funnel is to sniff it.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.560
 And in most polite books, it says it smells like raw dough,

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.440
 but actually scientific places says it smells spermatozoic.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.440
 - Well, if someone's just wanked off

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.640
 on a fool's funnel-- - Anna.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.160
 - It's a great point. - It's a good question.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.000
 - It's a good question.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.120
 - It's not worth the risk, I think.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:23.960
 - It's not.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.800
 - It's possible.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.640
 - Wow.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.680
 - We're about to be told, like, God,

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.760
 we've got bad news about your weird fetish.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.120
 You thought it was all innocent.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.160
 You're out in the fields making all mushrooms.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.160
 You've killed 50 people.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.280
 - You're under arrest.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:45.240
 - Okay, it's now time for fact number two,

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.000
 and that is the facts that have been sent to Anna.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 - My headline fact this week is from Geoffrey Partaker.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.120
 He said, "My fact is that every March,

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.960
 "the US has a 50% increase in vasectomies

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.400
 "so that men can spend their recovery time

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.560
 "watching the men's college basketball tournament."

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.960
 - Mm, that's superb.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.280
 - It is, and it seems to have been a very clever bit of PR

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.000
 from the vasectomy industry,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.440
 because this is known as March Madness in America,

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.800
 and it's where--

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.640
 - The basketball.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.680
 - The basketball, yes.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.200
 And it's where all college basketball teams play each other,

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.360
 and it's all done very intensively like a knockout tournament,

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.920
 all happens in the same three-week space.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.600
 So ideal for recovery time.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.200
 I mean, actually it only takes about six hours

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.240
 to recover from a vasectomy,

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.880
 so this is a lot of malingering men on their phones.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.240
 - It couldn't be a botched one.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.960
 - It could be, but they always ask for the botched ones.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.880
 - I was talking to the comedian John Bishop

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.440
 about vasectomies, and he had one,

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.200
 and he was telling me that on the day,

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.880
 'cause you're awake when you have it right,

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.600
 but they go in, so they sort of cut open the ball sack,

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.600
 and you've got to go into each testicle with a tube.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.080
 So Dr. does the first one, and he's laying there,

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.160
 and he's sort of like, it's very weird sensation,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.040
 he's very aware of it, gets the second testicle,

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.320
 and the doctor says,

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.040
 "Do you mind we have a student doctor who's in today

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.640
 "who would be interested to--

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.840
 - His big punch run.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.000
 (all laughing)

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.200
 - Can he keep one of your circles, is that all right?

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.440
 You won't be using it.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.880
 - So he says, "Yeah, the student doctor goes in,

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.440
 "and gives it a cut,

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.520
 "and then all he hears next is, 'Oh, no.'"

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.280
 And the doctor says, "What have you done?"

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.320
 And suddenly there's a bit of a crisis moment

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.080
 where he sees his testicle being lifted out and so on,

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.120
 and he's, "Oh, what is going on?"

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.160
 It was a total botched job, and they managed to fix it,

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.400
 they sewed him up, so you can get botched,

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.120
 even when you're famous comedians.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.640
 - Especially when, I would have thought,

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.760
 if you go in as a student doctor,

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.400
 and it's Judy Dench there who's vasectomy or performing,

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.760
 which I know is unlikely, but--

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.040
 - So when they're advertising these vasectomies--

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:50.880
 - Yes.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.760
 - So you can watch "Basketball,"

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.320
 do they say it'll give you a free shot?

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.440
 - Brilliant.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:58.760
 - As in you can have sex without having kids.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.920
 - They should, they advertise it as vas-madness.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.880
 - When they call it "Vasketball," that's very good.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.160
 - I'm sure that's in the press releases.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.880
 - Okay, if not, you're welcome.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.720
 - Yeah.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.560
 - America.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.800
 - Why don't they get a key fuzz to do the address?

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.240
 (all laughing)

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.720
 - I mean, they might be already doing it.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.560
 - I'm sure he is.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.400
 - You're welcome.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.400
 (all laughing)

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.920
 - Anyway, this guy sounds great, actually, Jeffrey.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.640
 He said, "I wanted to link this fact with information

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.000
 "regarding frozen pea sales in America,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.480
 "because that's a solution often for men

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.480
 "who don't have an ice pack,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.440
 "but there was no public information breakdown

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.360
 "of monthly sales of frozen peas.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.240
 "So I've tended a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.000
 "about this deficiency."

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.840
 And--

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:38.680
 (all laughing)

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.520
 - Wow.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.320
 - He also says, "I feel it should be noted

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.600
 "that I left the mushy pea jokes to the professionals

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.600
 "despite the low-hanging fruit."

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.440
 There we go.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.880
 - Yeah, he didn't give us the low-hanging fruit jokes.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.320
 (all laughing)

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.520
 - Jumped in with that one.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.360
 - Well, thank you, Jeffrey.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.320
 - Lovely.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.960
 - This is a great little fact from Robin.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.800
 "During World War II,

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.320
 "the German city of Konstanz actually kept its lights on

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.800
 "so that pilots flying overhead

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.400
 "would think they were still over Switzerland."

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.000
 (all laughing)

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.840
 - So clever.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.440
 - Must just be closer to the Swiss border.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.280
 - It's very, very--

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.120
 - In Lake Konstanz, yeah.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.720
 - I've been to Lake Konstanz.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.720
 - Have you? - Yeah.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.560
 - Nice.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.520
 Did it have its lights on?

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.440
 - It was daytime, so they were cleverly--

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.520
 - So you just bonded anyway.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.320
 (all laughing)

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.960
 - Nice, so yeah.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.800
 - Very cool.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.200
 - I think I was on the Swiss side of Lake Konstanz.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.000
 - Yeah, me too, actually.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.960
 - Interesting.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.640
 - Funny you didn't bump into each other.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.120
 - It was at different times.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.320
 - You don't know that.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.480
 - I do.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.640
 We have not allowed to take holidays at the same time

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.480
 anymore. - No, that's true.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.200
 - In case you're both killed at the same time.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.160
 - Yeah.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.480
 - No, that is really cool.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.120
 And I can't remember why I was looking this up,

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.840
 but oh, in fact, it was one of my facts.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.880
 It was about Royal Albert Hall.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.880
 During the Blitz, or maybe it was in the First World War,

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.640
 but whatever it was, they would put over massive curtains

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.920
 over the top of it.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.800
 And it was the same stuff as they would use to black it out

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.400
 whenever they showed movies.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.160
 But they would put it all the way over the--

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.000
 - That's so cool.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.840
 - Oh, wow. - The top of it

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.480
 so that no lights would come out and would give it away.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.560
 All lights would shine off the glass.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.720
 - So they usually use it to black out the inside.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.080
 - Wow, and they just sort of turned it inside out.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.160
 - That's very cool.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.000
 - I thought you were gonna say,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.640
 wasn't that fact that the roof of the Albert Hall

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.480
 isn't attached?

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.320
 - It was mostly that it was built in Manchester

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.120
 and then taken apart and then rebuilt on the roll-up pole.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.680
 - But it's just sitting on top, though.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.560
 - Yeah, it's just loose.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.560
 It's like an upturned bowl.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.520
 - I mean, domes are just mental, aren't they?

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.800
 Like, what's the one in Florence?

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.600
 Is it Brunelleschi made the one in Florence

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.400
 and we still don't know how he did it?

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.680
 'Cause it's got no structure holding it up.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.160
 It basically holds itself up.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.480
 - Is that the Duomo?

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.240
 - Duomo, maybe, yeah, I think it is.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.680
 - It's been to the Duomo when I was trying to.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.920
 But not all at the same time.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.480
 - But yeah, and we don't know how he did it.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.520
 What we think is he built, like, the first circle

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.520
 and then the next level sort of interlocked

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.760
 with the previous level of bricks.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.560
 Next level interlocked with those

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.640
 and then eventually it sort of holds itself up.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.560
 - Like a jigsaw.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.000
 - Like a jigsaw, kind of, yeah.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.840
 - Interesting.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.680
 - Like Lego, almost.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.640
 - But we don't fully...

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.080
 - We still don't know how he did it.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.000
 - How do you, do you think when,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.760
 if you're one of the builders doing it

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.080
 and you're like, "This doesn't work."

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.680
 And he's like, "No, it will, it will."

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.600
 Like, what's your confidence as a builder

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.800
 when someone's handed you a blueprint of something

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.800
 that no other architect can make sense of?

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.160
 - Yeah, I can only imagine Bruno Lesky was saying,

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.040
 "Just do it, mate. Just do it."

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.080
 Yeah, don't ask questions.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.280
 Just take this cutlery where I tell you to take it.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.520
 (all laughing)

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.320
 - I think it's amazing anything was built before about 1800.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.160
 - Oh, I agree.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.680
 - Anything substantial is insane that they did that.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.520
 Using what?

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.640
 - Built better, really, and built to last longer

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.880
 than plenty of buildings today, am I right?

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.720
 - Yeah.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.880
 - Yeah, Stonehenge.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.720
 - Yeah.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.560
 - Look at that.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.400
 It's not that good a house.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.240
 You don't even want to live in Stonehenge, would you?

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.200
 - The pyramids were the tallest building on our planet

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.680
 until something in America, right?

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.680
 - To the Eiffel Tower, I think.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.520
 - No, no, no.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.840
 - It's the Lincoln Center.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.680
 - Lincoln Cathedral.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.920
 - In Lincoln, UK.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.760
 - Right.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.440
 - Not in the United States, yeah.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.240
 And then there was Lincoln Cathedral for 400 years.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.800
 - And also the Duomo, I think was the biggest dome

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.080
 in the world until the Royal Albert Hall,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.160
 I think. - Nice.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.000
 - Good fact.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:11.840
 - Yeah, good stuff.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.440
 - I think this is my favorite fact that came through.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.760
 It's from Justice Goldstein Shirley.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.520
 And it's this amazing thing that Bookland

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.080
 is a made-up country.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:21.920
 - Bookland.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.480
 - Where all books come from.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.320
 - Did that preacher manage to get there to?

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.360
 (all laughing)

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.560
 - Arthur, bless it.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.400
 - Yeah.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.240
 - With his cross.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.080
 - I don't know if bless it has been there.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.800
 - To me, this is not a good fact.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.440
 This is a poor fact, because it's just mediup-y.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.440
 - No, no, no, 'cause it's where all books come from.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.960
 - Ah, but no.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.960
 - I've been to a place where books are printed.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.960
 It wasn't in Buckland.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.800
 - You went there as well, didn't you, Andy?

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.960
 Not at the same time as me.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.480
 (all laughing)

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.000
 - Basically, as they say,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.600
 I've just learned a fact you all may enjoy.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.080
 According to their barcodes,

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.160
 all published books come from a country called Bookland.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.360
 And it's because when barcode numbers

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.680
 were being standardized in the 1980s,

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.760
 the first three digits of all barcodes

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.760
 of like, products, you buy in shops, whatever,

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.480
 were assigned according to a country of origin.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.360
 But books already had ISBN numbers.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.200
 And so they didn't wanna completely change the system

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.800
 for books, so they thought,

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.240
 we're just gonna add a country onto the front

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.360
 of the ISBN numbers, a little bit added to the barcode.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.040
 But to make things easy, we're just gonna say,

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.920
 all books are from the same country.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.760
 And it's 978, which I never noticed every single book

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.360
 has the same first three letters at the start.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.200
 Numbers at the start.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.040
 - We're next to a bookcase now.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.380
 - We'd better check.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.220
 - 978.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.440
 - Yeah, this one's got a label on it.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.280
 - How many should we do?

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.120
 - 978.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.960
 - Yeah, 978.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.080
 - 978, 978, Katie Hickman's book, 978.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.560
 - Dan Shriver's Impossible Things, 978, out now, out now.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.840
 - Dan Shriver's Impossible Things, 979.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.120
 (all laughing)

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.640
 - Yeah, all they've got were on 7-8 at the start.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.480
 - Amazing.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.480
 - All the numbers, it works.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.480
 That's great, that's an amazing fact.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.320
 - Anyway, and that's Bookland.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.160
 - Yeah.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.000
 - You're like, this is called Bookland.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.760
 - That's like the shoe shop, having its own zip code.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.480
 All books have their own country of origin

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.600
 in an non-existent country.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.440
 - Yeah.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.280
 - Love that.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.120
 - Do you want me to do more?

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:04.960
 - Yes.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.780
 - Yeah.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:06.620
 - Great, I will.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.960
 - I'll cut.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.400
 1986 movie, The Manhattan Projects.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.240
 Is that anyone seeing it?

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.080
 - Okay, no.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.880
 - It's about a kid who makes, who, nice.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.760
 (all laughing)

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.600
 - It is.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.440
 - It was fine, man.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.720
 - It was quick, it wasn't funny, but it was quick.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.200
 - Was it a fine man?

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.040
 - Oh, was it?

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:26.520
 - Oh, wow, Dan, that was good.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.960
 That was high, Brow.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.120
 It's about a kid who makes a nuclear bomb

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.640
 and the prop designer took things a bit too far

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.720
 and designed a bomb that might actually have worked.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.380
 (all laughing)

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.020
 - Is that based on a real story?

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.420
 'Cause there was a kid who made a bomb,

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.580
 wasn't there, do you remember?

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.420
 - Yeah, there was.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.900
 I think that, was that not more recently?

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.020
 - Was he a boy scout?

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.360
 - I think it was a boy scout.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.380
 - I think it was about then,

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.100
 and it was in a shed or something.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:50.940
 - Yeah.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.780
 - And they had to take a shed

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.420
 and bury it in the middle of the desert.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.260
 - That's right.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.420
 - It doesn't claim so,

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.500
 but maybe they did plagiarize the story.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.260
 - How do they know it might have worked?

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.180
 - Well, this is the thing.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.700
 It said it would have worked,

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.100
 but it was minus the plutonium sphere,

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.600
 and then I went down such a rabbit hole

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.840
 about how you make atomic bombs,

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.720
 and basically the plutonium sphere is the center,

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.240
 which is quite important.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.080
 - It is the main bears.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:12.920
 - Yeah.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.920
 So this is the explosives around it,

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.960
 but I ended up looking up.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.800
 - Yeah, but, yeah.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.640
 - But still, you know, you've made,

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.480
 you put all the explosives together.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.720
 All you need to do is chuck a plutonium.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.560
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.400
 - If you watch the "Mission Impossible" films,

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.320
 those things are tenor penny.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.480
 They're constantly being traded across that world.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.160
 (all laughing)

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.960
 I love the idea that a prop maker's doing it so well

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.320
 that the thing of, like, can you imagine

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.520
 if like Michael J. Fox actually disappeared

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.200
 when he hit 88 in the DeLorean?

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.740
 (all laughing)

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.080
 - Barry!

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.100
 - Have you guys heard of the demon core?

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.200
 - No.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.260
 - It's kind of cool.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.780
 So I looked up plutonium sphere,

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.380
 and this is the only thing that comes up.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.820
 It was the third bomb, so it was meant to be,

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.220
 the bombs that obliterated Hiroshima and Nakasaki,

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.020
 the Americans had a third one ready to go

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.020
 if the Japanese didn't surrender.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.500
 They nicknamed it Rufus,

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.540
 but it was renamed the demon core.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.180
 But basically, when Japan surrendered,

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.060
 they were like, well, we've got this spare

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.800
 plutonium core now, let's do loads of experiments with it.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.360
 And these scientists just went nuts with it,

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.840
 trying to experiment with how much radiation

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.600
 it took to kill you and, you know,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.920
 where you reach the critical point

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.440
 where there's a radiation explosion.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.720
 But it kept on going wrong, understandably.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.280
 So there was a scientist called Henry Daglian

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:23.020
 in August, 1945, who went to the lab after dinner,

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.080
 which sounds a lot like he had a lot to drink,

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.840
 stumbled back to the lab,

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.040
 built all these bricks around the plutonium core

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.440
 made of tungsten carbide,

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.140
 which apparently makes it more and more radioactive.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.460
 And he got to the exact moment where he knew

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.220
 if he added one more brick,

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.940
 it would suddenly have this radiation explosion.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.580
 - This is your version of "Chengar Game" as well, isn't it?

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.220
 It's just gonna add one more brick.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.180
 - It's the most dangerous "Chengar Game" in the world.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.020
 - Wow.

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:50.860
 - For bad kids.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.260
 - Did he add it?

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.660
 - No, what he did was he thought, you know,

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.700
 what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the bricks away now

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.180
 'cause I don't wanna kill myself.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.420
 But he went to take one brick away

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.380
 and he dropped it on the core.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.080
 And there was a big flash of radiation.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.000
 It was only for a split second

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.640
 and he went and grabbed it and pushed it off.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.720
 But that was enough and within 20 days he was dead.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.000
 - Whoa!

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.400
 - Yeah, it's the scariest thing, isn't it?

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.520
 'Cause you think, oh, that tingled a bit.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.280
 It's probably fine.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.600
 But it's actually not if it's a plutonium core.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.440
 - Good to know.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.720
 - Public service.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.160
 - Anyway, that was just the rabbit hole I went down.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.520
 - Wow, that's brilliant.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.360
 - Okay, let's have one last one from Sam Bromley

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.520
 who says, "During a bout of hiccups today,

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.460
 "I did some Googling and found out

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.620
 "that some proven remedies for hiccups

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:38.340
 "include finger in the rectum or a fist."

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.380
 - In?

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.340
 - I'm afraid there's nothing more to that.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.260
 - The thing is, like, if a finger in the rectum works,

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.620
 why go full fist?

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.460
 (all laughing)

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.340
 Or did it start off with an arm

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.740
 and then they felt, actually, just the fist will work.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.580
 And then they're like,

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.660
 "Oh, actually, just a few fingers will work."

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.420
 - Actually, maybe just give it 10 minutes

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.260
 and it will go naturally.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.360
 (all laughing)

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.440
 - Certainly it would be a shock.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.480
 You know, you're told to shock someone.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.320
 - I think, yeah.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.380
 - If you start hiccuping

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.520
 and someone puts the fist up your rectum,

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.860
 then that will be a shock.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:09.700
 - Yeah.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.020
 - And it's worth two in the bush right here,

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.520
 is the fist in the...

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.440
 - A fist on the arse is worth it.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.160
 (all laughing)

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.000
 - Tandy.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:19.840
 - Sorry.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.660
 - Jesus Christ.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.980
 - Sorry.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.360
 - I bought my wife something called Hickaway.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.200
 - What?

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.040
 - Hickaway.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:27.860
 - Right.

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:28.800
 - Anti-hickup thing.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.800
 - What shape is it?

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.960
 (all laughing)

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.600
 - Mechanical arm that just...

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.840
 - It's not that.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.680
 - What is it?

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.600
 - It's a thing that you drink from,

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.600
 but it's like a straw

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.880
 and it's supposed to be proven to get rid of hiccups

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.480
 'cause my wife suffers from hiccups.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.080
 - James, I'm here to tell you

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.600
 that you have given your wife the fist,

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.720
 whether you know it or not.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.560
 - Okay.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.400
 - That's what the fist is.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.040
 So a finger in the rectum study,

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.840
 and he has cited studies

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.440
 which actually show a finger up the rectum works,

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.920
 but the fist is something completely different, F-I-S-S-T,

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:04.040
 and it stands for Forced Inspiratory Suction and Swallow Tool,

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.280
 and it is the Hickaway.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.600
 - Oh.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.520
 - So you've fisted your wife with that, even knowing it.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.200
 - Stop it, Anna, this is the bluest joke.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.040
 - It's just facts.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.120
 - So what is it?

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.840
 - It's a straw that's particularly hard to suck,

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.840
 I think, isn't it?

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.520
 - Why does the finger work out of curiosity?

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.480
 - Surprise.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.640
 - No, 'cause if I'm doing it to me,

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.800
 that's not a surprise.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.640
 - I think it will still be a surprise.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.480
 - I'll be surprised.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.560
 (all laughing)

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.560
 - It's not a surprise to yourself.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.040
 It's like trying to tickle yourself.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:28.880
 You can't tickle yourself.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.320
 - I believe if you're schizophrenic,

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.800
 you can shock yourself with a figure up your own penis.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.400
 - Right, there we go.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.880
 - No, I think, is it, they just nerve stuff, I think.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.920
 - I actually didn't read the study.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.800
 It's a digital rectum massage that you can give yourself,

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.400
 but I felt like I'd gone deep enough.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.640
 - The only thing I remember about putting a finger

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.480
 at the bottom is it's the way

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.120
 to get a dog to stop biting you.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.760
 - Oh, the dog's bottom or your own?

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.280
 - It's the dog's.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.800
 - The dog's like, "That's disgusting.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.520
 "What a bite of this guy."

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.360
 - Thank God you clarified, though, Adam.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.360
 There will be someone out there

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.880
 who will remember that little nugget one day.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.800
 He died bitten by a dog with his finger up his arse.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.080
 We can't quite work out.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.660
 (upbeat music)

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:14.520
 - Okay, it's time for facts number three.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.800
 And that is Dan.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.320
 - Yep, so we've been sent in a fact here

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.200
 by John Waldrop from 1934 to 1947.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.640
 And then from 1951 till his death in 1954,

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.560
 the mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana, was Harry Bowles.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.400
 Very good.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.560
 Yeah, I sort of, I remember mentioning him years ago

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.160
 on the show, but I don't think it made it

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.000
 to an edit in the end.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.240
 - It's called Harry.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.600
 - He's called Harry Bowles, B-A-A-L-S.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.080
 The pronunciation is that because he was once

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.160
 on a radio show with a guy called Bob Chase

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.000
 who wasn't quite sure what to say in the moment.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.560
 And so he pronounced the mayor's name Bales.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.600
 So he said, "Mayor Bales is with us."

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.640
 And he called him on it and he said,

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.520
 "Son, this is your mayor.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.440
 I pronounced my name Bales."

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.960
 So he was very into that.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.360
 But yeah, he seemed to be a quite an interesting character.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.840
 He did a lot of stuff for the city.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.400
 He sort of helped to build underground storage systems.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.680
 He launched lots of city departments,

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.520
 lowered the city tax rates, liked Guy by all accounts.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.960
 I looked him up on eBay and you can find...

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.720
 - You can buy him for 12 nights, Guy.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.920
 - Yeah, he's available now.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.080
 - No, there's a lot of like of the old paraphernalia

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.320
 that you can buy from his, I guess, election time

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.280
 and just general stuff.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.200
 And I can't tell which ones are genuine or not,

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.920
 but it's, you know, on the badges it will say stuff like,

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.680
 "I'm proud of my Harry Bowles."

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.440
 You know, stuff like that.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.120
 So they obviously leaned into it.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.200
 And apparently one of the most stolen street signs

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.840
 that you can get in the States is Harry Bowles Drive.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.640
 And that's constantly being...

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.160
 Yeah, so they had to rename it to HW Bowles Drive,

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.000
 just to avoid that.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.240
 - I kind of feel like the balls bit

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.760
 is kind of part of the problem.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.040
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.160
 But yeah, so yeah, thank you very much to John Waldrop.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.720
 Here's an interesting one that we got sent in.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.920
 Someone was saying that, "I love the show."

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.840
 - Oh, that's great.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.680
 - Yep, pretty nice.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.520
 - Move on to the next one maybe.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.360
 - Yeah, so this is from Jessica Ackerman.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.200
 "I love the show."

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.440
 In episode 538, Anna's fact is that

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.840
 there are only two colors of cat.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.000
 As a cat lover, I love the conversation.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.640
 And I have a rad fact about cat allergies to share.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:22.740
 We can use chickens to make cats less allergenic.

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.880
 Okay, this is how it's done.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.520
 The protein, FelD1, is responsible for around 90%

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.760
 of cat allergies in humans.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.720
 The protein is found in cat saliva.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.000
 Scientists have found that chickens raised

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.660
 in the proximity to cats develop an antibody to FelD1

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.200
 called IgY.

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:41.880
 That is passed into the yolk.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.720
 If you feed a cat egg yolks

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.640
 from the cat exposed chickens,

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.220
 the IgY antibody will cause the cat's body

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:50.920
 to produce less of the FelD1 protein,

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:54.480
 thereby lessening the allergen that most humans react to.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.160
 - So sorry, keep a chicken near your cat,

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.120
 then feed the cat the eggs that the chicken has laid.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:00.960
 - Yes.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.440
 - And the cat will produce less of the stuff that--

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.680
 - How do I convince my cat to eat this egg?

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.440
 Do I mix it in with some Evian?

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.280
 - Yeah.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.120
 (laughing)

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:10.960
 It's exactly that.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.280
 You mix it into the cat food.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.440
 There's also companies now.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.720
 There's one called Purina that sells a cat food

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.600
 that I believe has it mixed into it already.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.080
 But the DIY solution, as Jessica points out,

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.240
 is you mix it into the food of your cat.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.160
 We can't eat the eggs and sort it out on our side.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.560
 It has to be the cats.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.080
 - Because then the cat would have to eat you.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:31.920
 - Yes.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.760
 (laughing)

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.600
 That's a great fact.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.440
 - Yeah, that's so cool.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.280
 - That's very cool.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.680
 Well, this is quite similar actually.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.120
 This is from Zoe Keen.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.680
 She writes that Dr. Anthony Waddle

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.560
 has created budget frog saunas.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.080
 And this could be amazing.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.760
 - I hate it 'cause I always spend so much money

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.320
 on my frog saunas.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.880
 That time someone hit the lower end of the market.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.800
 (laughing)

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.720
 - So there are frogs that are being wiped out

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.080
 by a fungal infection called chitrid or citrid.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.320
 - CHY, TRND.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.800
 - It's a really big problem, isn't it?

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.640
 So there are these rare frogs in places like Hawaii

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.760
 which are just dying by the 1000

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.960
 because they're just getting these fungal infections.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.800
 - Yeah, so it's thought to have caused

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.400
 90 species to go extinct.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.680
 A decline of a further 500 species.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.880
 It's a big, big problem.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.640
 And the idea is that once this fungus

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.880
 reaches an environment where the frogs are living,

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.960
 it's pretty much impossible to save them.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.800
 That's what it's been like up until now

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.920
 until Dr. Anthony Waddle comes in with his frog saunas.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.000
 'Cause what he's worked out is that heat treatment

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 will prevent frogs from croaking as Zoe has written.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 So they set up basically,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.280
 they set up a bunch of experiments

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.920
 where they put frogs into a sauna-like condition.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.760
 It was very heated.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.880
 They made it so that it was fun for them to be in there.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.840
 And they noticed that the frog--

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.160
 - They're sorry, how did they make it fun?

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.000
 - Well, I guess.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.840
 - They said, "You can pour the water on the cold."

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.480
 - Lovely, fluffy towels so that they make sure

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.720
 there's a good storage unit for all their gold

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.880
 and watches and all that.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.800
 - Relaxing music.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:00.160
 You don't go to a bunch of saunas, do you?

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.800
 - Where's the gold locker, sorry.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:06.800
 - Now we have to do, you gotta take off all the jewelry.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.200
 - Oh, like your wedding ring or the thing.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.080
 - Yeah, it sounded like you were turned up

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.440
 with a huge chain.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.640
 Also, Dan, you shouldn't really take off your wedding ring

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.800
 when you go into the sauna.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.640
 I know.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.520
 - Shouldn't you?

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.700
 I don't know 'cause I don't use saunas,

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.040
 they're not burned through your fingers.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.040
 - It's a message, doesn't it?

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.020
 So, okay, so basically the idea is that they created

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.240
 what are effectively saunas for the frogs to be in

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.360
 and they discovered that the frogs seem to have an immunity

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.040
 once they are in this heated area

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.760
 and that the fungus can't handle the heat and dies off.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.680
 - Is it if they've caught it, they can be saved?

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.120
 Or is it sort of, do you know what I mean?

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.120
 Is it, do they have to have already contracted the fungus?

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.160
 - Yeah, maybe that builds up an resistance.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.480
 - It must be 'cause if you just put a bunch

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.800
 of uninfected frogs in saunas, they're also not gonna get it

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.440
 but also you've got a bunch of uninfected frogs stuck

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.760
 in a sauna forever.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, so hang on.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.960
 So in the lab, they allowed infected frogs

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.280
 the option of spending time in the warm environment.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.920
 They sprang up the chance to use the saunas.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.960
 The fungus could not handle the heat and the frogs recovered.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.400
 A control group without sauna access stayed infected.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.600
 - So what they're trying to work out now

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.440
 is how do we create natural saunas for these frogs

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.880
 in these-- - Global warming?

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.360
 - There we go, it's naturally gonna happen.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.120
 It's gonna be, we're all gonna die except the frogs.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.280
 - Wow, that's fact, but they can have a turn.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.320
 - Do you know that fungi are two times more deadly

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.240
 than they were in 1990?

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.580
 - Why?

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.400
 - Because-- - People keeps baffling off

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.240
 onto them.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.800
 (laughing)

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.160
 - That's so rude.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.000
 - It's an epidemic.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:34.840
 - It is.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.000
 - Go to a substance that we're putting on them

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.400
 but it's fungicides, basically.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.600
 - James, sorry, I'd never do this

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.480
 but just a quick request for the edit.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.360
 Can you just remove all the earlier mentions

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.360
 that animated that so it comes absolutely out of nowhere?

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.600
 (laughing)

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.920
 - Yeah, we're using more fungicides than ever

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.120
 and like if you use too many antibiotics,

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.600
 you get antibiotic resistant bacteria.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.840
 You can get more anti-fungal resistant.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.680
 So they're much more dangerous than they were

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.040
 30 years ago.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.720
 - I've had a thought about this fact that we got in,

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.800
 was it, from Zoe, about the frog sauna one.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.640
 - Yeah.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.160
 - You know, it's nice because now we can update a saying,

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.000
 can't we?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 There's that classic saying, you know,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.800
 if you put a frog in warm water and raise the temperature,

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.960
 how long, how long before it screams or whatever,

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.400
 or how long before it, you know, panics and dumps out?

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.240
 - It's like a catchy one.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.080
 - It's the same?

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:24.920
 - No, but you know-- - It's not the same.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.760
 - It's like-- - It's like--

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.280
 - It's like, count your chickens without I didn't know?

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.280
 Is this another?

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.600
 - There's a frog in a bath and you raise the temperature

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.400
 and you know, how long before it actually realizes

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.600
 that it's dangerous and tries to jump out?

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.760
 - It's not a saying.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.360
 - No, but it's a-- - It's a thought,

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.840
 it's a thought experiment. - Use it in like,

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.200
 I make your house, when would you say that to me?

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.160
 - So, for instance, Dan, you know what?

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.080
 These tax rises, they're happening,

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.760
 but they're happening quite slowly

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.840
 and so people don't complain about them.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.840
 It's like a frog being in a pot of water

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.360
 and they're getting warmer and warmer and warmer

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.360
 and they never jump out

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.200
 because they never realize it's gotten too hot.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.040
 - Thank you, exactly like that.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.600
 - It's like a political option,

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.440
 not the one I would have thought.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.480
 - That's basically the premise.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.280
 So this, but is an update

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.040
 because you've got a frog in their sauna and it's nice.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.080
 It was a more of a slam dunk in my head

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.180
 when I was clamming this.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.720
 - More than that, really.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.000
 - Let's move on to Oliver Titcombe,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.960
 who says, "My fact this week is that Canadian police

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.080
 procedural due south was set in Chicago,

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.640
 but filmed in Toronto.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.600
 In one episode, the characters crossed the border

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.000
 to reach Toronto.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.800
 This scene was filmed in Chicago."

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.640
 - It's very nice.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.880
 - Is that a funny joke of the directors?

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.960
 - I know, I looked into it slightly

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.200
 and that's kind of one of those IMDB factoids

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.680
 that you don't get much more on.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.520
 Maybe it's out there.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.520
 - I never watched you South,

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.000
 but I always assumed it was Canadian, all of it.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.520
 - It was set in Chicago.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.520
 - Yeah, which is not in Canada.

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.360
 - I know, right?

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.200
 - So how did you assume it was Canadian?

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.720
 You recognized all the sites of Toronto.

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.560
 Why did they keep referring to Chicago

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.040
 when there's the famous--

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.040
 - Seattle Tower is right there in the middle.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.040
 - Hang on, where was it?

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.040
 It was filmed in Chicago.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.240
 - Filmed in Chicago, no, filmed in Toronto.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.080
 - Filmed in Toronto, thank you.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.200
 - I think, I actually didn't look into this bit,

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.840
 but I'm gonna assume that it's a Canadian police show

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.440
 that is based about a Chicago police station.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.960
 - How, in what senses is it a Canadian police show

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.720
 except that it's filmed in Toronto?

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.040
 - The show follows the adventures

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.000
 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.320
 What are they doing in Chicago?

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.160
 - What is going on then?

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.960
 - Wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.440
 Who first came to Chicago

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.040
 on the trail of the killers of his father?

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:26.880
 - I see.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.200
 - I see, so it's a mountain.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.520
 It's like a fish out of water

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.920
 or a frog out of sauna.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.760
 - Right.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.000
 - It goes to Chicago.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.080
 I think this would have been helped

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.520
 if any of us had seen due south.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.080
 - Yes, also Oliver's email was a bit longer

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.920
 and I cropped it to just that one paragraph.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.960
 So he actually did explain a little more,

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.920
 but I thought, I'm sending it to Dan,

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.320
 I've just gotta include the first paragraph.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.160
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.320
 - The show's format looked at the stereotypical differences

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.240
 between Canadian and American culture at the time.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.200
 - That sounds quite good.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.880
 - Created by Paul Haggis.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.320
 - Great name.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.440
 - I want to see this show where he goes to Scotland.

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.280
 - Yeah.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:04.680
 - Okay, another fact from Sarah Ellis.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.160
 And I'll do this as a quiz question

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.440
 'cause I think it's sort of presented like that.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.680
 In parts of Australia,

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.520
 there will be two minutes in a day

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.320
 that last for a minute and a half each.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.760
 Why?

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.840
 - So I've seen the answer.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:18.680
 - Okay, yeah, of course.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:19.520
 - It came to the inbox.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.960
 So I'm gonna rule myself out.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.360
 Or I'll try and trick these others actually.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.520
 - Okay, go on then.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.040
 - I'll say it's 'cause Australia's so big

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.440
 they have to stretch the minute.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.440
 - Oh, that's a good idea, isn't that?

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.680
 - Yeah, I'm gonna go for that.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.760
 (all laughing)

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.800
 - Can I ask some follow up questions?

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.800
 - Absolutely, yeah.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.640
 - Great.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:38.760
 Is it just on one particular day or is it every day?

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.840
 - It's every day.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:40.840
 - Could you say it one more time?

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.640
 - Yeah, so in parts of Australia,

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.600
 there will be two minutes in a day

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.920
 and those two minutes last for a minute and a half each.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.120
 - Okay, okay.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.560
 Do we lose the other minute?

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.320
 'Cause the number of minutes in a day

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.640
 presumably is the same as anywhere else.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:59.760
 So we've got an extra half minute from each of those.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.600
 Have we lost that minute somewhere else?

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:02.440
 - Yes.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.240
 - Ah, okay.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.080
 So they've decided to do away with one of the minutes

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:07.920
 of the day.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.200
 - Which minute would you lose?

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.040
 (all laughing)

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.000
 - Ooh, what a question.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.840
 - I reckon I'd lose the minute

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:16.480
 of you talking about people spunking over mushrooms.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.600
 Why would you lose a minute?

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.400
 Well, logically you'd say the first or last minute

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.640
 would be a good one to lose.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.240
 Maybe the confusion of zero, zero, zero.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.680
 Like, 'cause in midnight,

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.840
 is it one day or is it the next day?

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:31.680
 - You're bang on.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:32.520
 - Is it really?

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.360
 - Yeah, yeah, that's absolutely it.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.200
 - Wow!

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.520
 - But where in Australia?

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.360
 This is a bit too hard to get.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.600
 - I should go on Tom Scott's podcast.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.600
 - This is too hard to get.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.440
 - We can get it.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.280
 - It's a bit misleading.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.000
 - How many places in Australia rather?

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.200
 Sydney or Melbourne?

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.360
 (all laughing)

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.760
 - Have we heard of this place?

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.040
 - It's not a place.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.600
 It's a, let's say it's a--

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.440
 - The exact center.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.720
 - It's an institution.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:52.560
 Help me out, Andy.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.480
 - With the space agency?

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.320
 Straight on.

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.160
 - GPS.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.600
 - Think, like, they're related to that.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.080
 Who invented GPS?

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:00.920
 Who owned GPS?

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.760
 - NASA.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.080
 - And the--

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.040
 - And the Space Force.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:07.000
 - And the American, they've got big guns.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:07.840
 - Army.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:08.680
 - The army!

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.520
 (laughing)

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:10.360
 - Wait a minute.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.200
 Is he still tricking us?

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.040
 - I can't remember.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:12.860
 I think, is it the army?

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:13.680
 - It's the Royal Australian Navy.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.520
 Oh, sorry.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.720
 So the explanation Sarah gives is that

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.440
 the Royal Australian Navy uses a 24 hour clock

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.800
 as opposed to 12 hour time.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.920
 24 hour time starts at zero, zero, zero.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.760
 And it goes until 2359, as we all know, then resets.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:30.080
 Now, some reason they just don't like the zero, zero, zero.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.080
 So what they do is they make the minute 2359

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.360
 last a minute and a half.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.720
 And then when it flicks over,

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.200
 it flicks over to zero, zero, one,

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.480
 and that lasts for a minute and a half.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.320
 And then you move back.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.140
 - I love that.

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.120
 Wouldn't it be amazing if you could lose,

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:44.600
 I was just thinking about the minute of the day that I lose.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.560
 And getting out of bed is the worst moment of the day, right?

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.920
 If you could lose the minute between

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.520
 when you're lying down and when you're standing up.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.640
 So you could just be like lying down and be like,

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.520
 okay, fine, can I skip ahead a minute now?

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.840
 And then you're standing up.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.600
 - That's a great premise for something.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.080
 A story or a film or something.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.320
 You have a button that you press and it just,

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.160
 I think that's great.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.000
 - Just give it a minute.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:05.840
 Thanks, Andy.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.120
 And this is a published novelist here.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:07.960
 Okay.

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:08.800
 (laughing)

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.640
 You're saying that?

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.480
 - 978.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.320
 - 978.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.160
 - 978.

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.000
 (laughing)

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.580
 (upbeat music)

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.880
 - Okay, it's time for the final facts of the show.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.080
 And those are my ones.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.360
 So get ready guys, 'cause these are the really good ones.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.560
 Right, these are the creme de la creme.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.000
 So here is a great one.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.360
 This is from Derek Dayerman.

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.720
 And he writes, I'm a train operator

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.560
 on the New York City subway.

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.440
 And I noticed the most bizarre Shakespearean coincidence

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.040
 within the system that I want to share with you.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.040
 This is great.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:46.360
 The fact is the Romeo train goes through the Montague Tunnel

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.880
 and the Juliet comes close but never gets to join it.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.000
 Okay, this is insane.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.400
 And I'm pretty sure this is a Derek-generated fact.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.840
 I think he's the first person to notice this,

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.680
 which is so cool.

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.500
 - Okay.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.640
 - So there are all these subway tunnels

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.320
 connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn, right?

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.280
 One of them is called the Montague Tunnel.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.400
 - Presumably not named after the family

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.480
 in Romeo and Juliet.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.940
 - No, it gets its name from the street

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:08.680
 that it runs underneath once it reaches Brooklyn,

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.680
 which is the Montague Street.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.840
 So in New York, the subway lines,

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.360
 they just have a letter or a number.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.880
 You know, the A train, the B train.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.880
 - Is it like alpha and beta?

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.680
 - Well, they do the phonetic alphabet.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.760
 So train crews on the R train call themselves Romeo's

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.200
 and train crews on the J train call themselves Juliet's.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.840
 And the R train goes through the Montague Tunnel.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.400
 There are tracks which would allow the J and Z trains

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.800
 to also use the Montague Tunnel,

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.400
 but they aren't used in passenger service.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.040
 They both terminate just before the entrance to the tunnel.

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:43.040
 So Juliet never gets to join Romeo through the Montague Tunnel.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.240
 I just think that's great.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.080
 Brilliant.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:45.920
 - So good.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:46.760
 - Brilliant.

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.580
 - Well done.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:48.420
 - Do you want to hear, this is a great,

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:49.600
 this is an Australian one.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.440
 We'll go to Australia soon.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.280
 - Okay.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.280
 - This might be helpful.

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.320
 From Will Davies, from Emerald Beach, New South Wales.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.960
 Familiar to any of them?

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:59.120
 - Yeah, it's by the coast, I think.

00:46:59.120 --> 00:46:59.960
 - Nice.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.880
 - I'll do this one as a riddle as well, actually.

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.600
 The third largest airline in Australia

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.640
 does not charge its passengers to fly.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.880
 Whoa.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:10.720
 - Is it?

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.440
 - So it's going to be animals that it's...

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.280
 - Yeah.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.040
 - Some sort of freight or military.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:16.880
 - Flying doctors.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.040
 - Not freight, it's not...

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:18.880
 James has got it.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.720
 - Oh.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:20.560
 - Flying doctors.

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.400
 - Why?

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.600
 - The third largest by fleet size.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.640
 So I suppose that's not total passenger capacity

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.040
 but number of planes you've got

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.200
 'cause they're quite small planes.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.400
 So yeah, it's flying doctors.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.720
 Who I don't think we've ever spoken about.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.680
 - No, no, how does, what are they?

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:37.200
 - Well, they, they're as it sounds, as it sounds.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.200
 - As it sounds, but is it like if you call an ambulance

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.760
 in the outback or you've been hit by a kangaroo,

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.800
 then you call and a doctor has to get to you.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:46.760
 - Yeah, or something even less stereotypical than that.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.400
 - I don't know, one of the cocks went in my eye from my hat.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.480
 - The little roo fell on me.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.080
 Yeah, that kind of, yeah.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.560
 - I guess 'cause you'd normally have just the paramedic go

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.680
 and then take them to another place.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.960
 - Yeah, but some of these places are so remote

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.440
 and they're not very low, but small populations.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.600
 And so you just need,

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.400
 if you need a doctor within a couple of hours.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.240
 - Yeah.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.840
 - The reason I actually knew about it

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:11.120
 is probably 10 years before due self came out,

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.160
 there was a TV show called The Flying Doctors,

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.040
 which was, I didn't really watch it,

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.600
 but I knew that it was about this.

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.920
 - Yeah, I used to watch it back home.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.640
 Yeah, it was a sort of staple of, you know,

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.320
 along with home and away and all that.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:22.360
 - Okay, here's a bonus quiz.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.480
 This is something, 'cause I was reading a bit

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.000
 about The Flying Doctors. - Yeah, yeah.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.500
 - So they, if they're landing in the dark,

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:31.760
 places they're flying to are not equipped with airports,

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.240
 most of them. - Right now, I know.

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:37.960
 - So what they want is proper sort of flares

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.640
 or electric lights on the runway to clearly mark out

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.960
 where they have to land at night.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.480
 So if you are landing somewhere

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.920
 which doesn't have those lights,

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.480
 what is the best alternative

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.920
 that The Flying Doctors like to use?

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.200
 - Pumpkins.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.520
 - Fireflies. - Not bad.

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.600
 Biomanescence. - Biomanescence.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.960
 - It's... (laughing)

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.360
 You have to breed some phosphorescent shrimp to,

00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.800
 and you chuck them out of the tanks,

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.080
 you just throw the aquariums.

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.240
 Every community under 20 people in Australia

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.680
 has millions of shrimps on a sand bike.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.880
 If someone takes their leg.

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.720
 - No, it's... - Phones.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.040
 - You are setting-- - Hold your phone up.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.240
 - That's a really nice idea.

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.200
 You are setting light to something.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.840
 What does every house have?

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.840
 - A netflix. - A washing machine.

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:20.840
 - Gold. - Safe.

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.600
 (laughing)

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.640
 - Evian. (laughing)

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.160
 - It's a dunny roll.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.600
 - Oh, okay. - It's new roll.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.440
 What you do is you soak toilet rolls in diesel

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.680
 and you just line them along your impromptu runway

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.840
 and set fire to them and they burn for half an hour.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.680
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.360
 - And the pilots can, and if you can't do that,

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.720
 if for whatever reason you've got to the end

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.200
 of your last roll, maybe that's the crisis

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.840
 that you're calling the fine doctors for,

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.560
 then you have four cars with their headlights

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.040
 at the corners of your runway.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:47.880
 - Ah, nice. - Just have to put

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.360
 on their headlights. - Very cool.

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.080
 - Flying doctors. - They're awesome.

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.720
 - Here's one from Henry Biggs.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.520
 Until the mid-1920s, Italians drove

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.600
 on both sides of the road.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.320
 - Well, we all drive on both sides of the road

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.960
 'cause that'd be a complete waste of road.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.520
 - Yeah, so you mean one way.

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.960
 - What? (laughing)

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.400
 - It's not like you look at a road

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.160
 and the only half of it's really used.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:10.080
 - Oh, we're in pedantry cul-de-sac now.

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.200
 They drove on the left and the right.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.280
 - Okay. - In the same direction.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.120
 - Thank you.

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.760
 - Why did they do such a thing?

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.720
 - Well, Italy largely adopted driving

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:20.880
 on the right as law in 1912,

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.640
 but in some cities with tram networks,

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.440
 drivers would have to switch to driving on the left

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.360
 as they approach the city centre.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.760
 Quite confusing.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.240
 - You know what, I once drove the wrong way

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.280
 round and round about in Italy

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.760
 and they were very annoyed,

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.720
 the people who were also on the roundabout.

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.080
 - But I should have just said,

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.160
 I thought we were still in 1912.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.200
 (laughing)

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.360
 - That would have calmed it down.

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.360
 Yeah, but weirdly, they think the Romans drove on the left.

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.560
 So I looked into this a bit off the back of the road.

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.400
 - Yeah, I think that's true, isn't it?

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.000
 They look at the ruts in the road and stuff.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:52.840
 - You've got it.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:53.680
 - Wow.

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.520
 - Oh, that's gonna be a little quiz.

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.360
 - Oh, I'm sorry.

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.200
 - No, that's quite all right.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.040
 Just forget.

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:57.880
 Okay, Dan and Anna, forget you had that.

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.200
 (laughing)

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.360
 - I can't believe James doesn't even eat

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.720
 the quiz question at this point.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:02.560
 (laughing)

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:03.640
 It just comes in with the answer.

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.920
 (laughing)

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.320
 - How do we know they weren't just always reversing, though?

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.160
 - That's true.

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.600
 - Well, it was 1998, they worked out,

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.920
 'cause there was a quarry near Swindon.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:14.380
 And archeologists found it,

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.560
 and they found the ruts on the,

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.920
 so if I'm looking at the quarry for a distance, right?

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.960
 The ruts on the right hand side of the road

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.720
 are deeper than the ones on the left.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.200
 So what they think is that carts were arriving lighter

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.960
 on the left, 'cause they're not weighed down,

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.920
 and then they're weighed down with stones

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.680
 as they're leaving, so the ruts are heavier.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.000
 So that's how they can tell which side of the road

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:34.840
 was driven on.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:35.680
 - Very cool.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.000
 - That is amazing.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.480
 - It's a great detective work.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:39.320
 One last one.

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:40.480
 From Adam Wilson,

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.480
 "According to the leading piracy historian,

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.840
 "Marcus Reddica, more people have worked

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.000
 "on the pirates of the Caribbean franchise

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.280
 "than there were ever actual pirates of the Caribbean."

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.120
 (laughing)

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.840
 And it's partly because the number of pirates

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.880
 was so small, he reckons, Marcus Reddica,

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.480
 who is probably a very eminent historian,

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:03.120
 that there were 4,000 total ever cumulative pirates.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:03.960
 Yeah.

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.680
 Imagine that, like 4,000 of them,

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.640
 and what they have influenced.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.360
 Every child pretends to be a pirate.

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.880
 Honestly, it's incredible, 4,000 people.

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.000
 - And they are pretending to be golden age pirates.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.120
 - Yeah, probably they're pretending

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.760
 to be 100 of those, right?

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.520
 Most of them wouldn't have been army hearties.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.200
 (laughing)

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.200
 - Yeah.

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.040
 - That's amazing.

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:25.880
 Only 4,000.

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:27.440
 - I know, and I presume the number of people

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:30.240
 who work on the, I presume even the graphics department

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:31.800
 for one pirates of the Caribbean, yeah.

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:33.280
 - There have been about 4,000 of the films

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.120
 that I've seen on the internet.

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:34.960
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.540
 (upbeat music)

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:40.480
 - Okay, that's it.

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.920
 That's all of your facts.

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:46.160

 and some of them may get read out.

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.000
 So that's an added incentive.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.280

 And if you enjoyed this kind of show,

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.160
 slightly different format, we actually have a club,

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.680
 a secret, private, highly publicized members club.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:28.720
 It's called Clubfish.

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.920
 It's so much fun for a few quid a month.

 which is already in the feedback bit,

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.080
 which is very funny.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.720
 It's not dissimilar to what you just heard.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.920
 - No, audience is funny in the podcast.

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.160
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it's really,

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.240
 it's, you know, I think a lot of the intellectual life

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.600
 is happening in Clubfish at the moment.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.400
 You know, it's the salon.

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.520
 - It's the sauna.

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.520
 - It's the sauna.

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.360
 So, whip off your wedding ring,

00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.760

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.760
