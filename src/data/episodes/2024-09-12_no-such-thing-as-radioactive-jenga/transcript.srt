1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,720
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,340
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,980
 of No Such Things as a Fish.

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,400
 It is our summer audience facts special.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,580
 So we're gonna be going through all of our mail bag

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,720
 to find the best facts that you have sent in.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,140
 Because right now Dan, we're not in the office, are we?

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,000
 - No, we are on the road.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,720
 We are doing our 10 year anniversary tour Thunder Nerds.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,560
 We've already done one in Bristol.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,200
 We're on our way to Dublin to do our next one.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,680
 And man, what amazing gigs.

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,880
 - Yeah, it's absolutely incredible.

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,440
 It's always amazing to do these shows

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,080
 because there are so many dorky, nerdy, geeky people

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,900
 out there, we absolutely love it.

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,200
 We feel like we're in our element.

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,320
 And the shows themselves have been so much fun.

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,800
 We've been doing quizzes.

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,240
 People have been sending in their best facts.

21
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,760
 We've met some incredible people, Dan.

22
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,960
 - Yeah, so we've set up for this tour,

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,840
 the Hall of Fame, where we're inducting a new person

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,120
 who's appeared as one of the facts in our show,

25
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,040
 and we get them coming live on stage.

26
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,000
 But James, Anna and Andy don't know who they are.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,520
 I've been bringing them secretly in.

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,280
 We have had the descendant of Confucius on stage with us.

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,200
 We have had the Asparamancer,

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,880
 the person who predicts all of the future political situations

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,640
 using Asparagus, aka Mystic Veg.

32
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,200
 She was there in Bristol.

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,080
 We've had the co-writer of Fatberg, The Musical.

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,920
 I have very exciting ones lined up for Dublin

35
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,880
 and for Glasgow, as well as Cardiff, London and Manchester.

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,920
 I am so excited for these things.

37
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,040
 It's an amazing night.

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,520
 - Have you got anyone for Newcastle?

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,600
 You didn't mention Newcastle?

40
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,680
 - Oh, I do. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,000
 Newcastle might be the best.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,040
 - Oh, wow. Okay.

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,080
 Well, if you are in any of those aforementioned towns,

44
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,240
 then make sure you come to the show.

45
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,760
 There are still tickets available for all of them.

46
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,280
 I think there might be a London show that's sold out,

47
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,560
 but we did put on a new show.

48
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,280
 So the tickets are available and you can get them

49
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,280
 by going to know6thingsafish.com/live.

50
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,720
 Okay, Dan, we got a flight to get.

51
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,160
 - We do. So let's get onto it.

52
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,440
 You guys get your tickets.

53
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,800
 We'll see you there at the live show.

54
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,200
 Come say hi afterwards when we take photos with everyone.

55
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,120
 It's a great night.

56
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,960
 See you there.

57
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,040
 But for now, enjoy the audience fact show.

58
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:21,920
 - Hello and welcome to No Such Thing as a Fish,

59
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,000
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI officers in Hoban.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,240
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray.

61
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,040
 I'm here with Dan Shriver, James Arkin and Anna Tajinski.

62
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

63
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,280
 with your favorite facts from the last three months.

64
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,440
 That's right. It's our summer audience fact special.

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,760
 You've been emailing your facts in to podcast@QI.com.

66
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,440
 We've caught a few of the very best ones

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,520
 and we're going to be serving them back to you today.

68
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,680
 Here we go, starting with James.

69
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,360
 - Okay. Well, the first one that I've got

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,080
 on my big pile of facts is from Glenn Matthews

71
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,840
 and Glenn writes to rival the Eiffel Tower.

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,480
 One suggestion for the Chicago World's Fair

73
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,840
 was a 200 person bungee.

74
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,160
 - Cool.

75
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,360
 On the same but extremely strong bungee rope.

76
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,680
 - No, no, all different bungee ropes.

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,360
 This is from a book called The Devil in the White City

78
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,840
 by Eric Larson, which Glenn read.

79
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,960
 And he has lots of other amazing things

80
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,800
 that you could have instead of an Eiffel Tower

81
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,080
 to celebrate your city.

82
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,000
 In this case, Chicago.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,840
 - Hang on, tourist go every moment of every day

84
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,080
 to see the Eiffel Tower.

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,360
 If you were truly going to rival it,

86
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
 you would need 200 bungee jumpers

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,440
 doing that every second of the day.

88
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,280
 - What's wrong with that?

89
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,560
 - There's nothing wrong with that.

90
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,160
 I just want to, I just want to make sure.

91
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,280
 - You could do it like not every second,

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,200
 but you could do it every half an hour, say, right?

93
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,040
 - Yeah.

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,720
 - I remember staying in a hotel in Las Vegas

95
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,520
 and there was a bungee jump place on the top of the hotel

96
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,880
 and just you would open your window at the morning.

97
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,720
 And you'd be like, oh, what a beauty.

98
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,880
 And then there'd just be a guy

99
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,680
 sort of plummeting past your window.

100
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,280
 - If you checked in late at night

101
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
 and you didn't know that was happening.

102
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,440
 Oh my God, someone's, oh no, cancel it.

103
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,640
 No, he's going back up.

104
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,000
 He must have changed his mind.

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,440
 Didn't when we stayed in New Zealand

106
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,440
 on our first fish tour there was,

107
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,200
 the hotel was having a special--

108
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,640
 - That big tower in Auckland, whatever it's called.

109
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,480
 - Yeah.

110
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,320
 - I don't remember.

111
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,480
 - Yeah, they do bungee off there as well.

112
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,080
 - It's all they do in New Zealand, isn't it?

113
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,920
 - It's having been.

114
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,920
 People bungee jump all the time, it's everywhere.

115
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,760
 - Yeah.

116
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,160
 - Quite a lot in Australia, but New Zealand,

117
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,720
 it's just New Zealand and Lord of the Rings tourists.

118
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,920
 - This is your weirdest stereotype.

119
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,760
 I've never heard of that.

120
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,680
 - It's not a stereotype.

121
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,360
 In New Zealand, there's a different legal thing

122
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,120
 and it's to do with the insurance

123
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,480
 that you get for extreme sports.

124
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,880
 And I think the government might cover some of it,

125
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,240
 which means that it's much easier to set up

126
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
 an extreme sports thing in New Zealand

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,360
 than it is anywhere else in the world.

128
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,200
 - Wow.

129
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,640
 - I see, that's why, I thought we're just into it.

130
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,440
 So it's not a tax break.

131
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,280
 It's not tax deductible.

132
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,440
 - It's not tax breaks so much as you don't,

133
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,880
 it costs you less to do it.

134
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,720
 And it, you're-

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,800
 - How would that work?

136
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,440
 - If you're cost any bungeeing, you don't pay any tax.

137
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,920
 - Yeah, you're sitting with your accountant and they say,

138
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
 "God, you've really gone over the threshold this year,

139
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,040
 but good news, Mrs. Saunders.

140
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,640
 You can do 76 bungee jumps."

141
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,800
 - Your investments can go down and up and down and up.

142
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,400
 So yeah, what do you think we could have?

143
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,000
 - Let's say for instance, in London,

144
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 we wanted a new tower to rival the Eiffel Tower.

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,720
 They did actually come up with some ideas, didn't they?

146
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,480
 But what do you think would be a good thing to have?

147
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,200
 - I guess the London Eye was meant to be that, right?

148
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,040
 - Kind of.

149
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,720
 Well, actually the London Eye was supposed to be temporary,

150
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,560
 I think.

151
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,400
 - Okay, what about this?

152
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,240
 The London Ear.

153
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,080
 - Oh yeah.

154
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,920
 - Right?

155
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,760
 - Oh yes.

156
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,840
 - So, keep going.

157
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,880
 - Well, it's a huge ear.

158
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,120
 Like the London Eye looks like a big eye, sort of.

159
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,320
 And you can, if you go in it,

160
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,720
 you can hear sounds from all over London.

161
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
 - Oh, that's nice.

162
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,680
 - So it's not an amazing view.

163
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,360
 It's an amazing sound.

164
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
 - And every day, those people from Gladiators

165
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,880
 uses one of their massive Pugel Sticks to clean it.

166
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,640
 - Exactly, yeah.

167
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,920
 - Yeah, okay, that's a good idea.

168
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,560
 - Well, you'd want to be able to hear something, right?

169
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,840
 So maybe you need another ear set up over in Paris.

170
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,600
 So it's like one of the, you know, when you go to--

171
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,560
 - Like a telephone.

172
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
 - Kind of like a telephone.

173
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,040
 But in, no, in China, in the summer palace,

174
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,120
 I seem to remember that you would go to either end

175
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,160
 of the palace and they would have somehow

176
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,360
 that you would whisper to the ball

177
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,200
 and you could hear--

178
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,240
 - Like you have in Playgrounds,

179
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,360
 you often have other endpoints of Playgrounds,

180
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,440
 those things you talk into that never work.

181
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,080
 - There was also one of those at Grand Central Station

182
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,720
 in New York, Whispering Gallery.

183
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
 And also it's--

184
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,240
 - It's a good intro, yeah.

185
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
 - So that's a good idea, thank you.

186
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,360
 - Jenga Tower.

187
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,440
 - Jenga Tower.

188
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,520
 - Everyone plays.

189
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,840
 Every Londoner gets to play

190
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,280
 and you just have to insert a brick each.

191
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,120
 And then the person who causes it to come out.

192
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,960
 - Oh, no, it's removing the brick.

193
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,800
 - That's not how it works.

194
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,760
 (laughing)

195
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,840
 - Now that's spoiling every game of Jenga.

196
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,800
 (laughing)

197
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
 - She's bringing bricks.

198
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,680
 We've been playing this game of Jenga for hours,

199
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,840
 but don't understand.

200
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,240
 (laughing)

201
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,080
 Great, well come on, James.

202
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,520
 - Oh, yes. - What did they propose?

203
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,360
 - Sorry.

204
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,200
 - Was this Chicago?

205
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,560
 - This was for the World's Fair in Chicago, yeah.

206
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,360
 So J.B. McComber thought you could get a massive tower,

207
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,320
 which is much bigger than the Eiffel Tower,

208
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,400
 10 times the size of the Eiffel Tower.

209
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,000
 And you would put rails from the top,

210
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,960
 going all the way to New York, Boston,

211
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,360
 and Baltimore, which you can toboggan down to get home.

212
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,640
 It's a great idea.

213
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,400
 - Hang on, you toboggan all the way from Chicago

214
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,240
 to one of these.

215
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
 That's gonna be a long toboggan commute, isn't it?

216
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,880
 - Well, the gradient is gonna be quite unexciting,

217
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,720
 I would guess.

218
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,680
 - Yeah, it's a green run.

219
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,040
 - Oh, but it has to be enough.

220
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,760
 It has to be enough that you can toboggan.

221
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,360
 - You know, when you go in a water slide

222
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
 and there's not enough water and there's not enough gradient,

223
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,720
 you just have to pull yourself along on your butt.

224
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,560
 - Terrifying.

225
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
 - Like a dog with worms.

226
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,520
 You have to do that for 400 miles.

227
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,240
 He said in his proposal,

228
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,000
 "As the cost of the tower and its slides

229
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,600
 "is of secondary importance, I do not mention it here,

230
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,920
 "but will furnish figures upon application."

231
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,760
 - Beautiful.

232
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,600
 - Yeah.

233
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,440
 - Should I do another fact?

234
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,480
 - Yeah, yeah, let's have one.

235
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,480
 - This one is from Suleiman Ilias Charrette,

236
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,000
 and he said that he recently learned

237
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,200
 that since Biden dropped out of the presidential race,

238
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,640
 this will be the first U.S. election since 1976

239
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,400
 that doesn't have a Bush, a Clinton,

240
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,360
 or a Biden on the ticket.

241
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
 - Cool.

242
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,440
 - Including vice president.

243
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
 - What?

244
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,600
 - And he said, "I even checked it myself

245
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,680
 "because I didn't believe it

246
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,040
 "and then gave us a Wikipedia link,

247
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,680
 "which admittedly I didn't check,

248
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,760
 "but I thought it would be bullsy to put that link in there

249
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,480
 "if it didn't prove his point."

250
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,280
 - Biden's not a great inclusion.

251
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,280
 Biden just is a normal president who--

252
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,600
 - But he thinks he comes the last three,

253
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,160
 'cause he did vice president for two terms.

254
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,120
 - Oh, it includes VPs.

255
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

256
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
 - So Bush is the running mate of Reagan.

257
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,800
 - God, that's weird.

258
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,160
 - Do you wanna hear facts about presidential names?

259
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,680
 'Cause I thought I'd find one myself

260
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,200
 after having read this.

261
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,720
 Do you know what Grover Cleveland's nickname was?

262
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,000
 - Rover Cleveland.

263
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,840
 - Yeah?

264
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,560
 - 'Cause he liked to go for a long walk and--

265
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,520
 - Oh, yeah, no, it's not that.

266
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,720
 - Drover Cleveland, because he would herd

267
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,760
 his sheep across America.

268
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,320
 (laughing)

269
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,200
 - Any more rhymes of Grover you wanna go?

270
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
 - I'm working on it.

271
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,320
 - Should I tell you?

272
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
 - Yes.

273
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,200
 - Well, two, you can have two options.

274
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,640
 One is Big Steve.

275
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,600
 (laughing)

276
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,760
 - Yep.

277
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,360
 - Isn't that a great nickname for Grover Cleveland?

278
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,080
 - Big Steve, was Steve even a name then?

279
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,400
 - Well, believe it or not,

280
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,040
 it was Grover Cleveland's first name

281
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,800
 because Grover was another nickname that he had.

282
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,640
 - Oh, was it?

283
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,040
 - He was actually called Stephen.

284
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,000
 - Steve Cleveland.

285
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,240
 - But as in, I'm surprised that Steve,

286
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
 of course, Stephen has been a name forever and ever,

287
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,440
 but Steve, you don't get a lot of Steve's popping up

288
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,680
 in Dickens or in--

289
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,920
 - Yeah, but he's American,

290
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,560
 and it's a very American name.

291
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,400
 - It is now, but again--

292
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,840
 - Stephen Fry has this whole thing,

293
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,320
 that his American adventure,

294
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,640
 he so nearly moved to America when he was a kid,

295
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,520
 and he pictures this whole world where he was Steve Fry,

296
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,640
 'cause that's the name he would have undoubtedly had.

297
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,760
 It's such a, yeah.

298
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,600
 - I don't know.

299
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,800
 Edith Water and Henry James aren't mentioning many Steve's.

300
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,320
 I don't think, but I don't know.

301
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,480
 - If you're called Steve and you're 150 years old,

302
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,840
 right here.

303
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,640
 - Okay, let's do a few more facts.

304
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,480
 - Yeah, yeah.

305
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,200
 - Mandarin writes in,

306
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,720
 and she writes in with some nominative determinism.

307
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,560
 - Lovely.

308
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,720
 - Arthur Owen Blessit is a traveling Christian preacher

309
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
 who is known for carrying a cross

310
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,760
 through every nation in the world.

311
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,600
 - Lovely.

312
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
 - Every nation.

313
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
 - Every nation.

314
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,440
 - That's very impressive.

315
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,160
 - There's usually all 193 of them.

316
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,480
 - He must have been in Roy when South Sea Darm was founded.

317
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,320
 - Yes, whenever there's a new one,

318
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,880
 he must be like, oh, for God's sake,

319
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,200
 picks up his cross.

320
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,480
 - Do we know if he takes a position on places like Taiwan?

321
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,320
 - Or Macau.

322
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,280
 - Or Micronations, yeah.

323
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,360
 - I don't know that.

324
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,200
 - Has he visited all those tiresome former oil rigs

325
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,000
 off the edge of the British coast?

326
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,320
 - Yeah.

327
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,360
 - All right, some praters said, oh, this is Steve Land.

328
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,240
 All the utopian failed areas.

329
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,600
 - I could just imagine other going to him going,

330
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,560
 so Arthur, bless it.

331
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,920
 Have you been to Germany?

332
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,240
 And he's like, fuck.

333
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,280
 (all laughing)

334
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,360
 - Have you been to Blackadder?

335
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,200
 - Yeah.

336
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,920
 - And we got one more bit of nominative determinism

337
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,840
 from Nathan Dwyer.

338
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,040
 He said that Scottish poet, Ivor Cutler,

339
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,840
 kept a set of ivory cutlery in his home.

340
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,120
 (all laughing)

341
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,840
 - No, it's fair enough.

342
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,920
 - Probably a lot of people did, didn't they?

343
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,240
 - Yeah, he's also a comedy writer.

344
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,080
 - Exactly.

345
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,920
 - Is he?

346
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,760
 - Oh.

347
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,600
 - Ivor Cutler, he's a poet, isn't he?

348
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,440
 - Yeah.

349
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,280
 - Who writes comics.

350
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,120
 - I didn't know anything about Ivor Cutler,

351
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,960
 but he sounds great.

352
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,800
 - He was a friend of the Beatles.

353
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,640
 - Oh, okay.

354
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,480
 - He was in--

355
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,760
 - Sounds like a euphemism there.

356
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,600
 - Friend of the Beatles.

357
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,440
 - Friend of the Beatles.

358
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,480
 - I don't know what for, but.

359
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,320
 - He was in the magical mystery tour.

360
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,160
 - Oh, okay.

361
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,000
 - Where he played a bus conductor called Buster Blood Vessel,

362
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,640
 which is where the pop star from Bad Manors gets his name.

363
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,480
 - I don't know about that.

364
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,320
 - We've gone down a train

365
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,800
 that I have not been able to follow.

366
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,040
 - We're actually on a bus right now.

367
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,080
 (all laughing)

368
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,320
 Do you guys remember when I visited the man

369
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,400
 with maybe the biggest collection of cutlery

370
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,600
 in private hands in the world?

371
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,240
 - Yes, not only that, but this just shows

372
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,760
 where the hierarchy lay back in those days.

373
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,080
 You visited him 'cause you did the original QI research

374
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,920
 and you picked up all the cutlery,

375
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,120
 and then once we were done with it,

376
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,360
 I had to schlep there to take it all back to him.

377
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,200
 (all laughing)

378
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,520
 - I didn't even know that we'd bothered returning it.

379
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,960
 - You wouldn't have, Andy.

380
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,720
 You were on to your next project.

381
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,440
 (all laughing)

382
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,640
 - That was the 11th series of QI

383
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,140
 'cause it was the K series.

384
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,480
 - Yes.

385
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,840
 - What series have we on now, 22 or three?

386
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,120
 So you've been carrying around that grudge

387
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,440
 for how many years?

388
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,000
 - I'm so glad I've got it off my chest.

389
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,120
 - The wording, it felt like you've practiced it in the mirror.

390
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,640
 It felt like this has been something

391
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,920
 you've been ready to get off your chest.

392
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,960
 I'm very excited.

393
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,800
 So you did that.

394
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,080
 You took his cutlery and then you just didn't think

395
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,760
 he might want this back?

396
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,480
 - No, I probably said something like,

397
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,880
 oh, someone sort this out.

398
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,400
 - Some fucking idiot.

399
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,880
 (all laughing)

400
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,920
 - He would never have said that to a colleague

401
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,600
 but I'd say, can we get one of the juniors to sort this out?

402
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,000
 (all laughing)

403
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,920
 James, give us another fact.

404
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,360
 - So Lowell Bender writes,

405
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,560
 "If you haven't already covered this,

406
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,360
 "I'd like you to know that some US banks

407
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,160
 "have their own zip code."

408
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,000
 - Ah, nice.

409
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,280
 - That's cool, isn't it?

410
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,240
 Lots of buildings actually have their own zip codes

411
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,560
 in America and in fact,

412
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,360
 the shoe floor of Sacs on Fifth Avenue

413
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,640
 has its own zip code.

414
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,720
 - The one floor of a building.

415
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,760
 - One floor that sells shoes.

416
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,320
 - Ironic because shoes are one item of clothing

417
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,640
 that rarely has zips.

418
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,920
 (all laughing)

419
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,840
 - There speaks a woman unacquainted with high fashion.

420
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,680
 - Yep.

421
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,960
 (all laughing)

422
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,160
 - Auntie and Dad are both wearing their knee-high boots today.

423
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,520
 - So many shoes have zips.

424
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,000
 - I mean, they're not most.

425
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,600
 I think most shoes would have lace.

426
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,720
 - Go into a leather shop and you'll see a lot of zips.

427
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,840
 - Do leather shoes have zips?

428
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,960
 - High heel, female high heel boots.

429
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,240
 Beetle-like boots.

430
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,080
 - No, you're right.

431
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,120
 It's not as ironic as I let everyone to believe

432
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,160
 'cause some shoes do have zips.

433
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,440
 What's something that never has zips?

434
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,880
 Hats, if it was a hat shop, it would be--

435
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,560
 - Oh, well, well, contrary to that.

436
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,000
 (all laughing)

437
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,240
 Lifts off his top hat to show a fully zipped trilby.

438
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,720
 Yes, so the zip code of the shoe shop

439
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,440
 was created as a one-off partnership

440
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,560
 between Sacs and USPS.

441
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,520
 - I feel very mucky about that.

442
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,360
 - I'm not sure about that.

443
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,800
 It's like when, so sometimes the London Underground Stations

444
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,680
 will do a humorous collaboration

445
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,040
 with a big mega-corp company

446
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,280
 and they'll change the name of the station for the day

447
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,000
 to Bond James Bond Street.

448
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,840
 - Oh, yeah.

449
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,520
 - Or something, if there's a James Bond film out to play.

450
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
 I don't know if they've done that,

451
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,240
 but I just think it must be really confusing

452
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,480
 for people who are just trying to get around London

453
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,440
 if you're a tourist, maybe you're not familiar with it.

454
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
 - What do you think you turned up to Bond Street Station,

455
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,160
 which is on Bond Street?

456
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,760
 And you see it's called James Bond Street.

457
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,200
 Oh, it must be somewhere else.

458
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,040
 - That's a bad example, that's a bad example.

459
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,080
 - Yeah, I just got back from Turkey, right?

460
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,880
 And I was at the immigration desk, handed my passport in

461
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,320
 and the guy behind it, he looked at my passport

462
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,240
 and he went out and he looked at me and he went,

463
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,760
 "Mr. Bond."

464
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,920
 And then he laughed and said,

465
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,480
 "I bet you get that all the time."

466
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,240
 And I laughed going, "Yeah."

467
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,240
 And I was going, "I've never had that in my life."

468
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,720
 And then I realized it's because my middle name is Craig.

469
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,000
 So I am Daniel Craig on my passports.

470
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,840
 - I actually get it quite regularly, I must say.

471
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,200
 - You get James Bond.

472
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,080
 - James Bond because I'm called James.

473
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,360
 Like I've definitely had it at least twice

474
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,720
 going through immigration in Russia, for instance.

475
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,040
 And I've had it in a few other countries as well.

476
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,120
 - Really? - Yeah, yeah.

477
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,960
 It's really weird.

478
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,760
 - That's so weird, 'cause there are other famous James's.

479
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,520
 - Yeah, but I was carrying a revolver and having sex

480
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,920
 with a woman and drinking a martini at the time.

481
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,320
 - While we're on Russia and also kind of on trains,

482
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,160
 I read a thing which I wonder if you know

483
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,920
 the Russian word for train, is it like Vox?

484
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,760
 How would you spell it?

485
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,720
 - Vaxal means Vaxal is train station.

486
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,680
 - Yeah, and the story goes a bunch of Russian engineers

487
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,040
 came over to the UK that went to Vauxhall Tube

488
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,120
 and they were like, "This is so good,

489
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,120
 "we'll just go back and name everything after it."

490
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,520
 - It was the Vauxhall Overground Station, I think,

491
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,640
 which was really ornate at the time.

492
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,680
 I don't know if it still has ever been there for four months.

493
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,440
 - I wouldn't, if I had to read for one word

494
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,680
 to describe Vauxhall, I would not describe it as ornate.

495
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,400
 It's very functional.

496
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,040
 - Really, 'cause almost all train stations

497
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,800
 are quite beautiful, so Vauxhall hasn't managed

498
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,120
 to achieve that, but mind you,

499
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,960
 it's probably they're probably going

500
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,000
 for that Soviet aesthetic, which often isn't ornate.

501
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,320
 - Although, in fairness, Russian train stations

502
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,960
 are pretty beautiful, generally speaking.

503
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,000
 And the underground especially, the undergrounds

504
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,080
 tend to be huge bolts with very ornate artwork

505
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,920
 and stuff on them.

506
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,160
 - Oh, Vauxhall Underground is the eighth wonder of the world.

507
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,000
 Oh yeah, it's--

508
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,120
 - Can I do one more?

509
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,080
 Robbie Garman writes about mushrooms.

510
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,640
 He's found a phrase on a website,

511
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,600
 "If it smells spermatozoic, eat it.

512
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,400
 "If not, you'll probably die."

513
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,680
 - All right, wait.

514
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,840
 I need a reminder of what that smell is.

515
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,680
 - No, no, no, no, I don't think you do.

516
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,360
 - What's the deal?

517
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,400
 All mushrooms that smell like sperm are safe.

518
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,600
 - No, it's a very specific mushroom called the miller.

519
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,680
 I don't know if anyone's told our colleague Ann Miller

520
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,040
 about this, but it can look very much

521
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,600
 like the deadly poisonous fool's funnel.

522
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,760
 And apparently the best way to tell

523
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,400
 whether your mushroom is a miller

524
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,160
 or a poisonous fool's funnel is to sniff it.

525
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,560
 And in most polite books, it says it smells like raw dough,

526
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,440
 but actually scientific places says it smells spermatozoic.

527
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
 - Well, if someone's just wanked off

528
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,640
 on a fool's funnel-- - Anna.

529
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,160
 - It's a great point. - It's a good question.

530
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,000
 - It's a good question.

531
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,120
 - It's not worth the risk, I think.

532
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,960
 - It's not.

533
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,800
 - It's possible.

534
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,640
 - Wow.

535
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,680
 - We're about to be told, like, God,

536
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,760
 we've got bad news about your weird fetish.

537
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,120
 You thought it was all innocent.

538
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,160
 You're out in the fields making all mushrooms.

539
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,160
 You've killed 50 people.

540
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,280
 - You're under arrest.

541
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:45,240
 - Okay, it's now time for fact number two,

542
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,000
 and that is the facts that have been sent to Anna.

543
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 - My headline fact this week is from Geoffrey Partaker.

544
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,120
 He said, "My fact is that every March,

545
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,960
 "the US has a 50% increase in vasectomies

546
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,400
 "so that men can spend their recovery time

547
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,560
 "watching the men's college basketball tournament."

548
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,960
 - Mm, that's superb.

549
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,280
 - It is, and it seems to have been a very clever bit of PR

550
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,000
 from the vasectomy industry,

551
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,440
 because this is known as March Madness in America,

552
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,800
 and it's where--

553
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,640
 - The basketball.

554
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,680
 - The basketball, yes.

555
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,200
 And it's where all college basketball teams play each other,

556
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,360
 and it's all done very intensively like a knockout tournament,

557
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,920
 all happens in the same three-week space.

558
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,600
 So ideal for recovery time.

559
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,200
 I mean, actually it only takes about six hours

560
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,240
 to recover from a vasectomy,

561
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,880
 so this is a lot of malingering men on their phones.

562
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,240
 - It couldn't be a botched one.

563
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,960
 - It could be, but they always ask for the botched ones.

564
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,880
 - I was talking to the comedian John Bishop

565
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,440
 about vasectomies, and he had one,

566
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,200
 and he was telling me that on the day,

567
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,880
 'cause you're awake when you have it right,

568
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,600
 but they go in, so they sort of cut open the ball sack,

569
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,600
 and you've got to go into each testicle with a tube.

570
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,080
 So Dr. does the first one, and he's laying there,

571
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,160
 and he's sort of like, it's very weird sensation,

572
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,040
 he's very aware of it, gets the second testicle,

573
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,320
 and the doctor says,

574
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,040
 "Do you mind we have a student doctor who's in today

575
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,640
 "who would be interested to--

576
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,840
 - His big punch run.

577
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,000
 (all laughing)

578
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,200
 - Can he keep one of your circles, is that all right?

579
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,440
 You won't be using it.

580
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,880
 - So he says, "Yeah, the student doctor goes in,

581
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,440
 "and gives it a cut,

582
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,520
 "and then all he hears next is, 'Oh, no.'"

583
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,280
 And the doctor says, "What have you done?"

584
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,320
 And suddenly there's a bit of a crisis moment

585
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,080
 where he sees his testicle being lifted out and so on,

586
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,120
 and he's, "Oh, what is going on?"

587
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,160
 It was a total botched job, and they managed to fix it,

588
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,400
 they sewed him up, so you can get botched,

589
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,120
 even when you're famous comedians.

590
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,640
 - Especially when, I would have thought,

591
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,760
 if you go in as a student doctor,

592
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,400
 and it's Judy Dench there who's vasectomy or performing,

593
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,760
 which I know is unlikely, but--

594
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,040
 - So when they're advertising these vasectomies--

595
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,880
 - Yes.

596
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,760
 - So you can watch "Basketball,"

597
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,320
 do they say it'll give you a free shot?

598
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,440
 - Brilliant.

599
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,760
 - As in you can have sex without having kids.

600
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,920
 - They should, they advertise it as vas-madness.

601
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,880
 - When they call it "Vasketball," that's very good.

602
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,160
 - I'm sure that's in the press releases.

603
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,880
 - Okay, if not, you're welcome.

604
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,720
 - Yeah.

605
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,560
 - America.

606
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,800
 - Why don't they get a key fuzz to do the address?

607
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,240
 (all laughing)

608
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,720
 - I mean, they might be already doing it.

609
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,560
 - I'm sure he is.

610
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,400
 - You're welcome.

611
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
 (all laughing)

612
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,920
 - Anyway, this guy sounds great, actually, Jeffrey.

613
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,640
 He said, "I wanted to link this fact with information

614
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,000
 "regarding frozen pea sales in America,

615
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,480
 "because that's a solution often for men

616
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
 "who don't have an ice pack,

617
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,440
 "but there was no public information breakdown

618
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,360
 "of monthly sales of frozen peas.

619
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,240
 "So I've tended a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture

620
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,000
 "about this deficiency."

621
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,840
 And--

622
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,680
 (all laughing)

623
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
 - Wow.

624
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,320
 - He also says, "I feel it should be noted

625
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,600
 "that I left the mushy pea jokes to the professionals

626
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
 "despite the low-hanging fruit."

627
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,440
 There we go.

628
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,880
 - Yeah, he didn't give us the low-hanging fruit jokes.

629
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,320
 (all laughing)

630
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,520
 - Jumped in with that one.

631
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,360
 - Well, thank you, Jeffrey.

632
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,320
 - Lovely.

633
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,960
 - This is a great little fact from Robin.

634
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,800
 "During World War II,

635
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,320
 "the German city of Konstanz actually kept its lights on

636
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,800
 "so that pilots flying overhead

637
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,400
 "would think they were still over Switzerland."

638
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
 (all laughing)

639
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,840
 - So clever.

640
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

641
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,440
 - Must just be closer to the Swiss border.

642
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,280
 - It's very, very--

643
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,120
 - In Lake Konstanz, yeah.

644
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,720
 - I've been to Lake Konstanz.

645
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
 - Have you? - Yeah.

646
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,560
 - Nice.

647
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,520
 Did it have its lights on?

648
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,440
 - It was daytime, so they were cleverly--

649
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,520
 - So you just bonded anyway.

650
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,320
 (all laughing)

651
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,960
 - Nice, so yeah.

652
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,800
 - Very cool.

653
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,200
 - I think I was on the Swiss side of Lake Konstanz.

654
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,000
 - Yeah, me too, actually.

655
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,960
 - Interesting.

656
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,640
 - Funny you didn't bump into each other.

657
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,120
 - It was at different times.

658
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,320
 - You don't know that.

659
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,480
 - I do.

660
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,640
 We have not allowed to take holidays at the same time

661
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,480
 anymore. - No, that's true.

662
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,200
 - In case you're both killed at the same time.

663
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,160
 - Yeah.

664
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,480
 - No, that is really cool.

665
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,120
 And I can't remember why I was looking this up,

666
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,840
 but oh, in fact, it was one of my facts.

667
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,880
 It was about Royal Albert Hall.

668
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,880
 During the Blitz, or maybe it was in the First World War,

669
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,640
 but whatever it was, they would put over massive curtains

670
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,920
 over the top of it.

671
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,800
 And it was the same stuff as they would use to black it out

672
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,400
 whenever they showed movies.

673
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,160
 But they would put it all the way over the--

674
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,000
 - That's so cool.

675
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,840
 - Oh, wow. - The top of it

676
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,480
 so that no lights would come out and would give it away.

677
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,560
 All lights would shine off the glass.

678
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,720
 - So they usually use it to black out the inside.

679
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,560
 - Yeah, yeah.

680
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,080
 - Wow, and they just sort of turned it inside out.

681
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,160
 - That's very cool.

682
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,000
 - I thought you were gonna say,

683
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,640
 wasn't that fact that the roof of the Albert Hall

684
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,480
 isn't attached?

685
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,320
 - It was mostly that it was built in Manchester

686
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,120
 and then taken apart and then rebuilt on the roll-up pole.

687
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,680
 - But it's just sitting on top, though.

688
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,560
 - Yeah, it's just loose.

689
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
 It's like an upturned bowl.

690
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,520
 - I mean, domes are just mental, aren't they?

691
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,800
 Like, what's the one in Florence?

692
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,600
 Is it Brunelleschi made the one in Florence

693
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,400
 and we still don't know how he did it?

694
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,680
 'Cause it's got no structure holding it up.

695
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,160
 It basically holds itself up.

696
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,480
 - Is that the Duomo?

697
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,240
 - Duomo, maybe, yeah, I think it is.

698
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,680
 - It's been to the Duomo when I was trying to.

699
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,920
 But not all at the same time.

700
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,480
 - But yeah, and we don't know how he did it.

701
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,520
 What we think is he built, like, the first circle

702
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,520
 and then the next level sort of interlocked

703
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,760
 with the previous level of bricks.

704
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,560
 Next level interlocked with those

705
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,640
 and then eventually it sort of holds itself up.

706
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,560
 - Like a jigsaw.

707
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,000
 - Like a jigsaw, kind of, yeah.

708
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,840
 - Interesting.

709
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,680
 - Like Lego, almost.

710
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,640
 - But we don't fully...

711
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,080
 - We still don't know how he did it.

712
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,000
 - How do you, do you think when,

713
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,760
 if you're one of the builders doing it

714
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,080
 and you're like, "This doesn't work."

715
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,680
 And he's like, "No, it will, it will."

716
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,600
 Like, what's your confidence as a builder

717
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,800
 when someone's handed you a blueprint of something

718
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,800
 that no other architect can make sense of?

719
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,160
 - Yeah, I can only imagine Bruno Lesky was saying,

720
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,040
 "Just do it, mate. Just do it."

721
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,080
 Yeah, don't ask questions.

722
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,280
 Just take this cutlery where I tell you to take it.

723
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,520
 (all laughing)

724
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,320
 - I think it's amazing anything was built before about 1800.

725
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,160
 - Oh, I agree.

726
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,680
 - Anything substantial is insane that they did that.

727
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,520
 Using what?

728
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,640
 - Built better, really, and built to last longer

729
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,880
 than plenty of buildings today, am I right?

730
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,720
 - Yeah.

731
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,880
 - Yeah, Stonehenge.

732
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,720
 - Yeah.

733
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,560
 - Look at that.

734
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,400
 It's not that good a house.

735
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,240
 You don't even want to live in Stonehenge, would you?

736
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,200
 - The pyramids were the tallest building on our planet

737
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,680
 until something in America, right?

738
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
 - To the Eiffel Tower, I think.

739
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,520
 - No, no, no.

740
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,840
 - It's the Lincoln Center.

741
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,680
 - Lincoln Cathedral.

742
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,920
 - In Lincoln, UK.

743
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,760
 - Right.

744
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

745
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,440
 - Not in the United States, yeah.

746
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,240
 And then there was Lincoln Cathedral for 400 years.

747
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,800
 - And also the Duomo, I think was the biggest dome

748
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,080
 in the world until the Royal Albert Hall,

749
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,160
 I think. - Nice.

750
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,000
 - Good fact.

751
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,840
 - Yeah, good stuff.

752
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,440
 - I think this is my favorite fact that came through.

753
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,760
 It's from Justice Goldstein Shirley.

754
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,520
 And it's this amazing thing that Bookland

755
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,080
 is a made-up country.

756
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,920
 - Bookland.

757
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,480
 - Where all books come from.

758
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,320
 - Did that preacher manage to get there to?

759
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,360
 (all laughing)

760
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,560
 - Arthur, bless it.

761
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,400
 - Yeah.

762
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,240
 - With his cross.

763
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,080
 - I don't know if bless it has been there.

764
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,800
 - To me, this is not a good fact.

765
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,440
 This is a poor fact, because it's just mediup-y.

766
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
 - No, no, no, 'cause it's where all books come from.

767
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,960
 - Ah, but no.

768
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,960
 - I've been to a place where books are printed.

769
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
 It wasn't in Buckland.

770
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,800
 - You went there as well, didn't you, Andy?

771
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,960
 Not at the same time as me.

772
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,480
 (all laughing)

773
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,000
 - Basically, as they say,

774
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,600
 I've just learned a fact you all may enjoy.

775
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,080
 According to their barcodes,

776
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,160
 all published books come from a country called Bookland.

777
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,360
 And it's because when barcode numbers

778
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,680
 were being standardized in the 1980s,

779
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,760
 the first three digits of all barcodes

780
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
 of like, products, you buy in shops, whatever,

781
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,480
 were assigned according to a country of origin.

782
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,360
 But books already had ISBN numbers.

783
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,200
 And so they didn't wanna completely change the system

784
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,800
 for books, so they thought,

785
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,240
 we're just gonna add a country onto the front

786
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,360
 of the ISBN numbers, a little bit added to the barcode.

787
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,040
 But to make things easy, we're just gonna say,

788
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,920
 all books are from the same country.

789
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,760
 And it's 978, which I never noticed every single book

790
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,360
 has the same first three letters at the start.

791
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,200
 Numbers at the start.

792
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,040
 - We're next to a bookcase now.

793
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,380
 - We'd better check.

794
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,220
 - 978.

795
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,440
 - Yeah, this one's got a label on it.

796
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,280
 - How many should we do?

797
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,120
 - 978.

798
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,960
 - Yeah, 978.

799
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,080
 - 978, 978, Katie Hickman's book, 978.

800
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,560
 - Dan Shriver's Impossible Things, 978, out now, out now.

801
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,840
 - Dan Shriver's Impossible Things, 979.

802
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,120
 (all laughing)

803
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,640
 - Yeah, all they've got were on 7-8 at the start.

804
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,480
 - Amazing.

805
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
 - All the numbers, it works.

806
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
 That's great, that's an amazing fact.

807
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,320
 - Anyway, and that's Bookland.

808
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,160
 - Yeah.

809
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,000
 - You're like, this is called Bookland.

810
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,760
 - That's like the shoe shop, having its own zip code.

811
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,480
 All books have their own country of origin

812
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,600
 in an non-existent country.

813
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,440
 - Yeah.

814
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,280
 - Love that.

815
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,120
 - Do you want me to do more?

816
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,960
 - Yes.

817
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,780
 - Yeah.

818
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,620
 - Great, I will.

819
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,960
 - I'll cut.

820
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,400
 1986 movie, The Manhattan Projects.

821
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,240
 Is that anyone seeing it?

822
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,080
 - Okay, no.

823
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,880
 - It's about a kid who makes, who, nice.

824
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,760
 (all laughing)

825
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,600
 - It is.

826
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,440
 - It was fine, man.

827
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,720
 - It was quick, it wasn't funny, but it was quick.

828
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,200
 - Was it a fine man?

829
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,040
 - Oh, was it?

830
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,520
 - Oh, wow, Dan, that was good.

831
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,960
 That was high, Brow.

832
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,120
 It's about a kid who makes a nuclear bomb

833
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,640
 and the prop designer took things a bit too far

834
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,720
 and designed a bomb that might actually have worked.

835
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,380
 (all laughing)

836
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,020
 - Is that based on a real story?

837
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,420
 'Cause there was a kid who made a bomb,

838
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,580
 wasn't there, do you remember?

839
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,420
 - Yeah, there was.

840
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,900
 I think that, was that not more recently?

841
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,020
 - Was he a boy scout?

842
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,360
 - I think it was a boy scout.

843
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,380
 - I think it was about then,

844
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,100
 and it was in a shed or something.

845
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,940
 - Yeah.

846
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,780
 - And they had to take a shed

847
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,420
 and bury it in the middle of the desert.

848
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,260
 - That's right.

849
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,420
 - It doesn't claim so,

850
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,500
 but maybe they did plagiarize the story.

851
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,260
 - How do they know it might have worked?

852
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,180
 - Well, this is the thing.

853
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,700
 It said it would have worked,

854
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,100
 but it was minus the plutonium sphere,

855
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,600
 and then I went down such a rabbit hole

856
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,840
 about how you make atomic bombs,

857
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,720
 and basically the plutonium sphere is the center,

858
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,240
 which is quite important.

859
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,080
 - It is the main bears.

860
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,920
 - Yeah.

861
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
 So this is the explosives around it,

862
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,960
 but I ended up looking up.

863
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,800
 - Yeah, but, yeah.

864
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,640
 - But still, you know, you've made,

865
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,480
 you put all the explosives together.

866
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,720
 All you need to do is chuck a plutonium.

867
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,560
 - Exactly, yeah.

868
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,400
 - If you watch the "Mission Impossible" films,

869
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,320
 those things are tenor penny.

870
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,480
 They're constantly being traded across that world.

871
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,160
 (all laughing)

872
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,960
 I love the idea that a prop maker's doing it so well

873
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,320
 that the thing of, like, can you imagine

874
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,520
 if like Michael J. Fox actually disappeared

875
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,200
 when he hit 88 in the DeLorean?

876
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,740
 (all laughing)

877
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,080
 - Barry!

878
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,100
 - Have you guys heard of the demon core?

879
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,200
 - No.

880
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,260
 - It's kind of cool.

881
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,780
 So I looked up plutonium sphere,

882
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,380
 and this is the only thing that comes up.

883
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,820
 It was the third bomb, so it was meant to be,

884
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,220
 the bombs that obliterated Hiroshima and Nakasaki,

885
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,020
 the Americans had a third one ready to go

886
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,020
 if the Japanese didn't surrender.

887
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,500
 They nicknamed it Rufus,

888
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,540
 but it was renamed the demon core.

889
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,180
 But basically, when Japan surrendered,

890
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,060
 they were like, well, we've got this spare

891
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,800
 plutonium core now, let's do loads of experiments with it.

892
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,360
 And these scientists just went nuts with it,

893
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,840
 trying to experiment with how much radiation

894
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,600
 it took to kill you and, you know,

895
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,920
 where you reach the critical point

896
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,440
 where there's a radiation explosion.

897
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,720
 But it kept on going wrong, understandably.

898
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,280
 So there was a scientist called Henry Daglian

899
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,020
 in August, 1945, who went to the lab after dinner,

900
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,080
 which sounds a lot like he had a lot to drink,

901
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,840
 stumbled back to the lab,

902
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,040
 built all these bricks around the plutonium core

903
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,440
 made of tungsten carbide,

904
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,140
 which apparently makes it more and more radioactive.

905
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,460
 And he got to the exact moment where he knew

906
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,220
 if he added one more brick,

907
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,940
 it would suddenly have this radiation explosion.

908
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,580
 - This is your version of "Chengar Game" as well, isn't it?

909
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,220
 It's just gonna add one more brick.

910
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,180
 - It's the most dangerous "Chengar Game" in the world.

911
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,020
 - Wow.

912
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,860
 - For bad kids.

913
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,260
 - Did he add it?

914
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,660
 - No, what he did was he thought, you know,

915
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,700
 what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the bricks away now

916
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,180
 'cause I don't wanna kill myself.

917
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,420
 But he went to take one brick away

918
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,380
 and he dropped it on the core.

919
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,080
 And there was a big flash of radiation.

920
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,000
 It was only for a split second

921
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,640
 and he went and grabbed it and pushed it off.

922
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,720
 But that was enough and within 20 days he was dead.

923
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,000
 - Whoa!

924
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,400
 - Yeah, it's the scariest thing, isn't it?

925
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,520
 'Cause you think, oh, that tingled a bit.

926
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,280
 It's probably fine.

927
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,600
 But it's actually not if it's a plutonium core.

928
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,440
 - Good to know.

929
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

930
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,720
 - Public service.

931
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,160
 - Anyway, that was just the rabbit hole I went down.

932
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,520
 - Wow, that's brilliant.

933
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,360
 - Okay, let's have one last one from Sam Bromley

934
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,520
 who says, "During a bout of hiccups today,

935
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,460
 "I did some Googling and found out

936
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,620
 "that some proven remedies for hiccups

937
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,340
 "include finger in the rectum or a fist."

938
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,380
 - In?

939
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,340
 - I'm afraid there's nothing more to that.

940
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,260
 - The thing is, like, if a finger in the rectum works,

941
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,620
 why go full fist?

942
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,460
 (all laughing)

943
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,340
 Or did it start off with an arm

944
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,740
 and then they felt, actually, just the fist will work.

945
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,580
 And then they're like,

946
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,660
 "Oh, actually, just a few fingers will work."

947
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,420
 - Actually, maybe just give it 10 minutes

948
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,260
 and it will go naturally.

949
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,360
 (all laughing)

950
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,440
 - Certainly it would be a shock.

951
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,480
 You know, you're told to shock someone.

952
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,320
 - I think, yeah.

953
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,380
 - If you start hiccuping

954
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,520
 and someone puts the fist up your rectum,

955
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,860
 then that will be a shock.

956
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,700
 - Yeah.

957
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,020
 - And it's worth two in the bush right here,

958
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,520
 is the fist in the...

959
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,440
 - A fist on the arse is worth it.

960
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,160
 (all laughing)

961
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,000
 - Tandy.

962
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,840
 - Sorry.

963
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,660
 - Jesus Christ.

964
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,980
 - Sorry.

965
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,360
 - I bought my wife something called Hickaway.

966
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,200
 - What?

967
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,040
 - Hickaway.

968
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,860
 - Right.

969
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,800
 - Anti-hickup thing.

970
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
 - What shape is it?

971
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,960
 (all laughing)

972
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,600
 - Mechanical arm that just...

973
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,840
 - It's not that.

974
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,680
 - What is it?

975
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,600
 - It's a thing that you drink from,

976
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,600
 but it's like a straw

977
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,880
 and it's supposed to be proven to get rid of hiccups

978
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,480
 'cause my wife suffers from hiccups.

979
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,080
 - James, I'm here to tell you

980
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,600
 that you have given your wife the fist,

981
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,720
 whether you know it or not.

982
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,560
 - Okay.

983
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,400
 - That's what the fist is.

984
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,040
 So a finger in the rectum study,

985
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,840
 and he has cited studies

986
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,440
 which actually show a finger up the rectum works,

987
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,920
 but the fist is something completely different, F-I-S-S-T,

988
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,040
 and it stands for Forced Inspiratory Suction and Swallow Tool,

989
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,280
 and it is the Hickaway.

990
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,600
 - Oh.

991
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,520
 - So you've fisted your wife with that, even knowing it.

992
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,200
 - Stop it, Anna, this is the bluest joke.

993
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,040
 - It's just facts.

994
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,120
 - So what is it?

995
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,840
 - It's a straw that's particularly hard to suck,

996
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
 I think, isn't it?

997
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,520
 - Why does the finger work out of curiosity?

998
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,480
 - Surprise.

999
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,640
 - No, 'cause if I'm doing it to me,

1000
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,800
 that's not a surprise.

1001
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,640
 - I think it will still be a surprise.

1002
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,480
 - I'll be surprised.

1003
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,560
 (all laughing)

1004
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,560
 - It's not a surprise to yourself.

1005
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,040
 It's like trying to tickle yourself.

1006
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,880
 You can't tickle yourself.

1007
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,320
 - I believe if you're schizophrenic,

1008
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,800
 you can shock yourself with a figure up your own penis.

1009
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,400
 - Right, there we go.

1010
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,880
 - No, I think, is it, they just nerve stuff, I think.

1011
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,920
 - I actually didn't read the study.

1012
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,800
 It's a digital rectum massage that you can give yourself,

1013
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,400
 but I felt like I'd gone deep enough.

1014
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,640
 - The only thing I remember about putting a finger

1015
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,480
 at the bottom is it's the way

1016
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,120
 to get a dog to stop biting you.

1017
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,760
 - Oh, the dog's bottom or your own?

1018
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,280
 - It's the dog's.

1019
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,800
 - The dog's like, "That's disgusting.

1020
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,520
 "What a bite of this guy."

1021
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,360
 - Thank God you clarified, though, Adam.

1022
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
 There will be someone out there

1023
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,880
 who will remember that little nugget one day.

1024
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,800
 He died bitten by a dog with his finger up his arse.

1025
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,080
 We can't quite work out.

1026
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,660
 (upbeat music)

1027
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:14,520
 - Okay, it's time for facts number three.

1028
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,800
 And that is Dan.

1029
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,320
 - Yep, so we've been sent in a fact here

1030
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,200
 by John Waldrop from 1934 to 1947.

1031
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,640
 And then from 1951 till his death in 1954,

1032
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,560
 the mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana, was Harry Bowles.

1033
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,400
 Very good.

1034
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,560
 Yeah, I sort of, I remember mentioning him years ago

1035
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,160
 on the show, but I don't think it made it

1036
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,000
 to an edit in the end.

1037
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,240
 - It's called Harry.

1038
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,600
 - He's called Harry Bowles, B-A-A-L-S.

1039
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,080
 The pronunciation is that because he was once

1040
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,160
 on a radio show with a guy called Bob Chase

1041
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,000
 who wasn't quite sure what to say in the moment.

1042
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,560
 And so he pronounced the mayor's name Bales.

1043
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,600
 So he said, "Mayor Bales is with us."

1044
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,640
 And he called him on it and he said,

1045
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,520
 "Son, this is your mayor.

1046
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,440
 I pronounced my name Bales."

1047
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,960
 So he was very into that.

1048
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,360
 But yeah, he seemed to be a quite an interesting character.

1049
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,840
 He did a lot of stuff for the city.

1050
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,400
 He sort of helped to build underground storage systems.

1051
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,680
 He launched lots of city departments,

1052
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,520
 lowered the city tax rates, liked Guy by all accounts.

1053
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,960
 I looked him up on eBay and you can find...

1054
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,720
 - You can buy him for 12 nights, Guy.

1055
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,920
 - Yeah, he's available now.

1056
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,080
 - No, there's a lot of like of the old paraphernalia

1057
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,320
 that you can buy from his, I guess, election time

1058
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,280
 and just general stuff.

1059
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,200
 And I can't tell which ones are genuine or not,

1060
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,920
 but it's, you know, on the badges it will say stuff like,

1061
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,680
 "I'm proud of my Harry Bowles."

1062
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,440
 You know, stuff like that.

1063
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,120
 So they obviously leaned into it.

1064
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,200
 And apparently one of the most stolen street signs

1065
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,840
 that you can get in the States is Harry Bowles Drive.

1066
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,640
 And that's constantly being...

1067
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,160
 Yeah, so they had to rename it to HW Bowles Drive,

1068
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,000
 just to avoid that.

1069
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,240
 - I kind of feel like the balls bit

1070
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,760
 is kind of part of the problem.

1071
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,040
 - Yeah, exactly.

1072
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,160
 But yeah, so yeah, thank you very much to John Waldrop.

1073
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,720
 Here's an interesting one that we got sent in.

1074
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,920
 Someone was saying that, "I love the show."

1075
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,840
 - Oh, that's great.

1076
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,680
 - Yep, pretty nice.

1077
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,520
 - Move on to the next one maybe.

1078
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,360
 - Yeah, so this is from Jessica Ackerman.

1079
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,200
 "I love the show."

1080
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,440
 In episode 538, Anna's fact is that

1081
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,840
 there are only two colors of cat.

1082
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,000
 As a cat lover, I love the conversation.

1083
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,640
 And I have a rad fact about cat allergies to share.

1084
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,740
 We can use chickens to make cats less allergenic.

1085
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,880
 Okay, this is how it's done.

1086
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,520
 The protein, FelD1, is responsible for around 90%

1087
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,760
 of cat allergies in humans.

1088
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,720
 The protein is found in cat saliva.

1089
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,000
 Scientists have found that chickens raised

1090
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,660
 in the proximity to cats develop an antibody to FelD1

1091
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,200
 called IgY.

1092
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,880
 That is passed into the yolk.

1093
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,720
 If you feed a cat egg yolks

1094
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,640
 from the cat exposed chickens,

1095
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,220
 the IgY antibody will cause the cat's body

1096
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,920
 to produce less of the FelD1 protein,

1097
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,480
 thereby lessening the allergen that most humans react to.

1098
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,160
 - So sorry, keep a chicken near your cat,

1099
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,120
 then feed the cat the eggs that the chicken has laid.

1100
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,960
 - Yes.

1101
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,440
 - And the cat will produce less of the stuff that--

1102
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,680
 - How do I convince my cat to eat this egg?

1103
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,440
 Do I mix it in with some Evian?

1104
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,280
 - Yeah.

1105
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,120
 (laughing)

1106
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,960
 It's exactly that.

1107
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,280
 You mix it into the cat food.

1108
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,440
 There's also companies now.

1109
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,720
 There's one called Purina that sells a cat food

1110
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,600
 that I believe has it mixed into it already.

1111
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,080
 But the DIY solution, as Jessica points out,

1112
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,240
 is you mix it into the food of your cat.

1113
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,160
 We can't eat the eggs and sort it out on our side.

1114
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,560
 It has to be the cats.

1115
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,080
 - Because then the cat would have to eat you.

1116
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,920
 - Yes.

1117
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,760
 (laughing)

1118
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,600
 That's a great fact.

1119
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,440
 - Yeah, that's so cool.

1120
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,280
 - That's very cool.

1121
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,680
 Well, this is quite similar actually.

1122
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,120
 This is from Zoe Keen.

1123
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,680
 She writes that Dr. Anthony Waddle

1124
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,560
 has created budget frog saunas.

1125
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,080
 And this could be amazing.

1126
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,760
 - I hate it 'cause I always spend so much money

1127
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,320
 on my frog saunas.

1128
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,880
 That time someone hit the lower end of the market.

1129
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,800
 (laughing)

1130
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,720
 - So there are frogs that are being wiped out

1131
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,080
 by a fungal infection called chitrid or citrid.

1132
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,320
 - CHY, TRND.

1133
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,800
 - It's a really big problem, isn't it?

1134
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,640
 So there are these rare frogs in places like Hawaii

1135
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,760
 which are just dying by the 1000

1136
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,960
 because they're just getting these fungal infections.

1137
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,800
 - Yeah, so it's thought to have caused

1138
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,400
 90 species to go extinct.

1139
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,680
 A decline of a further 500 species.

1140
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,880
 It's a big, big problem.

1141
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,640
 And the idea is that once this fungus

1142
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,880
 reaches an environment where the frogs are living,

1143
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,960
 it's pretty much impossible to save them.

1144
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,800
 That's what it's been like up until now

1145
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,920
 until Dr. Anthony Waddle comes in with his frog saunas.

1146
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,000
 'Cause what he's worked out is that heat treatment

1147
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 will prevent frogs from croaking as Zoe has written.

1148
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 So they set up basically,

1149
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,280
 they set up a bunch of experiments

1150
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,920
 where they put frogs into a sauna-like condition.

1151
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,760
 It was very heated.

1152
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,880
 They made it so that it was fun for them to be in there.

1153
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,840
 And they noticed that the frog--

1154
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,160
 - They're sorry, how did they make it fun?

1155
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,000
 - Well, I guess.

1156
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,840
 - They said, "You can pour the water on the cold."

1157
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,480
 - Lovely, fluffy towels so that they make sure

1158
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,720
 there's a good storage unit for all their gold

1159
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,880
 and watches and all that.

1160
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,800
 - Relaxing music.

1161
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,160
 You don't go to a bunch of saunas, do you?

1162
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,800
 - Where's the gold locker, sorry.

1163
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,800
 - Now we have to do, you gotta take off all the jewelry.

1164
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,200
 - Oh, like your wedding ring or the thing.

1165
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,080
 - Yeah, it sounded like you were turned up

1166
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,440
 with a huge chain.

1167
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,640
 Also, Dan, you shouldn't really take off your wedding ring

1168
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,800
 when you go into the sauna.

1169
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,640
 I know.

1170
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,520
 - Shouldn't you?

1171
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,700
 I don't know 'cause I don't use saunas,

1172
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,040
 they're not burned through your fingers.

1173
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
 - It's a message, doesn't it?

1174
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,020
 So, okay, so basically the idea is that they created

1175
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,240
 what are effectively saunas for the frogs to be in

1176
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,360
 and they discovered that the frogs seem to have an immunity

1177
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,040
 once they are in this heated area

1178
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,760
 and that the fungus can't handle the heat and dies off.

1179
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,680
 - Is it if they've caught it, they can be saved?

1180
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,120
 Or is it sort of, do you know what I mean?

1181
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,120
 Is it, do they have to have already contracted the fungus?

1182
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,160
 - Yeah, maybe that builds up an resistance.

1183
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,480
 - It must be 'cause if you just put a bunch

1184
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,800
 of uninfected frogs in saunas, they're also not gonna get it

1185
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,440
 but also you've got a bunch of uninfected frogs stuck

1186
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,760
 in a sauna forever.

1187
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, so hang on.

1188
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,960
 So in the lab, they allowed infected frogs

1189
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,280
 the option of spending time in the warm environment.

1190
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,920
 They sprang up the chance to use the saunas.

1191
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,960
 The fungus could not handle the heat and the frogs recovered.

1192
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,400
 A control group without sauna access stayed infected.

1193
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,600
 - So what they're trying to work out now

1194
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,440
 is how do we create natural saunas for these frogs

1195
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,880
 in these-- - Global warming?

1196
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,360
 - There we go, it's naturally gonna happen.

1197
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,120
 It's gonna be, we're all gonna die except the frogs.

1198
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,280
 - Wow, that's fact, but they can have a turn.

1199
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,320
 - Do you know that fungi are two times more deadly

1200
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,240
 than they were in 1990?

1201
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,580
 - Why?

1202
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,400
 - Because-- - People keeps baffling off

1203
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,240
 onto them.

1204
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,800
 (laughing)

1205
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,160
 - That's so rude.

1206
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,000
 - It's an epidemic.

1207
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,840
 - It is.

1208
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,000
 - Go to a substance that we're putting on them

1209
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,400
 but it's fungicides, basically.

1210
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,600
 - James, sorry, I'd never do this

1211
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,480
 but just a quick request for the edit.

1212
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,360
 Can you just remove all the earlier mentions

1213
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,360
 that animated that so it comes absolutely out of nowhere?

1214
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,600
 (laughing)

1215
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,920
 - Yeah, we're using more fungicides than ever

1216
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,120
 and like if you use too many antibiotics,

1217
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,600
 you get antibiotic resistant bacteria.

1218
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,840
 You can get more anti-fungal resistant.

1219
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,680
 So they're much more dangerous than they were

1220
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,040
 30 years ago.

1221
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,720
 - I've had a thought about this fact that we got in,

1222
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,800
 was it, from Zoe, about the frog sauna one.

1223
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,640
 - Yeah.

1224
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,160
 - You know, it's nice because now we can update a saying,

1225
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,000
 can't we?

1226
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 There's that classic saying, you know,

1227
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,800
 if you put a frog in warm water and raise the temperature,

1228
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,960
 how long, how long before it screams or whatever,

1229
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,400
 or how long before it, you know, panics and dumps out?

1230
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,240
 - It's like a catchy one.

1231
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,080
 - It's the same?

1232
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,920
 - No, but you know-- - It's not the same.

1233
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,760
 - It's like-- - It's like--

1234
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,280
 - It's like, count your chickens without I didn't know?

1235
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,280
 Is this another?

1236
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,600
 - There's a frog in a bath and you raise the temperature

1237
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,400
 and you know, how long before it actually realizes

1238
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,600
 that it's dangerous and tries to jump out?

1239
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,760
 - It's not a saying.

1240
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,360
 - No, but it's a-- - It's a thought,

1241
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,840
 it's a thought experiment. - Use it in like,

1242
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,200
 I make your house, when would you say that to me?

1243
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,160
 - So, for instance, Dan, you know what?

1244
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,080
 These tax rises, they're happening,

1245
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,760
 but they're happening quite slowly

1246
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,840
 and so people don't complain about them.

1247
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
 It's like a frog being in a pot of water

1248
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,360
 and they're getting warmer and warmer and warmer

1249
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,360
 and they never jump out

1250
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,200
 because they never realize it's gotten too hot.

1251
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,040
 - Thank you, exactly like that.

1252
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,600
 - It's like a political option,

1253
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,440
 not the one I would have thought.

1254
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,480
 - That's basically the premise.

1255
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,280
 So this, but is an update

1256
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,040
 because you've got a frog in their sauna and it's nice.

1257
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,080
 It was a more of a slam dunk in my head

1258
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,180
 when I was clamming this.

1259
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,720
 - More than that, really.

1260
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,000
 - Let's move on to Oliver Titcombe,

1261
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,960
 who says, "My fact this week is that Canadian police

1262
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,080
 procedural due south was set in Chicago,

1263
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,640
 but filmed in Toronto.

1264
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,600
 In one episode, the characters crossed the border

1265
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,000
 to reach Toronto.

1266
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,800
 This scene was filmed in Chicago."

1267
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,640
 - It's very nice.

1268
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,880
 - Is that a funny joke of the directors?

1269
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,960
 - I know, I looked into it slightly

1270
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,200
 and that's kind of one of those IMDB factoids

1271
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,680
 that you don't get much more on.

1272
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,520
 Maybe it's out there.

1273
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
 - I never watched you South,

1274
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,000
 but I always assumed it was Canadian, all of it.

1275
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,520
 - It was set in Chicago.

1276
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,520
 - Yeah, which is not in Canada.

1277
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,360
 - I know, right?

1278
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,200
 - So how did you assume it was Canadian?

1279
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,720
 You recognized all the sites of Toronto.

1280
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,560
 Why did they keep referring to Chicago

1281
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,040
 when there's the famous--

1282
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
 - Seattle Tower is right there in the middle.

1283
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,040
 - Hang on, where was it?

1284
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,040
 It was filmed in Chicago.

1285
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,240
 - Filmed in Chicago, no, filmed in Toronto.

1286
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,080
 - Filmed in Toronto, thank you.

1287
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,200
 - I think, I actually didn't look into this bit,

1288
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,840
 but I'm gonna assume that it's a Canadian police show

1289
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,440
 that is based about a Chicago police station.

1290
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,960
 - How, in what senses is it a Canadian police show

1291
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,720
 except that it's filmed in Toronto?

1292
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,040
 - The show follows the adventures

1293
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,000
 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

1294
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,320
 What are they doing in Chicago?

1295
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,160
 - What is going on then?

1296
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,960
 - Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1297
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,440
 Who first came to Chicago

1298
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,040
 on the trail of the killers of his father?

1299
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,880
 - I see.

1300
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,200
 - I see, so it's a mountain.

1301
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,520
 It's like a fish out of water

1302
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,920
 or a frog out of sauna.

1303
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,760
 - Right.

1304
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,000
 - It goes to Chicago.

1305
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,080
 I think this would have been helped

1306
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,520
 if any of us had seen due south.

1307
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,080
 - Yes, also Oliver's email was a bit longer

1308
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,920
 and I cropped it to just that one paragraph.

1309
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,960
 So he actually did explain a little more,

1310
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,920
 but I thought, I'm sending it to Dan,

1311
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,320
 I've just gotta include the first paragraph.

1312
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,160
 - Yeah, yeah.

1313
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,320
 - The show's format looked at the stereotypical differences

1314
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,240
 between Canadian and American culture at the time.

1315
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,200
 - That sounds quite good.

1316
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,880
 - Created by Paul Haggis.

1317
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,320
 - Great name.

1318
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,440
 - I want to see this show where he goes to Scotland.

1319
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,280
 - Yeah.

1320
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,680
 - Okay, another fact from Sarah Ellis.

1321
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,160
 And I'll do this as a quiz question

1322
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,440
 'cause I think it's sort of presented like that.

1323
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,680
 In parts of Australia,

1324
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,520
 there will be two minutes in a day

1325
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,320
 that last for a minute and a half each.

1326
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,760
 Why?

1327
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,840
 - So I've seen the answer.

1328
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,680
 - Okay, yeah, of course.

1329
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,520
 - It came to the inbox.

1330
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,960
 So I'm gonna rule myself out.

1331
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,360
 Or I'll try and trick these others actually.

1332
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,520
 - Okay, go on then.

1333
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,040
 - I'll say it's 'cause Australia's so big

1334
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,440
 they have to stretch the minute.

1335
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,440
 - Oh, that's a good idea, isn't that?

1336
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,680
 - Yeah, I'm gonna go for that.

1337
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,760
 (all laughing)

1338
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,800
 - Can I ask some follow up questions?

1339
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
 - Absolutely, yeah.

1340
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,640
 - Great.

1341
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,760
 Is it just on one particular day or is it every day?

1342
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,840
 - It's every day.

1343
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,840
 - Could you say it one more time?

1344
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,640
 - Yeah, so in parts of Australia,

1345
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,600
 there will be two minutes in a day

1346
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,920
 and those two minutes last for a minute and a half each.

1347
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,120
 - Okay, okay.

1348
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,560
 Do we lose the other minute?

1349
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,320
 'Cause the number of minutes in a day

1350
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,640
 presumably is the same as anywhere else.

1351
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,760
 So we've got an extra half minute from each of those.

1352
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,600
 Have we lost that minute somewhere else?

1353
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,440
 - Yes.

1354
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,240
 - Ah, okay.

1355
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,080
 So they've decided to do away with one of the minutes

1356
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,920
 of the day.

1357
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,200
 - Which minute would you lose?

1358
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,040
 (all laughing)

1359
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,000
 - Ooh, what a question.

1360
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,840
 - I reckon I'd lose the minute

1361
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,480
 of you talking about people spunking over mushrooms.

1362
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,600
 Why would you lose a minute?

1363
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,400
 Well, logically you'd say the first or last minute

1364
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,640
 would be a good one to lose.

1365
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,240
 Maybe the confusion of zero, zero, zero.

1366
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,680
 Like, 'cause in midnight,

1367
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,840
 is it one day or is it the next day?

1368
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,680
 - You're bang on.

1369
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,520
 - Is it really?

1370
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,360
 - Yeah, yeah, that's absolutely it.

1371
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,200
 - Wow!

1372
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,520
 - But where in Australia?

1373
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,360
 This is a bit too hard to get.

1374
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,600
 - I should go on Tom Scott's podcast.

1375
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,600
 - This is too hard to get.

1376
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,440
 - We can get it.

1377
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,280
 - It's a bit misleading.

1378
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,000
 - How many places in Australia rather?

1379
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,200
 Sydney or Melbourne?

1380
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,360
 (all laughing)

1381
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,760
 - Have we heard of this place?

1382
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,040
 - It's not a place.

1383
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,600
 It's a, let's say it's a--

1384
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,440
 - The exact center.

1385
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,720
 - It's an institution.

1386
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,560
 Help me out, Andy.

1387
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,480
 - With the space agency?

1388
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,320
 Straight on.

1389
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,160
 - GPS.

1390
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,600
 - Think, like, they're related to that.

1391
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,080
 Who invented GPS?

1392
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:00,920
 Who owned GPS?

1393
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,760
 - NASA.

1394
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,080
 - And the--

1395
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,040
 - And the Space Force.

1396
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,000
 - And the American, they've got big guns.

1397
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,840
 - Army.

1398
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,680
 - The army!

1399
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,520
 (laughing)

1400
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,360
 - Wait a minute.

1401
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,200
 Is he still tricking us?

1402
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,040
 - I can't remember.

1403
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:12,860
 I think, is it the army?

1404
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,680
 - It's the Royal Australian Navy.

1405
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,520
 Oh, sorry.

1406
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,720
 So the explanation Sarah gives is that

1407
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,440
 the Royal Australian Navy uses a 24 hour clock

1408
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,800
 as opposed to 12 hour time.

1409
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,920
 24 hour time starts at zero, zero, zero.

1410
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,760
 And it goes until 2359, as we all know, then resets.

1411
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,080
 Now, some reason they just don't like the zero, zero, zero.

1412
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,080
 So what they do is they make the minute 2359

1413
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,360
 last a minute and a half.

1414
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,720
 And then when it flicks over,

1415
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,200
 it flicks over to zero, zero, one,

1416
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,480
 and that lasts for a minute and a half.

1417
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,320
 And then you move back.

1418
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,140
 - I love that.

1419
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,120
 Wouldn't it be amazing if you could lose,

1420
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,600
 I was just thinking about the minute of the day that I lose.

1421
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,560
 And getting out of bed is the worst moment of the day, right?

1422
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,920
 If you could lose the minute between

1423
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,520
 when you're lying down and when you're standing up.

1424
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,640
 So you could just be like lying down and be like,

1425
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,520
 okay, fine, can I skip ahead a minute now?

1426
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,840
 And then you're standing up.

1427
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,600
 - That's a great premise for something.

1428
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,080
 A story or a film or something.

1429
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,320
 You have a button that you press and it just,

1430
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,160
 I think that's great.

1431
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,000
 - Just give it a minute.

1432
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,840
 Thanks, Andy.

1433
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,120
 And this is a published novelist here.

1434
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,960
 Okay.

1435
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,800
 (laughing)

1436
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,640
 You're saying that?

1437
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,480
 - 978.

1438
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,320
 - 978.

1439
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,160
 - 978.

1440
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,000
 (laughing)

1441
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,580
 (upbeat music)

1442
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,880
 - Okay, it's time for the final facts of the show.

1443
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,080
 And those are my ones.

1444
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,360
 So get ready guys, 'cause these are the really good ones.

1445
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,560
 Right, these are the creme de la creme.

1446
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,000
 So here is a great one.

1447
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,360
 This is from Derek Dayerman.

1448
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,720
 And he writes, I'm a train operator

1449
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,560
 on the New York City subway.

1450
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,440
 And I noticed the most bizarre Shakespearean coincidence

1451
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,040
 within the system that I want to share with you.

1452
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
 This is great.

1453
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,360
 The fact is the Romeo train goes through the Montague Tunnel

1454
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,880
 and the Juliet comes close but never gets to join it.

1455
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,000
 Okay, this is insane.

1456
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,400
 And I'm pretty sure this is a Derek-generated fact.

1457
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,840
 I think he's the first person to notice this,

1458
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,680
 which is so cool.

1459
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,500
 - Okay.

1460
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,640
 - So there are all these subway tunnels

1461
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,320
 connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn, right?

1462
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,280
 One of them is called the Montague Tunnel.

1463
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,400
 - Presumably not named after the family

1464
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,480
 in Romeo and Juliet.

1465
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,940
 - No, it gets its name from the street

1466
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,680
 that it runs underneath once it reaches Brooklyn,

1467
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,680
 which is the Montague Street.

1468
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,840
 So in New York, the subway lines,

1469
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,360
 they just have a letter or a number.

1470
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,880
 You know, the A train, the B train.

1471
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,880
 - Is it like alpha and beta?

1472
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,680
 - Well, they do the phonetic alphabet.

1473
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,760
 So train crews on the R train call themselves Romeo's

1474
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,200
 and train crews on the J train call themselves Juliet's.

1475
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,840
 And the R train goes through the Montague Tunnel.

1476
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,400
 There are tracks which would allow the J and Z trains

1477
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,800
 to also use the Montague Tunnel,

1478
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,400
 but they aren't used in passenger service.

1479
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,040
 They both terminate just before the entrance to the tunnel.

1480
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,040
 So Juliet never gets to join Romeo through the Montague Tunnel.

1481
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,240
 I just think that's great.

1482
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,080
 Brilliant.

1483
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:45,920
 - So good.

1484
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,760
 - Brilliant.

1485
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,580
 - Well done.

1486
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,420
 - Do you want to hear, this is a great,

1487
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,600
 this is an Australian one.

1488
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,440
 We'll go to Australia soon.

1489
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,280
 - Okay.

1490
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,280
 - This might be helpful.

1491
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,320
 From Will Davies, from Emerald Beach, New South Wales.

1492
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,960
 Familiar to any of them?

1493
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,120
 - Yeah, it's by the coast, I think.

1494
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,960
 - Nice.

1495
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,880
 - I'll do this one as a riddle as well, actually.

1496
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,600
 The third largest airline in Australia

1497
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,640
 does not charge its passengers to fly.

1498
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,880
 Whoa.

1499
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,720
 - Is it?

1500
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,440
 - So it's going to be animals that it's...

1501
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,280
 - Yeah.

1502
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,040
 - Some sort of freight or military.

1503
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:16,880
 - Flying doctors.

1504
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,040
 - Not freight, it's not...

1505
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,880
 James has got it.

1506
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,720
 - Oh.

1507
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,560
 - Flying doctors.

1508
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,400
 - Why?

1509
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,600
 - The third largest by fleet size.

1510
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,640
 So I suppose that's not total passenger capacity

1511
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,040
 but number of planes you've got

1512
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,200
 'cause they're quite small planes.

1513
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,400
 So yeah, it's flying doctors.

1514
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,720
 Who I don't think we've ever spoken about.

1515
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,680
 - No, no, how does, what are they?

1516
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,200
 - Well, they, they're as it sounds, as it sounds.

1517
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,200
 - As it sounds, but is it like if you call an ambulance

1518
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,760
 in the outback or you've been hit by a kangaroo,

1519
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,800
 then you call and a doctor has to get to you.

1520
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,760
 - Yeah, or something even less stereotypical than that.

1521
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,400
 - I don't know, one of the cocks went in my eye from my hat.

1522
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,480
 - The little roo fell on me.

1523
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,080
 Yeah, that kind of, yeah.

1524
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,560
 - I guess 'cause you'd normally have just the paramedic go

1525
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,680
 and then take them to another place.

1526
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,960
 - Yeah, but some of these places are so remote

1527
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,440
 and they're not very low, but small populations.

1528
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,600
 And so you just need,

1529
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,400
 if you need a doctor within a couple of hours.

1530
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,240
 - Yeah.

1531
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,840
 - The reason I actually knew about it

1532
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,120
 is probably 10 years before due self came out,

1533
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,160
 there was a TV show called The Flying Doctors,

1534
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,040
 which was, I didn't really watch it,

1535
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,600
 but I knew that it was about this.

1536
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,920
 - Yeah, I used to watch it back home.

1537
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,640
 Yeah, it was a sort of staple of, you know,

1538
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,320
 along with home and away and all that.

1539
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,360
 - Okay, here's a bonus quiz.

1540
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,480
 This is something, 'cause I was reading a bit

1541
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,000
 about The Flying Doctors. - Yeah, yeah.

1542
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,500
 - So they, if they're landing in the dark,

1543
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:31,760
 places they're flying to are not equipped with airports,

1544
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,240
 most of them. - Right now, I know.

1545
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,960
 - So what they want is proper sort of flares

1546
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,640
 or electric lights on the runway to clearly mark out

1547
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,960
 where they have to land at night.

1548
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,480
 So if you are landing somewhere

1549
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,920
 which doesn't have those lights,

1550
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,480
 what is the best alternative

1551
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,920
 that The Flying Doctors like to use?

1552
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,200
 - Pumpkins.

1553
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,520
 - Fireflies. - Not bad.

1554
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,600
 Biomanescence. - Biomanescence.

1555
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,960
 - It's... (laughing)

1556
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,360
 You have to breed some phosphorescent shrimp to,

1557
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,800
 and you chuck them out of the tanks,

1558
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,080
 you just throw the aquariums.

1559
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,240
 Every community under 20 people in Australia

1560
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,680
 has millions of shrimps on a sand bike.

1561
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,880
 If someone takes their leg.

1562
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,720
 - No, it's... - Phones.

1563
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,040
 - You are setting-- - Hold your phone up.

1564
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,240
 - That's a really nice idea.

1565
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,200
 You are setting light to something.

1566
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,840
 What does every house have?

1567
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,840
 - A netflix. - A washing machine.

1568
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,840
 - Gold. - Safe.

1569
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,600
 (laughing)

1570
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,640
 - Evian. (laughing)

1571
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,160
 - It's a dunny roll.

1572
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,600
 - Oh, okay. - It's new roll.

1573
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,440
 What you do is you soak toilet rolls in diesel

1574
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,680
 and you just line them along your impromptu runway

1575
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,840
 and set fire to them and they burn for half an hour.

1576
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,680
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1577
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,360
 - And the pilots can, and if you can't do that,

1578
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,720
 if for whatever reason you've got to the end

1579
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,200
 of your last roll, maybe that's the crisis

1580
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,840
 that you're calling the fine doctors for,

1581
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,560
 then you have four cars with their headlights

1582
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,040
 at the corners of your runway.

1583
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,880
 - Ah, nice. - Just have to put

1584
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,360
 on their headlights. - Very cool.

1585
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,080
 - Flying doctors. - They're awesome.

1586
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,720
 - Here's one from Henry Biggs.

1587
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,520
 Until the mid-1920s, Italians drove

1588
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,600
 on both sides of the road.

1589
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,320
 - Well, we all drive on both sides of the road

1590
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,960
 'cause that'd be a complete waste of road.

1591
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,520
 - Yeah, so you mean one way.

1592
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,960
 - What? (laughing)

1593
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,400
 - It's not like you look at a road

1594
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,160
 and the only half of it's really used.

1595
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,080
 - Oh, we're in pedantry cul-de-sac now.

1596
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,200
 They drove on the left and the right.

1597
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,280
 - Okay. - In the same direction.

1598
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,120
 - Thank you.

1599
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,760
 - Why did they do such a thing?

1600
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,720
 - Well, Italy largely adopted driving

1601
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,880
 on the right as law in 1912,

1602
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,640
 but in some cities with tram networks,

1603
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,440
 drivers would have to switch to driving on the left

1604
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,360
 as they approach the city centre.

1605
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,760
 Quite confusing.

1606
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,240
 - You know what, I once drove the wrong way

1607
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,280
 round and round about in Italy

1608
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,760
 and they were very annoyed,

1609
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,720
 the people who were also on the roundabout.

1610
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,080
 - But I should have just said,

1611
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,160
 I thought we were still in 1912.

1612
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,200
 (laughing)

1613
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,360
 - That would have calmed it down.

1614
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,360
 Yeah, but weirdly, they think the Romans drove on the left.

1615
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,560
 So I looked into this a bit off the back of the road.

1616
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,400
 - Yeah, I think that's true, isn't it?

1617
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,000
 They look at the ruts in the road and stuff.

1618
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,840
 - You've got it.

1619
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,680
 - Wow.

1620
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,520
 - Oh, that's gonna be a little quiz.

1621
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,360
 - Oh, I'm sorry.

1622
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,200
 - No, that's quite all right.

1623
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,040
 Just forget.

1624
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:57,880
 Okay, Dan and Anna, forget you had that.

1625
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,200
 (laughing)

1626
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,360
 - I can't believe James doesn't even eat

1627
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,720
 the quiz question at this point.

1628
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,560
 (laughing)

1629
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,640
 It just comes in with the answer.

1630
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,920
 (laughing)

1631
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,320
 - How do we know they weren't just always reversing, though?

1632
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,160
 - That's true.

1633
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,600
 - Well, it was 1998, they worked out,

1634
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,920
 'cause there was a quarry near Swindon.

1635
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,380
 And archeologists found it,

1636
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,560
 and they found the ruts on the,

1637
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,920
 so if I'm looking at the quarry for a distance, right?

1638
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,960
 The ruts on the right hand side of the road

1639
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,720
 are deeper than the ones on the left.

1640
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,200
 So what they think is that carts were arriving lighter

1641
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,960
 on the left, 'cause they're not weighed down,

1642
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,920
 and then they're weighed down with stones

1643
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,680
 as they're leaving, so the ruts are heavier.

1644
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,000
 So that's how they can tell which side of the road

1645
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,840
 was driven on.

1646
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,680
 - Very cool.

1647
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,000
 - That is amazing.

1648
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,480
 - It's a great detective work.

1649
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,320
 One last one.

1650
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,480
 From Adam Wilson,

1651
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,480
 "According to the leading piracy historian,

1652
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,840
 "Marcus Reddica, more people have worked

1653
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,000
 "on the pirates of the Caribbean franchise

1654
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,280
 "than there were ever actual pirates of the Caribbean."

1655
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,120
 (laughing)

1656
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,840
 And it's partly because the number of pirates

1657
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,880
 was so small, he reckons, Marcus Reddica,

1658
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,480
 who is probably a very eminent historian,

1659
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,120
 that there were 4,000 total ever cumulative pirates.

1660
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:03,960
 Yeah.

1661
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,680
 Imagine that, like 4,000 of them,

1662
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,640
 and what they have influenced.

1663
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,360
 Every child pretends to be a pirate.

1664
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,880
 Honestly, it's incredible, 4,000 people.

1665
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,000
 - And they are pretending to be golden age pirates.

1666
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,120
 - Yeah, probably they're pretending

1667
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,760
 to be 100 of those, right?

1668
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,520
 Most of them wouldn't have been army hearties.

1669
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,200
 (laughing)

1670
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,200
 - Yeah.

1671
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,040
 - That's amazing.

1672
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,880
 Only 4,000.

1673
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,440
 - I know, and I presume the number of people

1674
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,240
 who work on the, I presume even the graphics department

1675
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,800
 for one pirates of the Caribbean, yeah.

1676
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,280
 - There have been about 4,000 of the films

1677
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,120
 that I've seen on the internet.

1678
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:34,960
 - Yeah, that's true.

1679
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,540
 (upbeat music)

1680
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,480
 - Okay, that's it.

1681
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,920
 That's all of your facts.

1682
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,160
 Please keep sending them in to podcast@qi.com.

1683
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,840

00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,440
 and some of them may get read out.

1685
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,000
 So that's an added incentive.

1686
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,280

 And if you enjoyed this kind of show,

1700
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,160
 slightly different format, we actually have a club,

1701
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,680
 a secret, private, highly publicized members club.

1702
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,720
 It's called Clubfish.

1703
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,920
 It's so much fun for a few quid a month.

1704
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,640
 You get ad-free episodes, and you get bonus content,

1705

 including Drop Us Align,

1706
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,200
 which is already in the feedback bit,

1707
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,080
 which is very funny.

1708
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,720
 It's not dissimilar to what you just heard.

1709
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,920
 - No, audience is funny in the podcast.

1710
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,160
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it's really,

1711
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,240
 it's, you know, I think a lot of the intellectual life

1712
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,600
 is happening in Clubfish at the moment.

1713
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,400
 You know, it's the salon.

1714
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,520
 - It's the sauna.

1715
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,520
 - It's the sauna.

1716
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,360
 So, whip off your wedding ring,

1717
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,760
 pop your gold in the safe, and step on down.

 It starts soon.

1728

 There are still some tickets left for some of the UK dates.

1729
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,720
 Australia and New Zealand is mostly sold out at this stage.

1730
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,760
 - Gothenburg, Andy?

1731
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,760
 - And we're going to Gothenburg.

1732
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,360
 We're going to Gothenburg for the Book Festival

1733
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,240
 on the 27th of September.

1734
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,440
 That's going to be a fantastic fun.

1735
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,760
 We're going to be doing a show there.

1736
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,960
 So if you live in continental Europe,

1737
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,680
 that's your opportunity to see us.

1738
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,240
 And we will be back again with another episode

1739
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,080
 of this show next week.

1740
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:42,920
 We'll see you then.

1741
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,760
 Goodbye.

1742
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,340

1743
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,920
 (upbeat music)

1744
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,500
 (upbeat music)

1745
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,080
 (upbeat music)
