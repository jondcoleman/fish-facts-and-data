00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
 Hi everybody, Andy here, just with a quick exciting announcement before this week's

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.560
 episode of Fish Begins, which is that we are going on tour.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.500
 If you haven't seen this already, we are heading around the entire UK and Ireland with

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.660
 our tour, Nerd Immunity.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.380
 It's going to be so much fun, we're going to be stopping off all over the place.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.820
 Think of a town near you, we're probably playing it.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.300
 Names to stir the imagination, chill the blood.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.800
 Things like Peterborough, Barnstable, Chesterfield, Birmingham, Ipswich, Canterbury.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.820
 We're doing a whole raft in Scotland, we're doing Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Aberdeen.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.960
 We're going to Cardiff, we're going to Belfast and Dublin.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.860
 We're playing the London Palladium itself.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.360
 We cannot wait.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.080
 Every single show, we're going to be doing a brand new podcast in the second half and

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.540
 there will, as always, be a first half stuffed with stupidity, facts, us teasing down about

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.100
 the Mongolian death worm.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.140
 You name it, it's going to be in the show.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.180
 We cannot wait to be out there and we really hope to see you there.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.900
 We know that it may feel strange being in a theatre, a room with actual other people,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.300
 but we cannot wait and we're looking forward to it.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.300
 So if you would like to come and see Nerd Immunity, all you have to do is go to qi.com/fishevents,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.340
 see which is the nearest to you and snap up your ticket now.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.340
 Alright, on with the show.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:39.220
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.740
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.020
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting at a great distance from Anna Tyshinski, Andrew

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.260
 Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.580
 our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.480
 Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.940
 My fact is that for the 1921 Buster Keaton film The Boat, two prop boats were built,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.340
 one designed to float and one designed to sink.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.100
 Unfortunately, the one meant to float persistently sank and the one designed to sink repeatedly

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.100
 stayed afloat.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.140
 Okay, I have a question, why didn't they just relabel them?

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.300
 You know what, you would have been much use on this film, James, absolutely.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.060
 It's so weird, it's such a weird story.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.220
 This is from a book called Buster Keaton's Silent Shorts.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.460
 The film is The Boat, there was a boat in it called Damfino and the movie's technical

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.700
 director was a guy called Fred Gabburi and he built two boats and there were different

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.460
 shots to be filmed basically and yeah, the one which was designed to sink, refused to

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.460
 sink.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.780
 It was bored into it, it had a broken stern, deliberately broken stern and 1600 pounds of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.140
 dead iron weight in it, it just would not sink, stayed afloat and the floater on the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.060
 other hand just repeatedly sank and it had to be stuffed with pumps all the way through

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.380
 the bottom of it to keep it afloat.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.780
 Has anyone seen The Boat?

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.660
 I haven't actually, Anna has.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.300
 Yes, I have and it's dated, I will say it's dated.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.300
 Oh really?

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.300
 Okay.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.300
 Yeah, but it's perfectly good.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.820
 I do think that it's probably pronounced Damfino, The Boat, although obviously you don't

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.100
 want to hear them say it, but there is.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.500
 Did they rhyme it with Rhino halfway through the film in a note?

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.500
 Is that how you?

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.780
 It's really similar, at one point when they're sinking and they're about to drown, they call

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.780
 the coast guard and they say I'm on this boat and the coast guard says what's it called

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:36.260
 and they say Damfino and the coast guard mishears it as Damdefino and it's a hilarious exchange

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.260
 of misunderstanding.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.260
 Very good.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.420
 So back then that would have killed just because misunderstandings have been plowed

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.620
 to death in comedy since, you've got to put yourself a hundred years back and go wow that's

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.820
 the first misunderstanding that's ever happened.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.780
 Do you remember that ever where I think it's for a beer?

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.460
 It's the sailors radioing into a coastal station or something and they're saying help, help

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.000
 we're sinking, we're sinking and it's a German guy on the receiving end and he says listen

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.660
 to this, we're sinking, we're sinking and he says yes, what are you thinking about?

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.580
 No, that's a good joke, that's a classic.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.980
 So he's about how you deliver it, I'm just not sure they nailed the delivery in this.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.180
 In the silent comedy.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.340
 I watched another movie this week which was The General, which is one of his big ones.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.460
 Although at the time it got very bad reviews because it's a movie where he plays someone

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.100
 in the south during the civil war and all the reviewers were from the north and they

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.740
 thought that he was kind of giving some kind of skewed version of history where actually

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.860
 the people who were in the south were heroes who were kind of a little bit misunderstood

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.780
 and maybe they should have won the war after all and stuff like that.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.260
 But actually Buster Keaton, he was part of this kind of weird, I would say conspiracy

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.620
 but there was almost like a cult of people believing that the south was badly done to

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.620
 in the civil war.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.140
 The story sounds really cool of the general because it's based on a true civil war story

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.820
 and the idea was there were Unionist spies in the south and they decided to basically

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.340
 hijack a train and this happens to the film right and the idea was they hijack a southern

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.020
 train and they take over it and then they speed it along towards Chattanooga which I like

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.020
 even though the Chattanooga choo choo is totally unrelated to this train but by coincidence

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.780
 speed it towards Chattanooga and it's like a reverse Wallace and Gromit because they're

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.220
 tearing up the rail and all the telegraph poles and stuff behind it, right?

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.660
 Every scene you look at it and you think this could be Wallace and Gromit.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.660
 Yeah, all the way through.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.660
 It's brilliant.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.660
 It is amazing.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.460
 There's the scene, one of Buster Keaton's most famous stunts is where there's a huge

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.300
 sleeper lying across the track, a huge log of wood basically and he's holding a huge

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.300
 sleeper in his hands.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.860
 He's sitting on the cowcatcher at the front of the train and he has to throw a sleeper

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.300
 which is like tossing the caber basically at the other sleeper to knock it off the track.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.300
 It's a real shot.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.300
 The train is actually moving.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.300
 Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.300
 And he manages it.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.300
 Honestly, I watched it this week.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.100
 It was made in 1927 and I didn't know it was going to happen and I just went, "Whoa!"

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.100
 Yeah.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.100
 It's incredible.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.500
 So that's the thing, like Buster Keaton, so he was part of that big movement of silent

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.660
 comedy that came out with Harold Lloyd and Charlie Chaplin.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.340
 But this is a guy who, born in 1895, basically from the get-go, literally from birth, was

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.340
 into physical comedy.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.100
 Literally from bungee out of the vagina.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.100
 He basically did.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.300
 I mean, his parents were both in Vorderville and he was on the side of the stage every

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.580
 single night, jumping in on their act and he used to go on stage and his parents just

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.180
 used to throw him across the stage.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.180
 So he was known as the human mop, or Mr. Black and Blue, or the little boy who can't be damaged.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.180
 People would be so concerned.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.700
 It sounds like a misery memoir, title, "The Little Boy Who Can't Be Damaged".

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.700
 It really does.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.700
 But in those days, it was entertainment.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.220
 Well, there was a lot of questions about the fact of whether or not there was abuse from

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.700
 his dad as a result of this.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.460
 He always claimed there never was, but a lot of people said, "Yeah, but come on, you were

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.220
 chucking your son around the stage."

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.460
 But he went on stage at the age of one day old.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.460
 Yeah.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.980
 Well, you both say, "Yeah, that was a story."

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.940
 There were lots of stories that they kind of put across because they were a mother and

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.180
 father and child sort of group of three.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.220
 And there are lots of amazing stories about things that happened in their early days.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.740
 I know the one that you're thinking of.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.620
 Well, yeah, one for instance where he caught his forefinger in a clothes ringer, lost the

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.660
 first joint, then gashed his head near the eye with a brick that boomeranged after he

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.740
 threw it on a peach tree, and then, on the same day, he was sucked out of an upstairs

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.620
 window by a passing cyclone that carried him through the air and deposited him in the middle

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.220
 of the street a few blocks away.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.220
 Yeah.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.820
 And that was supposedly the story for why he started going on stage.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.820
 It's mostly...

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.980
 And that's all one day, isn't it?

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.980
 That's all one day.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.980
 It's in it.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.980
 I've got his autobiography here.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.660
 It's called My Wonderful World of Slapstick, and that is an entry in it.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.780
 He said, "I had rolled and revolved about a block from the farmhouse when a man saw me,

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.020
 rushed out, scooped me up, and carried me to safety of the nearest storm cellar, a pretty

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.660
 strenuous day, as anyone will admit, but superb conditioning for my career as the human mop."

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.140
 So my question is, when you read that in someone's autobiography, do you think, "Well, it's

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.420
 in the autobiography, so it must be true," or do you think maybe the rest of the stuff

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.380
 in this autobiography isn't true?

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.380
 True.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.380
 I believe it's all true.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.140
 No, I think he was 20 months old, at that point, we should say.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.140
 No, exactly.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.980
 And there are stories, like he includes in this book that he was named Buster after he

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.140
 fell down a staircase, and Harry Houdini, who was in a partnership with his family, saw

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:24.240
 that and said - they named him Buster, basically, off the back of that - there's so much literature

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.740
 to say that that wasn't the case.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.300
 I don't think the dates work out to them.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.300
 Yeah, the dates weren't working.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.300
 They were in a show with Houdini.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.540
 Oh, they definitely were in a show with Houdini.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.100
 And the thing is, is that he knew Houdini as he was growing up.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.380
 There's stories in this book of him hanging out with him and going to shops and stuff when

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.060
 he was a bit older and when they could converse.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.340
 So he claims it's true, but there was a newspaper report that claimed it was a guy called George

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:48.900
 Purdy, and that was published in Buster's early life, and so it predates it.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.500
 And that's from his dad giving the story.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.940
 If you've been in showbiz your whole life, then you're going to have a few little stories

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.940
 about you, aren't you?

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:55.940
 Exactly.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.700
 But what's amazing is it turns out, from reading this book, that Buster Keaton is the

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.940
 Brian Blessed of American Hollywood.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.820
 Every story is just unbelievable.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.500
 I think that it looks like the best biography of him is by a woman called Marion Mead, who

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.340
 mainly I love it because I love her.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.820
 She did a biography of Dorothy Parker that's amazing, but she had a lovely line, which

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.300
 was something like he layered the stories upon the myths of his life, like layers of

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.740
 a lasagna or something.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.460
 But she did look into his life and looked into the stuff that happened at his early

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.500
 age, and it was very violent.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.620
 So she said by age two, his brushes with death had included near incineration, suffocation,

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.460
 fools, mutilation, and natural calamities.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:38.420
 And there was one time when his parents kept him in a suitcase backstage, and at one point

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.680
 a stagehand walked by, thought someone left that suitcase open, shot it, and they came

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.860
 out at the end of the night and found that he had almost suffocated.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.300
 But he was fine.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.380
 And then that suitcase kind of came in useful afterwards, didn't it?

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.020
 Because they took the handle and they put it on his back, attached it to his clothes,

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.940
 and they would hold onto the suitcase handle and throw him across the stage.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.460
 They used to just, like the stunts, they'd throw him across the stage, they used to drop

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.020
 him into the orchestra pit when he was like two onto a bass drum.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:12.180
 His dad once apparently threw him at a heckler, that was me.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.580
 We're thinking about doing that to you on the next live tour, we all get together.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.780
 But then the father would get arrested, according to Buster Keaton, he said they would get arrested

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:26.500
 every other week, or rather his old man would get arrested, and the police would basically

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.540
 come over and say, why are you abusing your son?

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.140
 And then they would kind of look at Buster Keaton and see if he had all bruises and stuff,

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.540
 and he didn't, apparently, because he could fall so well, and so they kind of let them

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.540
 off every time.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:42.900
 It's weird when you read about him, because you find yourself on the side of Buster Keaton

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:49.260
 against the first ever child protective agency, because, and you wonder if you're reading

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.660
 it right, it was the Jerry Society, it was the first ever protection of children organisation

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.700
 in the world, it had just been set up, and it was chasing down these people, it did seem

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:02.500
 like we're abusing their son, but he remembers them as complete bogeymen.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.520
 And the thing about them that's kind of interesting is they were set up by Elbridge Jerry, who

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:12.900
 was the grandson of Vice President Elbridge Jerry, from where we get the word, Jerry

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.900
 Mandarin.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.900
 Really?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.340
 Yeah, he's the guy who first fingered around with the districts.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.300
 Oh, I was about to ask what that means, but I understand now.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.300
 How rude.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:27.260
 It's where they change the shape of the districts to mean that you're voters in a place where

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.020
 you want them to be.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:34.260
 But another interesting thing about the Jerry Society is that they were started when there

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:39.760
 was a church worker called Etta Agnal Wheeler, and she'd noticed that a child was being mistreated,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.120
 and she wanted to try and get someone to help this child, but there was no one to help them.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.360
 And she realised that there was no charity that was there to look after children.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.760
 But there was an American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and she's

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.360
 like, how can we have a charity for cruelty to animals, but not cruelty to children?

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.320
 And so she went to the person who was in charge of the American Society for the Prevention

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.540
 of Cruelty to Animals, and said, why don't you set up a children's charity?

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.540
 And that's what they did.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.100
 So actually, the children's charity grew from the animals charity.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.100
 Really?

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:16.380
 I thought you were going to say they reclassified children as animals for the benefit of them.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.940
 They got some protection.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.140
 You know the really famous, the really, really, really famous stunt is where the house falls

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:29.180
 on him, around him, and there's a window which falls exactly in the right place that it lands

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.180
 around him.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.440
 So you get two inches of clearance on either side of him for that stunt.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.440
 It's just incredible.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.320
 I can't believe they made it work.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.320
 And he supposedly was nailed to the ground.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.320
 I can't quite believe that.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.080
 He was nailed to the ground.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.760
 His shoes were nailed to the ground to keep him exactly on the right mark.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.760
 Oh, right.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.520
 So that's where the window's going to fall.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.600
 I watched that scene yesterday, and I'm sure he walked away.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.600
 The shot changes.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.240
 I believe the shot changes, and then he leaves.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.520
 But maybe, I mean, possibly it doesn't, and I'm wrong.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520
 That's also, yeah.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.160
 No, I think you would go with nailing to the ground, because you can't look up and

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.900
 check, because otherwise, that ruins the scene.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.740
 I wouldn't want to be nailed to the ground if they're going to drop the house, as in,

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.740
 you might think--

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.460
 Once it hits you, there's not much you can do about it.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.460
 Yeah, that's true.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.140
 Surely you'd want to be nailed to the ground rather than risk getting your boots on, and

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.140
 then thinking, oh, good.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:16.460
 Did I just accidentally step to the left of it?

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.700
 So he was very, very successful for a very long time, had a lot of money, and he used

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.620
 to invest in real estate and so on.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.820
 And one of the things he invested in was a yacht, and he was very proud of this yacht.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.560
 And one day, he was going through troubles in his marriage.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.280
 He went to take his yacht out, and--

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.760
 He tried to sink it to end it all, but unfortunately, he was using the damn final.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:44.360
 No, he went to try and take the yacht out, and the sort of boat master or the person

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.880
 who sort of looks after it said, I'm sorry, you can't.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.120
 It's only your wife who can take it out, and she's told me not to let you.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.640
 And he suddenly discovered that their marriage had fallen apart, and they were getting basically

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.640
 a divorce.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.840
 So he lost his yacht.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.500
 So in retaliation, he bought himself what he called the land yacht.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.500
 Do you guys read about the land yacht?

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.500
 No.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.060
 I read a one-line reference to it, but I didn't find it anymore.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.060
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.060
 So I read into it.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.580
 So he bought a land yacht, which basically he dressed as a captain, and he used to drive

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:15.580
 around, and he would go to all sorts of-- like he would go to hotels, and he'd make a scene

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.580
 of it by saying, we're going to rent out a room, but actually, we're just going to rent

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.460
 out a car park space, and we'll stay in our land yacht.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.460
 Is it like a big sort of vehicle that looks like a yacht?

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.460
 Yeah.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:30.600
 It's like a big bus that had been converted into what was known as a land yacht.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.040
 It does sound awesome on one level, but on the other, he is after divorce sleeping in

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.040
 his car.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.720
 Like there are two ways of looking at the situation.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.640
 He did say, I had as much fun with my land yacht as a man can whose purpose is to forget

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.800
 his whole private world has fallen apart.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.800
 So yeah.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.800
 It was not a good time for him.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.440
 But then he ended up in a sanitarium, didn't he?

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.440
 Yeah.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.440
 And he was in a straitjacket.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.520
 But unfortunately, it's very hard to keep someone in a straitjacket if they're friends

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.340
 with Harry Houdini, so he just got him straight out.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.340
 Yeah.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.340
 Was he really in a straitjacket?

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.340
 Yeah.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.340
 Yeah.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.940
 And the Harry Houdini thing is, I think, falls into the Buster Keaton myth or no, the great

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.940
 tales.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.740
 But he ran away, didn't he, and he got married to the nurse who was looking after him at

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.740
 the time.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.620
 While he was still married to the original life.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.620
 Yes.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.620
 Really?

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.620
 Yeah.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.620
 I mean, he was very drunk all the way through this time.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:18.620
 Well, that's fair enough.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.780
 He might have said, that was very big of me.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.780
 Yeah.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.780
 Yeah.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:27.080
 That'd be another one of those mishearing jokes.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.640
 That would have worked brilliantly on a silent film.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.160
 In his later years, he mostly did TV adverts and his grandchildren didn't know him from

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.160
 any of his films.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.160
 They knew him as the singing puppet advertising Alka-Seltzer on TV.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.160
 Really?

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.160
 Yeah.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.160
 Wow.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.160
 But he loved it.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.160
 He would turn up and do the adverts and then go away again.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.540
 And other silent stars like Charlie Chaplin, I don't think, did Telly.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.540
 They thought it was beneath them.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.540
 They hated Telly.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.540
 Yeah.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.660
 They hated Limelight, which is one of the great silent comedy scenes because it's in

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.400
 the talkies at this point and it's two old men, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, coming

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.100
 together to do a routine on a Vorderville stage.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.040
 And it's just such a beautiful moment because Buster Keaton still wasn't making movies

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:09.140
 and Chaplin gave him this moment again to sort of shine, which was really, really wonderful.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.660
 Because Chaplin, I think, also felt like all of those silent stars, they sort of became

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.900
 much less famous very, very quickly during the talkies and then had his big renaissance.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.600
 So he did get Buster Keaton to have a slightly happy ending.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.460
 He got an honorary Oscar in the late fifties, I think, and all of his films were re-shown

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.820
 in the fifties and sixties and film buffs were suddenly like, "This is genius."

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.300
 And Chaplin as well got, I think he was put up for an honorary Oscar in seventies, in

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.300
 the early seventies.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.300
 Yeah.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.820
 And when he was told about that, he said, "God, does anyone even remember who I am?"

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.820
 Wow.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.980
 Well, because he'd been exiled to Sweden or somewhere like that.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:41.980
 Exiled.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.980
 Yeah.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:43.980
 He got kicked out of America.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.980
 Chaplin had a huge period for--

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.980
 What for?

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.980
 Being a communist.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:47.980
 Yeah.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.140
 I think he left on a holiday and was told he couldn't come back.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.100
 Wait, what's black and white and red all over?

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.100
 Charlie Chaplin.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.100
 Charlie Chaplin.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.100
 Very good.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.100
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.100
 I'll buy that.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.100
 That's great.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:07.380
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:12.860
 My fact this week is that in 1993, America learned that Kazakhstan had enough uranium

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:19.700
 to make 24 nuclear bombs when a U.S. diplomat's car mechanic tried to sell it all to him.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.660
 Oh my God.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.660
 It's very cool.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.860
 It's like, you know, you get your car done and they're always like, "What do you want

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.660
 your wheel trims doing or do you want this doing?"

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.660
 It's upselling.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.660
 Yeah.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.660
 It's major upselling.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.660
 And he bought it as well.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:38.940
 So this was a guy called Andy Weber and he was sort of in charge of defense and nuclear

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.580
 programs under Obama, but in the 80s he was working at the U.S. Embassy in Kazakhstan

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:48.020
 and his car mechanic, who was also kind of a fixer and all-round wheeler dealer kind

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:52.660
 of guy, basically said to him, "Do you fancy some uranium?"

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.220
 And so this guy called the U.S. government and said, "Look, this bloke's just offered

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.900
 me a bunch of uranium," and they didn't believe him.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.780
 But eventually he had a series of meetings and was set up with other people to lead him

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:08.220
 to the uranium and he met with this general, this Kazakh general, who just slipped him

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:14.500
 a bit of paper, which said, "U-235," as in the uranium that can make a nuclear bomb,

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.020
 "90% 600 kilos."

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:22.380
 So for comparison, the Hiroshima bomb used 64 kilos of 80% in rich uranium.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.380
 Okay.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.660
 It was hardcore stuff.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.740
 And so what did he do with this uranium when he bought it?

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.300
 Just kept in his back pocket, useful for any day.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.500
 No, he told the U.S. government and they chatted to the president of Kazakhstan and they agreed

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.140
 that the U.S. should take it in case Iran got it, basically.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.940
 Same old fears.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.180
 And so he was taken to it and shown it and it sounds incredible.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:48.860
 He went to this warehouse, basically, and he found it all in buckets and the buckets

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.460
 were spaced apart.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.620
 So they were on this big table and they were spaced apart because if you have uranium too

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.780
 close together when it's that highly enriched, it does create a massive nuclear explosion.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.460
 So it literally spaced apart to avoid criticality issues.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.460
 Oh my God.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.460
 Isn't that terrifying?

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.580
 What if you've got a small table?

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.940
 He did specify it was a very big table.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:06.940
 It must have been a very big table.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.740
 So it's on the key lines in buckets.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.740
 Yeah.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.740
 It's quite heavy, I think.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.740
 Maybe they had a few trestle tables.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.740
 That kind of thing.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.940
 No, they probably set up some, yeah, trestles.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:15.940
 Yeah.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:16.940
 Yeah.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:17.940
 Pushed on together.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.620
 The extraction process was pretty amazing.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.500
 You had to carry it in a really large plane.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.900
 So it was some of the largest planes in the world that were sent over from America to

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.580
 Kazakhstan to pick it up.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.580
 There was a tiny...

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.580
 Is that because it has to be kept at a certain distance from itself?

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.580
 I think it has to be kept at a distance.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.580
 Yeah.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.580
 And I think there are actually four planes.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.580
 It's a big table.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:39.140
 Now you can now turn down your in-flight tables.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.780
 Why not just take them in separate?

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.280
 Like do a bunch of trips?

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.780
 Why are we getting too close to each other?

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.260
 Well, obviously, more likely of problems if you take them on loads of flights.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.780
 If you take them on one flight, hopefully nothing goes wrong.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.780
 It's like that old saying.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.780
 Put all your eggs in one basket.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.780
 Yeah.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.780
 There was four baskets.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.020
 It was all your uranium and it was four baskets/planes and then they weren't allowed to fly over

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.980
 any countries because basically they're carrying this massive nuclear bomb.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.660
 I think Kazakhstan is landlocked.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.900
 So yeah, they had to get to the nearest sea possible so they had to literally jump from

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:15.700
 like Caspian Sea over hardly any land and because of that, it ended up being the longest

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.380
 flight ever that the US had done and they had to do loads of in-flight refuelling because

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.020
 obviously they didn't have enough fuel to do this massively long flight so they were

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.660
 taking such a roundabout route.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.300
 But for four planes?

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.300
 For four planes, yeah.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.300
 Oh, my God.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.300
 What a nightmare.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.300
 Yeah.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.300
 Hell.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.780
 That's a nightmare situation.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.820
 You wouldn't want to be project manager on that, obviously.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.820
 Obviously.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.820
 Yeah.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.220
 It's not a very can-do attitude that I'm the idol, please.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.380
 What you really need to be doing is, "Okay, guys, this is what we're going to do now."

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.220
 Oh, God, this sounds hard, doesn't it?

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.220
 It's all my hassle.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.780
 That's why I'm a podcasting and not in nuclear material, that's my hassle.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.300
 Have you guys heard about the missing Nazi uranium cubes?

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.300
 No.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.300
 This is amazingly cool.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.300
 That's like an Indiana Jones fly.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.300
 It genuinely is.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.300
 It's amazing.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.380
 We've been working on nuclear fission in the late 1930s.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.220
 Lots of people were working on it at the time, obviously, because it would have been a big

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.220
 advantage.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:10.980
 The German scientists made this really weird cube nuclear reactor, which was 664 cubes

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.100
 of uranium all hanging up near each other, I guess, from the kind of reaction that Anna

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.100
 was talking about.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:21.660
 It was not a proper reactor in the way that we'd understand it, but it was all uranium.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.620
 When the Allies invaded, they took the cubes, which the German scientists as they left had

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.380
 tried to hide by burying in a field.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:32.320
 The Allies had to dig up these cubes and take them away, and it was a chaotic attempt to

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.820
 get hold of them.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.980
 In April 1945, there was a retreating military truck with the cubes on them, and a bunch

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:43.980
 of boys in a town called Garmisch-Partenkirchen, they nicked a load of the cubes and discovered

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.500
 that when you threw them, they would spark when they hit the ground.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.380
 They just were chucking around uranium.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.380
 You know what?

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.380
 I've been to Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.380
 Have you?

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.380
 Yeah, I have.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.300
 When we went there, it was Christmas time, and there was a big marketplace, and there

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.700
 were a load of kids, and they had these little cap things, and they kept throwing them on

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.700
 the floor genuinely.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:02.700
 That was happening.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.700
 No way!

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.700
 Yeah, yeah.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.700
 That's really, that's bizarre.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.020
 You probably should have confiscated those.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.500
 But lots of them are missing now.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.140
 I think I do suspect there is loads of this stuff still lying around, even though everyone

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.020
 claims weapons inspectors blah, blah, blah, they've sorted it out.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.820
 I mean, there's no way.

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:23.340
 Hands, blicks, his ears, they keep coming around now.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.580
 Get back on it, blicks.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.580
 What are you doing?

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.820
 In the 90s, there were US inspectors in Russia who were basically saying Russia was full

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.540
 of these warehouses that had little bits of uranium in them.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:38.220
 He said there was one warehouse stuffed with very highly enriched uranium, and it was locked

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:43.780
 with a bit of rope and a wax seal, which I've opened wax seals on the occasional fashion

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:44.780
 letter.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.780
 And it's not difficult.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.900
 That's really raising a few more questions than it's answered.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.860
 Who's sending you wax sealed letters, Emma?

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.380
 I exchanged letters with past.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.860
 Are you going out with a count from the 17th century or something?

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.380
 We send wax seal.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.380
 Do you?

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.380
 Yeah, we do, yeah.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.860
 Alina uses wax seal a lot.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:02.860
 Really?

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:03.860
 Yeah.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.860
 James and I always correspond that way.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:05.860
 That's why we find that when the podcast.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.780
 He has to write to me.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.140
 What does she use them for?

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.060
 Just kind of cool, like cool seal.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.220
 Well, she just thinks it's cool and Instagram-y.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.380
 So do you have your own, like, harken seal that goes on it?

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.380
 I can't remember.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.740
 She has her own seal, but I don't think it's a harken seal.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.740
 Right.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.740
 Yeah.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:22.740
 That's very cool.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.160
 We did it with you because it was all paper trail, wasn't it, back then, and we've lost

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.160
 the paper.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.160
 We don't know where stuff is.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.380
 50% of this podcast use wax seals.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.700
 That should be the headline fact.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.460
 It's got to be unproportional, and it's not you.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.340
 I mean, that's insane.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:43.940
 Yeah, but like Dan says, it was kind of paper trails, and they basically relied on, they

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.140
 just had fences.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.380
 They had ropes.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:51.140
 They might have had the odd wax seal, but mostly it was just intimidation that stopped

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:52.500
 people from stealing this stuff.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.180
 It was basically like, with a secret police, you better not steal it because you know what

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.180
 will happen.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.020
 And that's basically their only kind of way of stopping people from stealing stuff.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:05.580
 But the problem was that if you lost any uranium, you're getting so much trouble, people just

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.920
 kept it off the books.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.020
 And so that's the reason we don't really know how much of anything there was.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.020
 Interesting.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.020
 Yeah.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.980
 Yeah, you wouldn't want to be reporting that back to Stalin, would you?

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:15.980
 No, no.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.980
 Of course not.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.980
 I've lost a bomb.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:23.180
 And third nuclear power, and you don't hear that much about us, do you?

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:28.940
 And also in this year, the UK has raised the number of nukes that we have, which didn't

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:35.300
 get in the news that much, but we've gone up from the previous cap of 225, our cap is

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.740
 now 260.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.340
 So in a world where like ostensibly at least we're saying, let's get rid of all the nuclear

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:45.140
 weapons, I think there's a lot of re-arming happening around the world at the moment.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.140
 That's very interesting.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.520
 It doesn't feel like those extra 45 are going to make all the difference in one way or the

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.520
 other.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.520
 No.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.620
 If you can think of 220 places to attack and you still want 45 more, I don't know.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.180
 I mean, it's not your priority there.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.100
 Like because what, America and Russia are going to have what, about 6,000 each, 10,000

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.100
 each, something like that.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:08.460
 So our extra 40 might make all the difference in that war.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.860
 40 more than Australia have.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:14.300
 I think, you know, it's not necessarily, you don't have to go fighting the big boys.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.180
 Well, I think that the idea is not to fight anyone.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.180
 I think the idea is...

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.180
 Fight.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.180
 Fight.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.180
 Fight.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.180
 Please God, no.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.460
 I think most people think the idea is a deterrent.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.460
 Yeah.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.460
 I think welcome to the very confusing Cold War philosophy of mutually assured destruction,

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:32.340
 which obviously didn't make any sense at all, but yeah, we've got enough to destroy the

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:33.340
 universe.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.580
 But 17% of British electricity comes from nuclear sources.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:37.580
 17%?

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.580
 I say, well done.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.580
 You know?

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.580
 The positive spin.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.580
 Yeah, me too.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.580
 I mean, not weapons grade though.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.580
 Not weapons grade.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.580
 I don't know.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:50.460
 But Sellefield, nuclear power station, is obviously one of the places where it's generated.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.620
 And Sellefield's a really interesting place.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.620
 They have their own magazine, which I didn't know.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.620
 How interesting.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:59.860
 How often is that issued?

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.000
 That's not a weekly magazine, is it?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.860
 It is weekly, but every week there are half as many pages as in the previous week.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:12.060
 But that's not all that Sellefield has, Dan, because I sense you're being skeptical that

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.060
 that's the most interesting thing.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.060
 I'm just surprised you opened it.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.060
 What's coming next?

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:23.020
 Well, they've got a freezer full of dead seagulls, which is cool, because any mammal that dies

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.300
 in Sellefield, that's our mammals.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.300
 No.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.300
 No.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.300
 All right.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.300
 That's a free seagull.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:35.460
 If animals go into Sellefield and they get too close to the nuclear stuff, then they

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.020
 are considered hazardous, radioactively hazardous.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.380
 And so that can be a gateway to poison the wider area, because obviously you've got these

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.240
 radioactive seagulls flying off, creating mayhem.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.460
 So they're considered putrescent nuclear waste.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.460
 This was reported in 2010.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.700
 They had 350 birds and small mammals in their freezers.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.700
 That's quite a big freezer.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:52.700
 Yeah, it is.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.300
 They'll keep you going in a lockdown.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.300
 Yeah.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.500
 It's quite a big freezer, that's what I was saying.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:02.500
 That's the most interesting fact about that story.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.500
 Picture the freezer.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.780
 You didn't want me to be interested in project management before.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:12.380
 Yeah, what I showed interest in freezer capacity.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:18.420
 Just on nuclear bombs and the hazards of them, America seems to be a bit clumsy with those

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.420
 sometime.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.900
 We've read a few stories where you think, Jesus, you guys got lucky there, really.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:30.700
 So in 1961, there was a plane, and it had a mid-flight situation where all the pilots

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.500
 had to jump out of the plane, evacuate ejector seat out of it, and the plane actually crumbled

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.900
 in the air, and two nuclear bombs dropped from it over North Carolina.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.980
 And they should have gone off, basically, but they found one of the bombs hanging from

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:50.300
 a parachute off a tree, and they looked at it, and basically, for this bomb to go off,

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.620
 four things needed to be activated on it.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.340
 So it's a four-tier system.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:58.340
 Three of those had been activated in the process of it going down, but the fourth didn't go

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.980
 off for some reason.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.780
 As none of them should have gone off, should they?

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.660
 And yet, somehow, three of these extreme safety triggers had just gone off.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.660
 Yeah, we're ready to go.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.700
 That's why you have four, I guess.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.180
 Oh, my God.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:17.460
 But if it went off, each of them had 253 times the power that the little boy bomb had that

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.460
 was dropped over Hiroshima.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:19.460
 Can you imagine?

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.100
 Just one thing didn't go off.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.340
 Is kind of mind-boggling.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:29.420
 We had one in Britain as well in the '50s, didn't we, in Lake and Heath Air Base in Suffolk.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.460
 That was a plane crashed into a nuclear weapons storage facility.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.940
 It was a miracle that the bombs didn't explode, but if they had, we probably would have lost

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.940
 Cambridge.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.940
 Wow.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:40.940
 It was an US official.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:41.940
 Was an Oxford boy?

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:42.940
 A handy-looking happy?

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.940
 No great loss.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:50.980
 One US official said it's possible that part of Eastern England would have become a desert.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.980
 Wow.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.020
 And we only found out about this way, way later.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.780
 But when we look back, the reports said that there was a mass panic when they realized this

00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.780
 has happened.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:04.260
 And when the fire services were going towards Lake and Heath, all they saw was a convoy

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.620
 of Americans just legging it out.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:12.580
 Just cars full of people just panicking and people getting taxis and just saying, "Take

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.660
 me anywhere away from here as quickly as you can."

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.860
 Would you take on that taxi ride as a cab driver?

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.500
 I think I'd say, do you know what, you're a little bit out of my zone, actually.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.940
 I think I might put a search charge on for sure.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:25.940
 Gosh.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.260
 It is just unbelievable nothing ever happened.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.700
 My God, we got lucky.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.060
 There's so many cock-ups.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:36.540
 In 1983, there was this other one, which was when in the Soviet Union, there was a computer

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:41.340
 malfunction, which meant that the guy on duty, Stanislav Petrov, basically received information

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:45.100
 that the US was launching a missile strike on the USSR at that very moment.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.180
 And he was under very strict orders that he should tell his superiors and they would launch

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.460
 a retaliatory nuclear strike.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.140
 And so he watched the siren go off and go like, "Strike, strike, strike."

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.780
 And it said, "This is actually 100% reliable information we've got.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.980
 A second siren, a third, a fourth, a fifth went off."

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:06.540
 And he, for some reason, decided not to tell his superiors, thought, "Do you know what?

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.300
 I think that something's gone wrong here."

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.980
 And he said the only reason he thought that was because the system was too certain.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:19.820
 And he thought it had to pass 28 or 29 security levels to be totally sure that there was a

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.820
 strike.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.100
 And he was like, "I'm not even sure it would do that if there was a strike."

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.860
 So he didn't report it, 20 minutes went by, nothing happened.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.340
 So he thought, "Okay, it was a computer cock up."

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.580
 But he was the only civilian person who was...

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.580
 That's a stressful 20 minutes.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:44.540
 Not even the best episode of Frazier could take your mind off that.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.780
 Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is James.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:53.380
 Okay, my fact this week is that frog hopper insects can shoot their urine away from their

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:57.240
 body 20 times their own body length.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.420
 If they didn't do that, they'd probably drown in their own piss.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:06.520
 Well, good for them that they developed this.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.860
 Bad for frog hopper toilet makers, I guess.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.860
 Yeah.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:10.860
 20 times is quite far, though.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:11.860
 So...

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:12.860
 Quite.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:13.860
 Yeah, give us more.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:14.860
 How would that work?

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.860
 120 feet.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:16.860
 For us.

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.860
 Yeah.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.500
 So you must be pissing a hell of a lot for it to stack up enough that it could drown

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.500
 in their own body.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.600
 Well, they all make really, really good points.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:29.980
 So this was an article that I read recently on iflscience.com and it was about frog hoppers

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:37.100
 and what they do is they drink sap from trees, but they drink xylem, whereas most insects

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.380
 drink phloem.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.940
 So phloem's got loads of sugar, really easy to get to for some reason.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:46.220
 They drink xylem, which is really hard to get to and has very little nutrition.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.340
 Because it has so little nutrition, they have to drink tons and tons and tons and tons of

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.340
 it.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.420
 And I don't need to tell you that if you drink lots and lots of stuff, you need to pee a lot.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:01.220
 So they create loads and loads of urine and really they piss pretty much all the time.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:06.220
 And if they didn't get rid of it somehow, it's going to get in the throat if they had

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.220
 a throat.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.220
 Do they have a throat?

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.700
 Let's not discuss whether they have throats on that.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:17.580
 Anyway, so what they've come up with is a bum-mounted catapult, and what happens is they can urinate

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:24.620
 out of their bodies and this catapult fires the liquid away about 10 centimetres away,

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.420
 which might not sound that far, but they're only about 5 millimetres in length.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.420
 So cool.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:35.820
 But if you're parked at that exact distance from another of these frog hoppers, it's effectively

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:36.820
 a war, isn't it?

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.420
 You're sort of drowning each other in battle.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.420
 What would you do?

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:41.420
 I guess you would.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.420
 Yeah.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.420
 I mean, you'd move.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.420
 You'd step to the side.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.420
 Yeah.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.420
 Yeah, solve that.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.340
 And they're having to go to all of this effort, I think, just because they didn't pay attention

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:53.660
 in GCSE biology, the xylem carries the water, the phloem carries the sugars.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.660
 You idiots.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:55.660
 Exactly.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:56.660
 Exactly.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.660
 I mean, why are they doing it?

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.260
 But the amount of urine that they produce, particularly when they're babies, they're

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:07.060
 nymphs, they produce between 150 and 280 times their own body weight in urine every single

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.340
 day.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.340
 Every single day.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.340
 So great.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.340
 It's nuts.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.900
 So I was talking to Ethan, one of the elves about it.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.180
 So I weigh roughly 80 kilograms, roughly that.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:22.900
 So that would be me producing 22,400 litres of urine a day.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:23.900
 That's what they do.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.460
 So basically 74 bathtubs worth of urine.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.460
 Wow.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:28.460
 Is that full baths?

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.460
 Full baths.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.460
 Yeah.

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.460
 Gosh.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:32.460
 74 bathtubs full of urine.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.460
 An arresting image.

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.460
 It is.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.960
 Where do you get that many bathtubs?

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.180
 You'd have to go to a showroom.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:40.940
 You'd have to go to John Lewis and they won't be happy about it.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.180
 I see you coming.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.180
 Oh no.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.180
 Here's Dan.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.180
 Here's Pissy Shriver.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.780
 Oh, frog coppers.

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.780
 Frog coppers are amazing.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.780
 They're amazing.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:55.060
 Like Hannah said, they're stupid because they suck out xylem, which is really hard

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.060
 to suck out.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.620
 It's not only got no nutrition, it's really hard to suck out.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.300
 So it means they have to be really, really good at sucking.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.300
 Oh yeah.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.940
 They've got record breaking sucking powers, haven't they?

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.180
 They are suckers in nature.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.820
 I think 80 times more powerful than an elephant sucks, I think.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:11.820
 I mean, yeah.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.660
 They're incredible jumpers as well.

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.140
 Their jumping is extraordinary.

00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:20.220
 So they can get to the heights of 70 centimetres and they're only six millimetres long.

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.260
 So that's a huge jump.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:27.180
 And what's amazing is that they use their back legs in order to do the jumping.

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:30.300
 But the back legs are basically specialised to be used for that.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.580
 So when they're walking around normally, they're just dragging them along, not being

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.580
 used.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.620
 They're coming along and then as soon as they want to jump, they cock them into position

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.340
 and then just fling themselves.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:44.420
 They can sometimes ratchet up the strength in their back legs.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:48.140
 So they kind of prepare a jump in advance and then they don't jump.

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:49.140
 Oh.

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.140
 You see what I mean?

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:53.620
 They have a locking mechanism in their legs, which means they can keep the potential energy

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:54.620
 high.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.980
 So they are a coiled spring and then they just walk around on their front four legs and drag

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:05.100
 along these heavily loaded back legs with them so they can make a getaway, I guess.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.380
 And then they exert massive amounts of G-force on themselves, don't they, when they go flying

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.380
 through the air.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:14.020
 So they exert a G-force of over 400 G.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.980
 That's what they generate when they jump up.

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:20.460
 And for comparison, an astronaut who goes into orbit gets G-force of about 5G.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.100
 And so that's a lot.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.100
 If it was a human, we wouldn't survive.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.980
 And 5G is very bad for you, isn't it?

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:27.980
 Sorry.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:28.980
 Gives you COVID?

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:34.020
 Yeah, yeah, I've been watching a lot of David Ike stuff.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:39.340
 So people might know frog hoppers as well as spittle bugs, another name for them.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:43.420
 And that's because if you ever walk out in the countryside in the middle of spring, you

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:48.140
 might see little bubbles of spit on bits of grass or bits of plants.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.460
 And that is made by these frog hoppers.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:56.500
 And basically, they eat all of this xylem stuff into their body and then they poo it

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.460
 out into little bubbles.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:04.020
 And then those kind of bubbly poos is where their children live.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.740
 It's a beautiful start in life.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.860
 Well, they're just lucky to have, you know, the Bank of Mum and Dad, these kids to rely

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:10.860
 on.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.260
 But they're sort of suffocated in there.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:16.580
 So they've got to like shove a little bit of their abdomen out to breathe in.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:17.580
 Otherwise...

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.580
 It's a snorkel.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:19.580
 Yeah, it's a snorkel basically.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.580
 Yeah, it's very weird.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:24.380
 But then if you kind of scare the little baby as you're going past, I don't know how

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.780
 you would do it, I guess.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:26.780
 Boo!

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.780
 That'll do it.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.780
 Very easily scared, literally.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:33.900
 It'll kind of retreat into its little bubbly foam nest and it'll stop breathing and then

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.860
 just hope that the threat goes away and then it'll come back out again.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:41.420
 Yeah, I think sometimes they can use them as emergency oxygen tanks.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.180
 So sometimes if you've freed them out, they'll retreat into the bubbles and they'll pierce

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:48.180
 a few bubbles so they bond together into a bigger bubble and use it as an emergency

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.180
 tank.

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.460
 But it's really clever, though.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.460
 The cookies bit.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:57.060
 It's predators because I think it tastes horrible and it also stops the larvae from

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.060
 drying out.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.060
 It's come out of their bum, hasn't it?

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.060
 It's come out of their bum.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.580
 Self-respecting predator is not going to have that.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:06.140
 And it stops them from drying out but obviously when you then become born, you don't want

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:10.380
 to be soft anymore, you don't want to be wet, so what do you do?

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.780
 Well you blow an extra large bubble inside of your bubble and so more air comes in there

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:21.020
 and then your exoskeleton can dry out and then you can come out of the spitty bubble

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.060
 and you're fine and you can be an adult.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.820
 They're such amazing creatures.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:25.820
 They really are cool.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.660
 Why am I learning about these all the time?

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:31.020
 Because they are also, when you walk around the countryside, I always thought it was sap.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:34.780
 In fact, I'm pretty sure my mum once told me it was just sap and I said why is there

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.780
 loads of these globules of saliva sitting on all the plants?

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.780
 My parents always said it was cuckoo spit, which is what it's called, but they never

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:45.540
 went on to say which is made by an insect.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:49.140
 It's possible they hadn't looked into it and they hoped you wouldn't inquire further.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:55.060
 I must just say thank you to Claire Harkin, not my sister Claire Harkin but another Claire

00:37:55.060 --> 00:38:01.140
 Harkin with the same name who is one of the experts on frog hoppers in the UK.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:07.180
 You can help her by going to her website which is spittlebugsurvey.co.uk if you see any cuckoo

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.860
 spit in the spring.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.540
 The reason is we need to know where these frog hoppers are because it's possible that

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.380
 they can start spreading disease.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:22.100
 There's a bacteria called xylella which originated in South America and when they go into the

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:27.860
 plant to get this xylem, they also can sometimes put the bacteria into the plant and it means

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.220
 that the plants can die.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:35.300
 They basically die of thirst really and if you find this bacteria in a tree then all

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:39.020
 the plants within 100 metres will need to be destroyed because it's so catching this

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.020
 thing.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:44.220
 In Italy, basically centuries old, olive groves have had to be wiped out.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.380
 What caused the massive olive wipe out?

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.380
 Some of them for sure.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.380
 Yeah, that was bad.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.740
 Oh, frog hoppers, not so great after all.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.940
 It's the bacterium's fault.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:52.940
 I guess so.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:53.940
 Yeah.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:59.780
 But yeah, so if you do find any cuckoo spit in your garden then go to spittlebugsurvey.co.uk

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.260
 and let them know where it is and then we can test it.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.020
 We should say we think the bacteria is not in the UK yet.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.020
 Yes.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.940
 But so if you find cuckoo spit in your garden, don't destroy 100 metres around everything.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:13.740
 It's just important to report the presence of it so it's known where it is.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:18.580
 I spoke to Claire Harkin and she sent me loads of the material I've got for this came from

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.580
 her.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:20.580
 Oh, wow.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.380
 I said from one Harkin to another, can you send me all of your frog hopper stuff please?

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.380
 Nice.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:27.140
 I really hope in the future all your emails get mixed up between what you're meaning

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.820
 to send to your sister and what you send to her.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.820
 I'm just terrified now because I remember the last time something horrible came to Italy

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.380
 and we said, "But it hasn't come to the UK yet."

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:45.100
 Oh, an extremely bad day.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:48.460
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show and that's my fact.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:53.140
 My fact this week is that the person credited as official consultant about the future for

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:58.700
 the movie Back to the Future 2 is the great grandson of H. G. Wells.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.700
 Very nice.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.700
 Very nice.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.700
 Author of?

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:06.540
 Author of Time Machine and War of the Worlds and so on, but obviously Time Machine, very

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.020
 relevant to the movie.

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.860
 He's not a sort of futurologist though.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:10.860
 He's not a scientist.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:14.500
 He actually works within the movie world, so he's a director.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:19.060
 So he's a director of a great childhood favourite movie of mine, An American Tale, Five All

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.060
 Goes West.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.060
 Yes.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.700
 Yeah, he did The Prince of Egypt.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:27.460
 He worked on Who Framed Roger Rabbit when he started his career, Kung Fu Panda, he worked

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:34.020
 on, he worked on, I'm sorry, Kung Fu Panda 3, but no, so he's, you know, he's a big Hollywood

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:38.620
 guy and he got brought on to Back to the Future 2 and he did some consulting about the future.

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:39.620
 What's his name?

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:40.620
 His name is Simon Wells.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.620
 Simon Wells.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.620
 Yeah.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.620
 H. G. Wells?

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:44.620
 Yeah.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.620
 What an interesting man.

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:46.820
 Oh my goodness.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:51.900
 Incredible futurist and novelist and everything, you know, he wrote so many classic works,

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:56.220
 so he wrote War of the Worlds, Time Machine as we've said, The Island of Dr. Moreau, which

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.020
 is an absolute classic.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:02.420
 The Invisible Man, I mean, almost all of it was in this really short period quite soon

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:03.420
 after he became an author.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:07.660
 He stayed in author for 40 years, he wrote dozens and dozens of novels and, you know,

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.020
 hundreds of short stories and all of this.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.700
 Yeah, he came up with so much cool stuff, he came up with Wikipedia, long time before

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.700
 it was made.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.700
 Yeah, yeah.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.020
 Well, it's just super fun, The World Brain.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.220
 Yeah, that's a book that he published.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.220
 Yeah.

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.220
 Yes, exactly.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:24.820
 In 1936 was a lecture and in 1936 he presented it as The World Brain, which I think is what

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.140
 we should rename Wikipedia.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:32.100
 And his idea was that it was an encyclopedia that was constantly changing and alive and

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:36.180
 maturing and being revised by Brainsome Around the World.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.580
 And he said, you know, everyone should be able to refer to this for their knowledge

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:42.660
 of everything, schools and colleges and anyone who needs to fact check anything.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:46.740
 And basically the only difference is that it would be delivered in the form of reels

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:50.760
 of microfilm being dropped on demand from airplanes, as opposed to...

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.760
 We might get that.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.760
 We might get that in the future.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.760
 Fingers crossed.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.760
 Fingers crossed.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.460
 He thought it would prompt world peace, didn't he?

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:57.460
 Yeah.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.660
 He thought if we all had access to the same information, its creation is a way to world

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:01.660
 peace.

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.660
 His words.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:03.660
 And he sang us in 1936.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:08.940
 I think also it depends when you got him whether you want to take his futurism because in the

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:14.600
 early 20th century he wrote Anticipations was at massive bestseller and it was what

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.800
 he thought the future was going to be like and almost kind of what he thought it should

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:22.700
 be like because he'd read a lot of Darwin and a few other things and he thought this

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.060
 is the way we should go.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:29.100
 And he thought basically half the population should enslave the other half of the population.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:33.120
 He thought that racial and social homogeneity should be enforced.

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.160
 He thought that certain groups shouldn't be allowed to have children and certain groups

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.620
 should be told that they should have children.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.740
 Arthur Conan Doyle said it was vile and villainous.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:45.540
 Any man who knows science and medicine knows this book is muddle headed.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.780
 Any man who knows humanity knows the book is horrible.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.580
 I knew James was going to do this.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:57.160
 George Orwell said it was politically naive and that it was a terrible book as well.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.340
 It was a really, really like basically a nasty piece of work.

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.500
 It really, really was.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:06.180
 But as he got older in life he definitely changed and in the 20s he started to meet

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.180
 presidents.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:15.980
 He met Theodore Roosevelt, he even met Lenin as well and he started trying to talk them

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.260
 into a much better world.

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:23.820
 And actually in the end he was probably quite influential in the Universal Declaration of

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.000
 Human Rights that the UN came up with in 1948.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.420
 So when he was really young he had all these ideas which were really quite bad.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.700
 But then as he got older he kind of mellowed and he had a much better idea.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:35.700
 I had no idea.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.580
 I'd never heard of that anticipations thing.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.580
 That's extraordinary.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:40.620
 And that would have been after he started writing novels because I think he started

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:41.620
 about 1895.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:45.420
 And Orwell was a big fan even though there were disagreements.

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:46.420
 I mean he was very mercurial.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.340
 He had four things out with basically all of his mates in the end.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:54.940
 But Orwell basically said that anyone who'd been alive and literate between 1900 and 1920

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.960
 was affected by HD Wells more than anyone else.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.520
 And what a brilliant guy he'd been but later in his life.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.940
 So it seems like he started bad from what James said.

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.960
 He got extremely good and then he sort of descended into like literary shitness a little

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:07.960
 bit again.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:13.120
 And so Orwell said in the 1930s, now he seems a bit of a shallow inadequate thinker.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.480
 But mostly he was saying, but look, I think he was a pretty good guy.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:20.360
 And he and Wells just replied to Orwell with a note saying, you shit.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:25.780
 Wow, what a great writer.

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.580
 Such a way with words.

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:32.660
 Jumping back to young HD Wells, he was actually born from interesting stock.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.740
 His dad was a professional cricketer who was sort of famous in his own right.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:41.700
 So he's a cricketer who took four wickets in four balls for Kent against Sussex, apparently

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.180
 the first time that's ever been done.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.180
 Wow.

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.180
 Yeah.

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.180
 So he was he was really cool.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.180
 That by the way is huge.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:48.180
 Yeah.

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:54.360
 I was like, that should be the headline for that has only happened 43 times in the history

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.360
 of cricket.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:59.240
 And there's been over 60,000 matches of first class cricket in history.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.440
 And it's only happened 43 times and he was the first one to do it.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:06.440
 And one of the people that he got out was a guy called Spencer Austin Lee, who was the

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.160
 great nephew of Jane Austen.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.160
 Wow.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.160
 Amazing.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:16.200
 So his father then ran a crockery shop, which sold all of this crockery and also sold sporting

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:21.380
 goods because his great uncle was Timothy Duke and cricket fans will know the Duke's

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:25.340
 ball, which is a cricket ball that English teams use.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.540
 And whenever the Aussies come over here, they always complain about the Duke's ball.

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.220
 It swings too much and all that kind of stuff.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.420
 So he was part of that kind of family.

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:36.900
 So they opened this shop, but apparently the location was very poor and they didn't do

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:37.900
 very well.

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:42.220
 Although today there is a pry mark there, which I have to say does very well indeed.

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:45.820
 So I don't know if it was the location or not.

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:50.720
 But then I read an article in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, which you all know

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.680
 and it's often quite dry, that book.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:58.040
 But they talked about Joseph Wells, who was his father, and they said that he once broke

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:02.320
 his thigh by falling from a ladder in his backyard on a Sunday morning while the rest

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.000
 of the family were at church.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.040
 Officially, he had been pruning a vine, but local gossip alleged that the church service

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:15.000
 ended earlier than usual and that he was caught helping a lady friend escape over a back wall.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 Is that amazing?

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.720
 Are you sure this wasn't a Buster Keaton film?

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.180
 Anna, you'll think about him writing to, who was it?

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.180
 Orwell.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.180
 Orwell saying you shit.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.260
 He was quite good at grudges and rivalries.

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:33.940
 So the War of the Worlds came out in I think about 1895 or six and obviously huge success.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:38.380
 It was serialized as was common then, really popular, right?

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:44.580
 It was illustrated by an artist called Warwick and Goebel and Goebel's vision of the tripods

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.920
 was these kind of ovoid pods standing on the metal beams.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.440
 And Wells hated it so much, right?

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.880
 He hated this illustration so much that when the first collected version of the book was

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.640
 released, not serialized, he added some new material.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:02.280
 And halfway through the book, he's in the middle of describing a blasted planet earth

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.080
 and you know, it's in the middle of a full war.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:08.440
 And he describes the first pamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.120
 So he's writing about a text within the fictional story.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.500
 He said, "The artists had evidently made a hasty study of one of the fighting machines

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.980
 and there his knowledge ended.

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.980
 He presented them as tilted stiff tripods without either flexibility or subtlety, with

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:22.060
 an altogether misleading monotony of effect.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.340
 The pamphlet containing these red rings had a considerable vogue and I mentioned in here

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:28.180
 simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have created."

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.180
 Wow!

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.180
 Inside the next edition.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.180
 Yeah.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:32.180
 So good.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.180
 So good.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.180
 I love it.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.180
 I think that's incredibly unprofessional.

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:39.580
 That would ruin my enjoyment of a book if suddenly the author stepped out of it to bitch

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:40.580
 about his illustration.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.580
 I love it.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.580
 No, I'm into that.

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.580
 Okay, fine.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:47.620
 Another thing he would have hated while we're on things that he hated would have been his

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.840
 great grandson's credit in the movie.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:50.840
 Why?

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.280
 Because he didn't like credits.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.160
 He didn't think credits should be part of movies.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:59.240
 So in 1936 he wrote a movie called Things to Come and one of the things he tried to eliminate

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.440
 from the movie was the credits because he thinks all movies shouldn't have them.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:06.880
 He thought instead when you were sitting watching the film little booklets should come round

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.860
 and be handed out that would have the credits of the movie in them.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:10.860
 Great idea.

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:11.860
 Yeah.

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:12.860
 Nice idea.

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:13.860
 No, it's not.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.980
 You pause the film at various moments to check your booklet and see who the casting director

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:17.980
 was.

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:18.980
 Not during the film, I guess.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.620
 But I've often wanted some explanatory notes at the end of a film.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:24.060
 You know what it's a bit like, which I think is a really good idea.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.300
 You know, if you go to the theatre to watch a comedy show, it's like having a program,

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.300
 isn't it?

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:29.300
 Yeah.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.300
 Yeah, yeah.

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.780
 I think if I was to go and watch a podcast, do a live show, maybe later this year I probably

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:33.780
 would buy the program.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:34.780
 That's interesting.

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:35.780
 Yeah.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.400
 I think it's very well written and full of interesting jokes and funny episodes.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.180
 Lots of behind the scenes photos and yeah.

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:43.840
 I wouldn't buy it.

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:48.040
 Just one other thing, just to show his influence on this movie, there was an actor in it called

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:53.300
 Ernest Thessinger and all the scenes that he was in were shot and then Wells decided,

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:54.300
 "Man, I don't like him.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.300
 Let's get a new actor."

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:59.900
 So they reshot it with a guy called Cedric Hardwick, but they didn't tell Ernest Thessinger,

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:04.740
 who showed up to the premiere, sat down and discovered he wasn't in the movie.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:05.740
 That's a good prank.

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:11.340
 He should have read the little booklet even before it started, he would have known.

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.220
 You'd have a breakdown.

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:15.720
 You'd have some kind of psychotic break.

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.420
 Yeah, you'd think you were going insane, wouldn't you?

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:18.420
 Yeah, of course.

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.420
 You'd think you'd invented a memory.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.100
 Someone is on screen with someone else's face saying your lines to an actor you'd filmed

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.100
 a scene with.

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.100
 Yeah.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.460
 Yeah, you'd end up in the asylum.

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.460
 Yeah.

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:27.460
 Gosh.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.660
 His skin smelt of honey and ball nuts.

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:30.660
 Okay.

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:31.660
 What a great fact.

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:32.660
 Lovely.

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.660
 How do we know?

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.580
 "Lover's" said so, and he had many lovers.

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.580
 Oh, good.

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.380
 We're getting to the sexy bit of AQ Wells.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:40.380
 This is the juice.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.380
 Yeah.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.460
 He was a great womanizer, and he wrote one...

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:49.020
 No, the adjective "great" in that usually isn't said the way that you said it.

00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:50.020
 Sorry.

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.860
 He was an esteemed and wonderful womanizer.

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:55.380
 There was actually a lovely "Great Lives" on Radio 4.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:59.860
 It was from 2001, and it was, I don't know if you remember Humphrey Carpenter, who was

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:00.860
 hosting it.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:01.860
 Yeah.

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:05.780
 He was hosting Faye Weldon, the author, and she must have been about 70 at the time.

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.180
 And she loves AQ Wells.

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:10.820
 And Humphrey Carpenter said, "So would you have slept with him if you'd lived at the

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:11.980
 same time?"

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.220
 And she just said, "I daresay I would."

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:15.220
 Wow.

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:18.980
 Yeah, he claimed to have an open marriage, right?

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:22.380
 But it sort of sounded like he had the open marriage and his wife had no choice but to

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:23.380
 be in an open marriage.

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:24.380
 Well, he had a couple...

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.620
 He had a few marriages, didn't he?

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:29.780
 First was to his cousin, and second was not to his cousin, I believe.

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:35.180
 And what he said was, he wanted encounters with, I'm quoting here, "free, ambitious,

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:38.380
 self-reliant women who would mate with me and go their way."

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:41.540
 Was that in his newspaper, Adam?

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:42.540
 Exactly.

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:43.540
 It sounds...

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.540
 Non-smoker preferred.

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:50.700
 Can I tell you a woman that was a bit like that, his final partner in life, who was Maura

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:51.700
 Budberg.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:57.060
 Now, she was a Russian whose first husband was murdered in the October Revolution.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:02.420
 She later married Maxim Gorky, who is like the great author, and she was almost certainly

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:05.620
 a double agent between Britain and the USSR.

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:12.380
 One MI5 informant said of her, "She can drink an amazing quantity, mostly gin."

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.340
 She sounds absolutely amazing.

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:22.580
 And her older half-sister is someone called Alexandra Ignatieva Zakreskaya, and she was

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:29.460
 the great-grandmother of a certain Nick Clegg.

00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:33.900
 That is the sexiest thing I've ever heard about Nick Clegg, which I know is not so

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:34.900
 complex.

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:39.020
 Yeah, she was super cool, although Virginia Woolf used to call her "bedbug," I think,

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.300
 nice play on her name, which was harsh.

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:42.300
 But she was like...

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.300
 She was everywhere, Virginia Woolf.

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:44.300
 I know.

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.300
 She had her things in a lot of pies.

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.300
 Comment on everyone.

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.300
 Yeah.

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.300
 She liked to comment.

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:49.300
 It was kind of her game.

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:54.180
 But yeah, old bedbug, or Moora Budbug, she dated loads of cool people.

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:55.740
 She dated Maxim Gorky.

00:51:55.740 --> 00:52:00.340
 She dated Robert Bruce Lockhart, who tried to assassinate Lenin, whilst also spying on

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.340
 him.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:02.340
 John Lenin?

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:03.340
 So she was madly...

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.340
 He gets everywhere.

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:07.340
 Had a finger in a lot of pies at John Lenin, didn't he?

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.420
 Sorry, Anna, can you break that down for me a bit?

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:13.660
 Robert Bruce Lockhart tried to assassinate Lenin while also spying on him.

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:14.660
 No, sorry.

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:18.740
 Lockhart tried to assassinate Lenin, and this woman, Budberg, was totally in love

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:22.300
 with Lockhart, but also spying on him for Russia.

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:24.820
 So she was all over the place.

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.540
 She had a gold laundering scheme in the 1920s, I think.

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:31.860
 And then there was a massive house fire that destroyed all papers and files about her.

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:32.860
 How convenient.

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:33.860
 Nothing.

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.020
 But she kept turning wells down, didn't she?

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:38.180
 I think he proposed lots of times to her.

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:39.180
 They never married.

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.180
 They were just like...

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:41.180
 Interesting.

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:42.180
 ...kind of life partners at the end.

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:46.140
 Because there's a theory that she was pretending to be in love with him certainly at the start

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:49.500
 to gain access to his large circle of friends, because if she was a Soviet double agent,

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:50.500
 that was...

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.500
 He was a very useful man to know.

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.940
 Except that he kept falling out with all of his friends, which must have really pissed

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:54.940
 her off.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:55.940
 True.

00:52:55.940 --> 00:53:01.020
 Another person Wells had an affair with was a novelist called Elizabeth von Arnim, who

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.020
 is very cool.

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:05.100
 She is a really great 20th century novelist.

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:07.060
 She's her work, so highly recommended.

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:10.900
 But he came in through a hidden entrance, apparently, to her gaff.

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:11.900
 Oh, I see.

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:12.900
 Sorry.

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:15.620
 And they went at it so hard that they broke her hotel bed twice.

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:16.620
 Oh my God.

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:17.620
 That is actually...

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.140
 That feels like too much information about issues.

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.140
 That's from his memoirs, alright?

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.140
 Is it?

00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:24.140
 Yeah.

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:25.140
 Sorry.

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.140
 It's just the way you worded it, I think.

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:30.180
 They went at it so hard.

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.500
 He wrote two autobiographies.

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.340
 One of them was clean and one of them was dirty.

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:34.540
 One of them was about his sex life.

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:35.540
 Really?

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.500
 And he said, "Hold this back until all the women involved are dead."

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.060
 Andy, can I ask?

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:44.420
 When they were at this hotel and they were at it so hard that they broke their bed, did

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:49.860
 the housekeeper then come up and fix the bed while they're presumably sat around waiting

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:54.420
 for that to happen, and then they started having sex again and broke it again?

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.180
 I don't know if it was the same night.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:00.020
 What you're questioning is, was it a bad fix of the bed or was it separate beds?

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.020
 Yeah.

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.020
 Is the housekeeper to blame?

00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:03.020
 Is what we're wondering.

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:07.340
 What was his trip advisor review afterwards?

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:10.580
 This book sounds amazing, though, this book of all his exploits.

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:13.460
 I think he was kind of criticised because in his first autobiography he didn't mention

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:14.460
 any of his lovers.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.940
 But did it come out in his lifetime?

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:16.940
 No.

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.940
 He said to his son.

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.820
 He gave it to his son to edit and publish, which is weird.

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:21.820
 Wow.

00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:27.280
 His son could have got in there with my dad wrote a porno years before, right?

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.380
 He said, "Keep this back until all the women are dead."

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:30.380
 That meant 1984.

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.880
 Ironically, for someone who knew George Orwell.

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:33.880
 Yeah.

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:34.880
 Yeah.

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.120
 And lots of it was excised.

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:42.500
 Lots of details were excised from it, probably, you know, bed stuff, things like that.

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.620
 Can I just fill the last 20 seconds with another fact?

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:45.620
 Yeah.

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:46.620
 Yeah.

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:51.540
 He basically invented Warhammer, I'm saying, hobby wargaming, the practice of hobby wargaming.

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:54.300
 He invented a thing in 1913 called Little Wars.

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.300
 Yeah.

00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:58.660
 It was so much more serious than modern tabletop wargaming because you had to have a...

00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:59.660
 Okay.

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.340
 There are a lot of people listening who are very offended by the idea that anything is

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:02.620
 more serious than that.

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:06.900
 You had miniature cannons, which you had to fire at the enemy's soldiers in this game

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:07.900
 that H.T.

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:08.900
 Wells invented.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.900
 And this is also a man who had sex with lots of people.

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:14.380
 Stop giving people false hope.

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:16.180
 I know.

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:21.180
 Okay, that's it.

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:22.180
 That is all of our facts.

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.740

 We'll be back again next week.

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.180
 We'll see you then.

00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:58.180
 Goodbye.

00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:59.180
 Bye.

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:05.180
 Bye.

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:07.760
 (upbeat music)

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.340
