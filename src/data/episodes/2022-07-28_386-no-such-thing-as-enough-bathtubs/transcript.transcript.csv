00:01:16,00:01:18,"Alright, on with the show."
00:01:18,00:01:39,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:01:39,00:01:42,to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:01:42,00:01:48,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting at a great distance from Anna Tyshinski, Andrew"
00:01:48,00:01:53,Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with
00:01:53,00:01:59,"our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:59,00:02:02,"Starting with fact number one, that is Andy."
00:02:02,00:02:07,"My fact is that for the 1921 Buster Keaton film The Boat, two prop boats were built,"
00:02:07,00:02:10,one designed to float and one designed to sink.
00:02:10,00:02:15,"Unfortunately, the one meant to float persistently sank and the one designed to sink repeatedly"
00:02:15,00:02:16,stayed afloat.
00:02:16,00:02:19,"Okay, I have a question, why didn't they just relabel them?"
00:02:19,00:02:23,"You know what, you would have been much use on this film, James, absolutely."
00:02:23,00:02:26,"It's so weird, it's such a weird story."
00:02:26,00:02:29,This is from a book called Buster Keaton's Silent Shorts.
00:02:29,00:02:34,"The film is The Boat, there was a boat in it called Damfino and the movie's technical"
00:02:34,00:02:37,director was a guy called Fred Gabburi and he built two boats and there were different
00:02:37,00:02:43,"shots to be filmed basically and yeah, the one which was designed to sink, refused to"
00:02:43,00:02:44,sink.
00:02:44,00:02:48,"It was bored into it, it had a broken stern, deliberately broken stern and 1600 pounds of"
00:02:48,00:02:53,"dead iron weight in it, it just would not sink, stayed afloat and the floater on the"
00:02:53,00:02:57,other hand just repeatedly sank and it had to be stuffed with pumps all the way through
00:02:57,00:02:58,the bottom of it to keep it afloat.
00:02:58,00:02:59,Has anyone seen The Boat?
00:02:59,00:03:01,"I haven't actually, Anna has."
00:03:01,00:03:05,"Yes, I have and it's dated, I will say it's dated."
00:03:05,00:03:06,Oh really?
00:03:06,00:03:07,Okay.
00:03:07,00:03:08,"Yeah, but it's perfectly good."
00:03:08,00:03:11,"I do think that it's probably pronounced Damfino, The Boat, although obviously you don't"
00:03:11,00:03:14,"want to hear them say it, but there is."
00:03:14,00:03:17,Did they rhyme it with Rhino halfway through the film in a note?
00:03:17,00:03:18,Is that how you?
00:03:18,00:03:22,"It's really similar, at one point when they're sinking and they're about to drown, they call"
00:03:22,00:03:28,the coast guard and they say I'm on this boat and the coast guard says what's it called
00:03:28,00:03:36,and they say Damfino and the coast guard mishears it as Damdefino and it's a hilarious exchange
00:03:36,00:03:37,of misunderstanding.
00:03:37,00:03:38,Very good.
00:03:38,00:03:41,So back then that would have killed just because misunderstandings have been plowed
00:03:41,00:03:45,"to death in comedy since, you've got to put yourself a hundred years back and go wow that's"
00:03:45,00:03:47,the first misunderstanding that's ever happened.
00:03:47,00:03:51,Do you remember that ever where I think it's for a beer?
00:03:51,00:03:55,"It's the sailors radioing into a coastal station or something and they're saying help, help"
00:03:55,00:03:59,"we're sinking, we're sinking and it's a German guy on the receiving end and he says listen"
00:03:59,00:04:02,"to this, we're sinking, we're sinking and he says yes, what are you thinking about?"
00:04:02,00:04:06,"No, that's a good joke, that's a classic."
00:04:06,00:04:10,"So he's about how you deliver it, I'm just not sure they nailed the delivery in this."
00:04:10,00:04:13,In the silent comedy.
00:04:13,00:04:19,"I watched another movie this week which was The General, which is one of his big ones."
00:04:19,00:04:24,Although at the time it got very bad reviews because it's a movie where he plays someone
00:04:24,00:04:29,in the south during the civil war and all the reviewers were from the north and they
00:04:29,00:04:34,thought that he was kind of giving some kind of skewed version of history where actually
00:04:34,00:04:38,the people who were in the south were heroes who were kind of a little bit misunderstood
00:04:38,00:04:42,and maybe they should have won the war after all and stuff like that.
00:04:42,00:04:47,"But actually Buster Keaton, he was part of this kind of weird, I would say conspiracy"
00:04:47,00:04:51,but there was almost like a cult of people believing that the south was badly done to
00:04:51,00:04:52,in the civil war.
00:04:52,00:04:57,The story sounds really cool of the general because it's based on a true civil war story
00:04:57,00:05:01,and the idea was there were Unionist spies in the south and they decided to basically
00:05:01,00:05:05,hijack a train and this happens to the film right and the idea was they hijack a southern
00:05:05,00:05:11,train and they take over it and then they speed it along towards Chattanooga which I like
00:05:11,00:05:15,even though the Chattanooga choo choo is totally unrelated to this train but by coincidence
00:05:15,00:05:18,speed it towards Chattanooga and it's like a reverse Wallace and Gromit because they're
00:05:18,00:05:22,"tearing up the rail and all the telegraph poles and stuff behind it, right?"
00:05:22,00:05:24,Every scene you look at it and you think this could be Wallace and Gromit.
00:05:24,00:05:25,"Yeah, all the way through."
00:05:25,00:05:26,It's brilliant.
00:05:26,00:05:27,It is amazing.
00:05:27,00:05:32,"There's the scene, one of Buster Keaton's most famous stunts is where there's a huge"
00:05:32,00:05:37,"sleeper lying across the track, a huge log of wood basically and he's holding a huge"
00:05:37,00:05:38,sleeper in his hands.
00:05:38,00:05:42,He's sitting on the cowcatcher at the front of the train and he has to throw a sleeper
00:05:42,00:05:47,which is like tossing the caber basically at the other sleeper to knock it off the track.
00:05:47,00:05:48,It's a real shot.
00:05:48,00:05:49,The train is actually moving.
00:05:49,00:05:50,"Yeah, it's beautiful."
00:05:50,00:05:51,And he manages it.
00:05:51,00:05:52,"Honestly, I watched it this week."
00:05:52,00:05:57,"It was made in 1927 and I didn't know it was going to happen and I just went, ""Whoa!"""
00:05:57,00:05:58,Yeah.
00:05:58,00:05:59,It's incredible.
00:05:59,00:06:03,"So that's the thing, like Buster Keaton, so he was part of that big movement of silent"
00:06:03,00:06:06,comedy that came out with Harold Lloyd and Charlie Chaplin.
00:06:06,00:06:12,"But this is a guy who, born in 1895, basically from the get-go, literally from birth, was"
00:06:12,00:06:13,into physical comedy.
00:06:13,00:06:17,Literally from bungee out of the vagina.
00:06:17,00:06:18,He basically did.
00:06:18,00:06:22,"I mean, his parents were both in Vorderville and he was on the side of the stage every"
00:06:22,00:06:26,"single night, jumping in on their act and he used to go on stage and his parents just"
00:06:26,00:06:28,used to throw him across the stage.
00:06:28,00:06:34,"So he was known as the human mop, or Mr. Black and Blue, or the little boy who can't be damaged."
00:06:34,00:06:35,People would be so concerned.
00:06:35,00:06:38,"It sounds like a misery memoir, title, ""The Little Boy Who Can't Be Damaged""."
00:06:38,00:06:39,It really does.
00:06:39,00:06:40,"But in those days, it was entertainment."
00:06:40,00:06:44,"Well, there was a lot of questions about the fact of whether or not there was abuse from"
00:06:44,00:06:45,his dad as a result of this.
00:06:45,00:06:48,"He always claimed there never was, but a lot of people said, ""Yeah, but come on, you were"
00:06:48,00:06:50,"chucking your son around the stage."""
00:06:50,00:06:52,But he went on stage at the age of one day old.
00:06:52,00:06:53,Yeah.
00:06:53,00:06:55,"Well, you both say, ""Yeah, that was a story."""
00:06:55,00:06:59,There were lots of stories that they kind of put across because they were a mother and
00:06:59,00:07:03,father and child sort of group of three.
00:07:03,00:07:08,And there are lots of amazing stories about things that happened in their early days.
00:07:08,00:07:09,I know the one that you're thinking of.
00:07:09,00:07:15,"Well, yeah, one for instance where he caught his forefinger in a clothes ringer, lost the"
00:07:15,00:07:19,"first joint, then gashed his head near the eye with a brick that boomeranged after he"
00:07:19,00:07:23,"threw it on a peach tree, and then, on the same day, he was sucked out of an upstairs"
00:07:23,00:07:28,window by a passing cyclone that carried him through the air and deposited him in the middle
00:07:28,00:07:30,of the street a few blocks away.
00:07:30,00:07:31,Yeah.
00:07:31,00:07:33,And that was supposedly the story for why he started going on stage.
00:07:33,00:07:34,It's mostly...
00:07:34,00:07:35,"And that's all one day, isn't it?"
00:07:35,00:07:36,That's all one day.
00:07:36,00:07:37,It's in it.
00:07:37,00:07:38,I've got his autobiography here.
00:07:38,00:07:41,"It's called My Wonderful World of Slapstick, and that is an entry in it."
00:07:41,00:07:45,"He said, ""I had rolled and revolved about a block from the farmhouse when a man saw me,"
00:07:45,00:07:50,"rushed out, scooped me up, and carried me to safety of the nearest storm cellar, a pretty"
00:07:50,00:07:55,"strenuous day, as anyone will admit, but superb conditioning for my career as the human mop."""
00:07:55,00:07:59,"So my question is, when you read that in someone's autobiography, do you think, ""Well, it's"
00:07:59,00:08:02,"in the autobiography, so it must be true,"" or do you think maybe the rest of the stuff"
00:08:02,00:08:04,in this autobiography isn't true?
00:08:04,00:08:05,True.
00:08:05,00:08:06,I believe it's all true.
00:08:06,00:08:09,"No, I think he was 20 months old, at that point, we should say."
00:08:09,00:08:10,"No, exactly."
00:08:10,00:08:13,"And there are stories, like he includes in this book that he was named Buster after he"
00:08:13,00:08:18,"fell down a staircase, and Harry Houdini, who was in a partnership with his family, saw"
00:08:18,00:08:24,"that and said - they named him Buster, basically, off the back of that - there's so much literature"
00:08:24,00:08:25,to say that that wasn't the case.
00:08:25,00:08:27,I don't think the dates work out to them.
00:08:27,00:08:28,"Yeah, the dates weren't working."
00:08:28,00:08:29,They were in a show with Houdini.
00:08:29,00:08:31,"Oh, they definitely were in a show with Houdini."
00:08:31,00:08:34,"And the thing is, is that he knew Houdini as he was growing up."
00:08:34,00:08:37,There's stories in this book of him hanging out with him and going to shops and stuff when
00:08:37,00:08:39,he was a bit older and when they could converse.
00:08:39,00:08:43,"So he claims it's true, but there was a newspaper report that claimed it was a guy called George"
00:08:43,00:08:48,"Purdy, and that was published in Buster's early life, and so it predates it."
00:08:48,00:08:50,And that's from his dad giving the story.
00:08:50,00:08:53,"If you've been in showbiz your whole life, then you're going to have a few little stories"
00:08:53,00:08:54,"about you, aren't you?"
00:08:54,00:08:55,Exactly.
00:08:55,00:08:58,"But what's amazing is it turns out, from reading this book, that Buster Keaton is the"
00:08:58,00:09:01,Brian Blessed of American Hollywood.
00:09:01,00:09:03,Every story is just unbelievable.
00:09:03,00:09:07,"I think that it looks like the best biography of him is by a woman called Marion Mead, who"
00:09:07,00:09:09,mainly I love it because I love her.
00:09:09,00:09:12,"She did a biography of Dorothy Parker that's amazing, but she had a lovely line, which"
00:09:12,00:09:17,"was something like he layered the stories upon the myths of his life, like layers of"
00:09:17,00:09:20,a lasagna or something.
00:09:20,00:09:23,But she did look into his life and looked into the stuff that happened at his early
00:09:23,00:09:25,"age, and it was very violent."
00:09:25,00:09:30,"So she said by age two, his brushes with death had included near incineration, suffocation,"
00:09:30,00:09:33,"fools, mutilation, and natural calamities."
00:09:33,00:09:38,"And there was one time when his parents kept him in a suitcase backstage, and at one point"
00:09:38,00:09:42,"a stagehand walked by, thought someone left that suitcase open, shot it, and they came"
00:09:42,00:09:46,out at the end of the night and found that he had almost suffocated.
00:09:46,00:09:48,But he was fine.
00:09:48,00:09:51,"And then that suitcase kind of came in useful afterwards, didn't it?"
00:09:51,00:09:55,"Because they took the handle and they put it on his back, attached it to his clothes,"
00:09:55,00:09:59,and they would hold onto the suitcase handle and throw him across the stage.
00:09:59,00:10:03,"They used to just, like the stunts, they'd throw him across the stage, they used to drop"
00:10:03,00:10:08,him into the orchestra pit when he was like two onto a bass drum.
00:10:08,00:10:12,"His dad once apparently threw him at a heckler, that was me."
00:10:12,00:10:17,"We're thinking about doing that to you on the next live tour, we all get together."
00:10:17,00:10:21,"But then the father would get arrested, according to Buster Keaton, he said they would get arrested"
00:10:21,00:10:26,"every other week, or rather his old man would get arrested, and the police would basically"
00:10:26,00:10:29,"come over and say, why are you abusing your son?"
00:10:29,00:10:33,"And then they would kind of look at Buster Keaton and see if he had all bruises and stuff,"
00:10:33,00:10:36,"and he didn't, apparently, because he could fall so well, and so they kind of let them"
00:10:36,00:10:37,off every time.
00:10:37,00:10:42,"It's weird when you read about him, because you find yourself on the side of Buster Keaton"
00:10:42,00:10:49,"against the first ever child protective agency, because, and you wonder if you're reading"
00:10:49,00:10:53,"it right, it was the Jerry Society, it was the first ever protection of children organisation"
00:10:53,00:10:57,"in the world, it had just been set up, and it was chasing down these people, it did seem"
00:10:57,00:11:02,"like we're abusing their son, but he remembers them as complete bogeymen."
00:11:02,00:11:06,"And the thing about them that's kind of interesting is they were set up by Elbridge Jerry, who"
00:11:06,00:11:12,"was the grandson of Vice President Elbridge Jerry, from where we get the word, Jerry"
00:11:12,00:11:13,Mandarin.
00:11:13,00:11:14,Really?
00:11:14,00:11:17,"Yeah, he's the guy who first fingered around with the districts."
00:11:17,00:11:21,"Oh, I was about to ask what that means, but I understand now."
00:11:21,00:11:22,How rude.
00:11:22,00:11:27,It's where they change the shape of the districts to mean that you're voters in a place where
00:11:27,00:11:29,you want them to be.
00:11:29,00:11:34,But another interesting thing about the Jerry Society is that they were started when there
00:11:34,00:11:39,"was a church worker called Etta Agnal Wheeler, and she'd noticed that a child was being mistreated,"
00:11:39,00:11:44,"and she wanted to try and get someone to help this child, but there was no one to help them."
00:11:44,00:11:48,And she realised that there was no charity that was there to look after children.
00:11:48,00:11:52,"But there was an American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and she's"
00:11:52,00:11:57,"like, how can we have a charity for cruelty to animals, but not cruelty to children?"
00:11:57,00:12:02,And so she went to the person who was in charge of the American Society for the Prevention
00:12:02,00:12:06,"of Cruelty to Animals, and said, why don't you set up a children's charity?"
00:12:06,00:12:07,And that's what they did.
00:12:07,00:12:10,"So actually, the children's charity grew from the animals charity."
00:12:10,00:12:11,Really?
00:12:11,00:12:16,I thought you were going to say they reclassified children as animals for the benefit of them.
00:12:16,00:12:19,They got some protection.
00:12:19,00:12:23,"You know the really famous, the really, really, really famous stunt is where the house falls"
00:12:23,00:12:29,"on him, around him, and there's a window which falls exactly in the right place that it lands"
00:12:29,00:12:30,around him.
00:12:30,00:12:32,So you get two inches of clearance on either side of him for that stunt.
00:12:32,00:12:33,It's just incredible.
00:12:33,00:12:35,I can't believe they made it work.
00:12:35,00:12:37,And he supposedly was nailed to the ground.
00:12:37,00:12:38,I can't quite believe that.
00:12:38,00:12:40,He was nailed to the ground.
00:12:40,00:12:42,His shoes were nailed to the ground to keep him exactly on the right mark.
00:12:42,00:12:43,"Oh, right."
00:12:43,00:12:45,So that's where the window's going to fall.
00:12:45,00:12:47,"I watched that scene yesterday, and I'm sure he walked away."
00:12:47,00:12:48,The shot changes.
00:12:48,00:12:51,"I believe the shot changes, and then he leaves."
00:12:51,00:12:54,"But maybe, I mean, possibly it doesn't, and I'm wrong."
00:12:54,00:12:55,"That's also, yeah."
00:12:55,00:12:58,"No, I think you would go with nailing to the ground, because you can't look up and"
00:12:58,00:13:00,"check, because otherwise, that ruins the scene."
00:13:00,00:13:03,"I wouldn't want to be nailed to the ground if they're going to drop the house, as in,"
00:13:03,00:13:04,you might think--
00:13:04,00:13:06,"Once it hits you, there's not much you can do about it."
00:13:06,00:13:07,"Yeah, that's true."
00:13:07,00:13:10,"Surely you'd want to be nailed to the ground rather than risk getting your boots on, and"
00:13:10,00:13:11,"then thinking, oh, good."
00:13:11,00:13:16,Did I just accidentally step to the left of it?
00:13:16,00:13:20,"So he was very, very successful for a very long time, had a lot of money, and he used"
00:13:20,00:13:22,to invest in real estate and so on.
00:13:22,00:13:27,"And one of the things he invested in was a yacht, and he was very proud of this yacht."
00:13:27,00:13:31,"And one day, he was going through troubles in his marriage."
00:13:31,00:13:33,"He went to take his yacht out, and--"
00:13:33,00:13:38,"He tried to sink it to end it all, but unfortunately, he was using the damn final."
00:13:38,00:13:44,"No, he went to try and take the yacht out, and the sort of boat master or the person"
00:13:44,00:13:46,"who sort of looks after it said, I'm sorry, you can't."
00:13:46,00:13:50,"It's only your wife who can take it out, and she's told me not to let you."
00:13:50,00:13:54,"And he suddenly discovered that their marriage had fallen apart, and they were getting basically"
00:13:54,00:13:55,a divorce.
00:13:55,00:13:56,So he lost his yacht.
00:13:56,00:14:01,"So in retaliation, he bought himself what he called the land yacht."
00:14:01,00:14:02,Do you guys read about the land yacht?
00:14:02,00:14:03,No.
00:14:03,00:14:05,"I read a one-line reference to it, but I didn't find it anymore."
00:14:05,00:14:06,"Yeah, yeah."
00:14:06,00:14:07,So I read into it.
00:14:07,00:14:10,"So he bought a land yacht, which basically he dressed as a captain, and he used to drive"
00:14:10,00:14:15,"around, and he would go to all sorts of-- like he would go to hotels, and he'd make a scene"
00:14:15,00:14:18,"of it by saying, we're going to rent out a room, but actually, we're just going to rent"
00:14:18,00:14:21,"out a car park space, and we'll stay in our land yacht."
00:14:21,00:14:24,Is it like a big sort of vehicle that looks like a yacht?
00:14:24,00:14:25,Yeah.
00:14:25,00:14:30,It's like a big bus that had been converted into what was known as a land yacht.
00:14:30,00:14:34,"It does sound awesome on one level, but on the other, he is after divorce sleeping in"
00:14:34,00:14:35,his car.
00:14:35,00:14:37,Like there are two ways of looking at the situation.
00:14:37,00:14:41,"He did say, I had as much fun with my land yacht as a man can whose purpose is to forget"
00:14:41,00:14:43,his whole private world has fallen apart.
00:14:43,00:14:44,So yeah.
00:14:44,00:14:45,It was not a good time for him.
00:14:45,00:14:48,"But then he ended up in a sanitarium, didn't he?"
00:14:48,00:14:49,Yeah.
00:14:49,00:14:50,And he was in a straitjacket.
00:14:50,00:14:53,"But unfortunately, it's very hard to keep someone in a straitjacket if they're friends"
00:14:53,00:14:57,"with Harry Houdini, so he just got him straight out."
00:14:57,00:14:58,Yeah.
00:14:58,00:14:59,Was he really in a straitjacket?
00:14:59,00:15:00,Yeah.
00:15:00,00:15:01,Yeah.
00:15:01,00:15:05,"And the Harry Houdini thing is, I think, falls into the Buster Keaton myth or no, the great"
00:15:05,00:15:06,tales.
00:15:06,00:15:10,"But he ran away, didn't he, and he got married to the nurse who was looking after him at"
00:15:10,00:15:11,the time.
00:15:11,00:15:13,While he was still married to the original life.
00:15:13,00:15:14,Yes.
00:15:14,00:15:15,Really?
00:15:15,00:15:16,Yeah.
00:15:16,00:15:17,"I mean, he was very drunk all the way through this time."
00:15:17,00:15:18,"Well, that's fair enough."
00:15:18,00:15:20,"He might have said, that was very big of me."
00:15:20,00:15:21,Yeah.
00:15:21,00:15:22,Yeah.
00:15:22,00:15:27,That'd be another one of those mishearing jokes.
00:15:27,00:15:30,That would have worked brilliantly on a silent film.
00:15:30,00:15:34,"In his later years, he mostly did TV adverts and his grandchildren didn't know him from"
00:15:34,00:15:35,any of his films.
00:15:35,00:15:38,They knew him as the singing puppet advertising Alka-Seltzer on TV.
00:15:38,00:15:39,Really?
00:15:39,00:15:40,Yeah.
00:15:40,00:15:41,Wow.
00:15:41,00:15:42,But he loved it.
00:15:42,00:15:43,He would turn up and do the adverts and then go away again.
00:15:43,00:15:46,"And other silent stars like Charlie Chaplin, I don't think, did Telly."
00:15:46,00:15:47,They thought it was beneath them.
00:15:47,00:15:48,They hated Telly.
00:15:48,00:15:49,Yeah.
00:15:49,00:15:53,"They hated Limelight, which is one of the great silent comedy scenes because it's in"
00:15:53,00:15:57,"the talkies at this point and it's two old men, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, coming"
00:15:57,00:16:00,together to do a routine on a Vorderville stage.
00:16:00,00:16:04,And it's just such a beautiful moment because Buster Keaton still wasn't making movies
00:16:04,00:16:09,"and Chaplin gave him this moment again to sort of shine, which was really, really wonderful."
00:16:09,00:16:13,"Because Chaplin, I think, also felt like all of those silent stars, they sort of became"
00:16:13,00:16:17,"much less famous very, very quickly during the talkies and then had his big renaissance."
00:16:17,00:16:20,So he did get Buster Keaton to have a slightly happy ending.
00:16:20,00:16:24,"He got an honorary Oscar in the late fifties, I think, and all of his films were re-shown"
00:16:24,00:16:27,"in the fifties and sixties and film buffs were suddenly like, ""This is genius."""
00:16:27,00:16:32,"And Chaplin as well got, I think he was put up for an honorary Oscar in seventies, in"
00:16:32,00:16:33,the early seventies.
00:16:33,00:16:34,Yeah.
00:16:34,00:16:36,"And when he was told about that, he said, ""God, does anyone even remember who I am?"""
00:16:36,00:16:37,Wow.
00:16:37,00:16:40,"Well, because he'd been exiled to Sweden or somewhere like that."
00:16:40,00:16:41,Exiled.
00:16:41,00:16:42,Yeah.
00:16:42,00:16:43,He got kicked out of America.
00:16:43,00:16:44,Chaplin had a huge period for--
00:16:44,00:16:45,What for?
00:16:45,00:16:46,Being a communist.
00:16:46,00:16:47,Yeah.
00:16:47,00:16:50,I think he left on a holiday and was told he couldn't come back.
00:16:50,00:16:53,"Wait, what's black and white and red all over?"
00:16:53,00:16:54,Charlie Chaplin.
00:16:54,00:16:55,Charlie Chaplin.
00:16:55,00:16:56,Very good.
00:16:56,00:16:57,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:57,00:16:58,I'll buy that.
00:16:58,00:16:59,That's great.
00:16:59,00:17:07,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna."
00:17:07,00:17:12,"My fact this week is that in 1993, America learned that Kazakhstan had enough uranium"
00:17:12,00:17:19,to make 24 nuclear bombs when a U.S. diplomat's car mechanic tried to sell it all to him.
00:17:19,00:17:21,Oh my God.
00:17:21,00:17:22,It's very cool.
00:17:22,00:17:25,"It's like, you know, you get your car done and they're always like, ""What do you want"
00:17:25,00:17:28,"your wheel trims doing or do you want this doing?"""
00:17:28,00:17:29,It's upselling.
00:17:29,00:17:30,Yeah.
00:17:30,00:17:31,It's major upselling.
00:17:31,00:17:32,And he bought it as well.
00:17:32,00:17:38,So this was a guy called Andy Weber and he was sort of in charge of defense and nuclear
00:17:38,00:17:43,"programs under Obama, but in the 80s he was working at the U.S. Embassy in Kazakhstan"
00:17:43,00:17:48,"and his car mechanic, who was also kind of a fixer and all-round wheeler dealer kind"
00:17:48,00:17:52,"of guy, basically said to him, ""Do you fancy some uranium?"""
00:17:52,00:17:56,"And so this guy called the U.S. government and said, ""Look, this bloke's just offered"
00:17:56,00:17:58,"me a bunch of uranium,"" and they didn't believe him."
00:17:58,00:18:02,But eventually he had a series of meetings and was set up with other people to lead him
00:18:02,00:18:08,"to the uranium and he met with this general, this Kazakh general, who just slipped him"
00:18:08,00:18:14,"a bit of paper, which said, ""U-235,"" as in the uranium that can make a nuclear bomb,"
00:18:14,00:18:17,"""90% 600 kilos."""
00:18:17,00:18:22,"So for comparison, the Hiroshima bomb used 64 kilos of 80% in rich uranium."
00:18:22,00:18:23,Okay.
00:18:23,00:18:24,It was hardcore stuff.
00:18:24,00:18:27,And so what did he do with this uranium when he bought it?
00:18:27,00:18:30,"Just kept in his back pocket, useful for any day."
00:18:30,00:18:34,"No, he told the U.S. government and they chatted to the president of Kazakhstan and they agreed"
00:18:34,00:18:38,"that the U.S. should take it in case Iran got it, basically."
00:18:38,00:18:39,Same old fears.
00:18:39,00:18:43,And so he was taken to it and shown it and it sounds incredible.
00:18:43,00:18:48,"He went to this warehouse, basically, and he found it all in buckets and the buckets"
00:18:48,00:18:50,were spaced apart.
00:18:50,00:18:53,So they were on this big table and they were spaced apart because if you have uranium too
00:18:53,00:18:57,"close together when it's that highly enriched, it does create a massive nuclear explosion."
00:18:57,00:19:00,So it literally spaced apart to avoid criticality issues.
00:19:00,00:19:01,Oh my God.
00:19:01,00:19:02,Isn't that terrifying?
00:19:02,00:19:04,What if you've got a small table?
00:19:04,00:19:05,He did specify it was a very big table.
00:19:05,00:19:06,It must have been a very big table.
00:19:06,00:19:08,So it's on the key lines in buckets.
00:19:08,00:19:09,Yeah.
00:19:09,00:19:10,"It's quite heavy, I think."
00:19:10,00:19:11,Maybe they had a few trestle tables.
00:19:11,00:19:12,That kind of thing.
00:19:12,00:19:14,"No, they probably set up some, yeah, trestles."
00:19:14,00:19:15,Yeah.
00:19:15,00:19:16,Yeah.
00:19:16,00:19:17,Pushed on together.
00:19:17,00:19:19,The extraction process was pretty amazing.
00:19:19,00:19:21,You had to carry it in a really large plane.
00:19:21,00:19:24,So it was some of the largest planes in the world that were sent over from America to
00:19:24,00:19:26,Kazakhstan to pick it up.
00:19:26,00:19:27,There was a tiny...
00:19:27,00:19:29,Is that because it has to be kept at a certain distance from itself?
00:19:29,00:19:30,I think it has to be kept at a distance.
00:19:30,00:19:31,Yeah.
00:19:31,00:19:32,And I think there are actually four planes.
00:19:32,00:19:33,It's a big table.
00:19:33,00:19:39,Now you can now turn down your in-flight tables.
00:19:39,00:19:40,Why not just take them in separate?
00:19:40,00:19:42,Like do a bunch of trips?
00:19:42,00:19:43,Why are we getting too close to each other?
00:19:43,00:19:46,"Well, obviously, more likely of problems if you take them on loads of flights."
00:19:46,00:19:48,"If you take them on one flight, hopefully nothing goes wrong."
00:19:48,00:19:49,It's like that old saying.
00:19:49,00:19:52,Put all your eggs in one basket.
00:19:52,00:19:53,Yeah.
00:19:53,00:19:54,There was four baskets.
00:19:54,00:19:59,It was all your uranium and it was four baskets/planes and then they weren't allowed to fly over
00:19:59,00:20:02,any countries because basically they're carrying this massive nuclear bomb.
00:20:02,00:20:05,I think Kazakhstan is landlocked.
00:20:05,00:20:09,"So yeah, they had to get to the nearest sea possible so they had to literally jump from"
00:20:09,00:20:15,"like Caspian Sea over hardly any land and because of that, it ended up being the longest"
00:20:15,00:20:20,flight ever that the US had done and they had to do loads of in-flight refuelling because
00:20:20,00:20:23,obviously they didn't have enough fuel to do this massively long flight so they were
00:20:23,00:20:24,taking such a roundabout route.
00:20:24,00:20:26,But for four planes?
00:20:26,00:20:27,"For four planes, yeah."
00:20:27,00:20:28,"Oh, my God."
00:20:28,00:20:29,What a nightmare.
00:20:29,00:20:30,Yeah.
00:20:30,00:20:31,Hell.
00:20:31,00:20:33,That's a nightmare situation.
00:20:33,00:20:35,"You wouldn't want to be project manager on that, obviously."
00:20:35,00:20:36,Obviously.
00:20:36,00:20:37,Yeah.
00:20:37,00:20:40,"It's not a very can-do attitude that I'm the idol, please."
00:20:40,00:20:43,"What you really need to be doing is, ""Okay, guys, this is what we're going to do now."""
00:20:43,00:20:45,"Oh, God, this sounds hard, doesn't it?"
00:20:45,00:20:46,It's all my hassle.
00:20:46,00:20:49,"That's why I'm a podcasting and not in nuclear material, that's my hassle."
00:20:49,00:20:54,Have you guys heard about the missing Nazi uranium cubes?
00:20:54,00:20:55,No.
00:20:55,00:20:56,This is amazingly cool.
00:20:56,00:20:57,That's like an Indiana Jones fly.
00:20:57,00:20:58,It genuinely is.
00:20:58,00:20:59,It's amazing.
00:20:59,00:21:01,We've been working on nuclear fission in the late 1930s.
00:21:01,00:21:04,"Lots of people were working on it at the time, obviously, because it would have been a big"
00:21:04,00:21:05,advantage.
00:21:05,00:21:10,"The German scientists made this really weird cube nuclear reactor, which was 664 cubes"
00:21:10,00:21:15,"of uranium all hanging up near each other, I guess, from the kind of reaction that Anna"
00:21:15,00:21:16,was talking about.
00:21:16,00:21:21,"It was not a proper reactor in the way that we'd understand it, but it was all uranium."
00:21:21,00:21:25,"When the Allies invaded, they took the cubes, which the German scientists as they left had"
00:21:25,00:21:28,tried to hide by burying in a field.
00:21:28,00:21:32,"The Allies had to dig up these cubes and take them away, and it was a chaotic attempt to"
00:21:32,00:21:33,get hold of them.
00:21:33,00:21:37,"In April 1945, there was a retreating military truck with the cubes on them, and a bunch"
00:21:37,00:21:43,"of boys in a town called Garmisch-Partenkirchen, they nicked a load of the cubes and discovered"
00:21:43,00:21:46,"that when you threw them, they would spark when they hit the ground."
00:21:46,00:21:48,They just were chucking around uranium.
00:21:48,00:21:49,You know what?
00:21:49,00:21:50,I've been to Garmisch-Partenkirchen.
00:21:50,00:21:51,Have you?
00:21:51,00:21:52,"Yeah, I have."
00:21:52,00:21:57,"When we went there, it was Christmas time, and there was a big marketplace, and there"
00:21:57,00:22:00,"were a load of kids, and they had these little cap things, and they kept throwing them on"
00:22:00,00:22:01,the floor genuinely.
00:22:01,00:22:02,That was happening.
00:22:02,00:22:03,No way!
00:22:03,00:22:04,"Yeah, yeah."
00:22:04,00:22:05,"That's really, that's bizarre."
00:22:05,00:22:09,You probably should have confiscated those.
00:22:09,00:22:10,But lots of them are missing now.
00:22:10,00:22:14,"I think I do suspect there is loads of this stuff still lying around, even though everyone"
00:22:14,00:22:17,"claims weapons inspectors blah, blah, blah, they've sorted it out."
00:22:17,00:22:18,"I mean, there's no way."
00:22:18,00:22:23,"Hands, blicks, his ears, they keep coming around now."
00:22:23,00:22:24,"Get back on it, blicks."
00:22:24,00:22:25,What are you doing?
00:22:25,00:22:29,"In the 90s, there were US inspectors in Russia who were basically saying Russia was full"
00:22:29,00:22:32,of these warehouses that had little bits of uranium in them.
00:22:32,00:22:38,"He said there was one warehouse stuffed with very highly enriched uranium, and it was locked"
00:22:38,00:22:43,"with a bit of rope and a wax seal, which I've opened wax seals on the occasional fashion"
00:22:43,00:22:44,letter.
00:22:44,00:22:45,And it's not difficult.
00:22:45,00:22:48,That's really raising a few more questions than it's answered.
00:22:48,00:22:51,"Who's sending you wax sealed letters, Emma?"
00:22:51,00:22:53,I exchanged letters with past.
00:22:53,00:22:56,Are you going out with a count from the 17th century or something?
00:22:56,00:22:58,We send wax seal.
00:22:58,00:22:59,Do you?
00:22:59,00:23:00,"Yeah, we do, yeah."
00:23:00,00:23:01,Alina uses wax seal a lot.
00:23:01,00:23:02,Really?
00:23:02,00:23:03,Yeah.
00:23:03,00:23:04,James and I always correspond that way.
00:23:04,00:23:05,That's why we find that when the podcast.
00:23:05,00:23:07,He has to write to me.
00:23:07,00:23:09,What does she use them for?
00:23:09,00:23:11,"Just kind of cool, like cool seal."
00:23:11,00:23:13,"Well, she just thinks it's cool and Instagram-y."
00:23:13,00:23:16,"So do you have your own, like, harken seal that goes on it?"
00:23:16,00:23:17,I can't remember.
00:23:17,00:23:19,"She has her own seal, but I don't think it's a harken seal."
00:23:19,00:23:20,Right.
00:23:20,00:23:21,Yeah.
00:23:21,00:23:22,That's very cool.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"We did it with you because it was all paper trail, wasn't it, back then, and we've lost"
00:23:25,00:23:26,the paper.
00:23:26,00:23:27,We don't know where stuff is.
00:23:27,00:23:29,50% of this podcast use wax seals.
00:23:29,00:23:31,That should be the headline fact.
00:23:31,00:23:35,"It's got to be unproportional, and it's not you."
00:23:35,00:23:37,"I mean, that's insane."
00:23:37,00:23:43,"Yeah, but like Dan says, it was kind of paper trails, and they basically relied on, they"
00:23:43,00:23:45,just had fences.
00:23:45,00:23:46,They had ropes.
00:23:46,00:23:51,"They might have had the odd wax seal, but mostly it was just intimidation that stopped"
00:23:51,00:23:52,people from stealing this stuff.
00:23:52,00:23:56,"It was basically like, with a secret police, you better not steal it because you know what"
00:23:56,00:23:57,will happen.
00:23:57,00:24:01,And that's basically their only kind of way of stopping people from stealing stuff.
00:24:01,00:24:05,"But the problem was that if you lost any uranium, you're getting so much trouble, people just"
00:24:05,00:24:06,kept it off the books.
00:24:06,00:24:11,And so that's the reason we don't really know how much of anything there was.
00:24:11,00:24:12,Interesting.
00:24:12,00:24:13,Yeah.
00:24:13,00:24:14,"Yeah, you wouldn't want to be reporting that back to Stalin, would you?"
00:24:14,00:24:15,"No, no."
00:24:15,00:24:16,Of course not.
00:24:16,00:24:17,I've lost a bomb.
00:24:17,00:24:23,"And third nuclear power, and you don't hear that much about us, do you?"
00:24:23,00:24:28,"And also in this year, the UK has raised the number of nukes that we have, which didn't"
00:24:28,00:24:35,"get in the news that much, but we've gone up from the previous cap of 225, our cap is"
00:24:35,00:24:37,now 260.
00:24:37,00:24:41,"So in a world where like ostensibly at least we're saying, let's get rid of all the nuclear"
00:24:41,00:24:45,"weapons, I think there's a lot of re-arming happening around the world at the moment."
00:24:45,00:24:46,That's very interesting.
00:24:46,00:24:49,It doesn't feel like those extra 45 are going to make all the difference in one way or the
00:24:49,00:24:50,other.
00:24:50,00:24:51,No.
00:24:51,00:24:56,"If you can think of 220 places to attack and you still want 45 more, I don't know."
00:24:56,00:24:58,"I mean, it's not your priority there."
00:24:58,00:25:02,"Like because what, America and Russia are going to have what, about 6,000 each, 10,000"
00:25:02,00:25:03,"each, something like that."
00:25:03,00:25:08,So our extra 40 might make all the difference in that war.
00:25:08,00:25:09,40 more than Australia have.
00:25:09,00:25:14,"I think, you know, it's not necessarily, you don't have to go fighting the big boys."
00:25:14,00:25:17,"Well, I think that the idea is not to fight anyone."
00:25:17,00:25:18,I think the idea is...
00:25:18,00:25:19,Fight.
00:25:19,00:25:20,Fight.
00:25:20,00:25:21,Fight.
00:25:21,00:25:22,"Please God, no."
00:25:22,00:25:23,I think most people think the idea is a deterrent.
00:25:23,00:25:24,Yeah.
00:25:24,00:25:27,"I think welcome to the very confusing Cold War philosophy of mutually assured destruction,"
00:25:27,00:25:32,"which obviously didn't make any sense at all, but yeah, we've got enough to destroy the"
00:25:32,00:25:33,universe.
00:25:33,00:25:36,But 17% of British electricity comes from nuclear sources.
00:25:36,00:25:37,17%?
00:25:37,00:25:38,"I say, well done."
00:25:38,00:25:39,You know?
00:25:39,00:25:40,The positive spin.
00:25:40,00:25:41,"Yeah, me too."
00:25:41,00:25:42,"I mean, not weapons grade though."
00:25:42,00:25:43,Not weapons grade.
00:25:43,00:25:44,I don't know.
00:25:44,00:25:50,"But Sellefield, nuclear power station, is obviously one of the places where it's generated."
00:25:50,00:25:52,And Sellefield's a really interesting place.
00:25:52,00:25:54,"They have their own magazine, which I didn't know."
00:25:54,00:25:55,How interesting.
00:25:55,00:25:59,How often is that issued?
00:25:59,00:26:03,"That's not a weekly magazine, is it?"
00:26:03,00:26:08,"It is weekly, but every week there are half as many pages as in the previous week."
00:26:08,00:26:12,"But that's not all that Sellefield has, Dan, because I sense you're being skeptical that"
00:26:12,00:26:13,that's the most interesting thing.
00:26:13,00:26:14,I'm just surprised you opened it.
00:26:14,00:26:15,What's coming next?
00:26:15,00:26:23,"Well, they've got a freezer full of dead seagulls, which is cool, because any mammal that dies"
00:26:23,00:26:25,"in Sellefield, that's our mammals."
00:26:25,00:26:26,No.
00:26:26,00:26:27,No.
00:26:27,00:26:28,All right.
00:26:28,00:26:29,That's a free seagull.
00:26:29,00:26:35,"If animals go into Sellefield and they get too close to the nuclear stuff, then they"
00:26:35,00:26:39,"are considered hazardous, radioactively hazardous."
00:26:39,00:26:42,"And so that can be a gateway to poison the wider area, because obviously you've got these"
00:26:42,00:26:45,"radioactive seagulls flying off, creating mayhem."
00:26:45,00:26:47,So they're considered putrescent nuclear waste.
00:26:47,00:26:48,This was reported in 2010.
00:26:48,00:26:50,They had 350 birds and small mammals in their freezers.
00:26:50,00:26:51,That's quite a big freezer.
00:26:51,00:26:52,"Yeah, it is."
00:26:52,00:26:54,They'll keep you going in a lockdown.
00:26:54,00:26:55,Yeah.
00:26:55,00:26:57,"It's quite a big freezer, that's what I was saying."
00:26:57,00:27:02,That's the most interesting fact about that story.
00:27:02,00:27:03,Picture the freezer.
00:27:03,00:27:06,You didn't want me to be interested in project management before.
00:27:06,00:27:12,"Yeah, what I showed interest in freezer capacity."
00:27:12,00:27:18,"Just on nuclear bombs and the hazards of them, America seems to be a bit clumsy with those"
00:27:18,00:27:19,sometime.
00:27:19,00:27:23,"We've read a few stories where you think, Jesus, you guys got lucky there, really."
00:27:23,00:27:30,"So in 1961, there was a plane, and it had a mid-flight situation where all the pilots"
00:27:30,00:27:35,"had to jump out of the plane, evacuate ejector seat out of it, and the plane actually crumbled"
00:27:35,00:27:40,"in the air, and two nuclear bombs dropped from it over North Carolina."
00:27:40,00:27:44,"And they should have gone off, basically, but they found one of the bombs hanging from"
00:27:44,00:27:50,"a parachute off a tree, and they looked at it, and basically, for this bomb to go off,"
00:27:50,00:27:52,four things needed to be activated on it.
00:27:52,00:27:54,So it's a four-tier system.
00:27:54,00:27:58,"Three of those had been activated in the process of it going down, but the fourth didn't go"
00:27:58,00:28:00,off for some reason.
00:28:00,00:28:02,"As none of them should have gone off, should they?"
00:28:02,00:28:06,"And yet, somehow, three of these extreme safety triggers had just gone off."
00:28:06,00:28:07,"Yeah, we're ready to go."
00:28:07,00:28:09,"That's why you have four, I guess."
00:28:09,00:28:11,"Oh, my God."
00:28:11,00:28:17,"But if it went off, each of them had 253 times the power that the little boy bomb had that"
00:28:17,00:28:18,was dropped over Hiroshima.
00:28:18,00:28:19,Can you imagine?
00:28:19,00:28:21,Just one thing didn't go off.
00:28:21,00:28:22,Is kind of mind-boggling.
00:28:22,00:28:29,"We had one in Britain as well in the '50s, didn't we, in Lake and Heath Air Base in Suffolk."
00:28:29,00:28:33,That was a plane crashed into a nuclear weapons storage facility.
00:28:33,00:28:37,"It was a miracle that the bombs didn't explode, but if they had, we probably would have lost"
00:28:37,00:28:38,Cambridge.
00:28:38,00:28:39,Wow.
00:28:39,00:28:40,It was an US official.
00:28:40,00:28:41,Was an Oxford boy?
00:28:41,00:28:42,A handy-looking happy?
00:28:42,00:28:45,No great loss.
00:28:45,00:28:50,One US official said it's possible that part of Eastern England would have become a desert.
00:28:50,00:28:51,Wow.
00:28:51,00:28:54,"And we only found out about this way, way later."
00:28:54,00:28:58,"But when we look back, the reports said that there was a mass panic when they realized this"
00:28:58,00:28:59,has happened.
00:28:59,00:29:04,"And when the fire services were going towards Lake and Heath, all they saw was a convoy"
00:29:04,00:29:07,of Americans just legging it out.
00:29:07,00:29:12,"Just cars full of people just panicking and people getting taxis and just saying, ""Take"
00:29:12,00:29:15,"me anywhere away from here as quickly as you can."""
00:29:15,00:29:17,Would you take on that taxi ride as a cab driver?
00:29:17,00:29:21,"I think I'd say, do you know what, you're a little bit out of my zone, actually."
00:29:21,00:29:24,I think I might put a search charge on for sure.
00:29:24,00:29:25,Gosh.
00:29:25,00:29:28,It is just unbelievable nothing ever happened.
00:29:28,00:29:29,"My God, we got lucky."
00:29:29,00:29:31,There's so many cock-ups.
00:29:31,00:29:36,"In 1983, there was this other one, which was when in the Soviet Union, there was a computer"
00:29:36,00:29:41,"malfunction, which meant that the guy on duty, Stanislav Petrov, basically received information"
00:29:41,00:29:45,that the US was launching a missile strike on the USSR at that very moment.
00:29:45,00:29:49,And he was under very strict orders that he should tell his superiors and they would launch
00:29:49,00:29:51,a retaliatory nuclear strike.
00:29:51,00:29:55,"And so he watched the siren go off and go like, ""Strike, strike, strike."""
00:29:55,00:29:58,"And it said, ""This is actually 100% reliable information we've got."
00:29:58,00:30:01,"A second siren, a third, a fourth, a fifth went off."""
00:30:01,00:30:06,"And he, for some reason, decided not to tell his superiors, thought, ""Do you know what?"
00:30:06,00:30:08,"I think that something's gone wrong here."""
00:30:08,00:30:12,And he said the only reason he thought that was because the system was too certain.
00:30:12,00:30:19,And he thought it had to pass 28 or 29 security levels to be totally sure that there was a
00:30:19,00:30:20,strike.
00:30:20,00:30:23,"And he was like, ""I'm not even sure it would do that if there was a strike."""
00:30:23,00:30:26,"So he didn't report it, 20 minutes went by, nothing happened."
00:30:26,00:30:29,"So he thought, ""Okay, it was a computer cock up."""
00:30:29,00:30:31,But he was the only civilian person who was...
00:30:31,00:30:34,That's a stressful 20 minutes.
00:30:34,00:30:44,Not even the best episode of Frazier could take your mind off that.
00:30:44,00:30:47,"Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is James."
00:30:47,00:30:53,"Okay, my fact this week is that frog hopper insects can shoot their urine away from their"
00:30:53,00:30:57,body 20 times their own body length.
00:30:57,00:31:01,"If they didn't do that, they'd probably drown in their own piss."
00:31:01,00:31:06,"Well, good for them that they developed this."
00:31:06,00:31:08,"Bad for frog hopper toilet makers, I guess."
00:31:08,00:31:09,Yeah.
00:31:09,00:31:10,"20 times is quite far, though."
00:31:10,00:31:11,So...
00:31:11,00:31:12,Quite.
00:31:12,00:31:13,"Yeah, give us more."
00:31:13,00:31:14,How would that work?
00:31:14,00:31:15,120 feet.
00:31:15,00:31:16,For us.
00:31:16,00:31:17,Yeah.
00:31:17,00:31:21,So you must be pissing a hell of a lot for it to stack up enough that it could drown
00:31:21,00:31:22,in their own body.
00:31:22,00:31:24,"Well, they all make really, really good points."
00:31:24,00:31:29,So this was an article that I read recently on iflscience.com and it was about frog hoppers
00:31:29,00:31:37,"and what they do is they drink sap from trees, but they drink xylem, whereas most insects"
00:31:37,00:31:38,drink phloem.
00:31:38,00:31:41,"So phloem's got loads of sugar, really easy to get to for some reason."
00:31:41,00:31:46,"They drink xylem, which is really hard to get to and has very little nutrition."
00:31:46,00:31:50,"Because it has so little nutrition, they have to drink tons and tons and tons and tons of"
00:31:50,00:31:51,it.
00:31:51,00:31:55,"And I don't need to tell you that if you drink lots and lots of stuff, you need to pee a lot."
00:31:55,00:32:01,So they create loads and loads of urine and really they piss pretty much all the time.
00:32:01,00:32:06,"And if they didn't get rid of it somehow, it's going to get in the throat if they had"
00:32:06,00:32:07,a throat.
00:32:07,00:32:08,Do they have a throat?
00:32:08,00:32:10,Let's not discuss whether they have throats on that.
00:32:10,00:32:17,"Anyway, so what they've come up with is a bum-mounted catapult, and what happens is they can urinate"
00:32:17,00:32:24,"out of their bodies and this catapult fires the liquid away about 10 centimetres away,"
00:32:24,00:32:28,"which might not sound that far, but they're only about 5 millimetres in length."
00:32:28,00:32:30,So cool.
00:32:30,00:32:35,"But if you're parked at that exact distance from another of these frog hoppers, it's effectively"
00:32:35,00:32:36,"a war, isn't it?"
00:32:36,00:32:39,You're sort of drowning each other in battle.
00:32:39,00:32:40,What would you do?
00:32:40,00:32:41,I guess you would.
00:32:41,00:32:42,Yeah.
00:32:42,00:32:43,"I mean, you'd move."
00:32:43,00:32:44,You'd step to the side.
00:32:44,00:32:45,Yeah.
00:32:45,00:32:46,"Yeah, solve that."
00:32:46,00:32:49,"And they're having to go to all of this effort, I think, just because they didn't pay attention"
00:32:49,00:32:53,"in GCSE biology, the xylem carries the water, the phloem carries the sugars."
00:32:53,00:32:54,You idiots.
00:32:54,00:32:55,Exactly.
00:32:55,00:32:56,Exactly.
00:32:56,00:32:57,"I mean, why are they doing it?"
00:32:57,00:33:01,"But the amount of urine that they produce, particularly when they're babies, they're"
00:33:01,00:33:07,"nymphs, they produce between 150 and 280 times their own body weight in urine every single"
00:33:07,00:33:08,day.
00:33:08,00:33:09,Every single day.
00:33:09,00:33:10,So great.
00:33:10,00:33:11,It's nuts.
00:33:11,00:33:13,"So I was talking to Ethan, one of the elves about it."
00:33:13,00:33:17,"So I weigh roughly 80 kilograms, roughly that."
00:33:17,00:33:22,"So that would be me producing 22,400 litres of urine a day."
00:33:22,00:33:23,That's what they do.
00:33:23,00:33:26,So basically 74 bathtubs worth of urine.
00:33:26,00:33:27,Wow.
00:33:27,00:33:28,Is that full baths?
00:33:28,00:33:29,Full baths.
00:33:29,00:33:30,Yeah.
00:33:30,00:33:31,Gosh.
00:33:31,00:33:32,74 bathtubs full of urine.
00:33:32,00:33:33,An arresting image.
00:33:33,00:33:34,It is.
00:33:34,00:33:35,Where do you get that many bathtubs?
00:33:35,00:33:37,You'd have to go to a showroom.
00:33:37,00:33:40,You'd have to go to John Lewis and they won't be happy about it.
00:33:40,00:33:42,I see you coming.
00:33:42,00:33:43,Oh no.
00:33:43,00:33:44,Here's Dan.
00:33:44,00:33:47,Here's Pissy Shriver.
00:33:47,00:33:49,"Oh, frog coppers."
00:33:49,00:33:50,Frog coppers are amazing.
00:33:50,00:33:51,They're amazing.
00:33:51,00:33:55,"Like Hannah said, they're stupid because they suck out xylem, which is really hard"
00:33:55,00:33:56,to suck out.
00:33:56,00:33:58,"It's not only got no nutrition, it's really hard to suck out."
00:33:58,00:34:01,"So it means they have to be really, really good at sucking."
00:34:01,00:34:02,Oh yeah.
00:34:02,00:34:05,"They've got record breaking sucking powers, haven't they?"
00:34:05,00:34:07,They are suckers in nature.
00:34:07,00:34:10,"I think 80 times more powerful than an elephant sucks, I think."
00:34:10,00:34:11,"I mean, yeah."
00:34:11,00:34:13,They're incredible jumpers as well.
00:34:13,00:34:15,Their jumping is extraordinary.
00:34:15,00:34:20,So they can get to the heights of 70 centimetres and they're only six millimetres long.
00:34:20,00:34:22,So that's a huge jump.
00:34:22,00:34:27,And what's amazing is that they use their back legs in order to do the jumping.
00:34:27,00:34:30,But the back legs are basically specialised to be used for that.
00:34:30,00:34:33,"So when they're walking around normally, they're just dragging them along, not being"
00:34:33,00:34:34,used.
00:34:34,00:34:37,"They're coming along and then as soon as they want to jump, they cock them into position"
00:34:37,00:34:40,and then just fling themselves.
00:34:40,00:34:44,They can sometimes ratchet up the strength in their back legs.
00:34:44,00:34:48,So they kind of prepare a jump in advance and then they don't jump.
00:34:48,00:34:49,Oh.
00:34:49,00:34:50,You see what I mean?
00:34:50,00:34:53,"They have a locking mechanism in their legs, which means they can keep the potential energy"
00:34:53,00:34:54,high.
00:34:54,00:34:59,So they are a coiled spring and then they just walk around on their front four legs and drag
00:34:59,00:35:05,"along these heavily loaded back legs with them so they can make a getaway, I guess."
00:35:05,00:35:09,"And then they exert massive amounts of G-force on themselves, don't they, when they go flying"
00:35:09,00:35:10,through the air.
00:35:10,00:35:14,So they exert a G-force of over 400 G.
00:35:14,00:35:15,That's what they generate when they jump up.
00:35:15,00:35:20,"And for comparison, an astronaut who goes into orbit gets G-force of about 5G."
00:35:20,00:35:22,And so that's a lot.
00:35:22,00:35:24,"If it was a human, we wouldn't survive."
00:35:24,00:35:26,"And 5G is very bad for you, isn't it?"
00:35:26,00:35:27,Sorry.
00:35:27,00:35:28,Gives you COVID?
00:35:28,00:35:34,"Yeah, yeah, I've been watching a lot of David Ike stuff."
00:35:34,00:35:39,"So people might know frog hoppers as well as spittle bugs, another name for them."
00:35:39,00:35:43,"And that's because if you ever walk out in the countryside in the middle of spring, you"
00:35:43,00:35:48,might see little bubbles of spit on bits of grass or bits of plants.
00:35:48,00:35:51,And that is made by these frog hoppers.
00:35:51,00:35:56,"And basically, they eat all of this xylem stuff into their body and then they poo it"
00:35:56,00:35:59,out into little bubbles.
00:35:59,00:36:04,And then those kind of bubbly poos is where their children live.
00:36:04,00:36:05,It's a beautiful start in life.
00:36:05,00:36:09,"Well, they're just lucky to have, you know, the Bank of Mum and Dad, these kids to rely"
00:36:09,00:36:10,on.
00:36:10,00:36:12,But they're sort of suffocated in there.
00:36:12,00:36:16,So they've got to like shove a little bit of their abdomen out to breathe in.
00:36:16,00:36:17,Otherwise...
00:36:17,00:36:18,It's a snorkel.
00:36:18,00:36:19,"Yeah, it's a snorkel basically."
00:36:19,00:36:20,"Yeah, it's very weird."
00:36:20,00:36:24,"But then if you kind of scare the little baby as you're going past, I don't know how"
00:36:24,00:36:25,"you would do it, I guess."
00:36:25,00:36:26,Boo!
00:36:26,00:36:27,That'll do it.
00:36:27,00:36:28,"Very easily scared, literally."
00:36:28,00:36:33,It'll kind of retreat into its little bubbly foam nest and it'll stop breathing and then
00:36:33,00:36:36,just hope that the threat goes away and then it'll come back out again.
00:36:36,00:36:41,"Yeah, I think sometimes they can use them as emergency oxygen tanks."
00:36:41,00:36:44,"So sometimes if you've freed them out, they'll retreat into the bubbles and they'll pierce"
00:36:44,00:36:48,a few bubbles so they bond together into a bigger bubble and use it as an emergency
00:36:48,00:36:49,tank.
00:36:49,00:36:50,"But it's really clever, though."
00:36:50,00:36:51,The cookies bit.
00:36:51,00:36:57,It's predators because I think it tastes horrible and it also stops the larvae from
00:36:57,00:36:58,drying out.
00:36:58,00:36:59,"It's come out of their bum, hasn't it?"
00:36:59,00:37:00,It's come out of their bum.
00:37:00,00:37:01,Self-respecting predator is not going to have that.
00:37:01,00:37:06,"And it stops them from drying out but obviously when you then become born, you don't want"
00:37:06,00:37:10,"to be soft anymore, you don't want to be wet, so what do you do?"
00:37:10,00:37:15,Well you blow an extra large bubble inside of your bubble and so more air comes in there
00:37:15,00:37:21,and then your exoskeleton can dry out and then you can come out of the spitty bubble
00:37:21,00:37:23,and you're fine and you can be an adult.
00:37:23,00:37:24,They're such amazing creatures.
00:37:24,00:37:25,They really are cool.
00:37:25,00:37:27,Why am I learning about these all the time?
00:37:27,00:37:31,"Because they are also, when you walk around the countryside, I always thought it was sap."
00:37:31,00:37:34,"In fact, I'm pretty sure my mum once told me it was just sap and I said why is there"
00:37:34,00:37:37,loads of these globules of saliva sitting on all the plants?
00:37:37,00:37:41,"My parents always said it was cuckoo spit, which is what it's called, but they never"
00:37:41,00:37:45,went on to say which is made by an insect.
00:37:45,00:37:49,It's possible they hadn't looked into it and they hoped you wouldn't inquire further.
00:37:49,00:37:55,"I must just say thank you to Claire Harkin, not my sister Claire Harkin but another Claire"
00:37:55,00:38:01,Harkin with the same name who is one of the experts on frog hoppers in the UK.
00:38:01,00:38:07,You can help her by going to her website which is spittlebugsurvey.co.uk if you see any cuckoo
00:38:07,00:38:08,spit in the spring.
00:38:08,00:38:13,The reason is we need to know where these frog hoppers are because it's possible that
00:38:13,00:38:15,they can start spreading disease.
00:38:15,00:38:22,There's a bacteria called xylella which originated in South America and when they go into the
00:38:22,00:38:27,"plant to get this xylem, they also can sometimes put the bacteria into the plant and it means"
00:38:27,00:38:29,that the plants can die.
00:38:29,00:38:35,They basically die of thirst really and if you find this bacteria in a tree then all
00:38:35,00:38:39,the plants within 100 metres will need to be destroyed because it's so catching this
00:38:39,00:38:40,thing.
00:38:40,00:38:44,"In Italy, basically centuries old, olive groves have had to be wiped out."
00:38:44,00:38:46,What caused the massive olive wipe out?
00:38:46,00:38:47,Some of them for sure.
00:38:47,00:38:48,"Yeah, that was bad."
00:38:48,00:38:50,"Oh, frog hoppers, not so great after all."
00:38:50,00:38:51,It's the bacterium's fault.
00:38:51,00:38:52,I guess so.
00:38:52,00:38:53,Yeah.
00:38:53,00:38:59,"But yeah, so if you do find any cuckoo spit in your garden then go to spittlebugsurvey.co.uk"
00:38:59,00:39:02,and let them know where it is and then we can test it.
00:39:02,00:39:05,We should say we think the bacteria is not in the UK yet.
00:39:05,00:39:06,Yes.
00:39:06,00:39:09,"But so if you find cuckoo spit in your garden, don't destroy 100 metres around everything."
00:39:09,00:39:13,It's just important to report the presence of it so it's known where it is.
00:39:13,00:39:18,I spoke to Claire Harkin and she sent me loads of the material I've got for this came from
00:39:18,00:39:19,her.
00:39:19,00:39:20,"Oh, wow."
00:39:20,00:39:23,"I said from one Harkin to another, can you send me all of your frog hopper stuff please?"
00:39:23,00:39:24,Nice.
00:39:24,00:39:27,I really hope in the future all your emails get mixed up between what you're meaning
00:39:27,00:39:30,to send to your sister and what you send to her.
00:39:30,00:39:34,I'm just terrified now because I remember the last time something horrible came to Italy
00:39:34,00:39:37,"and we said, ""But it hasn't come to the UK yet."""
00:39:37,00:39:45,"Oh, an extremely bad day."
00:39:45,00:39:48,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show and that's my fact."
00:39:48,00:39:53,My fact this week is that the person credited as official consultant about the future for
00:39:53,00:39:58,the movie Back to the Future 2 is the great grandson of H. G. Wells.
00:39:58,00:39:59,Very nice.
00:39:59,00:40:00,Very nice.
00:40:00,00:40:01,Author of?
00:40:01,00:40:06,"Author of Time Machine and War of the Worlds and so on, but obviously Time Machine, very"
00:40:06,00:40:08,relevant to the movie.
00:40:08,00:40:09,He's not a sort of futurologist though.
00:40:09,00:40:10,He's not a scientist.
00:40:10,00:40:14,"He actually works within the movie world, so he's a director."
00:40:14,00:40:19,"So he's a director of a great childhood favourite movie of mine, An American Tale, Five All"
00:40:19,00:40:20,Goes West.
00:40:20,00:40:21,Yes.
00:40:21,00:40:22,"Yeah, he did The Prince of Egypt."
00:40:22,00:40:27,"He worked on Who Framed Roger Rabbit when he started his career, Kung Fu Panda, he worked"
00:40:27,00:40:34,"on, he worked on, I'm sorry, Kung Fu Panda 3, but no, so he's, you know, he's a big Hollywood"
00:40:34,00:40:38,guy and he got brought on to Back to the Future 2 and he did some consulting about the future.
00:40:38,00:40:39,What's his name?
00:40:39,00:40:40,His name is Simon Wells.
00:40:40,00:40:41,Simon Wells.
00:40:41,00:40:42,Yeah.
00:40:42,00:40:43,H. G. Wells?
00:40:43,00:40:44,Yeah.
00:40:44,00:40:45,What an interesting man.
00:40:45,00:40:46,Oh my goodness.
00:40:46,00:40:51,"Incredible futurist and novelist and everything, you know, he wrote so many classic works,"
00:40:51,00:40:56,"so he wrote War of the Worlds, Time Machine as we've said, The Island of Dr. Moreau, which"
00:40:56,00:40:58,is an absolute classic.
00:40:58,00:41:02,"The Invisible Man, I mean, almost all of it was in this really short period quite soon"
00:41:02,00:41:03,after he became an author.
00:41:03,00:41:07,"He stayed in author for 40 years, he wrote dozens and dozens of novels and, you know,"
00:41:07,00:41:09,hundreds of short stories and all of this.
00:41:09,00:41:12,"Yeah, he came up with so much cool stuff, he came up with Wikipedia, long time before"
00:41:12,00:41:13,it was made.
00:41:13,00:41:14,"Yeah, yeah."
00:41:14,00:41:16,"Well, it's just super fun, The World Brain."
00:41:16,00:41:18,"Yeah, that's a book that he published."
00:41:18,00:41:19,Yeah.
00:41:19,00:41:20,"Yes, exactly."
00:41:20,00:41:24,"In 1936 was a lecture and in 1936 he presented it as The World Brain, which I think is what"
00:41:24,00:41:27,we should rename Wikipedia.
00:41:27,00:41:32,And his idea was that it was an encyclopedia that was constantly changing and alive and
00:41:32,00:41:36,maturing and being revised by Brainsome Around the World.
00:41:36,00:41:38,"And he said, you know, everyone should be able to refer to this for their knowledge"
00:41:38,00:41:42,"of everything, schools and colleges and anyone who needs to fact check anything."
00:41:42,00:41:46,And basically the only difference is that it would be delivered in the form of reels
00:41:46,00:41:50,"of microfilm being dropped on demand from airplanes, as opposed to..."
00:41:50,00:41:51,We might get that.
00:41:51,00:41:52,We might get that in the future.
00:41:52,00:41:53,Fingers crossed.
00:41:53,00:41:54,Fingers crossed.
00:41:54,00:41:56,"He thought it would prompt world peace, didn't he?"
00:41:56,00:41:57,Yeah.
00:41:57,00:42:00,"He thought if we all had access to the same information, its creation is a way to world"
00:42:00,00:42:01,peace.
00:42:01,00:42:02,His words.
00:42:02,00:42:03,And he sang us in 1936.
00:42:03,00:42:08,I think also it depends when you got him whether you want to take his futurism because in the
00:42:08,00:42:14,early 20th century he wrote Anticipations was at massive bestseller and it was what
00:42:14,00:42:17,he thought the future was going to be like and almost kind of what he thought it should
00:42:17,00:42:22,be like because he'd read a lot of Darwin and a few other things and he thought this
00:42:22,00:42:24,is the way we should go.
00:42:24,00:42:29,And he thought basically half the population should enslave the other half of the population.
00:42:29,00:42:33,He thought that racial and social homogeneity should be enforced.
00:42:33,00:42:36,He thought that certain groups shouldn't be allowed to have children and certain groups
00:42:36,00:42:38,should be told that they should have children.
00:42:38,00:42:41,Arthur Conan Doyle said it was vile and villainous.
00:42:41,00:42:45,Any man who knows science and medicine knows this book is muddle headed.
00:42:45,00:42:48,Any man who knows humanity knows the book is horrible.
00:42:48,00:42:50,I knew James was going to do this.
00:42:50,00:42:57,George Orwell said it was politically naive and that it was a terrible book as well.
00:42:57,00:43:00,"It was a really, really like basically a nasty piece of work."
00:43:00,00:43:01,"It really, really was."
00:43:01,00:43:06,But as he got older in life he definitely changed and in the 20s he started to meet
00:43:06,00:43:07,presidents.
00:43:07,00:43:15,"He met Theodore Roosevelt, he even met Lenin as well and he started trying to talk them"
00:43:15,00:43:18,into a much better world.
00:43:18,00:43:23,And actually in the end he was probably quite influential in the Universal Declaration of
00:43:23,00:43:27,Human Rights that the UN came up with in 1948.
00:43:27,00:43:31,So when he was really young he had all these ideas which were really quite bad.
00:43:31,00:43:34,But then as he got older he kind of mellowed and he had a much better idea.
00:43:34,00:43:35,I had no idea.
00:43:35,00:43:37,I'd never heard of that anticipations thing.
00:43:37,00:43:38,That's extraordinary.
00:43:38,00:43:40,And that would have been after he started writing novels because I think he started
00:43:40,00:43:41,about 1895.
00:43:41,00:43:45,And Orwell was a big fan even though there were disagreements.
00:43:45,00:43:46,I mean he was very mercurial.
00:43:46,00:43:49,He had four things out with basically all of his mates in the end.
00:43:49,00:43:54,But Orwell basically said that anyone who'd been alive and literate between 1900 and 1920
00:43:54,00:43:56,was affected by HD Wells more than anyone else.
00:43:56,00:44:00,And what a brilliant guy he'd been but later in his life.
00:44:00,00:44:02,So it seems like he started bad from what James said.
00:44:02,00:44:06,He got extremely good and then he sort of descended into like literary shitness a little
00:44:06,00:44:07,bit again.
00:44:07,00:44:13,"And so Orwell said in the 1930s, now he seems a bit of a shallow inadequate thinker."
00:44:13,00:44:16,"But mostly he was saying, but look, I think he was a pretty good guy."
00:44:16,00:44:20,"And he and Wells just replied to Orwell with a note saying, you shit."
00:44:20,00:44:25,"Wow, what a great writer."
00:44:25,00:44:27,Such a way with words.
00:44:27,00:44:32,"Jumping back to young HD Wells, he was actually born from interesting stock."
00:44:32,00:44:36,His dad was a professional cricketer who was sort of famous in his own right.
00:44:36,00:44:41,"So he's a cricketer who took four wickets in four balls for Kent against Sussex, apparently"
00:44:41,00:44:43,the first time that's ever been done.
00:44:43,00:44:44,Wow.
00:44:44,00:44:45,Yeah.
00:44:45,00:44:46,So he was he was really cool.
00:44:46,00:44:47,That by the way is huge.
00:44:47,00:44:48,Yeah.
00:44:48,00:44:54,"I was like, that should be the headline for that has only happened 43 times in the history"
00:44:54,00:44:55,of cricket.
00:44:55,00:44:59,"And there's been over 60,000 matches of first class cricket in history."
00:44:59,00:45:02,And it's only happened 43 times and he was the first one to do it.
00:45:02,00:45:06,"And one of the people that he got out was a guy called Spencer Austin Lee, who was the"
00:45:06,00:45:09,great nephew of Jane Austen.
00:45:09,00:45:10,Wow.
00:45:10,00:45:11,Amazing.
00:45:11,00:45:16,"So his father then ran a crockery shop, which sold all of this crockery and also sold sporting"
00:45:16,00:45:21,goods because his great uncle was Timothy Duke and cricket fans will know the Duke's
00:45:21,00:45:25,"ball, which is a cricket ball that English teams use."
00:45:25,00:45:28,"And whenever the Aussies come over here, they always complain about the Duke's ball."
00:45:28,00:45:30,It swings too much and all that kind of stuff.
00:45:30,00:45:32,So he was part of that kind of family.
00:45:32,00:45:36,"So they opened this shop, but apparently the location was very poor and they didn't do"
00:45:36,00:45:37,very well.
00:45:37,00:45:42,"Although today there is a pry mark there, which I have to say does very well indeed."
00:45:42,00:45:45,So I don't know if it was the location or not.
00:45:45,00:45:50,"But then I read an article in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, which you all know"
00:45:50,00:45:53,"and it's often quite dry, that book."
00:45:53,00:45:58,"But they talked about Joseph Wells, who was his father, and they said that he once broke"
00:45:58,00:46:02,his thigh by falling from a ladder in his backyard on a Sunday morning while the rest
00:46:02,00:46:04,of the family were at church.
00:46:04,00:46:09,"Officially, he had been pruning a vine, but local gossip alleged that the church service"
00:46:09,00:46:15,ended earlier than usual and that he was caught helping a lady friend escape over a back wall.
00:46:15,00:46:16,Is that amazing?
00:46:16,00:46:19,Are you sure this wasn't a Buster Keaton film?
00:46:19,00:46:23,"Anna, you'll think about him writing to, who was it?"
00:46:23,00:46:24,Orwell.
00:46:24,00:46:25,Orwell saying you shit.
00:46:25,00:46:27,He was quite good at grudges and rivalries.
00:46:27,00:46:33,So the War of the Worlds came out in I think about 1895 or six and obviously huge success.
00:46:33,00:46:38,"It was serialized as was common then, really popular, right?"
00:46:38,00:46:44,It was illustrated by an artist called Warwick and Goebel and Goebel's vision of the tripods
00:46:44,00:46:47,was these kind of ovoid pods standing on the metal beams.
00:46:47,00:46:50,"And Wells hated it so much, right?"
00:46:50,00:46:54,He hated this illustration so much that when the first collected version of the book was
00:46:54,00:46:57,"released, not serialized, he added some new material."
00:46:57,00:47:02,"And halfway through the book, he's in the middle of describing a blasted planet earth"
00:47:02,00:47:04,"and you know, it's in the middle of a full war."
00:47:04,00:47:08,And he describes the first pamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war.
00:47:08,00:47:11,So he's writing about a text within the fictional story.
00:47:11,00:47:14,"He said, ""The artists had evidently made a hasty study of one of the fighting machines"
00:47:14,00:47:15,and there his knowledge ended.
00:47:15,00:47:19,"He presented them as tilted stiff tripods without either flexibility or subtlety, with"
00:47:19,00:47:22,an altogether misleading monotony of effect.
00:47:22,00:47:25,The pamphlet containing these red rings had a considerable vogue and I mentioned in here
00:47:25,00:47:28,"simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have created."""
00:47:28,00:47:29,Wow!
00:47:29,00:47:30,Inside the next edition.
00:47:30,00:47:31,Yeah.
00:47:31,00:47:32,So good.
00:47:32,00:47:33,So good.
00:47:33,00:47:34,I love it.
00:47:34,00:47:35,I think that's incredibly unprofessional.
00:47:35,00:47:39,That would ruin my enjoyment of a book if suddenly the author stepped out of it to bitch
00:47:39,00:47:40,about his illustration.
00:47:40,00:47:41,I love it.
00:47:41,00:47:42,"No, I'm into that."
00:47:42,00:47:43,"Okay, fine."
00:47:43,00:47:47,Another thing he would have hated while we're on things that he hated would have been his
00:47:47,00:47:49,great grandson's credit in the movie.
00:47:49,00:47:50,Why?
00:47:50,00:47:52,Because he didn't like credits.
00:47:52,00:47:54,He didn't think credits should be part of movies.
00:47:54,00:47:59,So in 1936 he wrote a movie called Things to Come and one of the things he tried to eliminate
00:47:59,00:48:02,from the movie was the credits because he thinks all movies shouldn't have them.
00:48:02,00:48:06,He thought instead when you were sitting watching the film little booklets should come round
00:48:06,00:48:09,and be handed out that would have the credits of the movie in them.
00:48:09,00:48:10,Great idea.
00:48:10,00:48:11,Yeah.
00:48:11,00:48:12,Nice idea.
00:48:12,00:48:13,"No, it's not."
00:48:13,00:48:16,You pause the film at various moments to check your booklet and see who the casting director
00:48:16,00:48:17,was.
00:48:17,00:48:18,"Not during the film, I guess."
00:48:18,00:48:21,But I've often wanted some explanatory notes at the end of a film.
00:48:21,00:48:24,"You know what it's a bit like, which I think is a really good idea."
00:48:24,00:48:27,"You know, if you go to the theatre to watch a comedy show, it's like having a program,"
00:48:27,00:48:28,isn't it?
00:48:28,00:48:29,Yeah.
00:48:29,00:48:30,"Yeah, yeah."
00:48:30,00:48:32,"I think if I was to go and watch a podcast, do a live show, maybe later this year I probably"
00:48:32,00:48:33,would buy the program.
00:48:33,00:48:34,That's interesting.
00:48:34,00:48:35,Yeah.
00:48:35,00:48:38,I think it's very well written and full of interesting jokes and funny episodes.
00:48:38,00:48:41,Lots of behind the scenes photos and yeah.
00:48:41,00:48:43,I wouldn't buy it.
00:48:43,00:48:48,"Just one other thing, just to show his influence on this movie, there was an actor in it called"
00:48:48,00:48:53,"Ernest Thessinger and all the scenes that he was in were shot and then Wells decided,"
00:48:53,00:48:54,"""Man, I don't like him."
00:48:54,00:48:55,"Let's get a new actor."""
00:48:55,00:48:59,"So they reshot it with a guy called Cedric Hardwick, but they didn't tell Ernest Thessinger,"
00:48:59,00:49:04,"who showed up to the premiere, sat down and discovered he wasn't in the movie."
00:49:04,00:49:05,That's a good prank.
00:49:05,00:49:11,"He should have read the little booklet even before it started, he would have known."
00:49:11,00:49:14,You'd have a breakdown.
00:49:14,00:49:15,You'd have some kind of psychotic break.
00:49:15,00:49:17,"Yeah, you'd think you were going insane, wouldn't you?"
00:49:17,00:49:18,"Yeah, of course."
00:49:18,00:49:19,You'd think you'd invented a memory.
00:49:19,00:49:22,Someone is on screen with someone else's face saying your lines to an actor you'd filmed
00:49:22,00:49:23,a scene with.
00:49:23,00:49:24,Yeah.
00:49:24,00:49:25,"Yeah, you'd end up in the asylum."
00:49:25,00:49:26,Yeah.
00:49:26,00:49:27,Gosh.
00:49:27,00:49:29,His skin smelt of honey and ball nuts.
00:49:29,00:49:30,Okay.
00:49:30,00:49:31,What a great fact.
00:49:31,00:49:32,Lovely.
00:49:32,00:49:33,How do we know?
00:49:33,00:49:36,"""Lover's"" said so, and he had many lovers."
00:49:36,00:49:37,"Oh, good."
00:49:37,00:49:39,We're getting to the sexy bit of AQ Wells.
00:49:39,00:49:40,This is the juice.
00:49:40,00:49:41,Yeah.
00:49:41,00:49:44,"He was a great womanizer, and he wrote one..."
00:49:44,00:49:49,"No, the adjective ""great"" in that usually isn't said the way that you said it."
00:49:49,00:49:50,Sorry.
00:49:50,00:49:51,He was an esteemed and wonderful womanizer.
00:49:51,00:49:55,"There was actually a lovely ""Great Lives"" on Radio 4."
00:49:55,00:49:59,"It was from 2001, and it was, I don't know if you remember Humphrey Carpenter, who was"
00:49:59,00:50:00,hosting it.
00:50:00,00:50:01,Yeah.
00:50:01,00:50:05,"He was hosting Faye Weldon, the author, and she must have been about 70 at the time."
00:50:05,00:50:08,And she loves AQ Wells.
00:50:08,00:50:10,"And Humphrey Carpenter said, ""So would you have slept with him if you'd lived at the"
00:50:10,00:50:11,"same time?"""
00:50:11,00:50:14,"And she just said, ""I daresay I would."""
00:50:14,00:50:15,Wow.
00:50:15,00:50:18,"Yeah, he claimed to have an open marriage, right?"
00:50:18,00:50:22,But it sort of sounded like he had the open marriage and his wife had no choice but to
00:50:22,00:50:23,be in an open marriage.
00:50:23,00:50:24,"Well, he had a couple..."
00:50:24,00:50:25,"He had a few marriages, didn't he?"
00:50:25,00:50:29,"First was to his cousin, and second was not to his cousin, I believe."
00:50:29,00:50:35,"And what he said was, he wanted encounters with, I'm quoting here, ""free, ambitious,"
00:50:35,00:50:38,"self-reliant women who would mate with me and go their way."""
00:50:38,00:50:41,"Was that in his newspaper, Adam?"
00:50:41,00:50:42,Exactly.
00:50:42,00:50:43,It sounds...
00:50:43,00:50:44,Non-smoker preferred.
00:50:44,00:50:50,"Can I tell you a woman that was a bit like that, his final partner in life, who was Maura"
00:50:50,00:50:51,Budberg.
00:50:51,00:50:57,"Now, she was a Russian whose first husband was murdered in the October Revolution."
00:50:57,00:51:02,"She later married Maxim Gorky, who is like the great author, and she was almost certainly"
00:51:02,00:51:05,a double agent between Britain and the USSR.
00:51:05,00:51:12,"One MI5 informant said of her, ""She can drink an amazing quantity, mostly gin."""
00:51:12,00:51:14,She sounds absolutely amazing.
00:51:14,00:51:22,"And her older half-sister is someone called Alexandra Ignatieva Zakreskaya, and she was"
00:51:22,00:51:29,the great-grandmother of a certain Nick Clegg.
00:51:29,00:51:33,"That is the sexiest thing I've ever heard about Nick Clegg, which I know is not so"
00:51:33,00:51:34,complex.
00:51:34,00:51:39,"Yeah, she was super cool, although Virginia Woolf used to call her ""bedbug,"" I think,"
00:51:39,00:51:41,"nice play on her name, which was harsh."
00:51:41,00:51:42,But she was like...
00:51:42,00:51:43,"She was everywhere, Virginia Woolf."
00:51:43,00:51:44,I know.
00:51:44,00:51:45,She had her things in a lot of pies.
00:51:45,00:51:46,Comment on everyone.
00:51:46,00:51:47,Yeah.
00:51:47,00:51:48,She liked to comment.
00:51:48,00:51:49,It was kind of her game.
00:51:49,00:51:54,"But yeah, old bedbug, or Moora Budbug, she dated loads of cool people."
00:51:54,00:51:55,She dated Maxim Gorky.
00:51:55,00:52:00,"She dated Robert Bruce Lockhart, who tried to assassinate Lenin, whilst also spying on"
00:52:00,00:52:01,him.
00:52:01,00:52:02,John Lenin?
00:52:02,00:52:03,So she was madly...
00:52:03,00:52:04,He gets everywhere.
00:52:04,00:52:07,"Had a finger in a lot of pies at John Lenin, didn't he?"
00:52:07,00:52:09,"Sorry, Anna, can you break that down for me a bit?"
00:52:09,00:52:13,Robert Bruce Lockhart tried to assassinate Lenin while also spying on him.
00:52:13,00:52:14,"No, sorry."
00:52:14,00:52:18,"Lockhart tried to assassinate Lenin, and this woman, Budberg, was totally in love"
00:52:18,00:52:22,"with Lockhart, but also spying on him for Russia."
00:52:22,00:52:24,So she was all over the place.
00:52:24,00:52:28,"She had a gold laundering scheme in the 1920s, I think."
00:52:28,00:52:31,And then there was a massive house fire that destroyed all papers and files about her.
00:52:31,00:52:32,How convenient.
00:52:32,00:52:33,Nothing.
00:52:33,00:52:36,"But she kept turning wells down, didn't she?"
00:52:36,00:52:38,I think he proposed lots of times to her.
00:52:38,00:52:39,They never married.
00:52:39,00:52:40,They were just like...
00:52:40,00:52:41,Interesting.
00:52:41,00:52:42,...kind of life partners at the end.
00:52:42,00:52:46,Because there's a theory that she was pretending to be in love with him certainly at the start
00:52:46,00:52:49,"to gain access to his large circle of friends, because if she was a Soviet double agent,"
00:52:49,00:52:50,that was...
00:52:50,00:52:51,He was a very useful man to know.
00:52:51,00:52:53,"Except that he kept falling out with all of his friends, which must have really pissed"
00:52:53,00:52:54,her off.
00:52:54,00:52:55,True.
00:52:55,00:53:01,"Another person Wells had an affair with was a novelist called Elizabeth von Arnim, who"
00:53:01,00:53:02,is very cool.
00:53:02,00:53:05,She is a really great 20th century novelist.
00:53:05,00:53:07,"She's her work, so highly recommended."
00:53:07,00:53:10,"But he came in through a hidden entrance, apparently, to her gaff."
00:53:10,00:53:11,"Oh, I see."
00:53:11,00:53:12,Sorry.
00:53:12,00:53:15,And they went at it so hard that they broke her hotel bed twice.
00:53:15,00:53:16,Oh my God.
00:53:16,00:53:17,That is actually...
00:53:17,00:53:20,That feels like too much information about issues.
00:53:20,00:53:22,"That's from his memoirs, alright?"
00:53:22,00:53:23,Is it?
00:53:23,00:53:24,Yeah.
00:53:24,00:53:25,Sorry.
00:53:25,00:53:26,"It's just the way you worded it, I think."
00:53:26,00:53:30,They went at it so hard.
00:53:30,00:53:31,He wrote two autobiographies.
00:53:31,00:53:33,One of them was clean and one of them was dirty.
00:53:33,00:53:34,One of them was about his sex life.
00:53:34,00:53:35,Really?
00:53:35,00:53:37,"And he said, ""Hold this back until all the women involved are dead."""
00:53:37,00:53:39,"Andy, can I ask?"
00:53:39,00:53:44,"When they were at this hotel and they were at it so hard that they broke their bed, did"
00:53:44,00:53:49,the housekeeper then come up and fix the bed while they're presumably sat around waiting
00:53:49,00:53:54,"for that to happen, and then they started having sex again and broke it again?"
00:53:54,00:53:56,I don't know if it was the same night.
00:53:56,00:54:00,"What you're questioning is, was it a bad fix of the bed or was it separate beds?"
00:54:00,00:54:01,Yeah.
00:54:01,00:54:02,Is the housekeeper to blame?
00:54:02,00:54:03,Is what we're wondering.
00:54:03,00:54:07,What was his trip advisor review afterwards?
00:54:07,00:54:10,"This book sounds amazing, though, this book of all his exploits."
00:54:10,00:54:13,I think he was kind of criticised because in his first autobiography he didn't mention
00:54:13,00:54:14,any of his lovers.
00:54:14,00:54:15,But did it come out in his lifetime?
00:54:15,00:54:16,No.
00:54:16,00:54:17,He said to his son.
00:54:17,00:54:20,"He gave it to his son to edit and publish, which is weird."
00:54:20,00:54:21,Wow.
00:54:21,00:54:27,"His son could have got in there with my dad wrote a porno years before, right?"
00:54:27,00:54:29,"He said, ""Keep this back until all the women are dead."""
00:54:29,00:54:30,That meant 1984.
00:54:30,00:54:32,"Ironically, for someone who knew George Orwell."
00:54:32,00:54:33,Yeah.
00:54:33,00:54:34,Yeah.
00:54:34,00:54:36,And lots of it was excised.
00:54:36,00:54:42,"Lots of details were excised from it, probably, you know, bed stuff, things like that."
00:54:42,00:54:44,Can I just fill the last 20 seconds with another fact?
00:54:44,00:54:45,Yeah.
00:54:45,00:54:46,Yeah.
00:54:46,00:54:51,"He basically invented Warhammer, I'm saying, hobby wargaming, the practice of hobby wargaming."
00:54:51,00:54:54,He invented a thing in 1913 called Little Wars.
00:54:54,00:54:55,Yeah.
00:54:55,00:54:58,It was so much more serious than modern tabletop wargaming because you had to have a...
00:54:58,00:54:59,Okay.
00:54:59,00:55:01,There are a lot of people listening who are very offended by the idea that anything is
00:55:01,00:55:02,more serious than that.
00:55:02,00:55:06,"You had miniature cannons, which you had to fire at the enemy's soldiers in this game"
00:55:06,00:55:07,that H.T.
00:55:07,00:55:08,Wells invented.
00:55:08,00:55:10,And this is also a man who had sex with lots of people.
00:55:10,00:55:14,Stop giving people false hope.
